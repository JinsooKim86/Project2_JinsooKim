A330,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Zurich to New York JFK,5.0," |  I was very impressed with the quality of service that the airline provided from Zurich to JFK. The aircraft is new and impeccably clean. We were served a snack and a drink after departure A few hours later with a choice of hot lunches and the portion and quality of food was good. The quality of food is very healthy. Every hour we were offered drinks. The WC was cleaned every hour and herbal soap, hand-cream and facial spray of essential oils were in the bathroom. The seats were very comfortable and especially the headrest. Pillow and blanket of high quality. Later, two hours before landing at JFK, we were offered hot towels, and served a hot sandwich and choices of drinks and Movenpick ice cream and Swiss chocolate. Great service and great people, and I would say above other European airlines that I have flown. The A330 provided a great ride back to NYC. I flew Lufthansa 747 going from JFK to AMS via Frankfurt and on the leg back, SAS to Zurich and Swiss from Zurich to NYC. They are all partners. But I wasn't happy that I could not check in online and received boarding passes for all the segments. I was lucky to have gotten a good seat once I checked in at Oslo SAS counter for the segment, Zurich to NYC. Also, my experience at the Zurich airport was above many in the region. I will do it again if I have to.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

The aircraft was a brand new A220-300 (CS-300) and therefore in top condition. The departure and arrival were slightly delayed. The machine was in a clean condition and the flight attendants friendly. The catering and the drinks according to the circumstances and the small piece of chocolate always a pleasure. Overall, a good experience except for the seats, which were a bit too hard and at takeoff and landing and the aircraft in the rear area are much too loud mechanical sounds from, which are very disturbing.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 777-300ER,Business Class,2.0,July 2018,3.0,3.0,3.0,no,Bangkok to Zurich,1.0, |  Highly disappointed with my Swiss business class flight from Bangkok to Zurich. Their business class seats are probably the worst I have experienced as some of the seats offer zero privacy and personal space. The Swiss business cabin is weirdly designed with basically three main types of seats: Window/Aisle pair seats which are simply horrible as: - the person seating near the window has no access to the aisle - the seats are very narrow - zero personal space - zero privacy The personal space aspect simply shocked me. There was just a middle console between the aisles and window seat and there was no space to set your bag or shoes or anything actually. This was shocking and I asked the flight attendants to help me understand if I was missing something and she apologized that some seats indeed have no real space and I should just use the overhead bins. The seats offered zero privacy and we also very narrow due to the outdated design although this was a relatively newly delivered aircraft. I would say that from a seat perspective it was terrible. The middle pair seats are better from a personal storage space although they are weird: one is very narrow from a space perspective and offers zero privacy yet a bit more storage space compare to the window/aisle pair and the other middle seat one offered much more space and privacy. Then there are the “throne” seats which come only one in a row which seem great but they cost an extra Euros. So overall from a seat perspective I found it horrible seating in the right side of the plane. Internet was the most expensive I have ever seen and sold by the MB (they count download AND upload) The least expensive option is 20MB for $ 10USD which they suggest is best “if you just intend to shortly check your emails or visit a couple of websites. 40 USD will get you a 120 MB package which on a flight of 11 hours is not enough to actively surf the net. I did not enjoy my flight and will try to avoid Swiss .,Business,2.0,1.0

Once something goes wrong the airline will not help you. They lost my luggage and began pointing fingers at the airport I arrived in and United because my flight got rebooked. However, it is stated on the Swiss website that they claim responsibility for your luggage once you check it. I have been in Italy for 6 days and have no clothes!",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Singapore to Paris,5.0," |  Singapore to Paris via Zurich returning from Paris.  The long-haul flights from Singapore and Zurich a joy - the mains were excellent and side dishes were good, and they've got more bread for you if you want. Every 1.5 hours or so the cabin crew will replenish cups with water or other drinks. Before landing passengers can take as many milk chocolates as they want from their chocolate basket, or head to the snack bar at the galleys which have fruits and snacks for everyone to munch on. Cabin crew on their long-haul flights were warm and friendly, and like some Asian airlines they distribute hot towels. Short-haul European flights were also good with quick but friendly cabin service with food and chocolate. Transiting in Zurich was a breeze - the airport was well designed and very easy to get around. Inflight entertainment on the long-haul flights was good but I was slightly disappointed that they didn't have many music choices. Nevertheless top marks for SWISS, glad I chose them for my trip to Europe this year and would not hesitate to fly them again in future.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Brand new aircraft (CS1), super clean with good toilet amenities for a one-hour flight. Cabin crew quite nice and friendly. Business class seat layout is a joke though as there is no separator at all between business and economy, not even a basic curtain. What is more, seat layout is 3-3 with the middle seat blocked. Legroom is good. Food was very basic and very limited in quantity. Champagne available but overall the selection of beverages is too limited. Not worth the money. Next time I will stick to economy.",Business,2.0,nan
Bombardier CS 100/300,Business Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,3.0,nan,yes,Vienna to Zurich,4.0," |  Vienna to Zurich. I upgraded from Economy to Business class, were I was just entitled to use the business class facilities on board and not on the ground, which wasn´t a problem. We were flying the little, but new Bombardier CS-100/300. The cleanliness of the aircraft was impressive, as well the boarding was completed very quickly. The pre-departure facilities were a bit disappointing as Swiss is just offering a face towel with a bottle of water, no good sparkling wine or Orange juice, but it wasn´t the big deal, as they provided pillows and blankets as well. A few minutes after taking off the Maitre of Cabin started the service. The flight time was only 1h and 20 minutes. They served a small lunch, more on a cold canapes meal which was with fresh salmon with avocado and a quinoa-bulgur salad, with some swiss cheese. The food quality was good, but the dessert made the meal, a berry-apple mousse with a vanilla foam on top. After it as the hostess saw I was still hungry she came to me with some croissant, still hot and offered me a hot coffee, what a nice touch!  The upgrade was definitely worth it.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A320-200,Business Class,2.0,July 2018,2.0,1.0,nan,yes,Zurich to Venice,3.0," |  Zurich to Venice. This 1h short flight was supposed to be on the new Bombardier CS-100/300, but it was re-scheduled on an Airbus A320-100/200, which is not a big deal as I love both aircrafts. I was coming to the gate from a connecting flight, and they de boarded me on the complete other part of the airport, which became a little struggle not just for my connecting flight but also for many other guests, but they provided a private bus with business class. As I arrived at the guest which was half way boarded there was no separate line, neither a separate business class bus, but the ground staff allowed me to skip the line, which seemed to be a dedicated touch, but it was one my benefits. As I boarded the plane, once again there was not any type of difference between Business class or economy class passengers. The layout is the same of the economy class just with the middle seat blocked and some cm more for your legroom. As usual we were provided with some water and a refreshing towel. After all the hurry to catch my connecting flight we ended up staying on the ground half an hour more than expected, and here were the cabin staff should provide a little touch with is making more pleasant your flight, the ridiculous touch from swiss was offering to everyone a little chocolate praline, with no difference between economy or business class passengers. The service in the sky was really quick as the flight is a short one. The food was terrible, as they served three canapes, two salty, which did not have any type of flavor just intense color and smell and the same dessert in my previous flight, I asked for a coffee and the hostess brought a coffee which she before serving it to me said that It wasn´t a good quality therefore she would have changed for me if I wanted, and now my question is turning up asking me than why should you serve something which you already know that will be not matching the expectation of the guest? As I started to be tired I asked for a pillow which I brought out from the aircraft, once landed as I still had a long trip in front of me, and the maître of cabin apparently saw me and ran after me saying in a not so polite way that I was not allowed to take it out, but I mean it´s ok I can also understand this. As I upgraded to the business class I was entitled to have the priority tag for my suitcase, which is kind of an essential element if you have further connections, and the of course mine arrived after 15 min of the normal delivery of all other suitcases, this was a really big breakdown! In general, the SWISS service is not bad, and I cannot say I did not enjoy my upgrade, but sometimes it´s not required a big effort, it stays all in the little details.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

It is always a pleasure flying Swiss and I found out the experience of business class is good even on short haul. Lounge access is of course provided and the seat configuration in 3-3 seat planes like the A320 is great. As opposed to other airlines, Swiss does not put a tray between seats A and C blocking seat B - thus you can sit next to your spouse or friend. Definitely recommended.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A340,Economy Class,5.0,August 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,SIN to ZRH,4.0,"Recently flew ZRH-SIN and SIN-ZRH on SWISS's A340s. These aircraft are solid machines, nothing of particular note. Seats were comfortable enough, seatpitch ok, IFE was of good standard (not up there with SQ's latest offering, but also a lot more stable), food was ok, overall nothing extraordinary but also nothing to complain about. What made these flight stand out from the connecting flights on SQ was the crew. Whereas SQ's delivered a perfect product, LX's crew may not have been quite so efficient - but they added a personal touch even in the economy cabin. I felt like a guest, someone to be welcomed on board, a person in the same right as the crew. I was not the customer to be satisfied. I was a person to interact with. Yes, the grooming of SQ's FAs was spotless. But LX's FAs were certainly a lot more likeable. When I said goodbye to one particularly nice member of cabin crew she obviously meant it when she said she'd like to welcome me again soon.

Return leg on A320 full flight, aircraft not at the gate at boarding time but nothing announced on screens, then 40 min delay announced, which eventually became 60 min. Full occupancy which gave a somewhat claustrophobic feeling, packed aircraft, luckily only a short flight. For short-haul I'd say sister companies Lufthansa and Brussels Airlines do a better job than Swiss.

A330-300,Economy Class,5.0,July 2015,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Montreal (YUL) to Zurich (ZRH),5.0,"The flight originated in Montreal P.E. Trudeau Airport and Swiss staff there were kind and willing to help. Boarding went smoothly and the plane departed on time. The cabin was very clean, elegant and felt comfortable. The seats had very decent legroom, had tolerable width and a pretty good IFE system. There was a good selection of movies, shows and music (although the user-interface was very bland). Seat recline was also decent and the seats themselves were very comfortable when I was seated properly. One downside was that there were no power outlets on any of the seats, only a USB port which was not working. Shortly after takeoff, we were served a snack (pretzels) and a drink of our choice, with a main meal followed shortly after and breakfast before arrival at Zurich. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful and spoke in various other languages aside from English, German and French. The flight was smooth, relaxing and quiet. Swiss International Airlines has also done a wonderful job in their product branding and the attention to detail was exquisite, with things such as full metal cutlery and the complementary Swiss chocolate that's given out before arrival.

Aircraft did not catch up time resulting in flight landing into ZRH late. Swiss is known for booking passengers onto flights with short connections. Unfortunately no one is qualified to handled the situation in a customer satisfying manner if the incoming flight delays and they misconnect. Even if the passenger takes the initiative to run (which should not be the case) to the gate 20 minutes before departure, they offload the passenger. Very devious as they assume that passengers may not make it not thinking that some are ambitious enough to run and sell the seats off to passengers from other airlines on standby. Denied boarding? but funny the seats were taken by other passengers - does not take a kindergarten kid to figure out what happened to the seats. Explanation, we cannot take you without your bags for security reasons. Who delayed the bags - not the passenger. Well when they do not load the bag, does not the bag go on another flight without the passenger? Best is a complaint written to Swiss customer service and they respond back saying ""We are not responsible for the delay."" Did they honestly think people were ignorant. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

VIE-ZRH delayed in 10 minutes increments at departure resulting finally in 50 minutes arrival delay in ZRH. ZRH-CPH on time. ZRH is a fast and easy airport without extra security checks for intra EU-transfers, so tight connection not a problem despite late arrival. Only travelling with hand luggage, so not sure if checked luggage would have made it as well. LX uses Recaro slim line seats, which are not the most comfortable option, but ok for the short flights and legroom was fine. Both planes were packed. In flight service on both legs was good for Economy. FA’s on the VIE-ZRH leg professional and courteous, but not really attentive; much better and friendlier crew on the ZRH-CPH leg. Food served was a croissant (good) on the first leg and a sandwich (just edible) on the second leg. One round of drinks per leg including beer and wine. Web check-in (through LH site) worked fine. LX used OS lounges in VIE. Senator Schengen lounge just very average and not great for being OS’s flagship lounge.

If you are a Star Alliance status member, you are assigned a ground hostess to guide you through security and immigration to the lounge, which at this time of the day (11:00 a.m.) is empty. Half an hour prior departure, you are escorted to the gate and to the aircraft. It turned out that I was the only Swiss in the very front of the cabin, and the welcome by cabin staff was warm. I got an appetizer, champagne, newspaper and pyjamas after boarding. Departure was on time, and towards cruising altitude, lunch was served. Nice choice of starters, and my favourite Swiss dish (which was not on the menu), was also available. With a glass of La Chapelle de la Mission-Haut Brion and cheese at the end, the lunch was perfect. I tried to have a nap, which is difficult early afternoon.  A very charming flight attendant, as this part of the cabin was only half full, she had time for some conversation. About an hour prior landing, small diner options were offered. When disembarking the aircraft in Zurich, First class are treated the same as Economy. There is no escort, you use the train to the main terminal and you queue up at immigration. It's just the luggage labelled HON which they separate upon delivery. All in all a perfect flight, except for the arrival procedures in Zurich.

The flight started well at check-in when we were invited to the new EVA Air lounge in Bangkok which must be one of the best Business class lounges anywhere. Uncrowded, well laid out, comfortable with a wide selection of appetising food. The Swiss A340 flown wasn't showing its age and the cabin lay-out, while 'different', was fully acceptable; lie-flat seats comfortable though rather 'firm'. Much has been made of the small IFE screens but the picture is very clear and presented no viewing problems. Lunch was served soon after take-off and no lover of good-quality food could have cause for criticism of what was served; an appealing selection of dishes well presented. Certainly as good as any meal I've had in recent times in Business class. The wine selection of course contained a Swiss white and a red, the sylvaner not to my taste but the pinot noir quite acceptable. But the inclusion of a first class Bordeaux (a 2011 St Emillion) had me asking for a refill (or two!). Before landing at Zurich a light meal was offered, just enough to see you through the rest of the day with a 19.30 arrival. Swiss cabin staff have been criticised by some as being somewhat impersonal but we found the opposite being attended by two very charming and attentive cabin crew. Nice to be addressed by name, something which is rare these days other than in First class.

On long haul flights two full meals plus beverages rounds done by cabin crew, and also a small self serve bar set in the galleys. Seat comfort was fine, although felt a bit cramped on the already dated A340. The IFE was the only minus, it got stuck on both flights but it was rebooted by friendly cabin crew. One thing I really liked was that in SIN they have an early checkin counter which opens 6 hours before departure, something really convenient when you arrive very early to the airport.

The check-in staff and the manager on duty at the time were rude to us when we asked what was going on with our seats, and were completely unhelpful. We managed to talk to one of the gate staff who somehow got each child paired up with one adult, but we were still split up, which ruined the longest part of our journey back home to Australia. As a family, it's unacceptable that we couldn't even sit near each other. What kind of airline splits up a family with children just because other people paid a bit more money? Additionally, your baggage allowance is ridiculously low compared to all other airlines we flew on during our holiday, requiring us to repack all our suitcases on the floor of your check in hall.

Very small, in peak hours it could be difficult to find a free see, slow wifi, unfriendly staff, and a very small buffet. Always the same food - nothing from the swiss cuisine, only standard food - for a flagship lounge not acceptable. Zurich to Hannover by Helvetic Airlines, old Fokker 100, business cabin not separated from the Economy - but a light meal was served even if this flight was only 50mins.

LX uses Economy seats with the middle seat unsold for Business Class, which are after all nothing else but not too comfortable Economy seats. However the seat pitch is better than in Economy.

Check-in in VIE (handled by OS) was fast and very friendly. Boarding in VIE slightly messy as no room to queue or for separate lines due to terrible design of the Skylink terminal. Boarding in ZRH uneventful. Swiss used Austrian Airlines lounges in VIE. Senator Schengen lounge just average and not great for being Austrian’s flagship lounge - very limited snacks and average drink selection. Did not use a lounge in ZRH due to short connection time. Arrival process in LCY great, border control efficient with short lines, luggage fast, priority luggage first.

Our trip was totally terrible that I would not recommend to anyone, especially if you travel with kids. Here is the list of problems we found during our trip: 1) All planes we took departed with a 30-40 mins delay. Having a 40-mins stopover in Zurich meant we had to run with kids in Zurich airport in order not to miss the next flight. They try to make as many deals as possible, offering impossible-to-complete stopovers. Don't buy tickets from them if the stopover is less than 1 hour. You have high chances of missing your next flight. 2) Baggage lost. We had 2 pushchairs for kids that were lost both on our way to Moscow and on our way back to Barcelona. We stayed in Moscow for 3 days, the lost pushchairs were delivered to our hotel on the night of our 3rd day. So, it was worth nothing taking pushchairs at all. Moreover, one of our luggages was lost on our way back. 3) SWISS office in Moscow Domodedovo airport has a awful customer service. These are my main complaints, but there were some other issues during the flight: food was poor, we had problems ordering special gluten-free food in advance. Stewards misinformed us by saying that the 40-mins delayed departure of the plane will be compensated during the flight and we will arrive on time (that in our case was not true). In Zurich airport there is no special lines for customers who are about to miss their flight, they go at a slow rhythm and just don't care if you miss the flight. I am often travelling with european low-cost airlines and I know that you have to sacrifice some comfort if you decide to pay less. Swiss is not supposed to be low-cost, but its service is just so bad that would rather I prefer Vueling or Ryanair with whom I have never had any problem like that. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

I always purchase a Z class business GVA-MUC and a D class business ticket for the return flight. I do so because I want to be able to catch an earlier flight home if my meeting finishes early and I always book on the last flight in case it doesn't. Until the summer timetable when Swiss took over, LH allowed me during the on-line check-in to ask for a reservation change. If the reservation change could not be approved immediately I was put on the waitlist and I always (99% of the time) succeeded in getting a seat. Swiss has a new policy. They sell you a D class (which is quite expensive) and when you try to change (you can no longer do this online) they demand a payment of an extra €200 (for a ticket that already costs over €1000). When I ask why, I am told the D class if full. I then get on board and find that out of 20 business class seats, only 3 are occupied. I asked the other passengers on my flight last week what booking class they had, and none of them were in D. I wrote to complain and sent in pictures of the empty business class section. I got a boilerplate answer which did not address any of the points I made. Can a carrier be held to account for dishonest advertising. Why do they sell a class which they claim is changeable but in practise it isn't. Swissair and its successor Swiss used to be such a great airline. They are doing remarkably well in antagonising their most loyal customers. It is a shame when a premium airline offers less service than say Easyjet which always allows you to travel on an earlier flight than the one you booked if there is space.

We had a long transit (18 hours) and Swiss do not arrange transit accommodation in Bangkok or lounge access, their office opens three hours before the flight and you need a boarding pass to enter the lounge, so you are 'on your own' with no baggage, no lounge access and need to arrange your own hotel and visa.

On both Swiss legs the airline failed to give a bassinet for our two month old baby so we had to nurse him for 14 hours of flights in total. The crew of the first flight tried their best to help and messaged Zurich to ensure the second flight would have a bassinet but there was still no bassinet for that flight. Our baby's ticket was almost USD$1000 so we expected something for the money spent.

I’m sure they see this every day but not an ounce of sympathy. He merely told us to go and see his supervisor who then directed us to Ticket Sales to purchase new tickets for the Geneva flight, leaving 3 hours later at a cost of £378 each. We did so as we had a connection in Athens on Aegean so we paid up. I called Aegean Airlines and explained our predicament. Within minutes, we were booked on a different flight from Athens by a very helpful and understanding customer service agent at a total cost of 40 euros. Boarding for the Geneva flight was scrappy and untidy. Met at the door by wooden crew with just a brief greeting. A320 was clean. Business Class seats on Swiss short haul are very uncomfortable and hard. Breakfast served shortly after take off by purser. Quite cold and robotic without any engagement with passengers.

Every seat had a blanket, pillow, TV, USB point, headphones available - something you would long to see in any US carrier. Magazines and newspapers were kept in different areas of the cabin but extremely disappointing that not a single one was in English. Swiss needs to know that not every passenger on their flights speak German or French. We departed on time and service commenced quickly and very efficiently. I admire the Swiss efficiency. Drinks were offered with salty biscuits and then lunch as a choice of 1 vegetarian option of noodle or a non-veg of chicken with aubergines. Serve with salad, dessert and Swiss cheese as well as additional large cans of soft drinks made this a very good meal for economy. The IFE needs to improve.

VIE-ZRH was a typical short European flight; flight was on time, seats okay with good legroom for Economy; cabin was only 70% full which added to the comfort; FA’s were friendly and professional; one drink run with a small sweet snack was adequate for the short duration of the flight. Web check-in did not work, but no problem as seat selection was possible and no lines at check-in counters. However carry-on limit of just 8 kg was heavily policed and strictly enforced at VIE. ZRH-ORD (day flight) slightly delayed on both departure and arrival, but did not cause problems. Flight was a very pleasant experience. Plane was not the most modern in the fleet, but fine with a 1-2-1/2-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD; movie selection was okay, but not too extensive, TV selection was rather poor. Typical for European airlines the selection offered was rather light on new releases. FA’s were again professional attentive and regularly present in the cabin also between service runs. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasar Salad. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. OS’s Senator lounge in VIE was good without being great and had a decent breakfast offering. LX’s Senator Lounge at the E-gates in ZRH has be one of the nicest lounges in Europe with a huge open-air terrace with great with view of the apron.

Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time; also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other EU countries; a breeze.

We were 2nd in line, and upon reaching the counter, were told the flight was overbooked when the service staff knew we were flying to Singapore. He offered a solution to fly us with Air France given we were involuntarily bumped from the flight without much alternatives, and were told to come back in an hour's time when the check-in counter would be closing. I had chosen to fly with Swiss because I have heard reviews on great service and flight quality but if you are offering to fly me with another carrier, I would have just chosen to fly with Air France in the first place without going through so much headache at the check-in counter. So we heeded the guy's suggestion to come back in another hour and we were on 'standby' list. But what I don't appreciate is the attitude the service staff who wasn't even apologetic that we were in this situation at all. He was the duty manager at the period of time but he was not providing the best solution to our benefit. He even told us to write a complaint to Swiss. I was appalled and amused by his reasoning. A flight that is overbooked is not a passenger's fault, and I think we have the right to reclaim our seats, plus I had the screenshot to confirm I was checked in with seats allocated.

Pushback was ontime for this 777 flight after an orderly boarding and time in the pleasant new Swiss lounge in terminal E, which is vastly superior to the terminal A lounge. This was our first flight on the Swiss Boeing 777 and the main thing to note is the upgraded seating which is similar to the A330 but a little more modern and user friendly. Swiss still don't offer noise cancelling headsets which is a little unusual these days. The other feature of the entertainment system is that for the first 20 to 25 minutes of the flight, passengers are forced to watch a series of ads and promotional videos. During this time, it is impossible to watch anything else as the handset and touchscreen controls are inoperable. For those people who choose to skip dinner and sleep, it is not possible to even switch off the screen during this time. It was interesting watching other frustrated passengers trying to unfreeze their controllers until one of the cabin crew told us we just had to wait until the ads were finished! Service and food are industry average with a competent but aloof crew. The flight was good value for money but it seems Swiss are content to be a middle grade carrier.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The whole plane was very clean. The seats were pretty spacious, but nevertheless I couldn't find any sleep that night. The cabin crew was very friendly. Since the A340 isn't the newest of planes, the inflight entertainment system was pretty old as well. It was somewhat slow to react on input and the screen was frankly speaking pretty bad. Furthermore, the whole inflight entertainment system was restarted midflight, which rendered unusable for around 30 minutes.

I had purchased a fare including one bag to check-in, but was not sure whether to check-in my carry-on. I asked at check-in, and together with the agent we agreed that I could carry my bag on-board. When boarding, a SWISS Gate agent tells me that there is no way that I can bring this bag on board, since the plane is absolutely full. Given that the agent was not very keen on listening to customer input to put it mildly, I accepted to have the bag tagged. When boarding was completed, the plane was not even half full, and the space above my seat was completely empty. Three carry-ons of approved size such as mine could easily have fit into the overhead space. However, today was not one those days at SWISS. I really encourage adhering to rules, but it is a two-way street, and today's performance by SWISS is enough for me to consider another carrier next time. In addition, the service level overall on-board today's flight was not impressive. The staff seemed to have misunderstood the fact that they are there to work and assist passengers. A really dismal performance from an airline that usually gets it right.

I was lucky enough to have an exit row, so my legs had room but my upper legs another story. Being a body builder I was filling my seat just as a well stuffed sausage. Service was standard, nothing fancy. Food okay, prosecco was available for economy class. FA's doing their job and polite. Nice TV Screen but IFE selection had just the basics: each music selection has 1 or max 2 albums. Less than 10 TV series to choose from with only about 4 episodes.

I am traveling with small children and have to be seated together with them. I think at the very least these extra charges should be disclosed before one purchases a ticket through Kayak, because it is unusual; people have the expectation of being able to choose their seat without charge. I understand that this is the trend in airline pricing, but explicit disclosure on Kayak is a totally different matter.

Even before take-off I noticed that the headphone was not working properly (sound in only 1 ear). With only 8 seats in first class it is asking too much to check these before flights? I was given a new headphone after take-off. Quality wise these headphones are low quality: no noise cancelling. I can say only positive things about the flight attendants who were friendly, very helpful and efficient. Meal service was somewhat disappointing: for main course it was either chicken or pasta. The quality was fine but not exceptional. I would have expected a bigger choice. Different from business class? Not really except for better quality wine and better presentation. Sleep quality: you get a set of pyjamas and the flight attendant puts a small mattress and duvet. So I slept very well. Flight entertainment: same offerings as in Business with movies the same for an entire month. So don't travel SWISS too much or you will be watching the same movies. Was it worth the extra cost between business and First? Not really. But what always ruins the experience when you fly to Brussels via Zurich: on the leg between Zurich and Brussels they use the tiniest plane they have and you are put on a bus between the terminal and the plane.

Attendants would not reply to bell and had to get up for water at night whilst attendants were talking at back of aircraft (they looked at me like it was an inconvenience when I asked for water - I felt like I was rude for asking). I must say however the crew on the flight home were the opposite and I could not speak highly enough of the service and would be amongst the best I have experienced. Anyway my overall opinion would be to give them a go as if it was anything like the way back I would recommend.,nan,nan,nan

The crew were disinterested and outright rude. I asked for a glass of water 4 hours in and was told to get it at the back galley. When I got there all the crew were sitting around chatting. They ran out of white wine within 90 minutes of leaving Geneva. Overall the service was really poor.,nan,nan,nan

Trouble free check in at Terminal 1 slight delayed departure to Zurich but we were kept informed and the crew came round with a tray of chocolates as we were waiting 10mins which was a nice touch. Spotlessly clean Airbus 321 with welcoming crew. Fresh croissants served with a hot drink. Plenty to keep you occupied during the connection at Zurich airport with a wide range of shops and facilities. Flight to Palma full legroom fine in Y class not cramped good quality Sandwich and hot and cold drinks again served by great flight attendants. 3D route map shown on overhead screens informative. Return in C class was fantastic I was booked on the 1735 departure from PMI but because the departure of that aircraft from ZRH was 30 mins delayed I was automatically switched to an earlier flight at 1630 to ZRH. PMI to ZHR was with Eidelweiss airlines (same group as Swiss) excellent meal in Business food was well presented and served professionally then a cheese board. The Lounge at Zurich is not the best food choice is rather limited but didn't need to eat. Onward connection to LHR busy but plenty of room in Business class more mature but professional crew meal and drinks served. Again well maintained aircraft interior. Sadly the problems started as we approached LHR as usual had to hold for 30 mins before landing and then they were not expecting us at the allocated air bridge so no staff were there to meet the aircraft. After waiting 15 mins they did find a member of the ground staff and we had to disembark via the rear exit onto buses which took us to the terminal as they could not use the airbridge.,nan,5.0,nan

I had been wait listed for Business from my full flexi economy ticket however all ground staff I talked to simply fobbed me off with 'only if there is a no show'. I had blocked 40k miles for this. Upon boarding was told business was full and was not going to happen. Strangely enough there was over 4 empty seats in Business when all passengers were seated. FA when asked said it was out of her control. In Economy - cabin was full and seat space is very compact. IFE is on demand however I found the screens even at the lowest brightness to be still very bright. Earphones painful after an hour. Food was acceptable however there was no choice only chicken provided. Breakfast was a croissant and yoghurt and the FA did come around again with a second batch of croissants. FA on our aisle was young and very friendly. However on occasion some of the older crew would come by barking orders at customers. Seat quality for sleeping is terrible new Recarro seats they should not be used for long haul. No possible way to get comfortable. The cabin temperature dropped massively during the night. Eventually the crew when torn away from their chatting at the back turned the temp back up. This was my first and last time using Swiss Long haul. Much better products out there.,nan,2.0,nan

Breakfast in C to and from CPH which was cheese with a fruit salad and warm bread and choice of sandwich between ZRH-BCN which is a nice change in Y. Swiss offers a consistent product but could improve on the cabin staff friendliness as this aspect is the inconsistent factor with Swiss and always has been. Staff in C is usually much friendlier though which is expected of course.,nan,3.0,nan

Business class lounge in Zürich is very comfortable and has good facilities but a limited range of food and drink. Boarding was smooth and the flight on time. The quality and availability of food and drink on board were excellent. Staff were friendly and efficient. In lay-back mode I found the seat to be very comfortable and it seemed longer than the one on the A330; however in seated mode there is a hard area on the flat part of the seat that is a bit uncomfortable.

Flight operated by Swiss European former Crossair aircraft. Instead of having a hand luggage baggage and a laptop bag decided to have everything in once piece of hand luggage. Resulted in a bit heavier rucksack but compared to other trolleys of other passengers still considerably lighter. (As I assisted fellow passengers placing their luggage). Maitre de Cabin decided that my rucksack had to go into the overhead bin which I agreed to and offered to assist. She declined assistance but when placing it in the bin she screamed down the whole aisle if I was carrying stones in it. Upon take off asked her very politely if that was professional and only got a sarcastic smile and a I dont care body movement. My fellow passengers around me where not amused as well. On top of that she talked about me and my rucksack with her colleague in Swiss German while serving food not considering that I might even speak Swiss German which I do. Snack was a weird cheese in ""curry"" sandwich that was left aside by many passengers. Usually they serve decent sandwiches though. Full bar service. In all slightly delayed but efficient flight. Let down by unprofessional FAs.",nan,5.0,nan

The transfer at Zurich airport was easy. On the RJ100 our bulkhead seats were comfortable enough and the cabin attendant was very attentive.

Shortly after lunch the cabin staff proceeded to close all the window blinds making the cabin dark as if it was a night flight and stopped people opening them until two hours before landing. This made it even harder to cope with jetlag as the plane arrived at around 5pm Pacific time and we were expected to go to sleep again. Complained to Swiss who basically said ""it's policy"".

Aircraft very clean and comfortable for the 45 minutes flight. A gourmet sandwich with parma ham and Swiss cheese plus choice of alcoholic drinks and chocolate dessert and coffee. Crew polite and attentive but rushed service due to the short length of flight and stormy weather and turbulence. Zurich-Berlin Tegel on an A320 3x3 with the middle seat empty not a fan of this euro-configuration for business. Flight delayed almost an hour in Zurich due to severe storm and airport congestion. For the 1.10 hrs flight a full dinner was served in spite of the heavy rain and turbulence with fresh breads foie-gras and sauerkraut Swiss cheeses and a fruits-tart for dessert. Service was friendly by young flight attendant. Arrived Tegel in late evening with airport almost empty. Baggage was one of the first due to Priority tags.

The new long-haul business seat is a minor miracle in that with a small gap between the rows one gets a lot of personal space (especially in the single seats by the windows). Both dinner and breakfast were excellent and the service attentive. On the negative side the pillow and blanket are paltry and the entertainment system antiquated. Short hop to London ok but nothing special. Difficult to see why they have won best European business class.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Had the opportunity to try out the new Business Class product on LX due to the Thanksgiving week premium fare sale EWR-ZRH A340-300 on the way out A330-300 on the way back. Seats were roomy for C with only 4 or 5 across (depending on row) made for lots of living and storage space. My only complaint was how low to the ground the seats were in bed mode - you felt every single bump. That said it did an excellent job providing privacy and blocking out any ambient light. Service was highly professional and pleasant flight attendants where everything from meal service to mid-flight beverage requests was quickly responded to with a smile. Passengers were addressed by name and as far as I could tell every member of staff spoke English in addition to Schweizerdeutsch (and a few French as well). I highly recommend trying the Swiss speciality entree for me it did not disappoint. IFE was a mixed bag. While both aircraft type feature AVOD the A340's system appears to be an older generation - clunky interface long load times and the system froze on me (necessitating a reset) twice. The A330 has a newer system better interface and a larger screen although with the same limited selection as on the outbound flight. Despite wishing the seat's bed mode was slightly higher and a more extensive/ newer IFE system I had an overall excellent experience with the best sleep I've ever had on an airplane.,nan,5.0,nan

Good choice of newspapers and magazines. wines are very good and food good but not up to standard when compared to other airlines. Seat is good and quite comfortable but certainly not the best in the sky. Once turned into a bed it is very comfortable with a good size duvet and a real pillow allowing a good rest. The fact of having only one WC for first class can be very bothersome especially just before landing when everyone uses it for changing.,nan,4.0,nan

Staff again professional and efficient and some friendlier than the normal Swiss staff. The Cabin Manger was very attentive and spoke to all passengers individually over dinner (interestingly he was in fact Spanish). Dinner as on the outbound was very good and as a late night departure quickly served which was appreciated. Fully flat beds again which is normal for the A340 and woken the usual 90 minutes prior to landing for a (very poor) breakfast which let this flight down. Could not find the arrivals lounge at Zurich but not important as has a shower at the departure lounge while waiting for the second flight. Again no complaints a full lunch with champagne served despite being 10.30am but acceptable as being awake for many hours and travelling in a different time zone. As always have no problem recommending Swiss.,nan,5.0,nan

Prices in Business out of Spain always one of the best and makes the 7 hour layover in ZRH justifiable. Fully flat seat a little hard even after choosing soft function. One of the best steak meals ever enjoyed on a flight which was one of the celebrity chefs signature dishes. Champagne and drinks of good quality and usual service a little cold and slow but always polite. Overall never disappointed never wowed but this means trust and worth repeat business.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight from Birmingham to Zurich was late turning a tight connection into a stressful experience. Once on board the long haul run to Sao Paulo it was about as bearable as a 12-hour overnighter in economy can be. The return leg was similar - 12-hour overnighter from Zurich to Sao Paulo - I had pre-booked an aisle seat but was assigned at check-in to a middle seat - only when I threatened to call Swiss in Zurich did an aisle seat miraculously become available. However this turned out to be a rear seat with limited recline. As I am not a sleeper on night flights that was not a huge problem and it was good that the crew came around regularly with water. The food was standard fare - not good. 7-hour layover in Zurich was very welcome with the excellent Dayrooms facility at Zurich Airport. I was able to get 4 good hours of sleep before my onward flight and drive home. By the way I have rated the seat-comfort as very poor - this is not a reflection on Swiss - all economy seating is akin to purgatory on any long-haul.,nan,4.0,nan

Food and wines were very also excellent and with a local flair promoting different regions of Switzerland. Once the seat is turned into a bed full flat with a real duvet and a normal size pillow you are almost like in a normal bed. Entertainment also quite good with a nice choice of movies and a large fixed screen. The movable half partition gives you privacy without the feeling of being claustrophobic.

ANA do the check in at Narita and they were very pleasant. Staff on board were polite but food was non-memorable the one meal for the 12-hour flight was far too small with nothing but a light snack shortly before landing in Zurich. Movie selection was quite extensive. Seat was very upright and hard for sitting and my type of seat along the wall was probably the worst type of seat. It was claustrophobic as the curved wall encroached upon my space both when sitting or lying down. Seat is uncomfortably narrow for both sitting and trying to sleep. Being a wide shouldered man I could not really sleep on my back between the armrests. You legs are stuck in a tunnel or box making it difficult to get in and out of the seat when it is reclined. I am not excited about using Swiss again but if I did I would try to get a seat in the centre of the plane.,nan,2.0,nan

Plane was tidy and clean but seats are starting to show their age. Not much leg room especially in the first rows. Service was very friendly and efficient and the purser was great. Usually young flight attendants are trained on this flight and on a full flight when left alone in business class it can be a disaster at times but luckily it was not the case on this flight. For a short European flight food is not with local Swiss specialities (with portions getting smaller and smaller) and a nice selection of wines but still far below the competition.

Since I was flying Swiss through United I was unable to check-in online 24 hours before. I called the company and they told me it would not be possible. The unavailability of online check-in led to problems on the flight namely many passengers being unhappy with their seat assignments. I was asked twice to switch seats. I also overheard 3 other passengers asking other passengers to change seats. They were also very adamant about the weight of carry-on baggage being under 8 pounds. I felt this rule somewhat arbitrary but was happy to comply. Many passengers in line ahead and behind me had to pay the $100.00 fee to check their bags.,nan,4.0,nan

Equipment: A330-300 seats in Economy are tiny and dreadful. Food was good but insufficient. At least Maître de Cabine kindly served me an extra main course and a snack before landing (in addition to the traditional Ice Cream) as I was literally starving.

Seats are as comfortable as they're ever going to be in economy leg room not great but once again this economy so can't complain. My only gripe would be that the inflight entertainment is a bit antiquated not touch screen on the A340 and has a fiddly little remote in the arm rest with a mind of its own.

When I ordered a coffee in the morning I had to remind flight attendant again ca. 10 minutes later. The cabin was full and the one small bathroom was crowded in the morning with people changing again. I would not recommend the First class product on A340.

A family with a child (supposed to stay on the parent's lap but of course it did not stay there) kept the entire Business Section awake because of the child's loud voice. Cabin crew went out of their way to ignore the problem. Even discounting the anti-social behaviour: when will airlines learn how to do the maths? Introduce child-free sections and enforce it! Then the seats. Extremely hard like sleeping on a bunk. To top it off the captain had announced a quiet flight (weather wise) but over half of the time we experienced turbulence.

Very disappointing use of business class due to wishing to have large seats the 3-3 combination but airline had chosen to block the middle seat with a completely hard table that is not removable this gives the impression that the seat is even smaller than in economy as there is no way of raising the arm rest to expand over into the middle seat - as a large person the idea of having extra space is why I paid for business. Staff did their best to try to move me which ended up by moving economy passengers around and putting me in economy with a free seat next to me. A solution but not nice when you are expecting a business class experience. Staff were trying to make up for this by being particularly attentive but bear this in mind if you wish to have more space. It would have been cheaper for me to pay for 2 seats in economy. If I were a smaller/average size person it might have been a good experience as food was nice and service was great - but bad seats let them down.

Sets were narrow on-board service nearly non-existent no interaction with cabin crew. Food was awful and poor. Temperature was cold with no personal air system. Transfer at Zurich was awful.

Plane clean and well maintained ""full flat seats"" but my aisle seat was open in the very front thus the feet could easily slip to the right and collide with the people moving in the aisle. Window seats do not have this risk. Departure with a minimal delay arrival about 20 minutes late due to ""avoiding Russian airspace"" thus taking the Southern route over Turkmenistan Kazakstan and entering Chinese airspace West of Urumqi - this is altogether a flight time of one additional hour. Meal service consisted of a late lunch and an early breakfast almost at sunrise over Central China - both with good choices good quality - just good European business class standard but also taking Asian tastes into consideration (two of the four meal choices can be called Asian dishes). Beverage selection ok no ""high class wines"" - one Swiss white and red each plus three additional European varieties. The result is probably similar to my choices if someone would ask me to suggest five reasonable wines giving me a strict budget plus the must of choosing two Swiss ones. Thus I do not complain but enthusiasm sounds different AVOD is not my topic - I just follow the airshow read dine and take a nap. Once again a pleasant flight on Swiss but I wish they could have a slightly less strict budget on beverages and inflight magazines.",nan,4.0,nan

In all the decades I flew with Swissair and now with Swiss International I always noticed the limited supply of reading material - compared to e.g. Lufthansa.

The outbound flight arrived on time seat comfort was very good and there was a very frendly and competent cabin crew at work. The return flight arrived about 25 minutes late (rush hour at TXL) but the standards of comfort and cabin crew were equally good. But the overall feeling was not very inviting and quite annoying because both flights (Airbus A321) were more or less full. There were lots of business travellers with huge carry on luggage lots of heavy jackets because of winter time and yes boarding and deboarding an Airbus A321 through only one door takes a long time. But I am not going to blame Swiss for that elsewhere I would have had the same experience. I paid EUR 180 for the ticket which is a good fare from my point of view. I will definitely consider Swiss again. Zurich airport is very efficient and passenger friendly while it is good that Berlin TXL is going to be replaced.

Their resumption of SIN services appears to be paying off with excellent loads both ways (previous trip was ex-HKG). Outwards SIN-ZRH LX179 was on the oldest A340 (HB-JMA) but you would not have known it from the immaculate cabin. Cabin crew an absolute delight with a range of ages and genders and every one with whom I interacted was cheerful and charming the friendly teamwork was a joy to observe. The addition of a seat controls briefing card’to the seat-pocket contents was a welcome and helpful addition to the reconfigured A340. Choose an outboard single seat if travelling alone I had 9K on the LX179 and 11K on the return LX178 and enjoyed a decent 5hrs snooze on the former and almost 8hrs solid sleep on the latter. In Europe the ZRH-TXL (and later return) sectors demonstrated why Swiss has been awarded Best European Business Airline. Crew interaction details (jackets lockers water bottles reading materials chocolates) and short- sector catering were all happy experiences. The return LX178 ZRH-SIN crew didn't quite make par with their 179 counterparts a fortnight earlier but their colleagues had set a very high bar. Both food and wine were very good indeed.

Swiss badly let down by the standards at the Thai Royal Orchid lounge at D Concourse. Amongst other matters there are no calls in this lounge which resulted in a wait at the gate before priority boarding of premium cabins.

Pre take-off drinks - champagne juice or water - on time push back full dinner service when airborne (entree choice of three mains - the steak was one of the best cooked and most flavoursome enjoyed aloft - cheese and dessert complemented by a choice of two white wines (Swiss or NZ) and two reds (Australian and French) and a good nights sleep on the flat bed.

I have to point out the impeccable state of the restrooms throughout the flight! Arrival in MIA was hassle free as we were the only international flight arriving at that time (6pm) and all immigration officers were there only for Swiss. Return from LAX also no drop-off zone for baggage again pre- checked-in online. Treated ourselves to a paying upgrade into business class. The seats are nice and good. Not my favourite though. The food concept is ok and especially the service routine for breakfast was confusing to me: No information about the options on the menu card which makes it even harder to pick a choice from the service cart and it all was on demand. Espresso service is great! All of the cabin crew were really nice caring and friendly. The downturn was the 'maitre de cabine' who was rushing down the aisle with her service cart and lacked proper service enthusiasm and should have taken her team as role models.

Flight departed Zurich on time at 16.35 and arrived slightly before scheduled arrival time at 19.00 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. Aircraft on this service was an Airbus A320 and I was seated in Economy on seat 10F (a window seat). Flights were more or less fully booked so it was rather cramped and the overhead bins became full before all passengers had boarded. This is quite normal on this particular flight since the load factor is normally very good thus meaning that it may become somewhat uncomfortable for you as a passenger. The standard of the aircraft was good and the seat pitch is perceived to be marginally better than the average carrier on intra-European routes. This may however only depend on the seat design. I have not checked the pitch compared to other airlines. A simple hot vegetable tart was served that in fact was quite tasty. Two rounds of services with both hot and cold drinks were offered during this 2 hr 20 min flight which I appreciated. The spirit and level of personal service and attention of the cabin crew I regard as slightly below the average full-service carrier on intra-European services. An in-flight overhead entertainment system were installed which was ok. The in-flight magazines available is also ok with quiet some variety of Swiss watches also available in the lower price range. The seats is of the more common recaro slim seats with artificial leather that to my opinion is so so. The cabin temperature was quite high which appears to be normal on Swiss flights for some reason. Best credits to the cabin crew that upon landing welcomed everyone to the ""Royal Kingdom of Sweden"". This was very much appreciated by me and I guess by many more Swedish passengers!",nan,3.0,nan

It shouldn't be this way on a transatlantic flight. All domestic flight seats I've had were better than this seating. What's scandalous is the utter contempt this airline has for the passenger: Not only is the seat narrower than you can imagine - I am a 5' 5"" female who weighs just 115 lbs but the armrests between seats only go up about 35 degrees. Meaning even if you have vacant seats next to you you cannot lie down or spread out. I could see everyone else was as shocked as I was on this overnight transatlantic route. I might add that he bulkhead seats which can be prime seats for leg room etc has entirely an entirely fixed armrest that can't be raised at all. The entertainment system felt out of date. The food was just awful. I kept thinking what could they possibly be thinking? The flight felt less than half full and the need for what I imagine was some need to squeeze extra seats onto the floor plan just wasn't apparent eyeing the plane. I would never ever fly Swiss Air again if I could help it. Again this is transatlantic service from New York City and should be the best foot forward.

Check-in desk at Birmingham was kind enough to allow my bag which was almost 2kg over the limit which I was not expecting from a European airline. Zurich airport is definitely a selling point for choosing Swiss stylish easy to navigate and very efficient. Swiss also has probably the best-timed schedules for connecting flights between Europe and Asia. Overall service and hospitality onboard both flights was friendly and attentive almost as good as Asian carriers. Can't say the same about the catering which was rather basic (cold sandwich on a 2 hour full-service international flight is unheard of in Asia no menus offered meal portions intercontinental were on the small side). Upsides were the surprisingly good wine available and the delicious Swiss cheese. The Y seat on the A340 is okay but rather outdated with no in-seat power or foot rest and an annoyingly large IFE box under the window seat. No amenity kits whatsoever on a 12 hour flight but the frequent drinks service was appreciated.

The meals on long haul flights leaving Zurich are prepared by starred chefs accompanied by good quality Swiss wines which are hard to get outside of Switzerland.

Another highly positive aspect of flying with Swiss airline is that you get plenty of leg space (compared to other airlines) and the seats are very comfortable even on short distance routes which shows that Swiss airline is one of the few airlines these days which doesn't compromise quality. We got free Swiss chocolates from the crew as well as sandwiches and drinks.

The dumplings were quite good served in a generous portion with a salad roll and dessert. Also offered a nice variety compared to usual economy fare.

The only criticism I have - a Swiss IA responsibility though the service is subcontracted - is that in the business lounge there is free wi-fi but only for 60 consecutive minutes. After that there is a charge. As I had a 5hr wait this was very inconvenient. Surely having pitched up a business class fare they could at least emulate many high street coffee shops and provide unlimited wi-fi without charge. it's not a big charge in the context of the fare more a matter of principle.,nan,4.0,nan

Swiss offers a traditional full in-service business product also on intra-European flights. This includes a 3 course meal which was very tasteful and included a selection between to hot main dishes. The only thing that is lacking is the timing in the service. No pre-dinner drinks or snacks were offered these had to be ordered at the same time as the meal was served which took quite some time into the flight. The timing of serving coffee/tea was also not as to be expected. The service level in general from the cabin staff I regard as lower than expected. They do their job in a correct Swiss manner but it lacked the sprit and enthusiasm that you would expect from such a well renowned carrier as Swiss. Cabin was clean and tidy and the middle seat was free in Business Class and the seat pitch was good. The seats are however the same as in Economy that is Recaro Slim Seats with artificial leather that to my opinion is not especially comfortable. The same type of seats can be found on several Star Alliance airlines within Europe. They offer no support for your head so if you would like to take a short nap bring your own pillow.

We boarded the plane as normal welcomed onboard and told we were ready to take off despite an earlier bird strike in one of the engines. Informed there was a 20-minute delay due to changing weather conditions. 15 minutes into the flight the pilot announced that we were returning to Zurich as the earlier bird strike had apparently damaged the engine too much. Then we had to be patient for an extra half hour due to the heavy incoming traffic to Zurich. In the end it took us what felt like the same amount of time as the flight would have taken to London. To offer an alternative a crew member announced that we should take the next scheduled flight to London Heathrow at 21.20 hrs. There was no alternative to London City allegedly due to lack of smaller aircraft that could land there. The hostess also announced that as soon as we land we should go straight to gate 31D to board the new flight stressing the point about going straight to that gate twice. I decided to go to Heathrow so I rushed along many other passengers to gate 31D and queued up only to find the gate unattended. 20 minutes later a staff member appeared and told us we should go gate 53D get our new boarding passes there and come back to gate 31D for boarding. While providing us with our new boarding passes the staff at gate 53D also gave us a food and refreshment voucher by way of compensation they said. These were valid for the coffee bar across the hall. So we all went to the coffee bar and queued up there to get our “ free”food and drink. Alas we found out that the vouchers was valid for a bar of chocolate and bottle of water. The time was after 8 pm.

The cabin crew appeared to be efficient but by the end of the trip I would rather describe them as glacially indifferent. Food quality served on silly little trays was very poor and small things like no salt or pepper sachet shows a lack of quality control somewhere. The toilet nearest to us ran out of toilet paper.

When I contacted Swiss about this I was advised all the information we relied on in choosing Swiss was incorrect. So even though we paid Swiss which issued the tickets and the plane was referenced as a Swiss flight there were no Star Alliance benefits and I would not receive any miles. As to the Swiss affiliate Edelweiss the plane was hot cramped uncomfortable and all drinks were a charge for this 10-hour flight. This was on the way to and from. To add insult to injury the staff were cold and short even for people from Central Europe and Edelweiss will allow the Economy Plus (Extra) to go empty rather than upgrade anyone with Star Alliance status. Instead they want $200 per person per way. The Economy Plus on our return flight was empty yet they ran out of food (unless you want curry on a 10-hour flight) and we were only 3 rows back from the front of Economy.

They served in coach a little hot meal (Risotto with dried tomatoes and a small chocolate cake) was very good and gave 2 rounds of drinks on a flight of 1.5 hours.

nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,2.0,We paid for 3 seats in Business Class and I can't believe I didn't fly my usual choice. Swiss show a picture of a throne-like seat on their website and represent that as their Business Class seat. But there are just a few of these in the cabin and the other seats are different. You can't get the seats they show on the web site only their senior frequent flyers. So my wife and baby were stuck in a middle seat with an unfortunate stranger next to them despite me having reserved the lone window seat online. The seats themselves are lumpy and uncomfortable and the in-flight entertainment is the worst I've seen. It is painfully slow clunky and simply doesn't work much of the time (we took two long haul legs Zurich - Singapore and Hong Kong - Zurich and this was true on both legs). The food is ok though not a patch on what you'd get on Emirates Qatar or one of the first-tier airlines. Swiss have no lounges of their own outside of Switzerland so in Hong Kong we ended up being sent to a packed noisy pay-per-entry lounge which had no seats was utter chaos and had one type of beer in the fridge. When we disembarked in Zurich we were told with no apology at all that we'd miss our connection to Manchester because Swiss were late arriving. My wife left her bag on the plane accidentally in our rush to get off. 5 minutes later we told a Swiss ground employee that the bag had been left in Business Class and would they mind retrieving it. They passed me a card for a third party lost and found company called Swissport and was told to file a web report with them when I was back in the UK. Two days later and still no info on what should have been the easiest thing in the world to solve. In short I wouldn't fly Swiss again.,nan,1.0,nan

Once onboard the pilot informed us that all passengers would have to leave the aircraft one by one to identify their bags as there were 3 extra bags that they could not identify. The plane was going to be at least 3 hours late which meant that we were going to miss our connecting flight in Zurich therefore missing our business meeting in Prague.

Reservation not satisfactory at all first of all there is no special hotline for first class passengers so you always need to wait for long time to get an agent. Then any request (also very basic) was difficult to get done. In particular I never got a follow up or feedback on my requests and had to call several times to follow up. Staff on the hotline are sometimes OK sometimes not friendly at all and had a lack of client orientation. Lounge in ZRH is very good design food good with good wine selection service OK. Lounge in SIN is very disappointing old and outdated design bad food choice and quality very poor wine selection. Cabin layout very outdated no luxury at all seat very old and not very comfortable; no luxury amenities at all (toilet without any mouth wash hand cream or lip balm etc). Food below average worse than business class. There is no food available after dinner if you wake up during the flight so you need to go on your own to get something from business class - not really first level. Good wine selection and quality. Staff this time (both legs) very friendly and helpful - there is a big difference from crew to crew so you need to be lucky to get a good crew - this should not be the case in First Class. Conclusion: disappointing I cannot recommend Swiss and find it clearly below other airlines first class.,nan,2.0,nan

Crew not smiling and mostly looking bored loudly discussing amongst themselves how bad their schedule is. Saw a lady traveling solo with 2 small children instead of assisting her with the seat belts one crew member just stood there looking annoyed while giving her orders adding insult to injury actually commencing to loudly complain to a colleague about a non existing situation (kids did nothing wrong).

The TV screen is very small. The seat adjustment panel shows its age some buttons do not work properly. The toilets have also absolutely no luxury features they look more like economy than first class very limited amenities (only one hand lotion and one face lotion but no lip balm no mouth wash etc.) after some hours they are out of tissues so you have to use paper tissues - very economy style! Amenities OK but again no luxury. The pyjamas are good quality. Food is OK but not on First standard (same choice and quality as Business Class). Limited choice. The chicken had absolutely no taste the rice also tasteless - overall really not good. Good is the quality of the wines. During the flight there is no food available - worse than in Business Class where they serve sandwiches etc. Service very disappointing: 3 empty water bottles remained for more than 5 hours beside me. The maitre de cabin however was nice and tried to accommodate us as much as possible. Overall very disappointing far away from Premium airlines like Emirates Etihad and Singapore Airlines. The First experience is at most on Business level of these Premium airlines. SWISS really needs to make an effort.,nan,1.0,nan

While the seating or relaxing position are good the sleeping one is very strange. The whole seat goes down close to the floor. I had a feeling to be lying in a coffin. Entertainment system was very slow crashed several times. Meal service was just ok started with a glass of wine (or champagne) and a cheap-feeling packet of nuts supermarket style. Even American airlines propose better prepared appetisers!. Three hours before landing the crew started to dismantle the whole galley behind us with continual clicks and clacks. I guess its a kind of game they had - who can make more noise when preparing breakfast. No idea who actually won but for sure all passengers lost at least one hour of sleep. Why serve breakfast two hours before landing? During the short- haul European flights they manage to serve the meal during 50 minutes long flights why not to do the same on long-haul flights? Long waiting for toilets: there are only two for both business cabins. All in all very disappointed experience. Will avoid SWISS in the future.,nan,2.0,nan

Okay so it was an economy seat but the seat spacing was extremely tight and the seats cushions were old and uncomfortable. The arrangement of Airbus 330 had no standing areas to comfortably stretch your legs without constantly moving out of the way of the lavatory door ways. Also there was no path to cross over to the other aisle so that I could not easily visit my friend on the other side of the aircraft.

First I noticed that my son's headset was not working so he wad to be moved to another seat. Then my headset seemed somewhat out of order as something heavy (probably the speaker within the earpiece) was displaced and moved freely every time I turned my head. Although the flight from N.Y. to Zurich was 8-hour long both dinner and breakfast were way below what someone would expect from Swiss business class both in terms of quantity but mainly in quality. There were only few business class travelers in this flight (less than 20 if I remember correctly) but still the crew seemed tired and was only ""typically"" polite trying just to ""get their thing done"". I had a much better and far more enjoyable experience about a month ago when traveling from Athens to Vienna and on to New York with Austrian airlines. Austrian's service was way more friendly genuinely polite and very helpful and their meals were far better that Swiss's. Also Austrian featured touch-screen TVs with newer movies and live in-flight information something that was missing from Swiss.

No amount of negotiation was going to get my case on board without a hefty fee of 150 Euros even though I was only a few grams over after packing my case. Swiss feels like a very low budget airline and their lack of any flexibility whatsoever was frustrating. The worst part is that Swiss do not allow you to have a carry-on plus a laptop.

I am however very disappointed with the airline. Both LX flights were delayed by or over 30 mins no explanation/excuse. The ZRH-ATH sector was on a new A321 with minimum cabin crew of 4 (instead of 5) so only 3 in the Y class. The cabin crew were uncoordinated (they were demonstrating the oxygen masks while the purser was announcing the life vest use) and the food service began from the forward towards the aft cabin and food collection was from aft to forward which means that we had to eat like animals. The food was a joke - an over-seasoned risotto that was only three spoons' size and a muffin. Drinks service - only one drink/cup per passenger and coffee/tea service 40 mins prior to arrival - for a 02.40 hours flight. For comparison LH OS A3 offer at least two drinks per passenger usually you get an additional drink with coffee or tea. The Crew was ignorant of the passengers two of them snappy they didn't bother to ask the passengers to raise their seatbacks for food service. Chaos in the aisle passengers not respecting the service but the crew didn't bother. Passengers almost climbed on seats to move across the trolley. The ATH-GVA sector was a bit friendlier but the crew were incapable of serving drinks without constantly spilling drinks on the floor. They also hurried the food/drink service in order to start the duty-free sales asking almost every passenger to buy something.

The Business Class seats are very nice and contemporary. Food was in general very good and well- presented. We did have two minor quibbles. The menu that we were given said that ice cream would be provided but we never saw it. Also the IFE is clumsy and outdated.

My seat was 2A on both legs of the trip. The seat is a normal economy class seat though the pitch is only marginally better than in economy class and definitely much worse than in exit row. Seat comfort was the same as Swiss economy which is to say not great at all. The food consisted of a regional Swiss vegetarian dish and a standard chicken dish with a nice dessert. Portions were small cutlery etc was good though. I paid a fairly low price for my semi-flexible (mid of the range) D class ticket. The value is pretty good if you need to carry a lot of baggage as you may check in 2 times 32kg and carry on 2 times 8kg. In comparison to other airlines such as Turkish airlines business class in Swiss is not ideal. Service quality was unexpectedly blunderous with an almost overly friendly cabin chief and a totally inadequate business class FA who couldn't even recall whether alpha is on port or starboard and was desperately searching for some imaginary economy class guest who may have been lost in business class (why anyone would attempt that on Swiss in Europe is a mystery to me - though it's possible as an accident since the seats in business and economy are identical).

Swiss at CDG only has a 23kg weight limit and the staff are extremely severe at enforcing this. No amount of negotiation was going to get my case on board without a hefty fee of 150 Euros even though I was only a few grams over after packing my case. Swiss feels like a very low budget airline and their lack of any flexibility whatsoever was frustrating. The worst part is that Swiss do not allow you to have a carry-on plus a laptop. Only one bag so I was forced to cram my laptop bag into my carry-on. A futile activity as I just took it out again after security. I found check-in to be really nasty.,nan,2.0,nan

The outcome is very low-cost like. Seats are incredibly cramped and uncomfortable the hot meal has been sacrificed for a ""new concept"" cold snack offered in a box and there is no entertainment except from the overhead screens (that's Tom & Jerry for you a few advertisements and the moving map). Staff have now become indifferent and the aisle has also become congested with passengers waiting to use the few toilets on board (including the only Business Class toilet). Forget paying for Business Class if you're flying this route on this aircraft: passengers are treated to the exact same seats as the ones in Economy Class (with the same pitch but the middle seat left empty) unless you can justify paying more than three times the amount for a hot meal and lounge access. SWISS is also charging Economy passengers a lot for booking seats in advance. There are better op tions to Cairo: BA Air France KLM and even (some) EgyptAir flights continue to operate widebodies from Europe and offer decent levels of comfort. SWISS has completely lost the plot and are now offering a standard Euro product for a 4 hour intercontinental flight.",nan,3.0,nan

Having paid 825 Euros for my ticket the services offered on-board as well as Swiss' overall product were a complete letdown despite the fact that I flew Economy. The on-board service consisted of a small cheese sandwich that was disgusting as the cheese was visibly going bad however a nice selection of drinks was offered.

Overall the Lufthansa Group's ground-crew policy of outsourcing check-in services to the cheapest provider counteracts the excellent on-board service: In my row in economy we were 3 Star-Gold customers (visible on our boarding passes) sandwiched next to each other. One look to the rear of the plane revealed that nearly all middle seats on the plane were empty. This seating practice leaves the impression that status-customers are being punished for their loyalty.,nan,4.0,nan

The meal was correct. I've the feeling that I always eat the same on Swiss economy chicken or pasta. Swiss Taste of Switzerland should be applied in economy class too. The staff were friendly and very professional as usual. As an example I wanted to buy cigarettes at the inflight duty-free shop and the flight attendant was not sure if my brand was still available. He promised to come back later to tell me if yes or not he came back one hour later telling me that they were not available and he even checked in business and first class too so kind! The inflight Entertainment is good too a lot of choice. Unfortunately compared to the competition I think that the screens are too small with a low resolution unfortunately. Better with Lufthansa.

Waiting for 3 hours on the plane with virtually no service of drinks snacks etc. was not up to standard. Swiss' old first class seats are very dated and worn. No privacy screen very poor monitor and very limited choice of video / movie entertainment. Missed connections in Zurich were very efficiently rebooked and information was available on arrival. No invitation no information was offered to first class passengers to the first class lounge at Zurich airport. Not knowing that a first class lounge exists I just searched and only found the business / senator lounge on arrival. Totally overcrowded limited choice of food and beverage no shower facilities in my view very inappropriate for first class service.

The seats are great and very stylish with light wood panelling. Boarding was on time with priority lane. The crew was extremely nice and welcoming. Also very professional. Drinks and food are ok but not up to standard when compared to other European carriers first class. In my experience Lufthansa and Air France serve much better food in their first class. Full flat seats are very comfortable and feels like a real bed with a nice duvet and real size pillow. Amenity kits are the same since at least 5 years with La Prairie products. Large screens are great for watching movies. Entertainment system is good also. Light snack served before landing to Miami. All in all it was a very nice flight.

The wines and chocolates served were top notch. The amenity kit was functional with what low budget items. The single seat is extremely private and very spacious though was a little too hard to sleep comfortably on. The crew is extremely polite and efficient though so no complaints there. The ZRH-BCN flight was an A320 with standard economy seating with the middle seat taken out.

I was upgraded to Business at the time of boarding which was most welcome as I had had an arduous day of travel and this was my last leg heading home. Upon arrival at the door of the aircraft we were told to standby as the cabin was not ready which meant a congregation of passengers in the jet-way. I found this to be highly atypical for an airline I usually associate with precision. On board the seat was spacious comfortable and offered power ports for USB and 110VAC. The amenity kit was pretty basic but I liked the packaging which was designed to serve as a tablet/iPad case after landing. IFE had a good selection of movies with respectable size screens and good audio. FA's were efficient and friendly and came around often. Food presentation was good but taste not so. There was plenty to choose from for drinks albeit the wine selection was limited. Ice cream was served twice during the flight which made up for subpar food quality. Flight left late but arrived ahead of schedule due to strong tail winds and we were kept abreast of the flight's progress by the captain throughout the journey.

IFE was AVOD movie selection was fine but has room for improvement. FA's were brilliant professional attentive actually charming and regularly present in the cabin with drinks sandwiches snacks ice-cream etc. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasars's Salad. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. LX uses the shared Servisair lounge in AMS which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a neglectable food selection. Due to the short connection time in ZRH we did not use lounge in ZRH. Transferring in ZRH is fast and easy. Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other Schengen countries a breeze. Terminals are roomy and well designed. Probably one of the very best airports in Europe for a transfer connection. Excellent long-haul product by LX and clearly recommended.

They have an ok selection in films but the screen size and resolution is not up to business class standards, some airlines have a better system even in Economy. I do hope that they improve with the new B777 entering next year. The 12 inch is not nearly good enough and the resolution is passable.

The Economy on their flagship 777 is very tight. 3-4-3 is not comfortable at all. And I felt sympathy with the crew serving in this very tight aisle. However the crew was unprofessional. Boarding commenced 10 minutes prior scheduled departure. So for sure 300 + passengers were not seated when the plane should leave the gate. So the crew started to yell to passengers to move faster to their seats and take a place. Very funny if you keep in mind, that you can’t pass anyone standing on the aisle due to the configuration. So the flight started badly already. It does not become better when they serve food. They made a whole service even departure was at midnight. None of the crew members was able to speak in an adequate level to the passenger nor even had eye contact. Just rude and unpolite. It remembers on former LH times. However they have improved significantly. Quality of food was ok. Entertainment also ok however with the same content as LH, so after 2 longhaul flights within 1 month your done with your choice.

Talking here about the economy product, I got a seat at the emergency exit, with extra leg room, although the regular ones have plenty as well. You get almost a real breakfast, a very nice croissant, coffee and orange juice and a refill, efficient service and the finest touch is the Swiss chocolate bar you get at the end. Flights are on time, the entertainment system shows you were you are, how much time until touchdown, info about the places you are flying over and cartoons.And this on the small planes like the A320.

Of note the complimentary white wine was better than the wine that we had in business on the way down and it was cold. Coming down none of the cold drinks in business had been cooled down, so we had wine with ice cubes.

If you choose to watch films with a dark background most of the detail in the film escapes the eye. It is almost difficult to watch and for long flights a good screen is important. I hope that with the new Boeing 777's coming in 2016 they will decide on a new system for video/audio.

Flight to Montreal was a new Boeing 777 aircraft, seating was comfortable and seat pitch was ok (31 in). Atmosphere in the aircraft was white and grey coloring, pillow with synthetic covering and nice blanket. There was a welcoming drink and then offer main meal with metallic silverware, and basic – sandwich breakfast 1 hour before landing. There was a mid flight buffet – minimal. IFE was good and easy to operate. They offer hot towels before landing. There were no amenities on the seat but were in the WC.",Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0

Coming back Saint Petersburg there was no priority boarding at Saint Petersburg, it was more lile a free for all, so disorganised. The flight was delayed into Zurich but I managed to make the flight, only to find that they failed to put my bags on the plane to London. I talked to the Swiss rep about the bag, so matter of fact about the bags being left behind and telling me it will be a full day before I receive my luggage. I asked why they were not put on the next flight which was due to arrive 2 hours after my flight but no explaination. Not what I expected from Swiss, especially not as a Business Class customer. Totally disgraceful. Swiss should be ashamed.",Business,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,5.0,July 2017,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Dublin to Zürich,4.0," |  I flew SWISS for the first time from Dublin to Zürich. The flight was quite cheap as I booked well in advance. The queue for check-in was lengthy enough but it moved fairly quickly. Boarding commenced on-time and departure was also punctual. The seats were standard slimline seats which were perfectly adequate for the length of the flight. Legroom was also fine. A number of TV screens were located throughout the cabin which showed the progress of the flight, which is not something you see very often on European flights. The food offered (morning flight) was a choice of a ""sweet or salty"" quiche. I think savoury was the word they were looking for! Anyway, I had the sweet quiche which was very nice. The savoury quiche got the thumbs up as well. Drinks were also offered. The Swiss chocolate later in the flight was a nice touch. All the cabin crew were very friendly and polite. The flight arrived in Zürich on-time. We had to be bussed to the terminal from a remote stand though unfortunately. Overall I can highly recommend SWISS. They have some very reasonable fares available despite their premium service.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

I had the 4A seat (aka 'the throne') which is perhaps the best seat in Business Class in the current Swiss A330 configuration. The pre-departure Swiss Business Class lounges in Zurich are somewhat disappointing. The air conditioning wasn't adequate and it was uncomfortably warm.

The flight from AMS back to ZRH was extremely comfortable because it was only about half full. Both flights were about 60 to 65 minutes, so the lack of IFE does not bother me.

On my return from Zurich to Barcelona I printed out my boarding pass at Zurich airport. Everything was fine. (Note: I had just left Zurich University Hospital after having a procedure there – which is why I paid to have a quiet seat at the front of the plane!). At the gate I was given another boarding pass - seat 25F – a horrible seat with no window – crowded at the middle / back of the plane. Reason: the plane had been ""reconfigured"" with a larger Business Class. The very unhelpful and arrogant staff told me I would have to apply to swiss.com for my refund. They gave me a moderately better seat a few seats further up from 25F just before take off. However, there was not one person seated in Business Class. Business Class was rows 1 through 13 in this reconfigured plane. My seat 5F was empty – as was every seat in rows 1 through 13.

Traveling with a family of 4 (2 adults, 1 toddler and one infant), we were all assigned seats in different rows, including our 3 year old sat 8 rows away from her parents! Flight crew made minimal effort to help us get reunited, despite the flight not being fully booked (my wife still had to sit separately with the baby so I could not support her during the flight). They also told my wife she could not breastfeed our baby on take off and that crying is good for them. Sorry to our fellow passengers as our baby screamed until the seatbelt sign went off.

There were some unaccompanied children seated next to me and the ground staff and the cabin crew really cared about them, made them small presents and wanted them to be happy all around. It was a joy to watch. The crew were outstandingly polyglot. Apart from the standard fluency in English, German and French you would expect from a Swiss crew, some crew members even had some competency in Spanish and Portuguese. The aircraft was very clean. There wasn't too much leg room, but it was sufficient. Though it was only a 55-minute flight, there were drinks and sandwiches served. The sandwiches were really tasty.

Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,3.0,August 2017,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,Hong Kong to Dublin via Zurich,1.0," |  Hong Kong to Dublin via Zurich. I took an eleven hour flight from Hong Kong to Zurich on August third, and as soon as the plane was in the air it was obvious something was wrong and we had to emergency land in Moscow for six hours. We were told we would be there for two hours, they did not give us another meal, they supplied soup only if you asked for it and not everybody knew to ask for it, they did however hand out chocolates and drinks which I appreciated -  but they would not let us off the plane for six hours.  We ended up on the flight for 21 hours, I missed my connecting flight, was put on a plane backw to Frankfurt and then a flight to Dublin four hours later. I should have been home by 4pm latest, I was home at 4am that night. On top of that, all they did to say sorry was give us a food voucher only usable in four variations of basically the same sandwich shop who wouldn't make you a new sandwich if you didn't like the ones on display. I will say the cabin crew were very friendly and seemed to be following protocol, and they made it easier to stick. The seats in economy were cramped and uncomfortable. The food was standard, they didn't sell snacks. The movie selection was alright, but you had to pay for wifi which annoys me.The flight to Hong Kong was fine, I had no qualms with it.

I will say they did have the best business class seats I have traveled in compared to most other carriers. Their flight crew was excellent. Now when it comes to their ability to be on-time.

Once the flight was cancelled, nobody seemed to care what happens to the passangers. We were left to figure things out on our own, standing in longest lines waiting for assistance. When my ticket was re-booked, it was re-booked with errors so that the other airline was not able to locate us in the system. I just kept running forth and back trying to figure out what are we supposed to do next. Nobody provided any food or drinks vouchers for passengers stranded for 7+ hours. We were re-booked without being asked about our preferred alternative arrangements. We ended up flying Alitalia which we would never have chosen to begin with, with their poorest chouce of drinks and no food which would be much appreciated after 6 wasted hours at Schiphol airport.

A330-300,Business Class,2.0,September 2017,2.0,5.0,3.0,no,Montreal to Zurich,2.0," |  Montreal to Zurich. Flight left on time from Montreal. The business class section is very large being a 2-2-2 configuration in two cabins. There are a few single seats so 1-2-2 in some rows. I had seat 10A, which was a single seat with two large storage compartments on each side. The seat was very narrow and when in the lie flat setting my feet hardly fit making for a very uncomfortable sleep (but I did have lots of useless storage space!). I think before an airline installs such seats the corporate executives need to sleep in them for a few nights. Service was very limited, as the flight seemed understaffed. I received my pre-flight drink, but nothing more was offered until dinner. There was no pre-dinner bar service or appetizer. Dinner, although the food was good it was bear bones, an basic entre, small salad and bread. Although I was served one glass of wine, it took a few tries to get a refill (one only). A small slice of cake was the sole dessert (they did come by and offered one small Swiss chocolate). Breakfast was basic, yogurt and bread. Overall the business class section is cramped with, in my opinion, narrow uncomfortable seats. Meal service was very basic. I know that some airlines are trying to limit costs but Swiss need to provide some service to justify the extra cost of the business cabin. Less airline accountants and more service and staff.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
A340,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Boston to Zurich,1.0," | This might go down as one of the worst airline experiences ever with respect to the horrendous attitude of a couple of the cabin crew, the quality of the seat, the quality of the entertainment system and the internal climate (i.e. incredibly hot) in the cabin. I couldn't rate an airline any worse. I used to fly Swiss all the time for work and it was always fine. That was a few years ago. Fast forward to today and you have a premier name flying a plane with some crew members that are actually worse than what I have experienced on Spirit Airlines. That is saying a lot for an airline that doesn't put itself out as a low cost or budget airline like Swiss. The only thing going for this travel experience was the punctuality. That is a plus. Everything else was an F minus or zero stars. And one flight crew member was 100% fantastic. The rest made this the most miserable flight ever. Other than punctuality and one nice member of the flight crew there were so many negatives (including members of the remaining flight crew) everything was negative. I hate to write such a harsh review but that is how this flight was. Bordered on ludicrous. We were 7 friends traveling together sitting in various parts of the aircraft.

A320 / CS100,Economy Class,2.0,September 2017,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,Geneva to Venice via Zurich,4.0," |  I fly several times a year with Swiss and they are fairly consistent: great aircraft, on time, unfriendly crew. I always make a point with this airline to greet each crew member, and see how many respond - nearly 100% this time but sometimes I was the one who initiated. Most convenient boarding gate in Geneva, short 30 minute hop to Zurich where they gave us a bottle of water and the signature chocolate just to remind you that you're not on easyJet (which is an effective marketing strategy). Smooth short transfer and boarding for another short 45 minute hop to Venice. Pretty bumpy for the whole flight which went straight over the Alps in stormy weather. Crew still managed to work quickly and serve everyone a drink - tea, coffee, wine, beer, soft drinks - which was impressive. No reassurance from the pilot about the turbulence though, and the cabin attendant only spoke German and English. When your selling point is that you're the national airline and you connect Geneva-based passengers through Zurich, it's inexcusable that you can't perform trolley service in French - all Swiss train conductors speak four languages and the competition - easyJet Switzerland - flies to Venice directly with French-speaking crew. (Ideally Italian would be offered as it's also a national language and this flight was to Italy - the pilot on the way back did make an Italian announcement but he was the only one. LH subsidiary Air Dolimiti attendants all speak EN DE FR IT, so this is possible). Delay in Venice waiting for steps - but this was well communicated. On the way back, we flew on their fancy new CS100 aircraft with Ferrari-esque interiors. That's all well and good but you need to turn on the air conditioning before passengers board (a regular issue with Swiss). A cabin attendant just stood next to my co-passenger and watched her struggle to put her bag in the overhead locker even after she was asked (in Swiss German) if she thought the duty free bag could go up there. (She responded with a ""yes"" and a look that said ""of course you can put your luggage in a the luggage bin"".) The CS100 has massive luggage bins which is great, but quite a few people hit their heads on them when disembarking - a little warning from the crew would be nice. In summary, service by the book without a smile in reliable clean, new aircraft. General lack of empathy and customer-centred service: don't expect anyone to help you if you have any problems.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

The original flight was at 9.40am and I reached the airport at 8.15am. At the time I was told the flight is overbooked so they are issuing my boarding pass wihout the seat no even though I arrived 90 minutes before departure. Then I went to the gate to get my seat confirmed and they told me that my flight has been 're booked without even asking me and my connecting flight from Zurich to New Delhi I will not be able to make it.  I pleaded with them as I had to reach India and catch a flight early morning to Bhopal as I had to attend a very important meeting. The staff did not listen to me and I asked them not to cancel my Zurich to New Delhi booking as I will book another flight to Zurich to catch it but they just did not comply as I had to reach there very urgently. They just gave me 70 ZL to last for 9hours. Now after a lot of debate when I was left with no other option i was asked to collect my checked in luggage from belt 5A.  I was standing in front of belt 5a waiting for my luggage for nearly 3hours to collect it and re check in. Finally I was able to pass time stranded on the airport with the 15USD given by Swiss as compensation which was of great help, and went to the check in counter of Qatar. My transit time in Doha, Qatar was 2 hours in order to catch the next flight to New Delhi. The Qatar flight got delayed for some technical reason and then I missed my connecting flight to New Delhi adding another torrential 18 hours at Doha.  There were three passengers including me who were booked to New Delhi via Zurich from Warsaw.  Now they are offering me a voucher of 13000INR which can be used on Swiss Air as a compensation without even feeling sorry or having the courtesy to call me or write to me. This they offered after 3 days when I got back and wrote to them. I was suppose to arrive in New Delhi on Saturday night but the flight landed on Monday. It was a 32 hour delay. I called Swiss from Doha asking them to rebook me to India on an earlier flight but they refused saying all other flights were booked. I then booked myself at my own cost on Indigo flight which was after 12hours as I had to get back in time. This is unprofessional behaviour from Swiss.",Business,3.0,nan

First impression was on the booking of seats: we have to pay to book some ‘premium’ seats on business class. Very surprising. However if you are lucky enough, you can get the good seats upon check in. The service was good, the ambiance was cozy. One thing which was a bit of an usual thing for me, was during the rest hours the lights in the cabin was actually pretty bright for my standard (compared say to AY, SQ and GA). Food was amazing, the airline brought local tastes every month, and the variety was also very good. There were about 3 courses for dinner, and that did not include the chocolates at the end. Cabin crews were friendly, however just to note, in my opinion it would also good to be recognized. Inflight entertainment was pretty OK - though I didnt like the fact we were ‘forced’ to watch the Swiss magazine in the beginning. There were WiFi connectivity - but in my opinion it was pretty pricey. I would recommend this airline due to the quality and the value for money.",Business,4.0,nan

On board experience was not bad for an 8hr night flight in a full economy cabin. Seats were reasonably comfortable, leg space – well – rather economic. IFE offered a large movie selection, including some very recent ones. A hot breakfast was served before landing. Really remarkable on this flight was the cabin crew who were exceptionally friendly and attentive. They managed to address many passengers by name (in economy) and gave us the feeling to be really welcome on board. ZRH to MUC was an uneventful 30-min hop.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

I had bought the ticket online, and then added the infant with full name and date of birth to the ticket later via telephone service. The telephone service had reassured me on 20 Oct that my row 40 was already reserved. When i checked in, i did not get a bassinet row nor a bassinet for my child, because i was told that the limit of bassinet was 8 months.  With the infant on my lap in a middle row of economy class, i could not eat as the table was not possible to be let down flat. The person before me could not lean her seat because it collided with my child's head.  Upon arrival in Singapore, i called Swiss Air to figure out how to get a child seat for my infant. I was told that i could not upgrade the ticket, and had to purchase a one way ticket for a child. I should also not give the real birthdate of the baby but enter a wrong year so that the child ticket could go through. It costed me EUR 630. I find this very strange practice to enter the wrong date of birth. It makes no sense to buy an infant ticket with Swiss Airlines for a child between 9 months and 2 years old. And since this is not anywhere well documented during the ticket purchase process, there will be mistaken parents. The stewardesses were sympathetic but not very helpful in my situation. The food was average. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

They were extremely friendly and went an extra mile to support my girls and myself during this flight. I am a nervous flyer and spending 3+ hours on the plane takes a lot out of me. When I came on board I said to 2 cabin crew that I am a bit scared and one of them gave me a hug and reassured that everything will be ok. Another staff spoke to me and told some stories about other people being scared and how they overcome their fear. They told me that they'll support me through and if I need anything they'll help. During the flight they came several times (especially during the turbulence) to reassure me that everything is ok and to explain things. They brought a few toys for my kids to play with, they offered a few drinks etc. Amazingly other cabin crews knew that I am worried on the plane and if they passed by they would ask if we are ok. I am so grateful to these people! I would strongly recommend Swiss Air just for its service.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

The cabin announcements were in many languages (Swiss German, Swiss French, Itialian and English). As far as entertainment, the screens that drop from the ceiling had a decent entertainment and I wasn't bored, although being into aviation may have played a part of that as it was mainly about swiss, if you didn't like flying you would probably find it boring. The magazine was great, very little adverts which was nice. All in all I would definitely recommend the airline and I congratulate Swiss on their professional and efficient, on time service on my flight to Italy today!

Snack service was strawberry ice cream and a tiny chocolate bar, so bring something of your own if you're not a sweet-tooth. Zurich to Newark was on an A330. Entertainment system worked fine, but there wasn't much worth watching. Meal, drink, and duty-free service were slow. Meal was fine, some kind of chicken, but there was no choice by the time they got to my row. After the meal service, getting an extra drink or snack was like pulling teeth. Crew not particularly friendly, rather robotic, and treated passengers as an inconvenience. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The meals were uninspiring with everything brought out on one tray except for the entree which was just a choice between chicken or beef. Amenity kit was barely anything and wines seemed cheap. The crew are robotic and seem thoroughly uninterested in taking care of passengers. Was scolded by a crew member for trying to use the toilet ""too close to landing"" which took place 40 minutes later. Even the purser was awful on both flights and seemed uninterested in taking part in any sort of device. Only positive was the both flights were on time and Lounge E in ZRH airport was nice.

Quick boardings, clean aircraft, smiling crews, reasonable snacks and drinks (wine/beers served for free). However a weird and new situation at airport baggage drop in Prague : I hold 2 Star-Alliance cards, from 2 different airlines: one with Gold status, on which I would not earn any miles on these flights, but I would be allowed to 46kg, the second one (basic status) awarding miles on these flights, but limited to 23kg, that I obviously used for my on-line check-in. I had more than 23kg. It is a common practice that in this case, my extra-weight is accepted when showing my Gold status on Star Alliance. It was not, for the first time in more than 10 years. Attendant cancelled my original check-in despite my protest, and registered me under Gold status without my agreement. I was not going to earn any miles.

I had only 40 minutes to change a plane in Zurich. However my night flight from Cairo was late 15 minutes in Cairo and also landed 15 minutes late, so boarding for next flight started before I left plane from Cairo. I was seating in the back so I was unable to take first bus. After all security and passport checking when I reached gate, stuff informed me that gate is closed and people coming by first bus reach gate successfully at the last moment. However, transfer desk moved me to next flight departing in next 5 hours, so no problem when I have lounge access. At least luggage won't be lost in Zurich. Next flight to Warsaw was late almost 1 hour. However, due to overbooked flight I got business class upgrade for this short flight, very nice.

I go the the airport, I drop my bag, I queue 40 minutes at the gate for security checks and, after that, I go to the duty free. While walking around, I look at the screen and notice that my flight to Zurich has been cancelled. I walk back to the metal detectors area and I ask what I should do. They give me instruction on how to exit the airport from the duty free area and they suggest I go back to the check in desks and ask for a new ticket. I exit a door and I find myself in the arrivals area. I walk around the airport and go back to the departures. I finally arrive to the check in desk and I ask for a new ticket. They guy puts me in the next flight with a 50 minutes connection time to run to the next flight. When he is about to print the new ticket, he asks me if I have any bag to check in. So I tell him that I have already checked in my bag before. He replies that I have to go back to the arrivals, walk to the Lost & Found Items office to get my bag and then go back to his desk. They are not only cancelling my flight but I also have to do their job in fixing the bag situation! I walk again all the way to the arrival, I go the office and they let me access to the luggage area. I get my bag and walk again to the check in desk. I finally get my new ticket, drop again the bag and I ask for an express pass because I have already queued for 40 minutes and I don't want to waste my time again. I ask for a special pass at the Zurich airport cause I have to go thru borders and I only have 50 minutes available. The guy refuses to do so because these privileges are only given to First Class passengers. After all this drama, I finally go on the plane and I understand why they have cancelled my flight. The plane was basically empty and they were flying passengers of 2 different flights. I arrive in Zurich, run to the second flight and I eventually arrive in Shanghai. When I get my bag I discover that it is broken. Arrives the day I have to fly back to Milano. Flight is at 9.50am and because it takes me 1 hour by car to get to the airport, I get up at 5 to get ready. At 5.30 I check my emails and I see 2 emails from Swiss that they sent me both at 4.20. First email: SWISS Flight Delay Information: LX189/11Dec2017 - Flight is delayed 2 hours Second email: Dear SWISS Customer. We regret to inform you that your original travel itinerary can no longer be granted due to an irregularity to one of your flights. Therefore we have rebooked you to another solution. I am sleepy and I don't understand what is going on so I try to call the customer service. Too early, and the China CC is still close. I try to call few European CC and I can't get thru. I decide to go to the airport and see what is going on. They put me on a Finnair flight from Shanghai to Milano via Helsinki.

I had the most coveted seat in Business Class cabin, 4A, the so-called 'throne seat.' These offer more privacy and more desk and storage space than the other seats. The 4A seat is also in the small, more cosy cabin just behind First Class. This flight was smooth and pleasant. Service was quick and efficient, with just the right touch of warmth. As I have said in an earlier review, there is a serious problem with the WiFi offering on Swiss: you pay for a product that provides virtually no value. To me the virtue of Swiss is its good on-time performance, its clean cabins and the fact that the Zurich airport is probably one of the handful of airports in Europe that are still pleasant and look First World.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0

Boeing 777-300,Business Class,4.0,November 2017,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,San Francisco to Mumbai via Zurich,5.0," | San Francisco to Mumbai via Zurich in Business Class on a B777-300. As a long time flyer on Swiss (and before that on the legendary Swissair), I have watched with dismay the slipping standards and the move towards mediocrity. On this particular flight I was lucky to get one of the coveted ""throne seats"" in Business Class (7A, in my case). These provide excellent privacy and comfort, but many of the other seats in Business Class are not as nice. Service was efficient and friendly and the flight overall was pleasant. The deterioration, however, is most discernible in the maintenance of the cabin. Although the aircraft was new (just over a year old) I went to the lavatory soon after boarding and saw the tap (see attached picture). This was rather shocking given the Swiss penchant for cleanliness. The grime built up on the tap appears to have not been addressed for weeks if not months. My other complaint concerns the WiFi product offered on Swiss which is a disgrace. The options come in MB packages and they are pitiful - my 120MB cost me CHF 39 and I could see the drain on my quota even when my iPhone was idle (I had turned off all background updates). Within minutes I exhausted my quota and I was doing basic operations such as checking email and sending text messages. I felt cheated out of 39 Swiss francs. Why doesn't Swiss offer the same plan as its parent Lufthansa, where you pay a flat fee and get wifi for the entire duration of the flight? Despite my reservations about Swiss, it still remains one of the better options for me.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0

One of the better carriers, although the competition is not really harsh as most carriers nowadays are low cost with full price. Check in in MUC was fine and uncomplicated, but security control was slow and chaotic. If some good soul wouldn't let me on priority lane I would have missed the flight. Specially because plane was leaving from satellite terminal what means a short drive by airport train. First leg was only 40min, so there is nothing what could go wrong, they even managed to give us drinks and chocolate. Lay over in ZRH was fine and visa control before boarding was well organized. Plane was an A320. Nothing special, shared IFE, but I had my laptop with me. Food service was well organized, food was quite innovative (quiche loraine), but being served in paper boxes ruined the general impression. After the meal there was a second drink service, so generally everything on acceptable level. In Moscow luggage service was smooth. Back to GVA on a brand new CSeries. Terrible airplane. Hard seats, IFE screens so small that were useless, some smart designer guy divided the net on the back of the sits in two parts, so you can not even put a book into it, forget about laptop or tablet. Level of service same as on inbound flight. A big mess on passport control in GVA. The airport is definitely not fitted to take so many flights out of Schengen area.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

During that time I wasn’t offered any drinks nor meals as EU Regulation 261/04 states. My new flight was supposed to depart Geneva on 13th at 17:55 hrs but it was delayed 45 minutes. So after arriving to Madrid more than 24 hrs later than what I was supposed to and missing one day of work, I wrote to the airline explaining to them the situation and asking them for compensation (250€ according to EU Regulation 261/04).

The design of the new business class is very appealing and modern. The seats are comfortable and are not arranged in this horrible V-angle as one has to endure in the Lufthansa planes. The crew was incredibly friendly and responsive. The food of very good quality and plenty. Between the meals the crew served continuously drinks, sweets and snacks. Food and soft drinks were also offered non-stop in the galley. I did not really use the inflight entertainment. In times of Netflix I cannot be bothered with such.

Business class was 30€ more so it was worth it. Swiss uses Lufthansa’s check in desks at Sofia Airport. There is no priority fast lane at Sofia. Went to the newly renovated Vitosha Lounge and spent there like an hour. I went to the gate and was shocked by how disorganised the boarding was. No priority boarding, as it says on the airline’s website. The plane was full (100 seats), as well as business class (6 seats; 1-2 layout). The overhead bins were very small, so there was not enough space for me to put my hand luggage. Water and towels were distributed to all the business class passengers. The plane took off on time. The meal was salmon, a piece of cake and some Swiss cheese on the side. Drinks were offered throughout the whole flight. Prior to landing, chocolate was given to everybody. We landed on time. There was a separate business class bus, that took us to the terminal very fast.

I missed my connection in Dubai and was told in order to fly on the next available flight I would have to be downgraded to Business Class. Swiss not offer any compensation for this but  wanted to charge me a 220 AED change fee for the downgrade! Somehow after the missed connection in DXB my baggage ended up in an inaccessible part of the airport and I did not get access to it until just before the downgraded LX flight was due to depart the next day. I checked my bag in with Swiss  at DXB without any problem. The inflight service in Business Class from DXB to MCT was fine, however, when I arrived in MCT at around 04:30 AM my checked bag did not! I spent the next frustrating 1.5 hours trying to fill out a baggage claim request. This involved multiple people trying to fill out the online form and at least 3 or 4 attempts where I had to repeat all my information and details every time. I was assured by the LX baggage handlers that the bag would be placed on the “next available flight” and provided them with all my local contact details. Over the next day while in Muscat, I, and the hotel operator and concierge repeatedly called multiple Swiss  numbers both in Dubai and Muscat and could not get through to anyone. I called Swiss  main number in Switzerland, informing them of the situation and was given other phone numbers which kept ringing but no one answered at the other end. At one point, I was told the most senior Swiss representative in Muscat was being e-mailed to call me immediately at my hotel and I am still waiting for that phone call. I e-mailed Swiss customer support online and have yet to hear back from anyone. My abbreviated stay in Muscat came to an end and I boarded my next flights that took me to the Seychelles, again with no access to my checked bag, toiletries and wearing the same clothes that I had when I started my trip in Toronto 4 days earlier. After arriving in the Seychelles, I noticed on the Swiss online baggage tracker that my bag was due to be delivered from Dubai to MCT on a flight that evening. After multiple exasperating phone calls, including to Swiss headquarters in Europe, I was finally able to redirect my bag to the Seychelles, not on the first available flight but to one 8 hours later. When the bag finally arrived at SEZ, it was eventually delivered to my hotel, however, I was asked to pay for the taxi charge from the airport. To summarize, Swiss Airlines First Class treatment is deplorable. They are happy to downgrade their customers with no offer of a refund and then have the gall to ask for a change fee. They lose your luggage and make no effort to reach out to you afterwards in a timely fashion. This has been the worst experience I have had with any airline.",Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0

Food was passable, not outstanding, it was quite limited (not possible to request more than one hot meal). Only 3 dishes offered (all Western, no Asian dishes offered): chicken, fish, and pasta – similar to e.g. economy class on Malaysia Airlines which I just had disembarked. Drinks supplied are normal for business class. I liked the two local Swiss beers served in original bottles. IFE very good. Beds narrow. Swiss lounges in ZRH were under repair except the one in concourse D. Acceptable lounge, got shower and drinks. Food was mediocre and cold.

The food and drinks offering is extremely limited in this latter lounge. Last but not least, it is obvious that no investments have been made there for at least the last 10 years. Cabin crew on the flight to Zurich was extremely friendly and helpful however not very competent. Food was just ok but very limited (e.g. no snacks anymore etc.). The business class seats in the A330 are very dated. My seat was extremely uncomfortable as the air seat cushion did not properly work anymore. It felt as if I was sleeping on the floor. Last but not least, cabin temperature was far too high. Whenever I am flying Swiss, they heat up the cabin as no other airline does it. Not sure there is any guidance for the cabin crews in that respect but it is extremely uncomfortable for the passengers if one is trying to sleep. The passenger next to me was also uncomfortable with the very high temperature as well. Overall, Swiss needs to work very hard to become a premium airline again.",Business,2.0,1.0

My flight was postponed from 10:30 PM on Sunday September 3th to Monday morning 9:00 AM September 4th, without any further announcement, until 30 minutes prior to anticipated departure in Zurich. With a delay of 10 hours and losing a full working day in Johannesburg, you might think Swiss is willing to compensate as per the European rules. However after an official claim you are simply told Swiss is not following these rules and hence you do not have any right to any compensation whatsoever. Great customer satisfaction! Both very poor communication and a third rank airline compensation strategy. I like the Swiss, but will avoid flying with them.",Business,1.0,nan

MIA airport is slight chaotic, though reasonably smooth check-in and security. Lounge shared with Avianca, it was busy and limited choice of food - not very relaxing, though comfortable and functional. Flight was great! As only five seats in a row, felt quite spacious for business class - a full size seat width right down to your feet. Seat also very comfortable - had what felt like a gel type cushion that you sat on. Slept for 5 hours with no problem - not often I've done that! Great screen - high resolution. Good quality dining - though flimsy trays that FA had to reach over by husband to retrieve. FAs friendly, though required a little prompting. Overall a great long-haul product. Lounge in ZRH, a bit small, though comfortable. Short haul flight okay, catering rather odd and I eat most things.

Boeing 777-300ER / A321,Business Class,5.0,January 2018,5.0,5.0,3.0,yes,Bangkok to London via Zurich,4.0," |  Bangkok to London via Zurich. I found a very cheap business class ticket with them. Before flying, I talked to their twitter account many times. The people who are responding are very fast, polite and informative people. I checked in online to be able to select a throne seat free of charge, and got a throne seat on the right hand Side of the plane. I arrived at the airport to be checked in very quickly by a polite trainee. I was told I could use any star alliance carrier lounge in Suvarnabhumi Airport, so I decided to use the Singapore airlines lounge. It was a newly renovated lounge with comfortable seating areas and heaps of food! One gesture I really appreciate Swiss for is the fact that they have a designated waiting area for First, Business and Gold card members at the boarding gate. Upon boarding, I'm greeted by a flight attendant who takes my coat, and champagne. I find the seat to be slightly narrow, especially at the foot portion, however I was able to sleep sideways. There is heaps of storage available everywhere. I would pay for this seat again if the price was a little less expensive (maybe $100 max). The flight attendants on this flight serving the business class section was mostly Thai crew, with the rest french-speaking Swiss crew. They were all engaging, polite and eager to help. The menu was presented with a choice of two starters and four main courses. I had a fish starter and a fish entree. The dessert tasted great, and there was a snack service during the flight, and another meal service before landing. I had a pasta with chicken and that was very good as well. The entertainment system was pretty poor, but was enough to keep me entertained. After landing in Zürich, I went to the Swiss lounge which had snacks and soup. I discovered I didn't get my Royal Orchid Plus number quoted in my boarding pass, and the lounge attendant was able to help me put in the number for my card. Boarding the A321 to London would've been chaotic without priority boarding, and the boarding process took long. The business class on short haul is horrible the empty middle seat made me feel like I was flying economy.  On this flight, there was a beef tartare served. It was very nice, and the condiments accompanying it as well. In conclusion, Swiss is a nice airline for long haul, but terrible for short haul.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,March 2018,4.0,3.0,3.0,no,Miami to Moscow via Zurich,3.0," | Miami to Moscow via Zurich. I frequently fly Star Alliance, especially United and Avianca. Very happy with the quality and service with these carriers. Recently I flew 2 times with SWISS, from Miami to Rome via Zurich and from Miami to Moscow via Zurich. The business flight to and from Rome was pleasant and as expected. The issue is with the accreditation of miles, that still is not showing up in the Avianca LifeMiles account, even if all the data are correct and the boarding pass presented the correct number. With all the other alliance airlines the accreditation is very quick, and that is important because the accreditation may lead to the next level of membership so one may end up having flown miles and segments and not being recognized just because SWISS is not diligent with accrediting. The other situation was with a flight from Miami to Moscow that I had to cancel, and was told that all the ticket would be gone lost, beside the taxes. Of course that was part of the contract's small print but still this is unfair that a vendor takes and keeps the money for a service that was not rendered. Other star alliance airlines' experience with canceling reservations (no matter what category of ticket) was that one can use the amount paid for the ticket for rebooking other flights, paying a penalty and fare difference, of course! SWISS is an OK airline but quite frankly not up to standard with other Star Alliance airlines in fact of caring about frequent flyers and cancellation policies. WIFI is incredibly expensive and not intuitive to use: so don't! So if you plan to fly with them make sure you are armed with patience and not needing any change in your schedule or need WIFI: SWISS is bad on all these issues.",Business,2.0,1.0

My original flight was cancelled a day prior which gave me time to figure alternatives. Swiss switched my flight 4 Times for me. With no extra payment, easy, no hassle and I did not pay for an insurance like other cheap airlines I have flown with. Their staff was quick on the phone, happy to work with me, and I know I will be booking them in the future. Unfortunately I needed to get to London for a conference so the next day option did not work and I had to entirely switch airlines.

Young purser on ZRH-BRU went out of her way in sharp contrast with her male colleagues on ZRH-BKK vv which paid hardly any attention to their premium pax. Bags first on belt.

More like an economy meal. Very substandard Lounges in ZRH under refurbishment and alternative is a joke. Staff from/to BKK rather cool except 1 lady on return. Swiss has 4 Thai staff members on this flight but there are hardly any Thai pax at all on board. Guess its only about savings. Swiss own staff on board not very friendly very distant. IFE very limited/poor selection/amenity kit substandard. Limited after dinner drinks and only 1 dessert option (cheese is already on tray).

Then, again in its infinite wisdom, thought it best to kick a family of four (mine) with two kids under four off the flight. They refused to let us wait for the next flight (5 hours later) in the lounge. So we waited 5 hours in GVA while the kids ran out of steam and drained all their parents' energy. Then they wouldn't let me take our fold up buggy, which fits in the overhead and they allowed on the flight to GVA, on the plane because they apparently changed policy mid week. Ridiculous experience. Kicking a young family off a plane because you over booked it is irresponsible. We flew at 8.50pm, well after their bedtime. They were terrors and they are usually great (because we plan ahead and book flights around their sleep schedules). Truly a worst in class airline.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

The check-in staff was simply terrible rude and despicable; absolutely unhelpful. I was flying from Amsterdam with one backpack and one carry on luggage. The woman at the check-in was trying every possible way to stop me from bringing my bags onto the flight claiming the flight was full. While I tried to balance the weight between my backpack and luggage to fit the weight limit and explained I had no problem bringing both onto the flights flew from HK on Swiss. In a rude and furious manner, the woman answered, ""I work for Swiss, are you telling me how to my job?"" After negotiation and I finally gave in, re-packed and ready to check in my luggage, I asked her what would be the compensation if I lost my luggage, as this had happened to me before (even though not with Swiss Air), and that's why I was reluctant to check my bags if not necessary. And, with the same mean and resentful tone, she answered, ""This is at your own risk. So do you want to check it in or not?"" Understanding she might have to deal with these situations often at the airport, and it can be frustrating. Yet, her unpleasant personality and appalling attitude towards passengers won't help with the situation.

Some seats are especially uncomfortable because of an IFE electronics box under the seat in front. I knew about this prior when booking and to avoid such a seat I paid 60CHF extra for a seat reservation. During the reservation process the cabin's seating map is shown where seats with such an IFE box in the legroom are marked. I chose a seat without IFE box, however, after boarding I had to realize that there was such a box. I called for the purser to address the issue, it took her 2 hours to come - brilliant work ethics were shown there.

However, Swiss is terrible at baggage handling and customer service.  The flight from FCO to ZRH was delayed about an hour & 10 minutes. Unfortunately, this meant we wouldn't catch our flight from ZRH to EWR as that flight was scheduled to depart five minutes before we arrived. My dad called Swiss who explained that they would provide us a voucher for a hotel near the Zurich airport and that they would make room on United 135 that would depart the next morning. Fast-forward to about fifteen minutes before we landed in Zurich, the flight attendants announce that our flight to EWR was delayed! In the jetbridge, we met a guy who thought there was a 40% chance that our bags would make it to our delayed connection. He then took us across the apron (where planes are parked) in an airport van to a secret security booth; he could not have been nicer, by the way. We made it to our flight and flew home to Newark, which was a pleasant flight. When we got to the luggage claim, none of our bags showed up because Swiss doesn't scan the barcodes on the bags. Luckily, the airport informed us that our bags would be on the flight the next day, that our bags would be delivered to our house, and that they would call us when the bags arrived. Under 36 hours later, we got a call at 05:17 (am) that our bags were waiting for us outside.
