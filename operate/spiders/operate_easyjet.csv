We would like to extend our thanks and appreciation to easyJet staff at Bristol airport for their outstanding help and support on  22nd December 2017. Under extremely difficult conditions they acted in a professional, friendly and efficient manner. Although we suffered extra expenses as a result of the cancellation we understand that easyJet is not responsible for the delays and any way because of the stress we failed to retain receipts.

A319,Economy Class,5.0,December 2017,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Geneva to Birmingham,5.0," |  Geneva to Birmingham. The cabin crew were very friendly. I am tall at 6'7"" and struggled to fit into the standard sized seats. A member of the cabin crew allowed the three of us to move to the front three extra legroom seats as they were empty. This was free of charge and throughout the journey he and the rest of the cabin crew were very friendly and helpful! Many thanks easyJet for your customer service on this flight!",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

Let us fly with a handbag and small suitcase on the way there but not on the way back to Manchester? If that is going to be applied, it needs to be applied both ways! Not only this, two hour delays on the way there. Have to admit the staff on the aircraft were very friendly. Never again though, will use another airline. First time used and worse time ever!",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan
A320/A319,Economy Class,5.0,December 2017,nan,5.0,nan,yes,London Gatwick to Southampton via Geneva,5.0, | I flew London Gatwick to Geneva and returned to Southampton. The flight to Geneva was almost full and arrived 10 minutes early. I had an emergency exit seat with nobody next to me which was handy. The Southampton flight was the first every Easyjet flight to that airport and we were met my the traditional water salute from the fire service. Only about 30 passengers on board. Crews fine on both flights. I did not make any purchases.,Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,2.0,December 2017,1.0,4.0,nan,yes,Lisbon to Luton,4.0," | Flight was delayed last minute due to a police intervention, as a group of passengers had to be removed and arrested. The crew handled this very professionally and did all security checks quickly so we could take off as soon as possible. But once we were airborne, the inflight service was another story: Once they started the food and beverage service, cabin crew constantly had to go back and forth to the galley to get foods or drinks. It took them ages to give passengers what they requested, process payments and reach the next row. They also seemed not to bother about this. I was very annoyed as I just wanted a bottle of water and had to wait for more than 45 minutes until they finally reached my row. This is usually faster with their main competitor. Also, I find it outrageous that Easyjet uses an ""old"" GBP/EUR exchange rate. GBP 1.80 is definitely not 2.50 EUR at the moment! I think Easyjet crews are usually very professional but they should be overall more dynamic. Other than that, plane was tidy and in all comfortable for the low cost standard.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

My travel partner was reimbursed for hotel cost due to a cancelled flight, the correspondence clearly stated ""we are sorry for the cancellation of your flight."" Yet I am being refused compensation for the flight (I paid for our flight) and the cost of the rental car and dinner to get us to our destination. We could not have made the next day flight and still made our connecting flight from Geneva to London, so we rented a car and drove overnight. How is it that she is being reimbursed but I am not? We were both scheduled on the same flight and she paid for our hotel stay. How many different customer service agents do I have to correspond with until I can speak to someone?

The airplane was already ready to leave, doors were shut and stairs were taken away, but they guys managed to get me on board.

It was originally delayed for 40mins due to weather and then a further 2.5 hours due to a technical issue. This was a major inconvenience for all on board, including the flight crew. The flight crew and Cabin crew were outstanding in their approach and interaction with passengers. They made a 2 hour sit in the plane very comfortable. I would like to thank them for their efforts yesterday. I realise that I am entitled to a refund for the delay over 3hrs but I do not wish to take this. ",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,December 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Athens to Manchester,1.0," |  Athens to Manchester. Seems standard after reading some reviews here. They stopped me at the gate and charged me 60 Euros for an 'oversize' bag that I've taken on a few dozen other flights with no trouble. Third slot has some metal bars at the top that shrink what you can put in by a cm or two and they know it. Never flying with them again, no matter what their price.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,4.0,November 2017,nan,4.0,nan,yes,Liverpool to Palma de Mallorca,4.0," | After two recent flights with Ryanair, it was a relief to be flying with easyJet again. We paid just under £100 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a long weekend. Both the outward and return flights were uneventful. We left on time and arrived early in each case. Boarding was handled smoothly and the cabin crews carried out their duties quietly and efficiently. There was none of the anxiety associated with Ryanair of infringing some new rule or having our flights cancelled at the last minute. We know all the ""dos and don'ts"" of flying with easyJet and the airline is always our first choice, if possible.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,5.0,January 2018,nan,5.0,nan,yes,Liverpool to Palma de Mallorca,4.0," | Another very good trip with easyJet. Both at Liverpool and Palma boarding was organised efficiently and promptly, with Speedy Boarders first on and off the transfer buses. Cabin crews worked hard and the pilots kept us informed of progress. Both flights landed early. Any problems which arose were caused by those passengers who think that rules or requests are for others, not themselves, and in the process make things more difficult for both staff and their fellow passengers. We had the usual suspects ignoring the repeated advice not to put small items in the overhead lockers, so that cabin crews then spent time tactfully trying to rearrange items to allow more trundle bags to be accommodated. On the outward journey a group wearing the kit of ""UK cycle team"" were talking so loudly during the safety briefing that one of the stewardesses actually shouted ""Please pay attention"". On the return journey one of the first passengers to board at the rear of the plane then proceeded to put her bag down in the aisle to open it and take out various items, completely oblivious of the queue held up behind her. I wouldn't mind betting that such people would be the first to complain about poor service or inconsiderate staff.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,5.0,November 2017,nan,5.0,nan,yes,Funchal to Lisbon,4.0," | Flew Funchal to Lisbon. It is always a breeze flying with easyJet, departures and arrivals are on schedule, the cabin crew are very professional and its product is very trustworthy. Many flag companies could learn from them. They are market aware and don't charge you any more or less than what they actually and ultimately deliver to you. A highly recommended low cost company.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,January 2018,4.0,1.0,nan,no,Bristol to Newcastle,4.0," | So when I arrived at Bristol airport I realised that my hand luggage was slightly oversized purely due to the wheels (my fault but I have used it to fly with easyJet as hand luggage before and for Jet2 as well). I queued up to speak to someone about what to do and she took a few minutes to decide but after seeing my case wouldn't fit in the example box she said not to worry, that it was ok and charged me £5 instead of £47. There were a family who were infront of us who were 70 kilos over or weighed 70 kilos so had to cough up £70 there and then, so it was like they were picking and choosing who they would charge and what. Anyway, I was so relieved and happy, got on the plane all the cabin staff were really polite, helpful, friendly and the flight was fine. However on the way home, we arrived at the airport 2 hours early, all checked in online before hand too, we went to the gate on time to get ready to board but there was a huge queue so we walked 1 minute down the airport to a loo quickly. When we got back we were at the front of the queue and there were 2 girls who were meant to check our boarding passes/ID and before even saying hello or waiting for the person infront of me to walk onwards one of the girls shouted 'can you check that case, that looks massive' then looked up and me and said 'that's going to be £47, not even a hello or a please'. I obviously said how it was okay on the way and how I'd used it before with easyJet and Jet2 and she actually said 'well you havent' and I said well I have! Was ridiculous! Then they tried to tell us we were late, when we'd been waiting for 2 hours, so rude. Anyway after looking me and my friend up and down in a judgemental rude way I told them how I don't have the money and that I think it's ridiculous I could fly with it as hand luggage for £5 on the way and now they're wanting £47! At this point everyone had boarded the plane and we were told we were about to miss it, I had to make a quick call to my gran to borrow the money as the hotel we stayed in had taken a huge deposit too and I wasn't getting that back until a few days after we left, and after typing the card details wrong 4 times into her computer the rude girl finally charged me £47 and we had to sprint to the plane. They were so rude and didn't even say hello, please or thank you at any point and set completely different rules as we had on the way. So annoyed and appalled at the rude and unfair staff. After all that the flight back was fine, just dissapointed really. Airport experience with easy jet there was 10/10, easyJet airport experience return 0/10.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Gatwick to Athens,2.0," | Gatwick to Athens. Once we got to the gate a flight attendant told us that we could not board the plane because we had 2 pieces of luggage (1 hand luggage and 1 small laptop case) and both of them were oversized. Then she explained that some policies had'changed and we do not meet the criteria or had accepted the new policies that had been sent to our email. Then we were ask to combine our luggage into 1, even though they were oversized, after 20 minutes of us trying to fit a laptop case into a very small hand-luggage, she told us that we could now board to the flight, but we had to give our hand-luggage to be stored at the bottom of the aircraft. Another 5 minutes till we had placed our luggage and we were told to follow a 'nice', ground staff, so we could hand-in our baggage and board from the back. (We were supposed to be seated at the 2nd row).",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

We had return flights booked to Amsterdam leaving at 06.45 on 3rd January and on 2nd January at 7pm we receive a text to inform us that our flight is now cancelled and with no real reason to why. We’ve now had to spend more money on other flights from a further away airport costing us more in time and money, and at a later time when we had all travel arrangements sorted, I’m not happy.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,nan,December 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Madrid to Gatwick,1.0," |  The four flights we took with easyjet were pretty horrible. All our flights were delayed to some technical difficulties. If you plan checking in a bag the fees on Iberia and BA are cheaper. easyJet check customers carry on to make sure it fits in the measuring box, if it doesn't be ready to pay a fee. At boarding there were no boarding groups so everyone just lines up. They don't use a jet bridge. The planes were all fairly new A321, 320 which were fine I suppose you really feel the pinch when sitting down and realizing the seat is tiny. On the flight you have a choice to buy the usual drinks and food. In all my experience was quite terrible, I will never take an easyJet flight again.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,3.0,December 2017,3.0,3.0,nan,yes,Gatwick to Copenhagen,3.0," | I now avoid British Airways under Alex Cruz and this is the first time I have flown EasyJet to Copenhagen. It was broadly comparable in comfort and service, while being significantly cheaper. I'd also choose over Ryanair as the aircraft interior is less garish and there are fewer annoying announcements.",Business,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,December 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Belfast to Gatwick,3.0," |  Belfast to Gatwick. Very unprofessional staff. Before boarding the flight at the airport gate, the member of staff checking passengers in kept coughing not really covering her mouth, then handled passports and boarding passes/mobile phones with e-tickets, without using sanitizer, it felt very unhygeinic. The air hostess doing the safety demonstration burst out laughing along with the cabin manager while doing the safety demonstration, the cabin manager then hid behind a screen to avoid been seen laughing. They safety demonstration was disrupted and not completed. The staff snacked on sweets throughout the flight making announcements with a mouthful of sweets sometimes. My bag had to be moved to the overhead compartment to which the cabin manager muttered 'God not this again' before moving my bag above. The flight was also 50min delayed to which the captain said 'sorry for being a few minutes late', didn't seem to realise that 50mins late can be very disruptive for passengers.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,December 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Luton to Inverness,nan," |  Luton to Inverness. I arrived at the Luton airport at 5:50am for my 6:55am flight, which should give me plenty of time to do the check-in and security process. But the Easyjet employee at the check-in desk just printed my boarding pass wrong (only had half the barcode on it), I couldn't get through the entry gate. Therefore, I was sent back and forth between the entry gate and the check-in desk. That wrong boarding pass thing wasted me a lot of time. So not surprisingly, I missed my flight. When I spoke to one of their employees try to get my flight re-scheduled, he told me that my boarding pass was re-printed at 6:13, the gate closure was at 6:40, SO I should have made the flight. Well, I was wondering how he thought 27 mins would be enough for me to get through all the people lined up there at the security check, Not to mention that I could have plenty of time if they just didn't print my boarding pass wrong! Also he told I have to pay extra 80 pounds for a tomorrow's flight! That's outrageous, I haven't yet even asked them to refund my waste of time and my ruined trip. I had no choice but paid them the 80 pounds for the next flight. I've filed the claim on their website, hopefully I can get my refund and cover my extra day of hotel expense. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Due to circumstances we arrived very late at the airport. If easyet would have sticked to their rules we wouldn't be allowed to board, but we were luck. We made the flight and the way we were welcomed on board was fantastic. Also the ground crew were great. The flight itself was good.

The seat was comfortable with adequate leg room for the 4 hour journey. In-flight service was friendly and efficient and the information from the cockpit was first class. Both sectors were punctual. The food and drinks served were tasty and reasonably priced. I was very impressed overall.,Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,February 2018,nan,4.0,nan,yes,London Southend to Malta ,4.0," | easyJet is is easily the best short-haul airline within Europe, especially as BA has cut inglight amenities without reducing their prices. We had an effortless journey from London Southend to Malta - the plane was clean and the seats comfortable enough for short journey. However it was the staff that made the difference, my partner left some duty-free a gift for his nephew in the terminal, he was a bit upset, but the cabin crew co-ordinating with the excellent and helpful Stobart Aviation ground staff managed to track it down in albeit a small terminal and retrieve it for him. This felt above and beyond and certainly more than I would have expected from an LCC. Both flights were uneventful, and we landed early on both occasions including a full 45 minute ahead of schedule on the return journey. If I was to be really picky, I would say the boarding experience could be better planned from Southend as it means standing in a cold although sheltered caged area for sometime before being allowed on to the plane and then having to go out in the open as there are no air-bridges at Southend Airport.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The flight was delayed for over an hour but I was happy to find out that I was flying on the new A320 NEO. The cabin looks exactly like the older version of the A320, however there is almost no engine noise, which made this flight one of the most pleasant flights I've had over the last years.

The flight from London to Munich was completely full and it’s not particularly used for business traveling. Everyone is bringing a carry on bag and the EasyJet staff are very strict about their regulations (you get what you pay), they check it at the gate. The seats are quite narrow, but I’d say for short distance flights it’s ok. Also the staff seems to be pretty young.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0
A340,Economy Class,1.0,August 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Manchester to Santorini,2.0," | Flew Manchester to Santorini. Simply put this was the worst service I have ever encountered when flying. When waiting to go home (in the hot sun with a 3 year old) we had to wait in excess of 3 hours while the airport authorities tried to get 37 volunteers not to fly. No reason, no explanation was given. Chaos ensued. No representative from the airline was present, instead, the airline left the announcement and the dealing with how to sort out frustrated, tired, ill, and angry passengers. The airport staff were poorly behaved, rude, threatening both physically and with the police. Apparently, after boarding (eventually) we were told that a member of the crew had fallen ill. This, according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. Problems occur, yes. But the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. Compensation was offered for volunteers. But, no guarantee of a flight back within a week was given. So compensation meant nothing. Those who did choose compensation had real difficulties getting back to their connecting airports. The compensation did not cover, car parking, food, hotel accommodation etc., loss of earnings, connecting flights. easyJet simply did not handle this very well. It appears this is frequent occurrence. The airport staff told us too! I shall not fly with easyJet again. Simply put, they did not care about their customers. Proof - no apology, no announcements, and they did not have one of their staff step off the plane to come and explain. This would have helped a lot. No food or drinks on the return flight too! Rubbish. Makes Ryanair look like one of the best services!",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
Not relevant,Economy Class,1.0,February 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Liverpool to Madrid,1.0," |  Liverpool to Madrid. Our last experience with Easyjet has been appalling. We got our tickets a month ago but when trying to check in the night before the flight, it turned out that there are no seats left on the plane for us! We arrived super early on the day and were told that easyjet oversells the seats and that we were 'standby passangers'. We had to wait for everyone to board and for the crew to check if anyone did not arrive, leaving empty seats (empty, but paid for!). Stressing over not getting there for a close relative's birthday, the money lost that we paid for the hotel, wasted holiday day booked off work are just the beginning of it. People must know that when they think they are getting seats on the plane, they are only really getting a possibility of a seat. We were absolutely appalled with the fact that the company got paid twice for our seats (my wife sat in the place of someone who did not travel due to serious sickness discovered very recently, as his friends told her and both her and the friends of that person were disgusted that easyjet would not accept refunds but will happily pass that seat to someone else who paid the same money and should have their own seat). We don't understand why getting the ticket and seat is not treated a contract, but instead easyjet 'has the right' to cancel it last minute and tell you that you are not going on the plane for which you bought the ticket, not due to weather or technical problems but as a result of their greed. What a terrible example of customer service! It's unbelievable in 21st century and it has to change or we should all change the airline we use.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,August 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Munich to Luton,4.0," |  Munich to Luton in August 2017. Weexperienced an overnight delay which resulted in a cancellation due to lightning strike, a new aircraft was flown from Italy to fly us back to Luton. There was one ground staff dealing with departures and arrivals at Munich airport, so as you can imagine, passengers had no idea what was going on and when we would be flying, or where we would be staying over night. The second flight was delayed by a further 5 hours 44 minutes due to technical issues (confirmed in an email). According to the EU Regulation 261/2004, we were entitled to €250 per passenger due to the delay being over three hours. It took over 4 compensation claim forms for easyJet to even respond, even then saying that we were eligible for compensation and that the money would be in our account within 15 days, it wasn’t. Phoned easyJet to get an update and see what was happening. We were then told that the second flight was delayed further due to the lightning strike. Having been in contact with some passengers on the same flight, many had already received the compensation and so I proceeded to explain this to them. He then apologised and said it was an error, and the money would be in the account within 21 day, it wasn’t. Again phoned customer service to be updated, in which I was told that the second flight was a ‘gifted free transfer’, and so compensation could not be claimed. I proceeded to explain that we had been told twice previous that we would receive the compensation. I was told this was by error and that we would not be receiving anything. I then phoned back to finally resolve the issue, and having spoken to her line manager, out of courtesy we would be transferred the compensation. Whether or not we will actually receive it this time I don’t know. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,4.0,December 2017,4.0,5.0,nan,yes,Geneva to Birmingham,3.0," |  Geneva to Birmingham, For a low-cost airline (given their reputation), this experience was alright. They allowed a great deal of luggage weight, for a price mind. They even offered us the chance to put our wheeled hand luggage items (of which there were many) in the hold, which was a nice touch. An even better touch was offering FREE in-flight WiFi on the return flight, although that limits you to their own website in partnership with Rakuten, so I wouldn't bother with doing anything else. Overall, this was one of the better low-cost airlines I've flown, really great value for money.",Family Leisure,5.0,3.0

Since it was only 10kg. And said to start with, we did not want the baggage because we could easily bring it in a bag. And they said we could do the same from Basel. But they were against it and would have to pay 47 euros. If we had the bag from Hamburg we did not have that problem at all. Now we left our luggage here and took things in a bag. It was a little bit bigger than cabin luggage. And less than 10kg. Also they would have 47euro. We had no handbag on the trip.",Business,1.0,nan

Unfortunately I did not realise that my son who is 4 years old was allocated a seat separated from me from the aisle. Once there, I asked the steward if there was anything he could do, since my son starting crying and was refusing to sit next to a stranger and fasten his belt. The steward told me that if I wanted that I should have checked in a month in advance (!) or pay extra! He added that the law allows them to separate the children! Well if there is any law that allows that it should clearly be changed! Thankfully other passengers offered their place and we managed to sit close, but I found this very upsetting and the steward's answer unhelpful. On our way back, at the boarding point families with young children were offered to board with priority, but then they ask us to pay extra to sit close to our children? Is this what EasyJet considers as family care? Or in our society you need to pay for everything! On their website they advertise their service where by paying you can sit close to the people you care most, and the motto is""easyjet generation"". Appaling!",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Most easyJet-flights from Milan depart form Malpensa, 50 kms north of town, but some flights, like mine, use the much closer Linate. The boarding started early and was only delayed by late passengers. The very friendly Dutch crew was efficient. Good information from the cockpit, announcements in English, Dutch and Italian and reasonably priced drinks. Legroom so-so, but that's the LCC-style. Landed 15 mins ahead of schedule in Amsterdam.

I booked a flight from Catania to Naples and was very pleased with the efficient bag-drop and friendly and helpful ground staff. Boarding was slightly delayed as two blind passengers needed assistance. I noted though that only one staff member went out of his way to help the blind passengers. Far too much hand-luggage was allowed aboard the flight and it was a concern that the cockpit door was left open for quite some time as the pilot chatted with various people. I bought a drink and the cabin crew member walked away without rendering the change. I had to call one of his colleagues and even then I was given the wrong change and had to challenge it. No apology was received. Disembarkation was quite well managed and the although there was a 40 min delay it was acceptable.

They said bad weather was the cause, other flights managed to land though so this wasn’t the case, we then waited in another line for 6 hours whilst 600 people were being seen by 1 member of staff, who after getting to the help desk denied working for the airline and said she’d didnt have information for us an we should request a refund (please never do this as they aren’t liable for client care ie no money for hotels or new flight). They couldn’t put us on a flight until a week later which was past the date we flew home, we booked into a hotel for two nights after already paying in Madeira, the next flight was $500 more, after contacting them their response was the same as the help desk, no refund will be given nor will they help with accommodations, 20 of us in the same situation all receiving this outrageous information.

On departure from Tel Aviv I was crammed into an Airport shuttle bus to take me to the plane.  My seat location on the aircraft meant that I was pushed into by crew and other passengers. On arrival at Luton I found out that they had lost their bag. No apology from easyJet whatsoever. Ground staff took their time to file a report and I used £5 of mobile phone to liase with my brother for pick up because of the mess. After six days into the trip I still don't know where my bag is or when I will get it back. Thumbs down to this unprofessional and incompetent airline.,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

A320,Economy Class,5.0,March 2018,4.0,4.0,nan,yes,Liverpool to Larnaca,4.0," |  Liverpool to Larnaca. I think that our recent experience clearly illustrates the difference companies like easyJet have made as far as foreign travel is concerned: we have just had a very enjoyable week’s holiday in Cyprus for less than it cost for just the flights on our first visit there over 30 years ago. On that occasion we were going to stay with friends and to reach Cyprus as “cheaply” as possible we had to drive to Heathrow, stay overnight and then travel via Budapest with a seven-hours’ layover in the airport there. Last week we had an hour’s drive to Liverpool and direct flights for two of us for a total of just over £140! We were not sure how we would cope with flights lasting 5 hours each way, as we normally restrict ourselves to 3 hours or less, but we equipped ourselves with plenty to occupy the time and the journeys were relatively painless. Both flights departed and arrived pretty promptly, cabin staff worked hard and efficiently without going over the top and the cockpit crews kept us informed. The plane on the outward journey had the new-style seats which we do not find particularly supportive though they were tolerable, but we were more comfortable on the return flight with the older, more thickly padded seats. Possibly the boarding procedure could have been handled better at Larnaca, but that might have been dictated by the airport rather than easyJet staff. One thing in particular struck me: the totally calm atmosphere on both flights – everyone seemed to be engrossed in or by whatever entertainment they had brought with them to pass the time, an indication perhaps that most clients know what to expect on an easyJet flight and are content with easyJet services, even if they do not bother to say so.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

I did so in 30 seconds and went back to him letting him know I had done this showing him receipt proof. He said I still needed to stand in the customer service line and get confirmation from them. I went back to the line and finally after 1 hour of waiting all he did was print a reciept that I already had on my phone. Finally when I got back to the check in counter they told me check in was closed and that I couldn’t get a refund and they wouldn’t put me on another flight. Later I checked my original baggage package I had purchased and I did not get the sports equipment package. I should’ve been put through the first time and let on my flight. They made me wait 2 hours total, pay additional money for a luggage package that was correct in the first place and waste 226 euros and most importantly made us lose our day in Rome and the hotel that we had already paid for.

Like a lot of other morning flights, EasyJet's flight was also cancelled due to the issues at the airport. The next available flight was 2 days later as all other flights were booked out due to the cancellations. While I was really frustrated with the situation, EasyJet did all they could to ensure our 2 extra days in Amsterdam were comfortable.

At least 15 people were not allowed on this flight and told the next flight would be the next afternoon.

There is what we call Budget, and there is Cattle Class! This was cattle class. It was also £70 more for the same destination than Lufthansa, which my daughter tells me had more leg room and drinks were included.

This is a warning, if you are flying EasyJet be aware that they may offload your hold baggage if the aircraft is allegedly overweight.

When told your bags are on the next flight and will be delivered to you that night  be aware that this means possibly the next day. If you have hand luggage, pack a spare set of clothing if possible. We departed Gatwick yesterday after being delayed an hour, before takeoff we were informed a couple of bags had been taken off due to the plane being overweight. On arrival at Faro airport we discover half of the passengers bags have been offloaded. Although easyJet knew this was happening before we took off there was no representative at arrivals who could help.

It would have been great to turn on the AC while we waited doors closed on the tarmac and to make at least some announcements. I did reserve a seat in the emergency exit row (window) and had speedy boarding. Even the emergency exit row was narrow and I felt cramped, it may have slightly more legspace but it is still not good. Furthermore, since everybody else boarded when the speedy boarding announcement was made this is no advantage. As expected no free drinks/water/food during the flight. No weight restrictions on hand luggage, though. Verdict: Not enough space. Will try to avoid EasyJet in the future.

I realised that the outbound flight was very tight and tried to change it but found that it was cheaper to book a second flight giving me the option of two - illogical but no more so than some railway journeys. The easyJet product is basic but acceptable - the aircraft was clean and the cabin crew friendly. I did not pay for allocated seating - the randomised seating that you get is a bit annoying. My main complaint is about the queuing. The outbound flight was delayed by 25 minutes. This is understandable, there were slot restrictions into AMS, but there the delay was not put on the screen seven though easyJet must have known about it and the gate closed before the plane actually got to the stand with passengers left to wait (fortunately in the gate). Don't think that you will get on a delayed flight if you are running late. There was a delay at LTN because the entry gate would not open and everyone had to wait on the apron although this was presumably down to the airport. The return flight was fine - we actually arrived on the gate a few minutes early and I wisely decided to remain seated and be the one of the last to leave the gate, given that the airline has allocated seating, having seen people waiting in lines on the ramp. I cannot complain having paid £61 for three flights, two of which I used but the product of better legacy carriers is superior.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Even sitting in the emergency exit row I had barely enough space and felt cramped. The seat was really uncomfortable and even for such a short flight not recommendable. A different airline would have been 50% more expensive (about 100€ for the roundtrip) for same dates and slightly better times. Next time I will think twice before booking the cheapest flight.

But the real issue I have with easyJet (what an ironic name) is that, at that point, they simply told us they couldn't help us any further. In other words, at midnight, after sitting in the airport for hours and hours, we were now left on our own to find a hotel and find another flight. It was simply incredible. We were all left high and dry, scrambling to get ourselves out of a terrible situation the airline had put us in. I did find a hotel and another flight the next day, which, together with the taxi rides, cost me around EUR 400. That's in addition to the money I spend for the original flight.

After already waiting for about half an hour to enter the plane I found bread crumbs and hair on my seat and the window was and full of finger prints. Apparently the flight got delayed for one hour because one of the stewardesses got sick and her standby flight attendant wasn’t around. If that wasn’t enough the flight got delayed for another 2 hours, which means I had to spend 5 hours in the airplane for a flight that should only take one and a half hours.

No assistance from easyJet ground crew in finding alternate transport, hotels, meals etc. Managed to get a flight from Malaga to Doncaster for the 7 kids, and Malaga to Southampton (we live in the Midlands, near Stafford, so not ideal) for myself and my partner both departing the next day. This really was the very best we could get. EasyJet emailed on 7 May (and in doing so have entered a contract) to confirm they would be paying the kids expenses claim amounting to £609.63: Alternate transport £216.63 Hotel £180.34 (one time gesture of goodwill) Meal £141.69 (one time gesture of goodwill) Transfers £70.97 No reimbursement as promised has been received. I also put in another expenses claim for myself and my partner. No reimbursement for this has been received either.

Our flight was cancelled and we had to arrange our own flight back to London and accommodation. Easyjet then expect you to fill out an online form to claim your expenses back! This was a flight back to London on Sunday, meaning everyone had work to return to but couldn’t do so because easyjet just seem to take bookings without taking into account all the most important factors. The weather was perfectly fine, but they used the weather in France as an excuse to cancel a flight on Sunday night! The accommodation was sorted out by easyJet using their app on your phone, but we had to wait around like clowns for a shuttle bus, only to be taken far away from city central but close enough to the airport! We had to wait around while having nothing interesting to do because the hotel they arranged was situated near a motor way system. Please avoid using their services on the weekends because you will suffer alot if they cancel your flight and you’re left stranded in a foreign country unprerpared for this sort of scenario.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

One of them delayed more than 3 hours which caused us missing our connecting flight. We had to then buy new tickets, £90 each. The person at the desk treated us disrespectfully when we explained our situation and talked to us as if everything that he was saying was self explanatory and he was wasting his time telling us what he was. When purchasing the tickets, he told us there were 3 seats on the plane that we could take, we only had to get our seat numbers at check-in - we weren't given them there. When boarding we were told we were stand byers and that they didn't know if there were seats for us. We were then asked to step back; when asked if we could wait beside the desk, they said no and told us to stay aside. We were the last to get on the plane, after a few calls from the staff who weren't certain if there were seats for us till the last moment. At that point the flight already had more than an hour delay. We landed at 10 pm. If none if this had happened, we would have landed just after 3 pm.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Never received a text alert or anything else, just lucky to check my email in the AM otherwise would have shown up to airport with no flight. And no reason given for the cancellation. Then the fun begin. No other flights offered, no help to get back to London. Had to spend a couple hours trying to figure out a way back and ended up taking a 6 hour train ride instead of a 1 hour flight. Wasn't able to make it to my hotel in Oxford, and due to the late cancellation, lost the money I spent on the hotel. Best part was that Easyjet only refunded me €95 out of the €250 I spend on the ticket. Can't figure that one out and am trying to get an answer from them. So I'm now out cost of hotel, cost of plane ticket, cost of train trip, and a whole day lost on my vacation. Googled to see why cancellation and found a few articles about Easyjet that shows they cancel a lot.

Took a multi-leg trip LTN-ZRH, BSL-AMS and AMS-LTN. On each occasion the flights were late with the delays being 70 minutes, 45 minutes and 2 hours respectively. On board staff were as helpful and apologetic as they could have been, but the impression remains of an airline that has severe organisational and punctuality issues. Information provided via their app and at the airport is inconsistent and unreliable and boarding is not well organised or pleasant with passengers being corralled into enclosures like cattle before boarding and then made to wait for an indefinite amount of time. When fees for seat reservations and hold bags are taken into account the price advantage over legacy airlines is marginal at best. Plus their lack of reliability and poor boarding organisation makes EasyJet a poor choice. If they can improve their on-time performance they might be worth considering otherwise I will give 'TardyJet' a miss in future.",Business,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Stansted to Ljubljana,nan," |  I had one of the worst experiences of any company ever when I attempted to fly with Easyjet. It has cost me £510, a day at Stansted airport and ruined my husband’s birthday. We arrived at the airport at 11am for a flight at 1:05pm. We checked a bag in and went to departures. After going to the allocated gate about 45mins before flight departure time we waited and were told there was a technical issue with the plane and were then told that we would need to get another plane which was due to land shortly. Then an hour at the gate with no further news. Then there was an announcement saying we should go back to the departure lounge as there was a gate change. We were taken by bus back to the departure lounge and when we looked at the screen info it flashed up that the plane would be leaving in 1 hours time and that the gate was 81. I looked online at the Easyjet flight tracker which still said that the plane was due to leave about 20mins previous to the current time so was incorrect. So we were not sure of when the plane would actually leave and thought we’d wait for announcements or info on screen in the departure lounge. We kept looking at the screen and all it ever said was ‘Gate change’. It didn’t say ‘go to gate’, ‘boarding’ or ever again an expected departure time. Then after about 1.5 hours it just disappeared off the screen. We were alarmed but there is no information desk at stansted to ask anyone what is going on. We wandered around until eventually asking someone with a walkie talkie who happened to be walking through. She called and found out that since we had been sitting there waiting for information our bag had been removed from the plane and it had left. No announcements had been made, no information on the board. We couldn’t believe it. They had taken our bag off the plane but hadn’t bothered to make an announcement calling us to the gate. There was never anything in the board saying ‘go to gate’ ‘boarding’ etc. Basically they hadn’t updated the screen info. We then experienced the worst customer service ever. After being dumped with various people with no explanation of what was going on we ended up speaking to the so called ‘manager’ at the Easyjet desk. She was woman called Rochelle who made no apology for our situation and could not have been less helpful, she treated us with utter contempt. I’ve never known such awful customer service. She said we should call the Easyjet phone line (which is actually a call centre in South Africa). We did this and they said the communication failure was something we should take up with Easyjet at the airport. But the representatives at the airport said it was nothing to do with them and there was no one we could complain to. Basically if something like this goes happens Easyjet are the absolute worst company to deal with. We were left unable to speak to anyone- everyone just said it wasn’t their responsibility. The awful Rochelle at one point said she didn’t actually really work for Easyjet but another company called Stobarts. So if some mistake is made at the airport you can’t complain, you lose your money and get no apology. I lost over £500 on the lost flights and holiday, it ruined my husband’s birthday and we were treated so poorly by Easyjet staff. The previous flight I got with Easyjet was delayed by 5 hours with no apology too. It’s a big mistake to choose this airline. I will never book a flight with them again.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Even on the next day the flight was late more than 1 hour. I lost a whole day of work. Reason given: staff had been working more than allowed?! As if easyJet doesn't know when their flights are scheduled - this happens when companies only look at costs. I am a weekly commuter between Milan and Paris. Out of my last 60 flights 36 were delayed by at least 30/40 minutes. That is pathetic and bad. If one adds the recurrently chaotic boarding procedures (CDG is the worst), and the terrible F&B offering on board, the ridiculous excuses given by ground staff (always given pretty late ie sometimes 1 hour after notices have been sent by the app), and customer service that doesn’t give a damm as not answering emails and complaints...I’d be tempted to say easyJet is the worst airline I know.

I usually don't fly low cost airlines because I never trust them but I really enjoyed my flight with EasyJet. I downloaded my boarding pass from the easyjet mobile app, which works extremely well! They called us at the gate about an hour early and they gathered all the passengers in the rather small gate area where we had to wait quite a long time, which was rather annoying. Boarding started and I was the first on the plane thanks to speedy boarding, which I think is really worth the extra money. I was initially worried that boarding would have been absolute chaos but in the end the staff at the gate were very professional and the boarding procedure was really organized. The cabin crew and both pilots were extremely nice and friendly and the atmosphere onboard was very relaxed. Food and drink isn't too expensive and they have a really good selection. The new plane was clean, it had good leather seats and legroom was actually quite good so it was very confortable. Will definitely consider flying EasyJet again!",Family Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,May 2018,4.0,1.0,nan,no,Inverness to Luton,4.0, |  Inverness to Luton. Third time in a row spectacularly delayed by easyJet this year. The last two have seemingly been a reflection of the poor resilience built into their schedules which are over complicated by crisscrossing all over Europe. They just cannot bee relied on for domestic U.K. travel. Be extremely worried if you receive an email a few days before your flight if it says that the flight will be operated by easyJet Europe as this seems to mean inevitable delays happen. On this occasion the incoming flight arrived late and so missed its window to then avoid a weather related issue at Luton. EasyJet initially refused to pay out compensation because of the Luton related weather issues - when it was pointed out to them that their own flights landed at Luton around the time mine was due to land and BA had found it possible to depart Inverness later and arrive at Heathrow on time they then blamed more French traffic control and weather systems in Europe. This seems to be an airline that cannot respond to any small issue elsewhere in Europe and then meet its timetable. In future I will either use a more expensive but reliable flat carrier or the train. The train would have been quicker all the way from Inverness to London with these delays and they pay out if just 30 minutes late whoever fault it is. The only positive was helpful cabin crew who gave people free food and drinks and dealt well with an unruly passenger and booted him off.,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The flight was fully booked and four hours long, but it was fine, as the seat was very comfortable and the legroom, thanks to the thin seats, surprisingly good. The cabin was quite clean, although I didn't visit the lavatory, so I can't judge on that. The wine and olives I ordered (and payed) were excellent. The only thing that in my opinion could be improved are the tray tables. They're actually quite small and I'm sure a 15"" laptop wouldn't be usable to do work or anything that requires using the keyboard. EasyJet's new inflight entertainment system ""Air Time"" didn't work, which was fine for me, but may have been bothersome for others.

However easyJet really must do something about the quality of their ground handling. I don't know who handles them in Vienna but we arrived to drop our bags and found the easyJet Plus counter unmanned. Thinking we were slightly early we waited. After a few minutes we were approached by a man who peremptorily ordered us to join the main queue. I refused point blank and told him as easyJet Plus customers we expected to get what we'd paid for, i.e. priority service. With no good grace he got behind the counter himself and did what he had to do so abruptly that I was surprised when our bags arrived in Edinburgh. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. At Edinburgh we landed ten minutes early and Menzies Aviation ran true to form. Firstly we came to a grinding stop on the apron because, as a clearly exasperated Captain told us, nobody had turned on the ground guidance system required for the aircraft to park on the stand. Having finally got on stand we then sat unable to deplane for almost a quarter of an hour because there were no steps. Three women with day-glo jackets and clipboards stood outside chatting, occasionally looking at the aircraft and clearly doing nothing useful. Once we eventually got off I asked a day-glo lady if the aircraft's arrival had come as a surprise to them. ""Well we were waiting for the steps"" was the response. Gosh, you don't say. I know from this and several similar experiences that you obviously don't have enough kit or enough people to handle the aircraft you're paid to handle. Not good enough. Come on easyJet, your product is good but the incompetence of your ground handlers annoys your customers and delays your flights.

We were one of the people that got charged £47 for extra baggage, I was frustrated as three people in front of me had the same bags as me. The lady at the desk was rude and would not discuss the issue ""we just had to pay"". We finally got onto the plane after being charged £47. We had a good holiday and left our hotel roughly 1930 on the 8 Jul to return to UK via Ibiza airport. Again went straight through security with absolute no dramas in Spain the staff were much more polite and not looking to make a quick pound! Whilst browsing the duty free I received a notification on my phone that the flight was delayed by 1 hour, 30 mins later another flight delayed by 4 hours! then roughly 2100 flight cancelled. We left gate are and went to find the easyJet information counter, when we got there we were offered a flight three days later! Which was no good due to being back at work the next day. We explained this and were told you have to buy your own return flight if you want to go earlier. That's fine if you have a spare £500 which what it ended up costing all in. There was five easJet staff at the counter 1 lady was working and the other four were doing nothing even though there was around 200 people in the same boat. 1 working 4 doing nothing so frustrating.

Once we had boarded, the passenger next to us boarded, she was a flight attendant that knew the crew. So they embraced, and had extended conversation. The conversation went right through the pilots announcements and the safety briefing - this was by a flight attendant who was a passenger, talked right through the safety briefing. As soon as she boarded the attendants gave her a bottle of water, then as soon as we took off, she got two gin and tonics, well before any other passenger had been served - did she pay of course not. Then she was given the toasted sandwich (no charge), the cold meat what ever that was (no charge) then the chocolate cookie (no charge), all before any passenger got a inking of being served.

It's normal for them to board on time and keep waiting on a craft for an hour or keep at the gate with no info. Half an hour delay become a standard and noone cares about passengers connections. Besides stuff is less and less qualified and motivated. Sometimes they hardly speak English and make no effort to make themself understood. I'm really disappointed with the company performance.

We arrived at Copenhagen airport just over an hour before the flight, and were surpised to be called for the flight almost inmediately we had passed through security. Walking through the airport I realised why, however - the budget airline wing of CPH is a very long way away from the main lounge area. The gate area for the budget flights is basic but there is a small shop for snacks and drinks. Boarding into a 'pen' commenced before arrival of the incoming flight, so we were stood in a queue for quite a while, but boarding was rapid once the inbound flight had arrived. Only real negative was the plane had clearly not been cleaned on the turnaround, and there was a fair amount of rubbish inside. The aircraft was one of the older easyJet planes and was showing its age - they really could do with a refurb of the older planes in the fleet now. Once on board, the pilot announced that storms were causing major delays into Gatwick and we might have to wait some time - an hour or more - for a takeoff slot. However, 15 minutes later the pilot informed us that he had managed to pursuade Gatwick to give us an earlier slot and we were cleared for takeoff straight away - I was impressed at these efforts. In flight, the crew were as good as I've come to expect from easyJet and the pilots gave the customary route updates, which are always welcome. We landed at Gatwick 15 minutes early, which was impressive as I noted from the arrivals board that almost every other flight that evening had a 1 hour or longer delay. Imnigration was surprisingly quiet for a bank holiday.

Keep in mind that this was at 09:47 am which is 1 hour and 43 minutes prior to delayed departure time. We go the help desk and the one agent didn’t get to us until 10:02. She was rude when speaking to us.  Instead of the normal bumping and compensation, I think that easyJet turned it on the customer under the “online checkin closes 2 hours prior to scheduled departure” clause. It does not specify on the email airport counter closes at that same time. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,Travelled as a couple from London Gatwick to Rome (Fiumicino airport) from Gatwick on Sunday 31st May 2015 and returned to London Gatwick from same airport on Thursday 4th June 2015. Outbound flight: delayed by 1.5 hours due to original Airbus A320 (180 seats) out of action due to technical issues (Easyjet excuse) so eventually transferred to Airbus A319 (only 156 seats). Tight squeeze and confusion for many of where to sit and many family members split. This plane was looking it's age inside and rattled a lot. It was one of the spare ones used specifically for breakdowns. Inbound flight: Delayed by 2 hours. Okay this airport has had a fire but please it was a month ago! Tannoy systems should be fixed by now. This may not be Easyjets fault but consider this: The flight was EZY5260. There was nothing on the electronic screens to show that this flight even existed (despite an Easyjet representative saying that the flight was erased it was never on the boards as we were at the airport for many hours). At the departure terminal 2 there was no information but after several enquiries to airport staff we were asked to go to terminal 3. No information and nobody to consult. There was even a young Easyjet employee who was travelling on an earlier flight (there were several to the UK all delayed) who was as perplexed as we were). At last after further enquiries and looking at the Easyjet website on phones the reason given for the delay was that a technical fault was the excuse. Easyjet are not at fault on the airport issues but I think they could do a lot better. Replacing ageing aircraft is a must and leaving passengers in the dark is inexcusable. Even though the pilot apologized for the delay it's not the delay at all it's the lack of common sense and dialogue that exasperates passengers. I've been in similar positions with other airlines. What do they do? Obtain a large white card describe the problem and where to go and have a rep at the terminal as described. It's not rocket science is it? The marks given are for poor customer relations and not the flight or pilot or flight attendants who were probably as cheesed off as the passengers for working later than anticipated.,nan,3.0,nan

As the flight commenced the front 10 rows were inconvenienced by a large family who constantly demanded attention from the crew and a small boy who ran up and down the aisle punching passengers arms as he went.

The cabin crew were efficient and polite and because of the short duration of the flight were quite busy. There was a number of disabled passengers including me who required assistance to disembark. Unfortunately the vehicle used for this was busy elsewhere and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get off. The Easyjet crew were very apologetic and the Captain herself came back and stayed to chat with us while we waited which I thought was a good bit of customer service. Once in the baggage reclaim area there was another slight delay as the conveyor belt would not start. The attitude of some passengers was appalling. The one airport employee present was constantly badgered about what was happening. All he could say was the engineers were trying to fix it and the duty manager was on his way. This evidently was not good enough for some and they registered their displeasure by behaving in a rude and arrogant fashion to both the one employee present and the duty manager when he arrived. The belt started and all luggage was offloaded and collected after about 30minutes not exactly a catastrophe but to some it was as if Easyjet (who were not responsible for any delay) and the Management at Luton Airport had deliberately conspired to cause a problem for their amusement.

The whole thing was a complete  shambles and there were some heated exchanges between passengers who tried to push in. We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run.

Being disabled, I requested assistance on both journeys.  The staff at Edinburgh were superb both times,  but the staff at Luton were almost non-existent. On arrival at Luton, we were taken to the baggage hall and told to sit at the side where we would be attended to. I could see my case going round and round and it was eventually removed and taken to me by another passenger. When an attendant eventually arrived, after a very long time, he was rushed off his feet, as there was such a shortage of staff.  On the return journey, I was almost reduced to tears.  I rang from the booth for disabled assistance, and was assured someone would be with me as soon as possible.  I rang twice more and both times was assured someone was on the way. Eventually, a very kind parking attendant went to investigate matters and someone arrived within 10 minutes, by which time I was almost passing out with the heat, as it was like sitting in a greenhouse with the sun beating down and I had waited an hour and a quarter!  Again, the attendant was run off his feet through lack of staff and I had not even been checked in (so much for having to arrive 90 minutes before the flight!).  As it was, the plane was late, otherwise I would have missed my flight.  Having said all that, all staff were very civil, but it did turn my lovely holiday into a nightmare.  If Easyjet are committed to helping disabled people have a smooth journey from start to finish, they need to get their act together and liaise with OES re passenger assistance, especially in this day and age.

Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet's ""midnight check-in"" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I'd paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn't find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay €100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I've had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins.

Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy.

I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fiancée's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional €55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff). Uncomfortable, no entertainment, limited and lastly not that particular inexpensive flight. We hope to fly with a more reputable airline in the future.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

I had already paid almost £600 for the 3 seats and since minors can't travel alone I assumed one of us would be seated with him. It was obviously something I hadn't even thought of an in hindsight, even though I shouldn't have to pay even more it would have been the safer option, however my complaint is with the way it was dealt with by the cabin crew and the distinct lack of customer care.

We didn't have bags but did get to the airport very early. Outbound: EZY8995, 14.40 (15.30)-17.05 (17.37), July 28th. Once in the departure lounge a 12 min delay was posted with the inbound aircraft 30 mins late. Around 30 mins before scheduled time of departure we got told to go to gate 52. Boarding was predominately hassle free but people could just walk on the plane. We pushed back at 15.00 and left Gatwick at 15.30 which was 50 mins late. The cabin crew were friendly and did apologise a few times for the delay. The food was quite expensive but still not as bad as Ryanair. We landed at 17.37 and deboarding was done quickly. The delay was acceptable as it was the 3rd return flight of the day in the summer. Inbound: EZY8996, 12.35( 13.25)-12.50 (13.20), August 5th. Once in the departure lounge a 25 min delay was posted. We boarded quickly around 10 mins after the aircraft arrived and were off quickly and on time. We were advised a flying time of 50 mins which is extremely quick in comparison to the average duration therefore service was rushed. However it was good to catch up with the delay.

Also other destinations eg Bedford not for sale in cabin. A shuttlebus to the railway station don't forget to buy your ticket for this in advance!

Paid extra for exit row seats as this was a 4 hour flight and that gave us the option of Speedy Boarding. However not so important now that easyJet have started offering pre-assigned seats which removes the scrum. Speedy Boarding does mean you can drop your bag at a special Speedy Boarding desk rather than queue with the majority of passengers. This saved quite a bit of time at both ends. We had checked in online and the airline's website suggests you just turn up and drop your hold baggage. However Easy Jet's definition of ""bag drop"" sees the same lengthy queues at desks that you would get if you were checking in at the airport. Seats were comfortable with the extra legroom that goes with exit seats. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food offering is perfectly adequate for the length of journey. Plenty of information from the flight crew. Bit too much use of the PA system by the cabin crew. Altogether I find easyJet perfectly adequate for short haul flights.",nan,4.0,nan

On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat.

I was a little concerned as I had booked those extra legroom on the return journey ! I thought it was a blip but you guessed it - the aircraft was also changed on the return journey and our seats were no longer extra legroom. There were 8 other people who were disappointed to. Now interestingly the cabin crew confirmed to us that this was not a last minute change of aircraft as it was shown on their schedule since they were issued some considerable time before. Therefore it seems obvious to me that if Easyjet can't fill a larger aircraft then they put on a smaller one and ignore those passengers who have paid for extra legroom seats which don't exist on the smaller plane. So beware booking an Easyjet flight and booking seats too far in advance because they seem to change aircraft a bit more frequently than you would think.,nan,3.0,nan

When we got to the airport we were forced to pay £25 for luggage being 1 kg over weight. If that was British airways that would be fine. For the flight you have to pay for food which the prices are ridiculous and the food isn't that amazing. 1 year prior to this occasion my kids and I had to fly to Spain and unfortunately Easyjet messed up our booking and we had to miss a weeding!

Allocated seating was good as there is no rush experienced with other low costers did not pay extra to get the option to choose the seats yourself but it would be great if they offered at least a few seats per flight to choose from without extra charge like regular carriers.

Bag drop off at Gatwick is easy and quick cabin crew always friendly and helpful and the planes are clean. I like the fact that the hand luggage weight is unlimited. The only bugbear I have is that when booking a return flight and hold baggage is required one way only you have to call Easyjet to do this as the system is not able to book one-way hold baggage. As a regular traveller with Easyjet would also be nice if they offered some sort of frequent flyer reward (rather than offering Easyjet Plus for £149/year) on similar lines to the Vantage Club with Monarch.,nan,4.0,nan

I had to pay £50 fee to ""check in"" 2 cases as it turns out I hadn't completed the process properly. Around 40 minutes to do this. Boarding was chaotic at LGW with speedy board passengers sitting all over the plane and creating congestion with the non speedy board passengers. 30 mins late on take off. Crew were fine and polite. Food was just ok (at an extra charge). On return flight their web site wouldn't let me check in the hold baggage so had to call customer services from Spain who told me as I hadn't booked direct with them it could only be changed by my travel company or by phone with them. Charged £28 to ""check in"" 2 hold bags. Return: Long wait at bag drop in Fuerteventura. Check in was quite slow and boarding was chaotic. Despite handing over my pre printed boarding pass I was issued with a new one at the bag drop which rather defeats the object of the so called online service. Cabin crew polite and efficient.

We had no worries as this piece of luggage was used in March to travel with easyjet to Geneva. We were wrong as the wheels were not fully in gauge and we had then to pay £25. We were angry and embarrassed re this. As we waited to be checked in not one other passenger was asked to even remove their luggage off trolley just us!

We printed our boarding cards at home but still queued for almost an hour at Gatwick to check bags in. Very slow service and only 4 desks open of a possible 20.

I understand there is a business need but a bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss. Legroom wasn't too bad given that I am 6'4"".

We were in an emergency exit row with me at the window and her in the middle. After take off I slid up the window blinder as it was a day flight and I didn't want the sun in my eyes. The blinder stuck and I was unable to slide it down for landing. As we approached Venice we came within 100-200 feet of the ground then pulled up and out of the landing. The co- captain came over the speaker saying 'the pilot decided not to land and there would be more information shortly.' After another fifteen minutes of circling Italy we landed. On the way back we'd noticed that every EasyJet flight was running 15-20 minutes late and every flight had it's gate moved. Our flight went from Gate 19 to Gate 28 for example. After sitting and waiting to board we were jammed into a bus and driven out to the plane. Waiting for takeoff I turned on the air blower above the seat and the panel fell down. The attendants fixed it but that is not at all comforting as you're about to fly. On the flight home I rolled my window blinder up and it stuck again. The flights were loud the seats didn't recline.

Easyjet are now making announcements asking passengers to volunteer to put their baggage in the hold free of charge. How can overhead lockers cope with unlimited weight? This is stupid beyond belief. You have passengers sticking 15 kilos in their hand baggage to save buying hold baggage. Did Easyjet really not see the absolutely obvious outcome of this policy.

What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair.

Shocked that at security at Gatwick I went straight to an x-ray machine! No queues! Eateries rammed as it was the start of the school holidays. Gate announced on time. At the gate they called all those with reserved seats and speedy boarding first. Told to go to the front of the bus and cram in there. Non-priority pax got on the same bus. Longest journey to the plane round the back of the airport and across most of it. At the plane the driver opened only the front door so speedy pax could exit first but as easyJet allocates seats you don't get the disgusting crush and rush as you do on Ryanair. Clean cabin. Thanked by the captain for boarding quickly but then told that the flight was to be delayed due to Air Traffic Control not giving them a slot until 2hrs later! I missed my connecting ferry. Captain came on and said the slot had been pushed back even further to 10am. Crew came down with free water a couple of times. Eventually take off 2 hours late. Fairly uncomfortable for a long flight when you add the extra time on the ground in. Crew were very cheery and professional. The chicken wrap I got had limited fillings and was very dry. The box of crisps were over salty and very oily. Next time I'll buy something at the airport to bring on board. Arriving at Kefalonia we were behind another flight so had to wait to clear immigration a bit and for our bags to arrive. Mine was the last one off!

On our return flight the air con was producing vapour during take off due to it being so hot outside and the crew made a special announcement just to reassure passengers as some were concerned it was smoke. The captain also warned us to expect turbulence just after take off and took time to explain why it may occur. Whilst seating is rather tight it is no worse than many other airlines and the service is far superior to that of many major scheduled airlines.

So you seat on an aircraft with no money to buy refreshments no accessible passport and none of the other items that make a flight more bearable.

The flight to Madrid a short travel of 45/50 minutes arrived on scheduled to Madrid so I had a stopover there of about 4 hours. I didn't have problems with the luggage. The boarding was a bit confusing (due to speedy boarding) and the flight was full so the experience on the ground and on board was poor. The space between the seats was also very short a thing that is normal on these low cost companies. My returning flight was threatened by a ground strike on Barajas.

They will not allow you to put anything under the seat in front of you so your purse is your carry-on and they'll charge you to check what should be your carry-on bag. Most European rollers are smaller than U.S. ones so your roller won't work. Our first flight from Brussels to Berlin cost us 50 euros extra when they took my roller at the gate. My husbands roller was allowed. On the second easy jet flight from Berlin to Paris we paid the counter charge of 30 euro for my roller only to have my husbands roller denied at the security line adjacent (literally) to the ticket counter for which we paid another gate fee of 50 euro even though we hadn't left the lobby. While in the security line a woman on our flight was worried about the time. She said ""I know this airline and if you're not at the gate a half hour before departure they will deny you boarding"". So we begged ourselves to the front of the line and ran to the gate. At least in Brussels they were calling people up on a flight that was next to depart.

Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings.

Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through ""manually"" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue.

There was a little confusion at the gate about which queue was what (i.e. Speed Boarding and the Other Queue) however announcements were made to clarify the confusion. One bag policy was an irritation (as was their militant- style checks of it) given that Monarch have now relaxed this as long as both bags fit within the allowance. Very warm welcome onboard by the crew. Seating tight but not too uncomfortable for a short flight - wouldn't fly with them mid-haul in those seats however. Allocated seating is a great improvement although there is still a mad rush to board for locker space. A fear seems to exist on low cost carriers in regards to this but I don't find this same mad rush on BA flights (when passengers tend to carry even more hand luggage). Selection of food and drink very extensive. Not too many announcements and no pushy sales. Service very warm and friendly. On time arrival and quick disembarkation. If easyJet can get smooth out the last remaining 'low cost feel' ruffles from their product (issues with hand luggage and more options to pay extra for space i.e. a blocked middle seat) I would consider them on par with BA 's product in Europe. easyJet have come a long way and overall I was quite pleased with the journey experience.,nan,4.0,nan

I am fed-up with their baggage policy. We paid extra for our case to go in the hold but was then asked to remove our coats from the overhead storage compartments so that other people's huge hand luggage could have the space! Baggage in the cabin is becoming a joke (a couple with a small toddler loaded 3 cases!) but we were asked to put our coats on the dirty floor or sit through the entire flight baking hot with them on our laps - not sure how we were expected to eat or drink anything in comfort as the table could barely be deployed! The overhead storage area was choc-a-block so I wonder if our group had also taken cases to go in the cabin - where on earth would it have been put! Maybe next time we won't pay extra and just wait for them to put the overload/surplus in the hold anyway unless of course they ask us to put it on our laps! Easyjet have a good pricing structure and if they included a piece of hold baggage as standard (and enforced the one piece of 'hand' luggage they could become an airline to seriously challenge their flag flying rivals.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,Luton - Olbia - Gatwick. Luton airport's small terminal resembled a crowded low-end shopping mall with a large food court. The passenger security check was well-managed. There was little seating in the almost-windowless departure lounge though there was somewhere to buy a coffee amid the duty free gauntlet. You wouldn't want to be delayed here. The walk from terminal entrance to boarding gate was relatively short as was the quick taxi from aircraft parking stand to take-off. At the boarding gate (gate 16) many passengers crowded precariously for at least 10 or 15 minutes over the entire length of a long and steep stairway with their cabin baggage before being able to access a small ground-level room where passports and boarding cards were slowly checked before exiting into the open air to walk across the tarmac to board the plane parked nearby. My single carry-on bag complied exactly with the airline's specified 56 x 45 x 25cm maximum dimensions including handles and wheels. At the boarding gate a member of Easyjet staff selected passengers with wheeled bags from the queue for baggage assessment. My bag did not quite fit a metal- framed gauge indicating that it was over-sized. I was required to check it in and pay a £40 fee on the spot. Not negotiable. The gate staff were blunt unsympathetic and appeared hardened to this procedure which felt like a scam. I still had to carry the bag to the aircraft steps and locate a hold-baggage loader to accept it. After boarding had finished there was ample empty space in the overhead lockers for my regulation-size cabin bag. Admittedly my soft- shell Samsonite wheelie was full which may have distorted the dimensions slightly but Easyjet's exacting customer- unfriendly approach felt 'out to get'. Be warned! On the return flight from Olbia my bag - the very same bag - just fitted a similar gauge and I was allowed to take it in the cabin. On both flights the cabins were tidy but with grubby carpet. There was no choice of seat (unless you opted to pay more in advance) which was randomly allocated at the time of online check in. The seat pitch was very tight though just tolerable for a two-hour flight; not for anything longer. The cabin crew both outbound and inbound were friendly and efficient but did nothing to stop noisy young children from running up and down the aisle throughout the entire flight and also made too many announcements. The announcements promoting food and tax-free sales and so many price-savings were intrusive and relentless. Pity the Easyjet frequent-flier! There was no complimentary in-flight catering but drinks and some over-priced unhealthy snacks were offered for sale. The outbound flight departed from Luton on time and arrived a few minutes early in Olbia. The return flight began boarding on time in Olbia but departed 30 minutes late. This delay appeared to be due to desperately inefficient ground handling staff at the boarding gate in Olbia who seemed to lack any sense of interest in getting the flight away on time. We made up some time during the journey and landed 20 minutes late into Gatwick. We arrived at Gatwick North terminal though the flight was sold as arriving at Gatwick South terminal. The boarding pass also indicated arrival at Gatwick South terminal. No announcement as to the change of terminal was made by the crew and anyone unfamiliar with Gatwick airport would have been unaware. The potential for this anomaly to cause problems for customers with pick-up arrangements is obvious. Overall Easyjet was a third-rate airline experience.

I had booked tickets for my son on October 2 and he arrived at the airport in time but was told that the flight was overbooked and there were no more seats. He could wait as two people had not shown up. Furthermore there were no more flights for the day. What was he to do sleep at the airport.? They did not even apologise.

Nothing can excuse the abysmal treatment by easyjet of the passengers who were forced to await repatriation from Malaga on 24th Dec. Poor information of passengers throughout especially on the 24th with passengers lurching from delay to delay eventually ending in cancellation after a 7-8 hour wait in the terminal. Being given a voucher for the value of 4.50 Euros in an airport in which a can of coke costs 3.70 Euros and a brownie 3.50 Euros. Having to queue for 2 hours to rebook following cancellation with 200 passengers served by 2 staff eventually reduced to 1 after which we were all told that all the rebooking was useless as we could rebook ourselves or check in normally the following day. Ferried to a hotel and having to queue in the rain and wind for over an hour while a single person was booking in 200 passengers one at a time. Ferried back to the airport the next day at 11 am only to be left in terminal C for over 7 hours with virtually all facilities shut down no attempt to hand out any snacks or refreshment and only one harassed easyjet rep in attendance being clearly out of his depth unable or unwilling to announce anything and to address anything. Absence of sensible and correct information from easyjet with the only source of semi-reliable information coming from passengers with access to the web or contacts in the UK. Had to endure hours of waiting as an aircraft scheduled to take us to Gatwick was diverted to Alicante without explanation for hours with wild rumours circulating on its destination chances of its return and any time estimates. Offered crisps or some low-cost choc sweet and a drink as compensation”for the 7-hour food-less/drink-less wait in an otherwise abandoned terminal. My own verdict is that easyjet's support framework in Malaga is totally inadequate and poorly equipped to deal with unforeseen events. Staff are poorly trained and poorly motivated having no understanding of the importance of talking to passengers and keeping them informed. Your food arrangements in case of serious delays are ludicrous all characteristic of an airline who has forgotten (or never learnt) the importance of customer relations alongside its raison d'etre of maximising its profits.,nan,1.0,nan

The on-line check-in was relatively simple although we were unable to choose seats for our return flight - however the allocated seats were reserved and we were seated together. Bag drop was simple and extremely well-organised at Gatwick the seats were comfortable and the removal of a reclining function meant that ones knees were never crushed by the person in front!

Thinner seat backs and everything more streamlined made for a much more spacious seat pitch and a more comfortable journey. We could not fault it at all.

We were then told it was going to cost an extra 55 Euro for a bag 1cm thicker than the allowed thickness which is outrageous not to mention we were well under our weight limit. I then noticed that some other passengers had cabin baggage as big as the one we had to pay extra for and put in the hold and also a large handbag or briefcase.

Bag Drop: the bag drop was straightforward and the staff member efficient but unsmiling and not at all friendly. Boarding: orderly enough but the announcements were not very clear and I saw 2 elderly people struggle unaided. The cabin crew were not at all friendly and seemed disorganised too. One member of the cabin crew was particularly unfriendly and gruff in the way in which he interacted with a young mum and a baby. Later in the flight I bought a coffee and the same man who was rude to the lady with the baby handed me my change with a phoney smile and the money with a strange expression. I checked the change and saw that rather than a £2 coin he had handed me an Arabic coin. I immediately saw this and asked for the correct coinage. It took the efforts of two of his colleagues for me to receive the correct change and no apology. Announcements: there were very few announcements during this journey and no route map at all. The lady captain made one announcement at the end of the flight. Comfort: The seat was rather thin but comfortable enough for the distance flown. Value: the price I paid was quite reasonable. However this was not the cheapest on this route and so I shall shop around in future to make sure I get a good deal.,nan,3.0,nan

The part B of the airport from which Easyjet flights depart looks like a hangar with no ventilation and places to sit. There is a huge line for boarding moving very slow. They started boarding before the plane arrived and all the passengers had to wait in very small room overheated with no fresh air. Also they write that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure while in reality it only starts at this time or even later. I guess that is completely unacceptable even for a low-cost.,nan,3.0,nan

My bag was too big for the cabin but then I was told I wasn't allowed my small handbag on board even though I was allowed both bags on my flight from London to Edinburgh. When asked why the sudden change in policy she had no answer and ignored me while I stood there clearly confused. I also feel that policies should be consistent throughout all airports you are situated at and all crew should be informed and enforce these policies.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Although it is an improvement that all seats are now allocated it's worth noting that even if you have purchased an allocated a seat up front this does not mean that you have Speedy Boarding. In fact Speedy Boarding now seems pointless since you need to get to the gate amongst the earliest passengers or so they told me at the gate last night. Seems to me that EasyJet should now copy best practice by proper airlines and board by seat number on busier flights. At the moment it is unnecessarily stressful.,nan,3.0,nan

Massive check-in queue and the flight left in just over 90 minutes. Thankfully for us they asked everyone for the Sharm bound flight to come forward. Very impressed with this as most airlines leave you to struggle on your own. Friendly staff at counter who couldn't stop smiling and were most helpful. Rushed to the gate and boarded straight away as we had priority boarding (for £20 extra mind you). Brand new A319 Airbus with clean and comfortable seats. Stewardesses were very kind and helpful offering us drinks food and being most attentive. They were so good they got a 4th drinks run in 25 minutes before landing. Had a decent bacon sarnie for breakfast which was a bit pricey at £2.50 but didn't taste like melted plastic. However there was no IFE so had to make do with iPad instead. Had same crew on way back and again were faultless. Overall I will definitely fly with Easyjet again!,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,2.0,LGW-Malta. Although I am a frequent flyer I did manage to go to the wrong terminal. My fault but the fact that easyJet operate from both terminals at Gatwick is unusual and they should do more to point this out to people before they join the long bag drop queue in South terminal. Fair enough the queues move fast and staff call out the flights that are closing but that isn't much help to you if you are in the wrong terminal altogether. Fortunately in our case we realised our error quickly and we got to north terminal and made our flight but I would argue that the bag drop system needs serious improvement. The actual flight was ok but the seat pitch is unacceptable for such a long flight. It is ok to read but not enough to work on a laptop - this is an issue for business travellers. The only good thing about easyjet is the coffee which is much better than their competitors. The allocated seating is also an improvement but we were allocated seats across the aisle from one another not ideal. I would say easyjet have some way to go before they can say they are really competing with BA etc for business travellers. They need to seriously look at what Norwegian are doing.,nan,3.0,nan

These flights were good and the introduction of allocated seating has been a vast improvement. Check-in at Bristol was fast but BCN is still a bit of a wait (always has been -30 minutes this time). Still some room for improvement though. Hand luggage storage is a shambles and £2-50 for a cup of tea is scandalous (but you don't have buy). Prices also seem to have risen dramatically but EJ is still the best of the low cost carriers.,nan,4.0,nan

I have returned from a lovely holiday from Portugal today-the flight was slightly delayed due to Air Traffic Control problems in France but this did not affect my experience in the slightest. When it came time to start descent (which I was not aware of) one of the cabin crew tapped me on the shoulder to ask me to put my earphones and phone away on which I was watching a movie. I put everything away in double quick time as soon as I was asked and pushed my bag under the seat in front. As she walked off behind me I heard her comment to either a colleague or another passenger ""there's always one"". I was very annoyed by this and advised one of her colleagues on the way off the plane. I deliberately hung back until most of the passengers had got off so that I did not cause a scene and I deliberately did not go to the woman in question so that it did not get out if hand. The other lady assured me that they have a debrief after every flight and that my comments would be discussed. The whole point of putting the headphones in and watching the movie was for me not to disturb anyone and cabin noise not to disturb me so I was not being ignorant. However her colleagues response to my comment was very professional and reassuring.",nan,4.0,nan

Carry-on only so I did not have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag. I also used the speedy-board option which avoided the one gripe I would have: people boarded the plane from both front and rear but without any consideration to seat allocation meaning that people were trying to pass each other in the aisle with bags in hand - close to mayhem. Seats were comfortable and legroom good (I'm a reasonably tall person) flight attendants very friendly and helpful. In summary I was pleasantly surprised.,nan,5.0,nan

They have done anything they could to get rid of customers. I flew with my 3 year old son who I paid full price for. I didn't want to take an extra luggage for him due to the many stairs on the way to the gate. Therefore I took one piece of luggage which was one inch too big. It was only one luggage for both of us. Nothing else and they charged us 45 pounds. Another customer same issue who had no cash and only a ATM Card to pay for his oversized back was refused to enter the aircraft until payment.

Nothing was too much trouble and everything was handled professionally. Landed at Luton 20 minutes early bags again delivered within 5 minutes of clearing immigration.

This time the agents were very rude pulling people at random out of line including us to tell us we had to pay 110 euros for our 2 bags (same bags same clothes) as they had to be checked in.

The bags contained our computers wallets money tickets and other valuable items. These bags were not lockable as we expected to have them with us. Their size has been acceptable on dozens of other flights with Easyjet and other airlines as they are made to fit within the airline in cabin sizing. The excuse for this 'new' ruling was that the flight was full. Every flight that I have been on with Easyjet has been full! They need to address the issue of passengers taking oversize bags onto the aircraft without penalising those of us who always ensure we have the correct size and weight for cabin bags.

Even check-in at FNC has improved and was much better than the last time we were there (looks like EJ now has its own staff as opposed to handing agents).

You are positively discriminated for taking a bag that is smaller that the new guaranteed size. Next time I fly I will be taking my usual size bag as this will end up in the overhead locker and I will get my leg space. No checks on the size of the luggage was performed at time of boarding.

We were whisked to London (40 mins) and back (35 mins). Legroom terrible but that's the disadvantage of LC-flying. The only one. Efficient friendly crew good information from the cockpit and swift bagdrop both ways. The only problem is caused by passengers on row 16 and beyond boarding the plane at the front instead of - as requested - from the back. Not easyJet's fault.

I dislike the policy the airline has regarding just one bag surely if I take a cabin case and a handbag to go under the seat in front this isn't a huge deal!

This is a real help to people who are a little jittery on planes. Seats are reasonably comfortable for a trip under 3 hours - any more and it would start to become an issue. Being able to pre-book a seat on Easyjet is a major step up from the free-for-all chaos of a couple of years ago. The charges for hold luggage are excessive but then this is an airline designed with city breaks in mind so hand luggage should accommodate most people's needs. No in-flight entertainment but don't most people revert to their phones / laptops / tablets these days anyway? Onboard food and drink are pricey but not ridiculously expensive and perfectly adequate compared to some of the muck served by other airlines. Have flown EJ before will do again.,nan,4.0,nan

Return trip flight was delayed by 90 minutes at Marrakech but they did not announce the delay until 10 minutes after the flight was meant to depart no announcements or explanation until after we had boarded. What was worrying is that another easyjet flight to Milan was boarding whilst we were waiting and they had adopted a Ryanair style cage to check bag sizes there were a lot of disgruntled passengers Easyjet is my carrier of choice but that will change if they start to adopt cheap money making tactics.,nan,4.0,nan

We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg.

Well it's not Virgin Cathy or Emirates but it's what you pay for. If you are hungry there is something to eat. They have changed their coffee from Starbucks which for me is good. Luggage issues: they do have some conflicting issues depending where you are ie: only I piece of hand luggage. Then people get on with bags. Does make me laugh. As for the new size I have noted they all stay in the cabin and the larger ones moved to hold at no cost. Speedy boarding I use all the time and it works well.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,I have been flying with easyjet for years on a regular basis and have recently been disappointed with how rapidly their customer service has declined. The last 3 times I have attempted to fly with easyjet have been disastrous and unnecessarily stressful with little compassion or understanding from staff who can only read legal requirements. The first was when I had a flexifare and attempted to change to earlier flight as per the terms and conditions of this flight but due to an error of assigning the right reference number they charged me a whole new fare. A month later I was going home for the weekend to see my family (I live in London my family in Belfast) and arrived at the airport on Friday to be told the flight was overbooked and they could offer me a flight on Sunday afternoon which of course was useless. This flight was reimbursed with the standard compensation which only just covered the return flight I lost as this was with a different airline. Finally last weekend when I didn't think easyjet could ruin another trip for me I arrived at the airport intending to get my 8pm flight to Edinburgh but the plane had been 'substituted' for another flight so we would only get our flight at around 1am! I asked customer service if they could arrange a hotel or taxi as I would be arriving to a city at 2.30am and I had been planning to make an onward journey but they refused saying my options were 1) to accept the delayed flight and get a refreshment voucher 2) take the 9.30 flight to Glasgow. I decided to go to Glasgow and would have made the last train to my onward destination but low and behold that flight was also delayed. So instead of arriving at 9.30pm to Edinburgh I arrived to Glasgow at 11.20pm. I asked for a refreshment voucher but was told I had a choice between accepting the late flight with a voucher or the Glasgow flight - what options!

Like they didn't know how many tickets they had booked for the day? Those passengers who had close departing flights were given priority so those of us who had arrived at the airport in appropriate time were made to wait even longer. After this fiasco we were informed our flight was 2+ hours delayed but we had to wait at the gate the entire time in case they decided to take off earlier.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,EZY5336 17th July 2014. On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.,nan,3.0,nan

Very professional and one can't ask for more.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,I recently flew easyJet from Stansted to Edinburgh. I had only hand luggage plus a handbag. There was no problem. Coming back however I was told that I wasn't allowed to have my hand bag with me and it had to be packed in my hand luggage not easy because the things I'd bought whilst in Scotland. Made my case fuller than it had previously been but rules I suppose are rules despite that the seem to be different at each airport. Imagine my surprise then when the tannoy informed me that apart from my hand luggage I was permitted one bag of shopping! I wonder what would have happened had I put my handbag into the carrier bag. I'm not trying to flout rules but I find it very confusing when goalposts are changed.,nan,3.0,nan

Full outbound flight much lighter load on the return flight into BRU. Both flights delayed. Luggage on the belt when getting to the arrivals hall in LGW only a 2 mins wait in Brussels. At LGW the gate was only announced at 16.50 with the notice that the gate would close at 16.56 which made for a hasty trek across the famous bridge to the gate where speedy boarding had just been completed. Despite the delays all in all quite satisfactory flights.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,I travelled Prague to Rome. I checked one backpack into the hold. I was carrying a small backpack which weighed about six kilos. I had a small bumbag around my waist which contained my valuables. I was told by this arrogant rude tall staff member to place my small bumbag into my backpack as he deemed it to be an extra bag. I have been travelling for 40 years and never come across this pedantic ridiculous rule. There were passengers there with three times the amount of my land luggage and many of them had their valuables in bags around their necks as well as their hand luggage. We also had to pay extra money from Split to Rome for hold luggage because it didn't come up on the Easyjet software app and it cost us more money at the airport. I won't be flying Easyjet anymore.,nan,3.0,nan

The flight was smooth and flight attendants were nice. Staff in Naples were very nice especially when i got mad about the carry-on policy. The staff in Venice were very nice they helped me get on my flight quicker since I was about to miss it. They were nice enough to hold my spot in line while I went to go pay for my luggage.

Informative flight deck and friendly cabin crew who for not one moment do I think want be be greeting every single passenger onboard but they do it and it's invaluable in my opinion leading to positive customer perception. Naturally being an airline of it's type anything you want onboard bar the toilet is chargable. Not a problem as what's on offer is priced reasonably the selection being good and if it's hot food you're purchasing it comes to you hot not lukewarm. Cabin crew seem to be far more visible during the flight than on some airlines which is undoubtedly a positive. Whilst no one expects them trolling the aisles for the who flight it is great to see them other than during cabin preparation and service times. Definitely an airline I'd have no hesitation in recommending. Comfortable on time flight priced competitively clean and comfortable cabin. Wishful thinking would have me hope some of the national airlines would embrace some of easyjets best practices but that will never happen so easyjet where practicable and price dependant would always be my first choice.,nan,4.0,nan

The Southend boarding staff are rude. My wife and I both had small cabin luggage and straw hats in separate plastic bags. Yes I know Easyjet have a one bag policy which we knew about before we flew but please tell me why Easyjet requires customers to take the hat out of a see-through bag and put it on rather than employ common sense. I suppose we must wait for Easyjet to adopt the same cabin baggage policy that Ryanair has been forced to adopt (ie. you are allowed a personal item). Previously we have ranked Easyjet higher than Ryanair. After two recent flights with Ryanair over the last couple of months I think we will now stick with Ryanair and avoid Easyjet. Thankfully Easyjet staff at Faro do not apply Easyjet's ridiculous rules.,nan,2.0,nan

On a short flight they managed to serve food and also interact with passengers. The one thing to prevent giving a score of 10 for satisfaction was the cleanliness of the cabin.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,A first and last time flight experience. Flight from Gatwick to Prague in late August. We followed the rules about bag dimensions and weights and checked in 1 bag each and proceeded to the holding area. Finally a call that our flight was boarding and an extended stampede of passengers to Gate 25 only to find we were further held before boarding. Here we were met with a very unfriendly ground staff member telling us that we were only allowed 1 bag not 2 as we were carrying (1 x wheelie + 1 x accessories). Having checked with the EZ web site just 10 days earlier which clearly indicates that a conforming carry on bag and an additional accessories bag was acceptable my wife and I found ourselves along with plenty of other passengers in a difficult space trying to squeeze our accessories bags into a single carry on. Having got into the plane that was about 2/3 full the PA system was telling us that small bags should be stowed under the seats in front of us. Clearly the people at EZ have no idea about presenting a uniform message. In my case 3 different messages. Does the left hand really know what the right hand is doing? A further delay occurred when the ground staff wouldn't issue a receipt for GBP 45 for an unfortunate passenger who couldn't squeeze 2 into 1 and it had to go in the hold. Rightly she refused to board the plane until a receipt was provided which saw us with a departure delay of around 30 minutes. The aircrew seemed more interested in themselves than providing a customer focused service.,nan,2.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,We flew from London Gatwick airport to Antalya Turkey in September 2014. What a mess! When we arrived at the bag drop there were two long queues moving rather slowly. EasyJet staff was running madly around the queues calling out for the passengers of the flights that are about to depart. These passengers (us among them) were then moved from inside the general queues to the fast track queue. The bag drop person informed us that the flight was delayed by 1 hour (this information never appeared on the airport display). We figured we had enough time to have a quick lunch. While waiting for our food I went to the information booth to double-check where the lady told me that our flight is not really being delayed all that much maybe by 1/2 hour or less - still no update on any of the airport displays. We quickly bagged our lunch and rushed to the gate. There was still no plane at the gate. Eventually it arrived late (the airport display still had the original departure time no update) and the boarding began. What a mess! After the initial boarding call for privileged EasyJet loyalty program members general boarding call was announced without any regard to the row numbers (i.e. everyone entered in random order) - but the airplane door was closed for some reason so after standing for a while in the line many people went back to the waiting area. Finally the door was open and everyone went inside the plane. Because the boarding order was not related in any way to the location of the people inside the aircraft (normally the rear rows board first to avoid congestion) chaos inside the aircraft followed and the boarding itself took a long time. The flight itself was uneventful no problems upon arrival luggage was offloaded quickly. If this airline can introduce some order into its operational activities I will be happy to use its services again. Also our flight may have been an exception - I do realize that one should not generalize based on a single flight experience.,nan,4.0,nan

However EasyJet has recently blocked its gates off from the main departures terminal so you have no access whatsoever to any restaurants shops or lounges. This is a real killer as their concourses have little to nothing to offer including seating. Basically is was enough to convince me to stop flying EasyJet from Amsterdam.

Return slightly less easy 45 minute delay incurred by problematic engine starting system. Again crew ensured there were no worries and that we were comfortable. Pleased to see ground staff in Russia spoke English.

In March I received notice from them that their daily flight from Rome to Nice would change from 11.55 AM to 7.15pm. I had to change my own schedule because I know what kind of headache I would get trying to get a refund from them. On the day of the flight I found out that there's no use of printing your own boarding pass beforehand because there's still a long line at the check in desks. There's no separate lines for bag-drop. After dropping my baggage I was told that the flight will be delayed for 40-minutes. Then during boarding the crew told me that I couldn't bring my hand bag because I already had a back pack with me. I had to drop one or pay 55EUR. I offered 70EUR cash but was told they only accepted credit card. I will never use this airline again.,nan,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,Friday night flight from Glasgow to London Gatwick. We arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern Scotland. Flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to Tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. At check-in we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyJet would try to push the flight forward. The opposite happened. Our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. Eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. Staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. There were no easyJet representatives to speak to only gate staff. When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.,nan,2.0,nan

Boarding at Bari a shambles. Ushered through to the bridge but then waited 15 minutes on staircase as they won't pay to use the full bridge service. Arrived a bit late at Gatwick but to South Terminal. Fine for me as I was alone and catching the train but a real pain for anyone expecting to be met at the North Terminal. And not a word from the cabin crew and no ground crew to offer any apology or explanation. Not good enough.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Have travelled several times with easyJet and continue to be very satisfied with the service provided. Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.,nan,4.0,nan

He was not only very informative but highly entertaining taking any pressure off the cabin crew due to circumstances. Although late in departure we arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Return flight also excellent with a good crew but information in main lounge was poor regarding gate and boarding. Without doubt the 'new' arrangements regarding allocated seating has made the experience that more civilised when boarding.

Whilst in the UK we heard of the computer problems at NATS but were relieved to hear on the way to the airport that problems were solved. Arriving there 3.5 hours before the flight was due we decided to have something to eat. Then a got a message on my iphone: we are very sorry but your flight EZ 8883 has been cancelled. Please contact Easyjet.com etc. This prompted us to go to the Easyjet desk but unfortunately there were already some 200 people before us in long rows with only 2 easyjet employees to assist. Therefore I (fortunately) decided to change my booking online and managed to get a return flight the following day in the evening. Then after 1.5 hours an easyjet employee climbed on a stand and shouted that everybody should see to changing their booking themselves and that accommodation to spend the night had been arranged at the Hilton Hotel. Upon arrival there Hilton knew nothing and was full to the brim. So back to the Easyjet desk only to find out that there were no more rooms but also no more Easyjet employees! Fortunately we managed to find some spare bedrooms in the Block hotel at Gatwick. Even getting a boarding pass proved to be a problem: as I had changed my booking using my iphone I was of course unable to print my boarding pass. So we went to Easyjet in the south terminal and asked them to print the boarding pass. That was not possible we had to go to the North terminal as we would leave from there. After some talking the man behind the desk told us check in was not open yet but after we told him we had already checked in electronically he managed to come up with two traditional boarding passes.,nan,2.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,My gripe is over a flight from Verona to LGW - problems were caused by Italian strikes and on checking in at the airport we were informed that an 11.45 flight had been delayed to 19.15 - not only informed by the check-in lady she also wrote it on our boarding pass and it was showing on the airport screens. She also told us to return to the airport at 1800 hours. We said to the very nice lady (who disappeared about five times as they were obviously being briefed on what to do) that we were going back into town for the day which we did. Due to the delay and a 3 hour drive on return we were looking at booking a hotel for the night at Gatwick but just to check whether we were being told the truth about the 19.15 departure time I decided to check when the rescheduled outward flight was going to leave LGW on the easyjet flight scanner - because it was actually in the air and on further inspection our flight had been rescheduled back to 1250pm - showing on both easyjet and airport websites. Jump into taxi and return to airport. Easyjet (and their agents) must have known at the time we were dropping our bags that the outward flight was actually happening as the plane must have been loaded and on the taxiway at LGW. Also easyjet made no attempt to communicate with us by email or mobile phone. Talking to others on the flight they had been asked at check-in to leave contact details and had been phoned (one family from about 40 miles away had got back home and had to turn around again almost immediately).

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,I recently booked a trip from London to Jersey for 4 people on easyjet which was a complete mess. One of the passengers arrived separately from the rest of us. He processed to easyjet check-in desk to get a boarding pass and was given the wrong boarding pass by the staff member. He never checked the boarding pass and managed to clear security at the airport with it. When the remanding 3 passengers tried to clear security with our boarding pass this was then it was discovered that the boarding passes were mixed up. This took sometime to be resolved but eventually did. As it was nearly time for our flight to leave we hurried to the gate only to find that is was already closed. At no point during this period did easyjet page us to advise that the gate was closing or that it was the last call for us (the passengers). We had to go back to easyjets desk in the departure area and waited over 45 minutes before someone came to the desk to see us. We had the use the phone on the desk to call an easyjet staff member 7 times before someone arrived. When someone did arrive the matter was not handled with any urgency. We were taken back to customer service desk and were told that it is our responsibility to get to the get to the gate on time. In order to change the ticket we would need to pay. We advised them of the error made my easyjet staff of giving the wrong boarding pass to the wrong passenger. We also asked why we were not paged and was told that easyjet doesn't page customers. They will only do so if you have checked in a bag. We did not check in any bags as we were only going to jersey for a day. I told the agent it was discrimination as easyjet assumes that all passengers are literate. Also it is common practice for airlines to page passengers if they have checked in and not arrived at the gate. We were offered the next easyjet flight which was in the afternoon at nearly 4pm which meant our day trip would not happen. Tried phoning customer service and we were meet with the same no help attitude. In the end we when to jersy and was only able to spend 2 hours. A very unsatisfactory trip. Since then trying to get customer service to take some action has been terrible.,nan,1.0,nan

The contrast could not be more stark. Boarding passes indicated a boarding time of 18.05 for a 18.35 departure. Approximately an hour before the due time boarding was announced which came as a surprise. An entire planeload of passengers were then processed through the boarding gate only to be left standing in an unlit hot covered walkway for just short of 30 minutes. Whilst my husband and I are able bodied there were any number of elderly passengers and very young children amongst our number who quickly became tired. This was an unpleasant experience but we were staggered to learn from regular passengers on this flight that this is standard prior to departure. From the moment the cabin doors closed pretty much until the wheels touched the tarmac in Liverpool 4 hours 15 minutes later those of us in the rear rows of seats were subjected to an absolute barrage of noise from the staff in the rear galley. During a long evening flight it clearly never occurred to them at any point that their passengers may wish to have some peace in which to rest read or sleep. Even the ""trolley service"" was conducted in between their gripping chats on many occasions causing them to have to ask passengers to repeat their orders as they clearly hadn't listened to them in the first place. We were both glad to finally exit the aircraft and both agreed on walking across the tarmac in highs wind and rain that we would not have had much confidence in this cabin crew to competently handle anything outside gossip and moaning.

Not sure what the point of the baggage drop is when you have to join an endless queue with people arguing about seats and luggage. The check in at Marrakech airport was farcical. We joined a queue with 4 families ahead of us. There was already a woman at the counter who kept arguing with the counter staff for over half an hour. The checking clerk kept disappearing and nothing appeared to be resolved. Then a single-man checked in quickly. He was followed by a large family group who appeared to be completely unable to fill in there own exit cards. The check clerk proceeded to fill in each form for them taking over half an hour! The family then proceeded to tag each piece of luggage with security strips. Our conclusion is you need to arrive 3 hours before the flight in order check in. We were most disappointed.,nan,4.0,nan

We had not luggage so arrived at the airport at 6pm. No information on the gate was available - we then learned that the flight was delayed by one hour. No one on the ground had information to give us. Delayed by another hour. We finally get to Gatwick and we were delayed again because there were no ground staff.

Would it hurt that much? Had then to change flights to the other day paid 160 EUR more for 2 passengers and they weren't even able to give me a receipt with theirs and mine fiscal number I could only have it asking through the internet but it's actually impossible if you don't ask for it prior and through the process of booking.

Other regular flyers confirmed this to be the case. The flight was due to leave at 21.25 actually boarded at 23.21 - funnily enough just within the two hour deadline for claiming compensation. No full explanation on their website and I'm afraid the old excuse 'technical issues' just doesn't wash when you overhear other airline staff mention the fact there weren't enough planes to fulfil the bookings promised!

There were 3 flights of easyjet leaving all at the same time. This terminal consists in a suffocating atmosphere with considerably bad infrastructure and used only for departures of low cost airlines. I was assigned a seat at the last row of the plane and not only there wasn't no window - in what it seems a business measure to book the more possible passengers at the expense of the seat pitch - but the plane itself was a really old A319 very degraded but the worst was the total lack of cleaning on the plane the seats textiles had a vivid brown in an absolutely act of negligence. The Portuguese male flight attendants chat a lot between both of them loud and clear as if the passengers were interested in knowing about their lives. Easyjet tends to be an excellent alternative choice but this time failed low of expectations. And please stop selling cameras among others throughout the flight.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Outward bound was Gatwick to Agadir. It was a traditional 'sardine tin' flight with no leg room and the aisle armrest didn't go up so it was very difficult getting in and out without holding the headrest of the seat in front where a poor young man attempting to sleep was continuously disturbed by me getting up and down as we had a baby with us who wouldn't sit still and it was a 7 30am flight. However the return journey was a total surprise we were on a newer plane with lots of leg room the aisle arm rest went up so we had lots of space and I didn't need to hold onto anything to get in and out of my seat. The seats were a lot thinner but surprisingly more comfortable than the previous thicker seats. On both journeys the planes were on time the staff were friendly- more on the outward flight 2 of the flight attendants on the way back obviously had lost the ability to smile so overall my first experience with easy jet was a positive one and I would definitely use them again.

Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.,nan,5.0,nan

Probably the most uncomfortable easyjet flight we've ever had (A319). Had seats 20 E & F which were extremely cramped. Luckily the flight left almost on time but with an extended flight time due to head winds it was the best part of two hours of purgatory.

Eventually the problem was sorted out but the confusion could have been avoided if there were signs up at both Bristol and Reykjavik airports telling people with just hand luggage that they don't need to go to baggage drop but can proceed to wherever the next step is. Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink.

Of course there was no one there. Eventually a single rep turned up and had to deal with us all. After 30 minutes those with no baggage we were led away, those of us with hold bags waited another 30 minutes before we could reclaim our bags and join the queue for a taxi to the Copthorne Hotel. The promised a shuttle bus but it never materialised. The boarding passes issued for the replacement flight the following day sent all passengers to the wrong terminal. It takes longer to get from the Gatwick runway to the terminal exits than it does to fly from Aberdeen to Gatwick. There is always a palava getting off, no steps, no chocks. Too windy.

Even with the travel time and train or car park extras it was worth the saving. Hand bags only, so nothing to check in, but it wouldn't have been a problem as there were so few people at the check in desks. Southend Airport only has around 20 flights a day so it wasn't crowded except when we queued for our flight. Boarding was slow as they made most people check that their bag fitted in the measuring device. Onboard you could see why as there wasn't much space for bags if you were late. We were two thirds of the way in the queue and just managed to get our bags in, but some rows from the seats. I wish we'd been with our bags further up as we had parents with a toddler behind us that kept kicking the seat, putting it's hands through the gap etc. I know this wasn't easyJet's fault, but glad it was only a short flight. Despite the short length, the seats are still hard and lack neck support. So glad to get off at the end. At Amsterdam it was a new experience using the ""G"" gates. These are low cost I assume as we had to up and down stairs in the terminal as well as from the plane Coming back we got to the gate earlyish so we were in the queue to get onboard quickly and got our bags above our seats. Prompt loading and good to see the crew helping load bags to get the flight away on time. Looong taxi to the runway. Took 10 mins to pass the ""regular"" D gates BA/KLM use for UK flights. However departure was ontime and with flying time of 35 mins back to Southend, can't complain. Off the plane and through immigration in about 10 mins. Easyjet offer a bus service in the air, a no frills trip. It's fine as it got us from A to B and back again but could improve the comfort of it's seats. The seats are the only thing you will have interaction with if you don't check in a bag or buy some of the overpriced on board food, so it would do them a world of good to improve the comfort of them.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

However my most recent experience, a return journey between Gatwick and Edinburgh, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding boarding. At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them. Overall I do like easyJet but their boarding procedures are becoming inconsistent and a tad shambolic.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

After many apologies to other passengers for queue jumping and running underneath barriers we reached the bag drop desk and the Easyjet representative told me to run with my luggage as I had already checked in on line. She said she was not sure we would make it but encouraged us to go for it. We were held up slightly at security as due to our earlier encounters with the car I had omitted to remove a bottle of water from my hand luggage! This resulted in us leaving security 10 minutes before departure and with a heavy heart and heavy bags we run through duty free to the departure gate. The Easyjet representative made a quick call on the radio and told us to run as quickly as we could down the airbridge. Staff efficiently tagged our luggage and on we went - departing Malaga on time.

At the gate, which was posted approximately 50 minutes before departure, I was impressed that gate staff were politely but firmly enforcing their hand baggage policy. For example a group in front of me were requested to pack their hand bags into their wheelie bags as they were allowed only one piece on board. Speedy Boarding was honoured and well policed with other passengers being politely asked to wait when they tried to board. However we then had to wait 5-10 minutes standing on the airbridge until we were allowed on board. Onboard I had no problem getting my bags up in the locker near me. This aircraft had the new seating and the legroom in this exit row seat was superb. The crew were very friendly and professional. My only criticism was that on a flight duration of 4h 30 mins they could easily have done more than two runs with the food and drinks trolley service. I would have bought another drink if they had!

The existence of easyJet (and to a lesser extent, Ryanair) has allowed us to travel frequently and cheaply, which would have been impossible 20 years ago, so thank you for that, easyJet. Yes, one can be picky and identify minor irritations at times, e.g. on this latest flight to Malaga we were marginally late leaving Liverpool because boarding was delayed despite this being the plane's first flight of the day. Such gripes are trivial, however, in comparison with the efficient and good-humoured service provided by all the easyJet staff we have encountered over the years.

The seats were like church pews, upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch! This despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright! After about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. We were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. Cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness, rather than efficient. The descent into Funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a ""missed approach"" due to the cross winds being outside the aircraft's limits. We briefly joined a holding pattern, but were diverted to Gran Canaria. We were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt.

Easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour - there being no taxis at the airport!

We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an ""upfront fee"" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: ""Excuse me Sir"" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology.

My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers.

As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated ""right, it doesn’t fit it will have to be checked in"". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay £45 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied ""well you won’t be flying then"". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn’t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her ""well trained"" staff couldn’t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager’s response was simply ""ok, yes it can go in with you"". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet £45 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet?

Flew from London Gatwick to Lisbon. Let's start with the booking process. This was easy and straightforward, living up to its name.

Afterall, we are already paying to fly. The bags - less said. Anyway, the London Gatwick experience was so-so. If you're not an easyJet Plus customer you can't bring anything else apart from one cabin bag-not even a small handbag. I think this is just ridiculous. A handbag is like a 5th limb for most people. Having said that, when returning, the staff at the boarding gate in Lisbon terminal 2 (budget airlines only terminal), allowed the passenger in front of me to carry her handbag which was almost as big as her cabin bag. She wasn't an easyJet Plus customer as those who were went through another lane. She was told to queue like we all were. This inconsistency is what lets easyJet down. I have to say, their pilots on both leg of the journey were brilliant. High winds, but not a bump when landing. The bag drop process in Gatwick was smooth. The one in Lisbon was so-so (might have to do with it being a budget terminal). Calling you to the gate 45 minutes before departure and then to go through passport control was a very silly set-up.

Facilities were adequate enough and free bus to terminal 1 for train station was easy to find. Used the easyJet app on my phone for check in etc. Impressed as gives you a message when your gate us announced and all that. Works well and easy to use compared to other airline apps.

Due to problem with plane the easyjet Manchester departure was slightly delayed and some passengers could not fly as the plane that was substituted was smaller. We did get on the flight but all our seats were changed, for a short flight and being older children this was not a huge issue but we had paid for allocated seating and it took several unanswered emails and eventually a long and no doubt costly call to Easyjet to try to claim the payment back. They tried to offer me free seat allocation on the next flight, as I'm hoping never to have to use this airline again I politely refused and was told a refund would be given in 5-10 days - time will tell! Return trip was delayed but no announcement made or info given, when finally boarded in Venice the cabin staff were to say the least brusque, we were seated at very back of flight and of course no room was left for baggage, rather than try to help by checking overheads at the front of the plane a staff member thought it appropriate to just shout at my daughters to sit down, when she explained she had no where to put her baggage and could not ""go against the tide"" of still boarding passengers to check the front she was told she would just have to put it in the hold, how this was going to be managed by my daughter was not mentioned and clearly the staff were not going to help - eventually another staff member did find some space and called my daughter down from her seat at the back to the front to store her baggage - not a major issue but overall the experience is one of lack of care, whilst safety should always be paramount they seem disorganised at best and uncaring at worst, helping a passenger could actually save them time in the long run and when they are obviously running late and working against a tight time frame you would think that experience would of taught them this - the whole customer service ethos has passed them by and I got the impression on both flights that passengers were very much a necessary evil and the cabin crews life would be so much better if they just didn't have to deal with them.

On 28 Feb 2016 I was supposed to take a flight from Naples to Paris Orly. Unfortunately this was cancelled due to the weather conditions. Ground staff did all they could to help passengers. We were told to come back the next morning for a new flight scheduled at 9.55. This flight finally departed after 13.00. The reason given by the captain (in Italian and English - translated into French by a stewardess) was that an emergency slide had to be repaired before departure and that he was waiting for the final paperwork. Result was a near 22 hour delay on arrival in Paris. I accept this misfortune could happen with any airline. What I do not accept is that on 15 June I am still waiting for the reimbursement of my out of pocket expenses and that EasyJet have claimed that they do not owe any compensation under European legislation as the flight was delayed due to weather conditions - that was the case for the original flight, but not for the replacement flight. By way of comparison following a mechanical failure on a Flybe flight compensation was finalized within 24 hours.

To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants.

Unfortunately, we did not know this policy until we get to the gate and they aggressively asked for our money. After traveling throughout Europe for some time, we have never had any problem with our baggage. Most airlines have allowed one small bag and one overhead bag, so while we still have all of that luggage, we have to pay for what they already have space for on their flight. Furthermore, once we had boarded the flight, we noticed ample space in all of the overhead luggage compartments for the bags while they had specifically said at the gate that due to the full flight, they could not fit our baggage. They charge you for all food and beverages as well. The policies this airline holds are frankly absurd as they try to rip you off. Definitely not worth what you pay for.

So far, now 22nd August, despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation, no refund of our bus fares, no explanation. EasyJet Customer Service is anything but a customer service.

If you are aware of this fact, and what it entails, then you know they will get you to where you are going, quickly and fairly efficiently, but that comfort and convenience are not high on the agenda. Their ground facilities will be using the worst and most out-of-they way parts of the airport they are flying to and from (in my case Terminal H from Schiphol, which is the least pleasant part of the airport, despite being relatively new, and London Stansted, of which many more passengers than I have already fittingly described on this site).

No reasonable explanation was given for the delay.

We used EasyJet to book airfare from Paris-Barcelona-Paris and a week later for Paris-Napes-Paris. Trip to Barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal, onto busses, then to a plane on tarmac - similar debark in Barcelona.  Inconvenient, slow. On the return trip, an EasyJet staffer pulled us out of line, measured our bags. One bag was 1"" too long. She said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. We were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. Later looking online, it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bag/purse per passenger is general, but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carry-on bag is allowed. Very confusing.  I can embrace the concept of a low-cost carrier but be clear about what you're not offering. Not even water, soda, juice or crackers was provided. Seats do not recline. Friendly helpful service was non-existent. Staff at BCN to help with complaints did not exist either. Worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight - we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. Had I not happen to wake up and check my phone at 3:30am, we would have been totally screwed. As it was, I spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 one-way tickets to Naples.  EasyJet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. The return flight was an Air France flight. That wasn't cancelled. So, now I needed one-way tickets (expensive) and last minute (even more expensive). What did EasyJet offer in compensation? They would rebook me (at no charge) another flight to Naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. Two issues.  Next available EasyJet flight was 5 days later (bye-bye vacation).  Value as for 1/2 round fair purchased a month ago. I will never fly EasyJet again. Wish I could rate lower than a 1. For the last kick in the pants, EasyJet also booked my rental car.

Tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall I found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. In normal circumstances I could endure this for a short three hour flight, however, a fate would have it the seat in front wouldn't stay in an upright position - it was in a permanent reclining position - it was broken. I asked the Stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do, which was reasonable. She seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so I sat with the Lady in front practically sitting on my lap. After a couple of hours I decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane, and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. So I sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. The Chief Stewardess rudely asked me why I was sitting there so I told her that row 16 seat was broken. She said I would have to pay extra to sit at the front so I asked her if I would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours - she said not and that I would have to return to my broken seat. As a matter of principle I refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to Row 16. On my return home I sent a complaint to Easyjet on 29th May. I received the following response right back ""Dear easyJet Customer Thank you for contacting easyJet via our online form. We aim to reply to you within 3days, although in busy periods this may be longer. We’ll be in touch soon. Regards, easyJet Customer Services"". That was on 29th May 2016 - it is now 3rd August 2016, almost ten weeks later and I haven't heard anything more from Easyjet. Seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesn't surprise me one little bit. I am a reasonable person who realises that things go wrong now and then but the disgraceful attitude of staff onboard and the total ignoring of my post-flight complaint proves to me that Customer Service is very low on the priority list.

Bag drop only took about 15 mins but unfortunately we weren't told of the 50 minute delay which they must have know about as it was the inbound flight that was delayed so we could have sat outside in the sun for a bit longer. Gate came up as if flight was on time so everyone gathered and We stood there for 50 minutes wondering why we weren't boarding. That's my only complaint. Once on board. Good leg-room for a budget airline. Food and drinks Ok (including hot tea).

The plane departed on time and the flight was better than I expected. The cabin staff was very friendly and the seats are comfortable enough. The legroom was better than legroom in other low-cost flights. I had to pay for my seat and for the food. But the focaccia I have bought for 3.5€ was hot and very delicious. Juice for 3€ was a bit expensive if you compare it with the good price of the focaccia but it was also good. The small room where I had to wait before Boarding was not comfortable because I did not have a seat for 10 minutes. Like in other low-cost or regional airlines there was no IFE but for 2.5 hours it was okay.

We elected to pay with a card which didn't please the female staff member as she didn't have a card reader and with my wifes card on display for all to see she wrote out a receipt giving every passenger in close proximity a clear view of the numbers. When my wife objected to this it was made clear to her that this was frowned upon and we could be banned from the flight. For our return on 1st November the staff in Berlin were totally different and my own bag was put in the hold free of charge to free up cabin space. On checking I have found that along with others easyJet changed their policy on hand luggage a while back and while I accept we were wrong, the company and it's employees ignorant attitude and primitive methods leave a very bad taste and we will not go with them again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Landed at Seville and were kept on the plane for over an hour while they worked out what to do. Could not go back to Gibraltar as weather worsened. Eventually bussed back to Gibraltar which took 3 hrs and finally arrived there at 8pm instead of 11.55am. At no point were we offered a drink or food on the plane - unless we paid for it. A goodwill gesture of free food or drink would have made a huge difference. The next day we discovered that both flights after ours had landed in Gibraltar and all flights into Malaga had also landed - why couldn't our pilot? I am aware landing at Gibraltar can be hazardous and have been diverted to Malaga on one occasion a few years ago but the detour we had to endure seemed pointless and totally unnecessary.

EasyJet use terminal 1 at MUC but there were no indications on the boarding pass of which zone to use for bag drop - I ended up having to ask at the information desk and then trek all the way down to zone Z by the S-Bahn station. Some simple signage and advice on the app or website (I did check before travelling) would have allowed my taxi to drop me at the right place. Passport control not within EasyJet's control I admit but they should be making representations to the authorities  was incredibly slow. Security was fairly quick. Then boarding - I've rarely had a more unpleasant experience. Coming through the gate at the ""last and final urgent call"", I am greeted with the dreaded bus. Already packed of course, and more passengers pile on behind me well after cut-off time. We stood on the bus - cramped, cold, uncomfortable - for over 15 minutes before we were driven to the stand. Boarding once off the bus was quick enough, we taxied on time and were in the air by 0955. Seat was the usual cramped LCC arrangement. No recline at all. Slept, so no idea on service.

Arrived into Bristol early, with a short walk from the aircraft to the baggage claim/passport control. Return flight was on time. Gate at Bristol was located quite a walk from the departures area, crowds of people walking through corridor means that it's not ideal for travellers with small children, wheelchairs, etc. Boarding was efficient and flight left on time.

We were informed that the flight was full, and l must praise the cabin crew for the courteous, friendly and helpful way in which they managed the boarding process and accommodated everybody's luggage into the overhead bins. The aircraft was clean and tidy. We were told by the Captain that there would be a 30 minute delay leaving Palma due to aircraft congestion in the London area (the communication from the flight deck crew was accurate and informative). A reasonably priced Buy On Board food and beverages service was offered twice during this 2 hour flight. The only disappointing aspect to the journey was when we arrived at a remote stand at London Gatwick. Although the bus was ready and waiting to transfer the passengers to the North Terminal, it took nearly 25 minutes for ground service personnel to arrive and position the stairs against the side of the aircraft.

The outbound flight was a bit bumpy and we had to make two attempts at landing due to a cross wind. But we were warned by the Captain that the plane in front of us had reported 'A bumpy ride over the Bay of Biscay'. The return flight we arrived at Gatwick 25 minutes early due to a tail wind the return flight was perfect. Cabin Crew on both legs operated a slick service and worked well as a team. The cabin service was excellent on both legs and the food was hot and fresh. Its price was the same has the outlets in the airport. The information from the cockpit and cabin was clear, concise and friendly. It was nice to see the Captain on leaving the aircraft on both legs.

The crew are very helpful, of course they try to sell a lot but they do it in a friendly way. Food and Drink is affordable, especially if you get a meal deal, but some of the products are extremely over priced. The magazine is basically sell sell sell!

Oh and if you are going to encourage passengers to bring only cabin luggage then redesign your planes to cope with this, because you can't get your holiday off to a better start than by having to stand on the runway/steps in the cold, wind or rain whilst the people at the front of the queue are rearranging their baggage in the overhead lockers and blocking the aisles.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Alas easyJet is not the airline it used to be. On December 23rd I flew back from Gatwick to Edinburgh, the plane due to take us was held up in Belfast by a storm. When it finally came (I was supposed to catch the 7pm plane) it was given to the passengers waiting from the delayed 5pm plane. To cut the story short the plane we finally got put on (and then sat waiting) finally reached Edinburgh after 1 am on morning of 24th Dec. This is because easyJet now juggle with planes and have too few to cover the short falls. Last night my Edinburgh plane was again delayed to Gatwick, should have been 6.55 pm and it finally got in at 9pm. One other winge is that they frequently fly you in the plane that differs from the diagram of one used to allocate tickets, twice now I have booked £10 extra for sitting in row with extra leg room over wings (Exit) and ended up in one with virtually no leg room as its a different plane. No one explains this and yet they take money paid for space.

Both flights with Easyjet have been great. Bright, modern aircraft, enthusiastic but not pushy cabin staff. Drinks a bit expensive but I'm in holiday mode so I don't mind. The early departure means an extended first day and the return is again, at a reasonable hour. Plenty of chat from the flight deck and overall a really good experience. I always pay a bit extra for exit row seats as I'm a bit lanky and with this comes Speedy Boarding so there's always room for my luggage in the aircraft. However, I will add that it seems to be a free for all in Arrecife with no discernible advantage to have SB.

I always travel with the same luggage, but thanks to the person in charge from easyjet I had this problem - other passengers pointed out to me that they passed with luggage bigger than mine. So my advice is don't ever pay those 60 euros if you get in the same situation as I did, report it to the airport, do what you need to do, but don't pay that money. 10 people who came after me had to put the luggage on hold, that is to send it for free because the plane was full, so for them they could do that but I had to pay 60 euros.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

However on our return on Sunday 05.02.17 the flight was delayed and we were sent to the waiting gate where we had to wait for some considerable time without any seats to sit on.

I didn't know that on these low cost airlines that you don't get any checked bags and when paying for it, it was also ""overweight"".

The overall flight experience was stable, but very cramped. I am around 174cm tall but the leg room is so little that even I felt uncomfortable during the 40 or 50 minutes flight. The seat is not adjustable, thin, hard, within expectation though as a budget airline. That said, I got my return ticket for around £100, without checked in baggage. That was not a good deal to be honest. A lady in front of me carried a small pouch and a medium sized handbag. Even though it really was a very small pouch, an easyjet employee asked her to put the pouch into the handbag because she recognized the pouch as one handcarry luggage.

A320,Economy Class,1.0,April 2017,3.0,5.0,nan,no,Manchester to Antalya,4.0," |  EasyJet flight EZY1821 on 19th April from Manchester to Antalya. Having travelled extensively for over 50 years, never have I experienced such appalling, intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. From the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight.  Whilst I understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with (as do all other customer facing roles) the majority of yesterday's passengers appeared to be middle aged, sensibly behaved golfers & regular, well mannered holiday makers. We were all initially warned that the crew had a ""list of passenger names"" who'd made purchases from Manchester airport duty-free and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found 'guilty' they would have the duty-free confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. An example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to Tenerife, and was conveyed as if this was a threat. One  does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. As far as I could see, most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. The in-flight safety demonstration then commenced, but the steward paused it, and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be ""returning to the terminal and we'd be going nowhere"". Much as I fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples (there were many others) there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. I did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. I witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger (behind his back) as ""grandad"". Another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger, there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. When the cabin steward announced that in flight duty-free sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in Turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight (hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in Turkey). We subsequently did not purchase anything from duty-free in protest to such slanderous remarks, nor did fellow passengers nearby. It was a relief to disembark, in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. I have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before, however on this occasion I feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay. I enjoy flying as a rule and have never come away from a journey feeling nervous of the crew. I sincerely hope we don't encounter this particular crew ever again.

However, now as a parent my needs and requirements have changed and i do not think Easyjet takes care of this customer base at all. On a bright side - staff was nice and at points very helpful. However my stroller was not delivered to the aircraft at my destination - not an airport restriction as even Ryanair does this - I had to wait for my stroller more than people for their luggage (not easy with active toddler) - on the way back in Gatwick again I did not get the stroller and when I asked if it will be at the top of the sleeve was told it will not be available until baggage claim. That is a very long walk carring a toddler and waiting for passport control. I was told that 'maybe' i can find a yellow pushchair that i guess are used to lower the cost of service. None was available to anyone on this flight - not only me. If easyJet wants to use this system than i should have an option to prebook this chair or have enough available for all. Otherwise they cant claim they provide the service. - at the end again I had to wait until most of the luggage rolled off I fly a lot with my toddler - low cost and not - but never before I have had to endure this inconvenience.

Speedy boarding did not work as other passengers simply unhooked the chain separator on the bus to board at the same time.

In flight catering was started shortly after take off and for the prices charged good value. The Captain had provided a detailed update on what was happening and actually came into the cabin to speak directly to everyone over a short delay to take off due to flight congestion in Marrakech. After two hours into the flight, the Captain announced that a member of the flight attendant crew had been taken ill and he had decided to divert to Lisbon to get her medical treatment. Immediately the remaining crew took steps to get the plane ready for a landing and the Captain continued to supply information on what was happening and how problems on finding a replacement crew member were handled. It was handled efficiently that everyone was fully informed and understanding of the problems. After landing the crew member was taken away by ambulance and within 30 minutes a replacement arrived. Whilst we waited the Captain kept us informed and walked through the plane to answer anyone who had specific questions. The flight continued on to Marrakech arriving two hours late.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,June 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Paris to London,3.0," | This is a direct return trip from London Luton Airport to Paris and back with easyJet. To be fair, the trip to Paris was ok, but the flight back was terrible, with not one, but a series of unpleasant occurrences. The problematic flight from Paris to London Luton was due to set off at 9:55pm, but was delayed by an hour and took off at 10:55pm Paris time. Despite the delay, the boarding procedures were extremely inefficient. There was no sense of urgency despite the tardiness, especially given the fact that this is such a late flight. The gate number also changed mid-way through the delayed hour. When we scanned the boarding pass, my friend was stopped by one of the staff as he was carrying two backpacks. Despite the fact some people's roller cabin luggage alone is the size of my friend's two backpacks combined, that staff insisted that my friend must pack everything into one backpack only. My friend had to step out, repack everything into one bulging, overflowing backpack before he is let through. The content brought through the gate doesn't change, the two backpacks were far from exceeding the luggage allowance in the first place, and the staff has created nothing more than sheer annoyance and further delay in our already delayed trip. The flight was around 50 minutes long and given the 1-hr time difference, reached London Luton airport at around 10:45pm London time. By this time, my friend and I were very anxious as we need to catch the 11:20pm bus from the airport to the train station, if we miss that bus, we will miss the last train home and will inevitably have to spend the night out in the streets. Just when everyone is getting their luggage from the cabin and gearing to leave, a flight announcement sounded saying that the bus to the gate will not be here for another ten minutes, and we were frustrated. Despite being late for an hour, the shuttle bus to the gate is still not scheduled on time! By the time the shuttle bus came, everyone got in, and we arrived at the gate, it was 11pm and we have barely 20 minutes to run to the customs, clear it, and dash to the bus stop. I have to run and dash through the crowd like a mad person, and we hopped onto the bus with only 2 minutes to spare. I don't think I will take easyjet again.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,August 2017,2.0,5.0,nan,yes,Toulouse to London Gatwick,3.0," |  This review relates to a flight from Toulouse to London Gatwick in August 2017. I shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as I can. Firstly, I found the website easy to use and clear and follow-up emails were constructive and informative. I found the Easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. Check-in as operated in Toulouse was efficient and the staff well-presented and polite. While checking in I was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. Toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from Lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. The flight to London was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. I witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. I assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. During the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and I saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. The safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. Snacks were available for purchase. The crew failed to deal with an irresponsible parent who allowed her child to run up and down the aisle during the flight. Disembarkation was orderly.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Why not leave us on the airport! Common sense would dictate that. Plane was full of screaming kids getting impatient. Full marks for easyJet on poor services and how not to run an airline.

No queue at bag drop and boarding was well managed, despite being a very full flight.

Flew Copenhagen to Paris CDG. I flew all over Europe for a month taking bargain airlines and flew easyJet three times. By far the worst airline, and when I read reviews for Flybe, it got really bad reviews but in fact that was my best flight. Two flights on easyJet were delayed, one had the worst turbulence I've experienced and we had to circle before landing, their policy on carry on bags is absurd. Every other airline if you carry a bag and a backpack you're fine but you can volunteer to check for free, but with easyJet you have to either stuff them into one or pay $60 in order to check the bag. Additionally, twice the gate was moved after waiting at the gate it was originally assigned, which could be an airport issue but since it happened at two different airports it is suspicious. The staff were not particularly nice.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Malaga recently they decided to swap boarding gates at the last minute and there was no tannoy announcement. As we had swapped with a Newcastle flight, we had a lot of people from Newcastle in our queue going to Southend who wasn't aware the gates had been swapped.

Flight operated by SmartLynx Airlines on behalf of easyJet (24 hours notice given by easyJet via text message). Plain white, unliveried A320. Cabin crew all in SmartLynx uniforms. Cabin crew polite and no interaction with passengers unless you wanted to buy something. Announcements were clear and made in english only. Aircraft was dirty. No attempt had been made to clean aircraft during turn around. Crisps and chocolates littering the floor of row 10. Took off about 30 mins late. Zero overhead locker space left (flight not even full) by the time we boarded. SmartLynx A320 seats are bolt upright, non-adjustable and very uncomfortable. No leg room as had to store cabin bag under seat in front as all overhead lockers stuffed with cabin suitcases. Toilet was in a poor state when I used it. Soap dispenser broken and lying on its side and water draining very slowly from wash hand basin. Smooth enough flight with minimal CAT. Would not use SmartLynx by choice.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

It all started when I was on my way to to the airport when I received message that plane would be 40 minutes delay and while at the airport another when it said 2 hours and 15 minutes, that was bad but OK. Plane departed 2 hours later than scheduled, but that's when fun begin, Captain told us that we might not be able to land in Berlin because airport is closing at midnight and we might not get exception which was the case so we were diverted to Rostok. We were told that buses will be waiting for us when we exit the terminal and message from EasyJet said that cabin crew will be there to assist us and will give us some food and drinks. Reality was a bit different, when we got out, there was one bus which was close and driver nowhere to be seen (we were one of the 3 aircraft) and cabin crew got into their shuttles and left, I've stopped one from other aircraft (from my already left) and she told me to ask person at the airport, there was no person at the airport. It took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. I could understand that things like diverting can happen, but the way EasyJet handled that is beyond terrible, I thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this. I used to fly with EasyJet often and it was my favourite budget airline, but I'm done with them and I won't be flying with them again.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

When it came to boarding they made everyone sit and re-pack their bags to fit it all in 1 case - wasn't even allowed to wear my bum bag which was for my essentials (passports, money, etc). We still had plenty of room in our checked luggage but the lady on the check in desk intentionally sent off our bags then told us about the bag situation, poor customer service. If this was the case atleast notify your customer prior to sending off their checked baggage and we would have packed the backpack in their.

Flight was delayed by over an hour - it would seem this was the case for all EasyJet flights across the day. We had tried repeatedly to pay for extra legroom seats in advance but the airline's website simply refused to load on either of our phones, instead refreshing the login page over and over again. Tried to purchase seats at check-in but we were told the flight was already full and this would not be possible. Boarding was announced a good 45 minutes before we took off but this being EasyJet, it took all of that time to get people moving onto the plane. The usual stress of a lengthy queue going nowhere, ground staff coming through to check every bag they could get their orange labels on into the hold, etc etc. Our seats were beyond uncomfortable - my partner is 6'7"" and was pretty much paralysed in place for the entire flight. This is the last time we will use this airline - it may be marginally cheaper than others but the stress and hassle caused from start to finish simply isn't worth the 'savings'.

I have trusted their services for years to meet my travel needs. Yesterday my flight was delayed and not only that but when we had landed it took 20 minutes to get off as they only opened one door on the plane to allow passengers to evacuate the plane even though passengers were able to board from both doors which I did not understand. I needed to use the restroom while we were waiting to get off, although because the toilets were out of service I was unable to use them which meant I had to wait 20 minutes to use the restroom. This was not good for me at all as I have dysfunctional kidneys and makes it very painful for me to wait. My flight going to London and coming back to Belfast were both delayed.

When I arrived at the boarding line, the pre-boarding was already started. So I've been asked to put a label over my luggage to put it in the hold. Apparently the number of available spaces were ended. I just would like to know why they don't simply count. They know how many speedy boarding there are. They know if they've done the check-in and if they are inside the airport. I've seen with my eyes their staff counting with paper and pen how many luggages there are. So, the question is: is it so difficult to reserve the spaces for the speedy boarding customers? They even claim that you can get an additional luggage with you and you can skip the queue. But not if you arrive a few minutes after the started pre-boarding. When they offer to buy the speedy boarding you should tell that some advantages are valid only for a few minutes. On the flight there were free spaces for luggage and a lot of them were used for something that, based on their policy, should stay under the seat. To conclude: if you just wanna go from point A to B, it can be ok easyJet. If you're expecting to pay to have a bit better service, avoid easyJet.

Then didn't ask if sugar or milk was required and then returned with one empty sugar packet which I had to request to be changed.  I didn't know it was a rule to only ask for items once the trolley has passed once! This isn't written in terms and conditions when booking the flight!

Our flight was cancelled at the last minute, and we were notified at the boarding gate after our initial departure time. We were initially told that all flights to Madrid Barajas were being cancelled due to bad weather conditions, however a quick Google search confirmed that this was not true and that ours was the only cancelled flight to Madrid that day. We were escorted out of the airport to a poorly organised customer service area where we were promised by the customer service staff members that we would be refunded for our flights and reimbursed for our new flights to Madrid, transportation costs, accommodation and even food expenditure. We were told that we could not book another flight to Madrid with Easyjet until Monday the 10th (in over 3 days) as their flights were fully booked until then. This was not true, as they were still offering flights for that weekend on their website. However, we couldn’t do anything about it as their ‘support’ staff were unresponsive and dismissive, so we went back home to central London, and tried to look up affordable alternatives that would get us to Madrid in time for the music festival we had paid a lot of money to attend, and to the Airbnb that we had already paid for as well. The cheapest tickets we could find were £200 stand-by tickets (each) with Iberia, on top of the £80 each we had already paid for the Easyjet flight. After leaving Madrid, we were informed by Easyjet that they were actually not going to be refunding us the cost of the flights as their flight was cancelled due to bad weather, and they added that they could not refund our Gatwick express tickets as we sent them a copy of the bank receipt of the tickets with corresponding photos of the tickets, rather than an itemised receipt that we were not given from the station clerk. Overall, because the cancelled Easyjet flight, we had to spend: £280 per person for the flights, £35 each for the Gatwick Express, a wasted £60 on pre-booked accommodation in Madrid, and a lot of stress. That is over £1000 wasted between three people for a short-haul trip. Easyjet has refunded us nothing in return, thus we will never be returning to use their services.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Boarding was very slow and I must confess that the whole ""speedy boarding"" thing seems more like a gimmick, and that you are not going faster, you are just slowing everyone else instead. The plane was nice, comfortable, plane was very clean and seats were fare more spacious than what I would though, as the cabin was equipped with the new Airbus seats which provide so much more knee room! I really enjoyed the colours of the cabin. Staff was very friendly and even passed with a garbage bag before landing to let passenger get rid of all there garbage, not even normal airlines do that so I was not expecting it in a low cost airline.

We were made to wait around 5 minutes at the bottom of the aircraft steps in a 30 degrees Celsius heat. Boarding was fast and we were airborne on time. Once in the air the crew started selling. I bought myself a meal deal for around £6/7 which is a good price in my opinion. The seat was not the most comfortable but bearable for this flight. Seat pitch was good for a low cost carrier. The crew were amazing, very friendly and always smiling. We landed into London Gatwick early. When disembarking the aircraft we used the jet bridge,this is something easyJet don’t normally use.

When we asked him what we can do now he said that if we want to know more information we should go and ask about some details at EasyJet information desk.

Everything what we heard there was that they have got only 2 flights to Majorca during a week (Tuesday and Friday) and all they can offer us is a leaflet with the information how to apply for refund. They also did not tell us a reason why this flight was cancelled. I was travelling for 5 hours to the airport and after that cancellation again I had to be on my way to home for 5 next hours. It was ridiculous for all passengers.  I had to cancel all our holiday because of that cancelled flight and due to that cancellation I will not get all my money from the travel agency.

This is after the captain had told us personally that he would keep us updated. Nearly 300 people wandered around the terminal at 11.30 pm looking lost and confused. I could see what was coming so I rang a hotel and booked a room. When I went outside the terminal there were no taxis due to there being no flights due until the morning. I tried phoning but were told ""No taxis""! Then one taxi appeared and took us to the hotel.

At Berlin Schoenfeld Airport, the queue was extremely long and there were only 3 counters opened. Check-in staff were rude and unhelpful. I feel that the airline's main aim is to be voted ""most on time carrier"" at the expense of passengers. The app does not really work when you have more than 2 boarding passes. For example, I could see that I had 4 boarding passes on the app but I could only open 2 earlier passes. After the check-in staff also could not open the other 2 boarding passes, he issued us with paper passes, but he issued my son's pass twice and not mine causing further confusion and distress at the security gate. Overall, not happy with easyJet. But a positive point on easyJet in comparison with other budget carriers, they allow a child traveller to have a free check-in of a stroller / car seat. Also, instead of spamming with offers on hotel and car rentals, they could alert travellers on what is likely to happen at any particular airport (eg very slow security) as I am sure that they would have data on the number of passengers who missed flights.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

The staff who was checking me into the flight proceeded to make me pay 60 euros for my bag even though I paid extra when booking the flight to have more than one bag.

I like how the seats don't recline and I think all short haul economy seats should be like this as its so frustrating when the person in front reclines their seat. The flight departed and landed on time and the service from the crew was friendly, professional and efficient. There was a good range of food and beverages available for purchase. The easyJet app is excellent give you alerts when a gate is assigned etc. Very happy with easyJet.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,2.0,October 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Gatwick to Paris,3.0," |  Gatwick to Paris. I've waited 10 flights to see if things would improve - they didn't. Once you have checked in for a flight on the App, even if you change your reservation, the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted: confusing. The way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. Then you cannot change it yourself.  By the way, you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. I like to check in on the way to the airport once I know I will get my flight. No, you have to check in way before. Once, the check in with the app or via their website didn't work, so I tried to call the customer service helpline: waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldn't do anything. You are now on your way to the gate, it is 1/2 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. Normally no stress, not with easyjet, where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight, so you run to realize it hasn't started boarding. In short, if you have a short connection, forget about your connecting flight.  You think you are better off with a more expensive Flexi fare ticket (that is what we travel with). Good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security, but in Paris at easyJet terminal there are no fast security lanes, while in Gatwick all the lanes are decently fast.  But then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream: you are entitled to board first, but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all, standing in the jetway until you can board the plane.  The flight in itself is more or less OK, the staff are usually smiling, except when they bother you, at the first and emergency exit rows, to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders.  This time they bothered me saying that I needed to fold my iPad cover during the descent, in a way that I wasn't able to use the Bluetooth keyboard which is part of that iPad cover.",Business,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,September 2017,nan,5.0,nan,yes,Gatwick to Milan,4.0," |  As I was boarding from Gatwick to Milan on 24th September, I thought this is going to be a nightmare, I am surrounded by teenagers flying back to their country. Thankfully, the pilot saved the day. He was humourous, witty, joking and had a really good customer-approach.  When arriving to Milan, he was joking about plane arriving but no-one was there to get us with stairs, advising us to take a seat and be patient. Hope my praise will get to this particular pilot! Wishing him well and motivation to continue in his job.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Rome  to Paris,3.0," |  Rome FCO to Paris Orly, it had the best price compared to the other airlines, since I was travelling with a big Indonesian group and paid for all the flight tickets for them as gifts. My experience onboard two flights were pleasant, the cabin crews were nice and the interior of the aircraft is not bad at all for a budget airline. Sadly, the good experience on board was  ruined by the horrible ground staff on both flights! On the first flight from AMS to LIN, each of us brought 1 cabin luggage & 1 small bag. We didn't realise that it was a mistake, so when we knew it from the surprisingly unfriendly Dutch ground staffs, we hurriedly packed each of our small bags to the bigger bag. So, we can say that we really tried to respect the rule. However, we felt that as an tourist group, as some passengers could bring 2 Luggage without being warned, maybe it was more because we were a big group of tourists so they wanted to show their power to us. On the second flight, we tried our best to respect the rule by only bringing 1 cabin bag for each of us. And we were positive that it wouldn't lead us to any problem. We were wrong! The ground staff in FCO Airport were trying to charge us 60 euros in the gate just because one of our luggage was a bit too big just because of its wheels! There were actually so many people with bigger luggage than ours I believe.",Business,2.0,nan

I passed the check in Dortmund airport, head to my gate and waited to board. I had a luggage and a backpack as I had my suit in my hand luggage and didn't want to ruin my suit. My two bags were less than 8Kg so there was enough space to combine them in one. Easyjet's employee told me in a very rude way that I need to put everything in one luggage and told me ""you get what you pay for"". Of course I put everything in one bag but Easyjet should have in mind that it doesn't do as a favor when we pick it as a flight service provider. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,November 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Gatwick to Keflavik,4.0, |  Gatwick to Keflavik. I fly around 3 to 4 times a year. Occasionally with hand luggage only. I've flown with a variety of airlines including Ryanair. When we were about to go through the gate to board the plane to Iceland. easyJet crew stopped me and my friend and said we were only allowed 1 piece of luggage and we had to put our handbags inside our small case which we had as hand luggage. I've always carried a small bag as well as my trusted size friendly case. But no easy jet explained this 1 item only as hand luggage. Quite a few people had been stopped. And all of us was on the floor forcing our bags into our cases. It put a damper on our trip. It weighed the same what ever way we carried our luggage. But upward and onwards we went. Only to be informed that if we paid extra as a speedy boarder or priority boarding we can take our handbags with us. I have always praised easyJet as I have flown with them for many years. But they are becoming a rival for money grabbing Ryanair. Time to change to Norwegian as I have heard great things about this airline. Goodbye easyJet.,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0

I was with laptop bag and my husband with small back bag. 2 ladies on that morning wouldn't allow us to carry laptop bag & small back bag, we have to put them in the bin. They didn't even offer to keep the bag for us collect on the way back. Is this reasonable? Coming back at Malaga to Gatwick, I have carried a small handbag, no problem at all.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,November 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Athens to Bristol,1.0, |  Athens to Bristol. EasyJet have disappointed on this trip. I had paid out for an extra suitcase along with upfront seating for an extra suitcase. This small suitcase has been used on their flights before but on this one it was apparently too big to go in the cabin. This resulted in them charging me another 60 euros on my flight home. Overall I spent an extra 120 euros on getting home. I appreciate I had to pay for the extras to get my luggage home as I have been working abroad for the last months. What make this worse is that there were other people on the flight who's luggage was bigger than mine. I can say I won't be choosing to travel with easyjet again!,Business,1.0,1.0

We ordered a drink from their inflight bar, about 30 mins later (40 mins until landing) we asked for another drink only to be told they were going to have a breakfast so would not give us more drinks? Surely you have a breakfast before you leave the house or if you must eat on a 90 minute flight, you can take it in turns to make sure staff are available. Absolutely ridiculous.

But to be delayed two hours due to it being fixed I can deal with although still ridiculous when you have boarded the plane that then problems are noticed. The main problem is that now after a two hour wait we have a further couple of hours to wait as the current crew has said they are finishing their shifts. We now have to wait for the new crew, who still have to travel to the airport. Unprofessional and no compensation! Sorry does not fix things!

nan,Economy Class,nan,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Munich to Gatwick,nan," |  Munich to Gatwick. Terrible cancellation policy. I bought three tickets for $68. A few minutes later I saw that I needed to fly out a day earlier. I then proceeded to cancel and change my flight. They charged me $129 to change, and then charged me $248 for the same flight the day before (A few minutes after I made this change I looked up how much those same flights cost, and they were selling for $68 -  meaning easyjet gouged me). In short, a $68 ticket ended up being around $400. If you are going to fly easyjet and you need to cancel, then dont cancel, just let the seats fly empty and buy your new seats. Or, better yet, just don't fly easyjet! Ryanair had much better solutions.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I was denied boarding in London (I had a connection in Budapest transit zone to to Kutaisi, Georgia) because I did not have a Hungarian visa. This is absurd since I was supposed to have connection in the international transit zone in the same terminal in Budapest with no check-in carriage and I was checked-in for my next flight. EasyJet eventually refunded me for that, but they could not explain at all which of their terms I was violating. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
