nan,Economy Class,nan,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Brisbane to Cairns,nan," |  Brisbane to Cairns. My wallet fell out of my pocket when I was getting up from my seat on my flight on July 12th. I noticed while I was coming down the steps onto the tarmac, I was not allowed to go back and check my seat. The crew on the tarmac told me to go to the gate and another crew member would bring my wallet down to me. I was one of the very last off the plane. The crew started boarding the plane almost immediately after we came through the gate. We then had to wait an hour with no communication as to whether or not they had looked for it or if it had been found. The crew couldn't even care enough to actually look at my seat for it and didn't ask for a description. When I called the airline the following day I was told I had to e-mail ""customer care"" to check for lost property. Crew didn't let me know they had found my wallet until the following day, after I had cancelled all my cards and paid to replace my drivers licence. I thought a customer service line would respond right away if they had found something so important. They told me if I wanted to get my wallet back that I had to pay for them to post it back to me. I paid for and sent them an envelope almost two weeks ago and they have not returned my wallet to me. I have been in contact with Tigerair in regards to this, and they repeatedly ignore me and my e-mails. The customer service with this airline is abysmal. Tthe customer care e-mail have been absolutely no help whatsoever. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The service you get is close to none and they will make you pay for even breathing. The flight was delayed and instead of getting an apology, the extremely rude staff made me pay 36 AUD because my carry on was 1.5 k more than their 7k limit, and insisted she had to count my laptop bag as well. I could see that others were getting away with much heavier bags but she was just making a fuss out of nothing for my bag (I don't have an Aussie accent so she gave me a completely different attitude).",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

It was the first time I was to fly with Tiger and they cancelled the flight via text and email. I immediately called customer service which is based in the Philippines and waited 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone. After 20 minutes on a mobile phone I realised that I would not be provided with any assistance. I went to the airport and waited two and a half hours for Tiger Airways staff to get to work at 6.30pm. To say Tiger Airways staff are unhelpful is a gross understatement. They could not give a rats about the customer at all, in fact their complete lack of ability to provide assistance was incredulous. Their idea of assistance was for me to sleep at the airport in the clothes I was wearing, go without food or showering and my prescription medication for the next two days. The fact that they are required to put passengers on the next available flight doesn't hold for them if there are no seats available. I was asked haughtily if I had read their terms and conditions. Now I have to wait two weeks to get my money back and they refused to give me a receipt. Disgraceful airline, rude staff with no empathy or common sense and appalling service. Tiger Airlines business practices need to be investigated. To make matters worse all the other airlines jacked up their prices to take cancelled passengers on board. I slept at the airport and had to pay $552 to fly one way to Sydney the next morning. Just a horrible stressful experience and I will never choose Tigerair again.",Business,1.0,nan

However today my experience was disappointing because of three young people in row 1 AB&C who were served alcohol again after the cabin service had ceased and the pilot had asked the crew to prepare the aircraft for landing. The individuals concerned were loud, swearing and jumping around in the their seats continually reclining the seat and generally being quite obnoxious. The crew seemed to think their behaviour was OK and a great start to their holiday. It spoilt my flight and that of the person sitting next to me. I don't believe alcohol is necessary at 9.30am I'm not adverse to a drink on a flight but this was not necessary. Overall think Tiger great value but will rethink my next flights.

I received a text from the airline to say that my flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the aircraft. The call centre told me that i had two options, a flight to Sydney on the 5th, or a flight to the Gold Coast on the day. Picked the latter because i did not want to pay accomodation charges in Australia's most expensive city. I mentioned to a member of Tigerair staff at the kiosk at Sydney airport that I had been bumped off the flight. Her reply ""why do you keep flying on this airline"". Hardly filled me with confidence.

Another huge negative is the lack of online check-in which forces passengers to be at the airport at least an hour before flight for a domestic route which is unacceptable when both Virgin and Jetstar allow online check-in with presentation at gate up to 20 min before departure.

I decide to do some investigative work and I log into Sydney airport to see what time the plane departed there at.

They then booked us on two different flights - one for the evening in question the other a few days later. It took another hour to convince them to fix this. The plane was about 2 hours which meant that we arrived in Melbourne after 7pm and consequently wasted an entire day. The in- flight crew were pleasant enough. The return flight was also cancelled and re-booked for earlier on in the day - meaning we lost the 2nd of our 4 day holiday in Melbourne.

Its a cheap recreational airline and that's it. Look out if you are on holidays on the Gold Coast and do a bit of shopping. I didn't realise I had to buy extra baggage 4 hours beforehand online like any other airline thought I could fix this up at the counter. If I had realised you had to buy it online it would have cost me $17.95 for up to 20 kilos. Since I didn't realise that and wanted to pay at the airport the counter staff charged me $90 (more than the cost of my ticket for the flight!) to check in 14 kilos (carry on you can only have 10 kilos). The counter staff couldn't seem to understand why this incredibly unreasonable charge made me upset to have to pay it. Then when we got to Sydney there was no indication of what carousel the luggage was on the flight wasn't listed on the carousel boards and I had to ask the airport concierge where Tiger luggage usually comes out - Carousel 6 if you get into this situation.

But it is understandable as it's a cheap airline. The service was good just an 80 minute flight so I don't need any food or beverages.

Therefore Tiger has the cheapest flight compared to any other Australian Airlines. I have not encountered any problems yet hopefully not in the future. Seat comfort on the other hand really depends on the pax around you. If the pax kept kicking your seat from behind you will feel uncomfortable. If the pax in front of you reclined their seat you will feel uncomfortable too. Since I know it is a budget airline I do not expect much from it. What I do know is that I have never encountered any problems and flights were always on time (maybe I was just too lucky).,nan,5.0,nan

She just followed process but it wasn't very customer orientated nor efficient as we ended up waiting for her return as did everyone else in the line up. Return flight was fully booked with the exception of 1 seat which the check-in manager strategically placed between my husband and myself so we got 3 seats for the 4 of us which made all the difference (to us as we'll as the poor person who would have been sat next to us).

The next day absolutely no sympathy or apologies were shown and they even tried to charge us extra for baggage between 2 people that was 21 kg.

They were not just rude to me but the majority of the people checking in. They are definitely lacking in customer service. I missed a different flight with them and had to pay $85 to catch the next flight. Charging a fee to switch a flight is expected but I only paid $68 for the ticket so $85 to switch was a little steep.

Out of Sydney I did not check my seat until I got into the plane. Of course we were not given the seats we had paid for. I raised this with the cabin staff and was told that they could do nothing about it. After a lovely holiday I checked in for the return flight and raised the issue of the seats. I was told that I could not have the seats because I was flying with a 14 year old who was seated behind me. Tiger knew the ages of the family yet took the $$$$.

Aircraft cabin was fine clean and presentable and departure-arrival times went to schedule. We had no problems with cabin crew as all were approachable and communicative. I did see people at Sydney turn up late and also try to wing it with baggage allowances and they had to pay the price for this which is fair enough.

A staff member eventually came forward asking for anymore passengers for Sydney (ex Cairns) we came forward with half a dozen others and were told there were 7 seats left on the flight I shrugged this off as we had already paid for our seats were early and had paid extra for the seat allocation. Things went downhill quickly. No seats together bad luck read the T&C's we were told which apparently state no matter how much you pay or how early you are you're not even guaranteed a seat let alone the one you specifically chose and paid extra for. Apparently they're in the business of intentionally over-selling all of their flights. When I protested and continued to remind her we were on time had followed all the rules and should not have had our seats given away we were told too bad further protesting miraculously eventually resulted in seats together but not the seats we'd paid for. Our bag was a couple of kilos over which was the same bag that boarded a Jetstar flight to Cairns without incident and now we were being told to pay $25 per kilo I laughed and said that's ok we can take a few things out the already rude check-in staff member continued to get ruder and ruder telling us she didn't have time for this (still an hour before the flight) and eventually let us go but only because I continued to protest. The size of the seat and legroom was by far the most cramped and uncomfortable I've ever experienced.

We were fortunate we didn't have anyone waiting and the FAPAS bus still happily honoured our ticket. Then returning on Monday 2nd from Melbourne our flight which was due to leave 12.20pm eventually took off at 17.05pm arriving in Brisbane too late for us to get our connecting transport home until Tuesday morning. They announced several times that due to the late arrival of our plane our flight would be leaving late which didn't ring true. A later flight took off hours before ours. They eventually gave all passengers a $5 refreshment voucher but this hardly makes up for sitting in the airport for 6 hours with only several announcements.,nan,3.0,nan

There were delays in Sydney due to winds and all airlines were suffering delays to/from Sydney. Hardly Tigers fault. Boarded the plane around 4:40pm and was ready for take off just after 5pm. Most people were asleep after a busy weekend as we started rolling down the runway. About 1/3 of the way down the runway the captain hit the brakes. We were stopped at the end of the runway and had no idea why. There was no announcement from the cabin crew and eventually the captain came on. A light had appeared during takeoff and he had to abort the takeoff. So he said we'd go back to the terminal and have engineers look at the issue and we were to remain on the plane. The cabin crew made no announcements at all during this time. One got short when people wanted to go the toilet. After about 10 mins we were told we would need to get off and head back into the terminal. Back into the terminal we go and we were told not to go too far so we can listen to the announcements. What announcements?? There was not 1 announcement from the Aerocare ground staff. The captain made two announcements over the nearly 5 hour delay! One of the announcements was that the engineer had just arrived at that was at 7pm nearly 2 hours later and that we should be out by 8pm. Then 8pm came and no announcement. The staff at the gate said a call would be made between 8:30pm and 9pm to see if the flight would be cancelled. Come 9pm there was no announcement! With a delay this long peoples tempers were becoming frayed! The AFP turned up a few times. We received no food or drink vouchers. We also learnt that if the flight was cancelled it was left up to us to find accommodation. The 8:05pm flight to Sydney was cancelled as it was the same aircraft that we were on. There was some very lost passengers at the gate as there was no staff at the gate. We finally boarded around 9:20pm and we didn't get off the ground till 9:45pm. All we got onboard as compensation was a cup of tea or coffee or a cup of water! We made it to Sydney with 6 mins to spare before curfew. Not too sure if I'd fly Tiger again after this experience.

Flight wise boarding was very organised (passengers were boarded by row numbers) and no complaints about the service of the crew on this flight. Aircraft departed the gate in Singapore a couple of minutes late but arrived early in Penang. That being said the ground and online services are completely lacking. A total mess at Changi T2 at 7.30am in the morning with hundreds of passengers scrambling to check in for 5-6 flights at the time. The airline does not spend any effort to guide passengers to the correct check in queues but is more than happy to deploy staff to collect passenger information for their own surveys. No self-check machines whatsoever. The online service is no better: passengers departing Singapore on one-way tickets have no online check in option and hence no straight to gate to beat the queues. I wish I could recommend people to fly this airline but no. Don't fly Tigerair unless you don't have any other option.,nan,2.0,nan

Return flight was delayed due to bad weather in Sydney which they made us aware of and unavoidable and we were half an hour late arriving back into Melbourne from the Gold Coast due to a thunderstorm over Tullamarine once again can't blame Tiger for that.

We purchased an extra on our ticket which was the cost of $3.00 to have priority boarding. Initially thought was ' that's great! When it was time for boarding they called out over the speaker that all passengers that have purchased priority boarding to board now. It seemed a bit confusing because when we went to go and stand in line everyone got out of there seats to board the plane. Luckily me and my brother got to the boarding gate to stand in line first but even when we did get our boarding passes scanned people behind us without priority boarding were allowed to board. I think Tigerair need to be specific and say a couple of times more calling for anyone with priority boarding. Once boarding the flight the cabin crew were so polite and welcoming. There were plenty of drinks and food to purchase the trolley was full! The food was fresh and the drinks were nice and cold.

The flights left and arrived on time. The seating was adequate not overly roomy but ok. The leather upholstery on the return flight was welcome. The inflight catering is user pays as is usual with all low cost carriers and a good variety was available and to my knowledge was all available. We purchased 2 hot chocolate drinks at $4 each which was reasonable value. The cabin staff were attentive and had good customer skills . The main reason airlines employ cabin staff is to facilitate safety and the cabin staff on both sectors were very particular with their safety briefings and walk around checks. On arrival at Sydney we were directed to a remote parking stand. This presented no problems as the bus transport dropped the pax off literally within 20 metres of the baggage claim carousel.

After a 9 hour delay with nothing given to us but 'complementary water' we were finally put on another aircraft no help whatsoever from the crew to get a different earlier flight. The one thing I do applaud this terrible airline is the fact that they were able to spot the engine failure whilst still on the ground and not whilst we were mid-flight.

The check in process went smoothly and the agent that assisted me was very friendly and that helped set the tone for a flight that was supposed to have been short and without incident. The flight was supposed to have been less than 90 minutes. I found out that Sydney Airport had closed due to inclement weather and that the fuel was low so the flight was diverted to Canberra. Absolutely no information was provided by the pilots or the cabin crew in Canberra as to when the flight would be back in the air or how long the ground delay would be for. I had told the cabin crew that I had to connect to an international flight and tried outlining steps that they could take such as requesting priority disembarkation/luggage collection and calling their ground reps in Sydney to see if assistance could be provided at the arrival gate for those that were traveling on connecting flights. Their response to me was ""we understand and we'll do everything we can to help"". After sitting in Canberra for well over 2 hours it became clear that I faced the very real possibility that I would miss my connecting flight. When the plane did land in Sydney I was left with a little over an hour to disembark run to baggage claim to get my luggage and transfer terminals in order to make my international connection. The flight did not arrive at a bridged gate. Instead passengers had to disembark by stairs and proceed up a single set of stairs into the concourse - I was sitting at the rear of the plane so you imagine what it's like walking behind more than a 100 other people because that's what happened to me. I was appalled upon getting to the concourse to find out that not a single Tigerair representative was around to meet the aircraft and offer help. In spite of me having clearly told the cabin crew that I was supposed to connect to an international flight and in spite of providing them with my departure time my luggage was one of the very last pieces to be removed from the plane. I then had to run to the train to the international terminal which I had to pay for and once there I ran straight for the Etihad Airways check in desk only to be told that the flight had already been closed and that it would not be possible to board. I had to watch the plane that was supposed to have brought me home push back and leave without me. I can understand that diversions and other unexpected circumstances can happen from time to time but after having been given the run-around after having been offered no legitimate help of any kind on the ground upon arrival in Sydney and after dealing with a flight crew that didn't have the least bit of sympathy for my situation and offered generic explanations instead of going out of their way to truly help me out I can assuredly say that I will never fly with Tigerair again!",nan,1.0,nan

On the seat selection page it shows which seats are empty and which seats are booked. Generally the seats with the added leg room are an extra cost and generally always the first booked. I always skip the seat selection and let Tiger assign me a seat at no extra cost. Now whenever I go to check in at Sydney airport or Coolangatta airport the check in staff often ask me where I would like to sit. So I ask for the seats with extra leg room which are the emergency exit rows and generally I'm assigned a seat with extra leg room despite the fact that I didn't pay anything extra and despite the Tiger Airways website stating that those seats which cost more and were ""booked"". So some poor fools are specifically choosing a certain seat and paying extra on the Tiger airways official website for a seat with extra ""leg room"".

Firstly, the access to Tigerair Terminal in Melbourne is long, no rails and wet and dirty surface. To navigate the narrow access takes at least 10 extra minutes, walking: no escalators, no moving path. This condition has lasted for the past 10 years we are told. And you always have to climb the steps to get to the plane, no connecting luxury. There was an unexplained delay with no apology, staff irritated when you ask the reason. The waiting rooms were overcrowded with three delayed flights customers, loud and littered with remnants of food and drinks. They would not return the ticket price if we decided not to wait.  We are senior citizens and had to face a 3 hour delayed flight from SYD to MEL. We asked the reason for delay, they asked for our boarding passes, took down numbers and gave them back. When the flight was boarding, our boarding passes were taken away from us and new ones issued. They had row 30 on them. We could not believe it. We were told by the young woman at boarding desk that those places are better than the row 15 we had paid for, as the boarding and exit are quicker. No amount of reasoning could move her. The plane was full, there was no question of redistribution of weight. Fortunately, the cabin staff were more understanding, and as our health condition is not ideal, we got back our original seats which were empty anyway.

At the gate, carry-on bags were being checked ad-hoc. Boarding was efficient and quick which allowed for an early departure. The aircraft was spotless and it was great to have cloth seats rather than the faux leather of Virgin. Yes its buy on board, but a good range of drinks and snacks were available. Very friendly cabin crew and great communication from the flight deck. It was actually the first time that I was asked if I needed assistance to place my bag in the overhead locker. Seat comfort no different to economy on Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar and in fact it seemed that the seats were wider than on the Qantas and Virgin 737's. Since being taken over by Virgin, Tiger certainly seemed to have improved and as long as you follow the rules concerning check in times and carry-on limits they provide quality safe air travel at quite reasonable prices when compared with Virgin and Qantas. You have to ask for the majority of flights in Australia under 3 hours, is the extra money to fly Qantas or Virgin for a complimentary muffin worth it.

The plane itself was clean and comfortable - even nicer than the Jetstar flight I took on the outgoing flight. The flight was slightly delayed due to bad weather in Sydney (as were other flights) but otherwise very smooth and on time. Flight attendants also very friendly and helpful. The only annoying part is their carry-on baggage restrictions - everyone had to have their bag weighed before boarding to make sure they were under 7kg.

After arriving to check in and waiting 4 hours they told us the flight was cancelled 'again'. Offering me a refund in 48 hours I had to find another carrier to fly home with.

When I asked if I could these tickets I was told that these tickets where actually sold out and that the website had not been updated. That if I were to book these tickets online (which the system was letting me do) I would find out later that my trip had been cancelled again due to overbooking. I subsequently book my tickets with another airline at considerable cost due to short notice. I was told that I would receive a refund in 3-6 weeks from Tiger. On looking at the Tiger website the following day I discovered that the trip I had wanted to book was still being advertised and I could still book on line if I wanted to. Therefore potentially there is a lot of customers who could have been booking that trip over the last two days only to discover that there trip had been cancelled due to over booking.

After a long mindless day looking around T2 & T3 shops we boarded the plane at 1:45. After more waiting everyone dutifully seat belted in the cabin crew announced that 10 people never showed for the flight (not a surprise) and their bags had to be removed from the plane.

While not at a peak time one wonders how much longer before part owners such as Singapore Airlines pull the pin on the Australian operation where clearly (when not affected by natural events such as volcanic ash) flights are cancelled daily due to either an aircraft failure or low passenger numbers.

Of the 5 sectors that we have booked over the last 3 years only one flight left at the originally booked time (PER/SIN in 2008).

Two were rescheduled by 12 hours when Tiger rearranged their schedules earlier this year causing significant problems with our holiday. A one in five success rate is appalling even for a discount airline.

Finally on top of the 60AUD ticket and another 30 dollars for an extra piece of luggage, Tigerair charged me 320AUD for extra kgs over their 40kg limit at check in.

The was the first time flying Tiger after a very unpleasant experience in 2005 in Singapore. For SYD-MEL while waiting in the boarding lounge a Tigerair staffer approached me asking if I’d like priority boarding and an exit row seat at no cost. Gratefully accepted, but 10 minutes before the scheduled departure, no aircraft had arrived. It was obvious we would be late departing. After boarding, we all sat like dummies to be told after a period that the flight would not be leaving for 45 minutes as we’d lost our place in the queue for take-off. The 0845 departure became 0940. Priority boarding is a waste under such circumstances. Inflight service was fine, and the staff friendly and smiling. The food and drinks are competitively priced. MEL-SYD began boarding at 1800 for an 1825 departure. Again, once boarded we were told that bad weather in Sydney had delayed arrivals and departures and we’d be held captive for an hour so Sydney air traffic could be sorted. It’s not Tigerair’s fault, but why were we boarded and why were we kept on the plane when we could have returned to the boarding lounge. Finally push back was 1905 and the uneventful flight landed in Sydney 30 minutes late at 2029. Again, the cabin crew were friendly, smiling and made very clear announcements.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I said that I had been travelling for more than 24 hours, and had no energy to go around Sydney looking for accomodation.

A couple of annoying events, the first of which was the booking and on-line check in on the Tigerair site. Like most people I don’t want to have a multitude of advertisements hitting on me while I’m trying to concentrate on the booking. I ended up with email spam from the Tigerair affiliates. Similarly, the on-line check in is also unnecessarily complicated when it could be so simple. Pre-boarding I asked for an aisle seat and the Tigerair staffer was so polite and helpful and the seat was changed with no fuss at all. At boarding lounge 49 the ground crew announcements were spoken so fast it was unintelligible. One passenger asked me what was said and I was unable to tell him. When I very politely suggested to the Tigerair staffer to slow down his delivery, he replied, “Other passengers can understand it”. If so, why are the passengers lining up in the wrong places and at wrong times? The flight was uneventful with friendly cabin attendants and punctual departure and arrival. A late-morning flight ADL to SYD was booked but on-line check in was a problem as I had no internet access for 24 hours. I found a Tigerair staffer in the airport who kindly directed me to the check-in area. Arriving there, there was no check in desk open. Within two minutes, the same Tigerair staffer offered to help me. He was friendly, efficient did the check in and seat allocation in about 2 minutes. Later at the boarding gate his announcements were clear, precise and audible, unlike his female offsider who could not be heard above the noise of the passengers.

Since that date (9th June 2017) I have been in touch with Tigerair via email, seeking an explanation as to their cavalier attitude to my needs on that night. They eventually conceded that it wasn't the weather, but 'Engineering Requirements', but have since sought to alter that to 'Engineering Requirements and weather'. They have also refused to discuss why it took so long to advise that the flight was cancelled. I have discovered that the aircraft concerned was still airborne on its way to Melbourne from Cooloongatta at the time it should have been leaving Melbourne for Sydney (6.25 pm), but it took Tigerair until 8.20 pm to send their 3 line email cancelling the flight.

They could only put us on a flight 38 hours after they cancelled our first one. Because this was only a weekend away and we were leaving Tuesday – I brought a flight on Saturday with Virgin who were much more understanding and helpful. $600 down, Virgin did everything to make sure we were happy and tried to accommodate us after hearing how Tigerair treated us. When I asked Tiger for a refund for this, we were refused one and said the best they can do is a credit. Are you serious? Like I’m ever going to use this airline again.

After calling Customer service and in total over 60 minutes on phone, they agreed to put us in hotel in Perth.

I know flying a budget airline means you take a risk that there might be a delay, but I find it extremely unsatisfactory that we were expected to wait for over a day for what should be a straight-forward flight from Melbourne to Sydney. The Tigerair staff at the airport offered no assistance and no compensation, and told us that that if we wanted to cancel the next day's flight, all we would receive would be a credit for the fare we had paid. Because of the excessive wait, we had no alternative but to pay ""walk up"" fares on another airline, and all we have from Tigerair is a credit but no refund.

Being a Gluten Free Vegan the temptation of a Rowie’s Burger took over and I thought I would give them a shot. From the onset even before boarding my experience was horrible. The customer service was appalling - the stewardesses were rude and didn’t smile. I was  shocked they included my handbag (which can’t even fit a tablet in!) as weighed luggage. Upon paying for my .5 excess of 7kg luggage limit which was due to my handbag I was refused a receipt. The staff  also did not have change for a $50 note and had to request smaller change or to somehow get change for her current float. After that incident I was sitting when I was approached several times asking to re-weigh my bags which I said I had. They had no record of my weighing - and requested a receipt. I went back to the stewardess at the counter and requested a receipt in light of the circumstances. It seemed she did not know how to issue one, after calling for her she advised me I have to go to another gate as her printer was down. After going to two other Tiger gates it seems the third gate was the only one able to print. Eventually when I did board - after the delayed departure they seemed to miss my pre-ordered meal. I reminded them 30 mins prior to the scheduled landing that I had a pre-ordered meal. I was promptly given  my allocated drink but was disallowed from having my tray down as we had begun our descent. They offered me a chicken or beef sandwich in compensation to my misplaced meal - which was a silly offer as I clearly ordered a dietary specific menu item. I was finally treated to my pre-ordered in-flight meal which arrived once I landed. Not only was it overcooked and the box it was served it had leaked sauce in but it was also cold. There was no point ordering food at all. All in all for an $89 flight, $13 in-flight meal and $36 luggage fee I may as well of forked out the extra $20 and flown a seamless journey with Virgin.

What is the point of a low fare ticket if you end up paying heaps more for last minute ticket with another airline. Last minute cancellations and re-timing are the norm with Tiger.

I'll admit I didn't notice the date change, originally thought we had been delayed by 2 hours. I showed one of the check-in staff (who also didn't notice the date change), she told me I couldn’t check-in until 12pm (2 hrs before the new flight). So my toddler and I sat around the airport for 1.5hrs, frustrated but fine. When I tried to check-in at noon it was pointed out to me that my flight was not until the following day. My toddler and I were flying to Melb for my Mum's 70th b’day dinner (which was a big deal as my Mum has been fighting stage 4 cancer for the last year - family were coming from interstate, it was much needed celebration). When I explained the importance of our trip I was told I could try another airline (which by this stage were sold out - it was the footy finals and start of school hols), get a refund, go on standby or come back tomorrow. I wasn't pleased with any of the options, but thought the best chance was to go standby. So we waited another 2.5hrs. I asked if we would get a food voucher for a sandwich for my daughter and got a very blunt ""no"". At 2:30 after the final call for the 3:15 Melbourne flight, we went back to the original check-in girl (who had stated that she had put us ""top of the standby list""), she told us ""40 passengers are yet to book in, so it looks good for you"" (so we were feeling relieved) 20mins later another staff member came & told us (& 6 other passengers who had gone standby after the cancellation) the flight was booked & the best they could offer was a 7am flight.  The 7am flight was not an option for us. I then had to try & sort my airport parking, fun, fun. On our return flight, somehow my toddler and I were assigned seats in different rows! The cabin staff told me this had happened twice on the flight already. They did their best to reshuffle people, but we ended up sitting with an aisle between us.  I emailed Tiger with my complaints and suggested compensation of Tiger credit to fly later in the year. They offered their ""sincere apologies"" but told me because I didn't take out insurance they were not going to offer any compensation. This baffled me!? Instead of offering $100 they would rather have a very unsatisfied customer? So I emailed them again and was told ""we appreciate your understanding in this matter"". I know flying a budget airline you take a risk of being delayed - but delayed by an hour or two, not 26! And not to be told then too bad, take out insurance next time.

The 737 seems to have more leg room than the A320 also used by Tiger. Pre-booked breakfast and the meal was quite tasty. Bad: The flight being rescheduled from 0820 to 0725.

I didn't expect much from such a low-cost airline and this was pretty much within my expectations. The section dedicated to Tigerair in Tullamarine airport wasn't bad, featuring decent chairs with power outlets in certain locations. What's worth noting is that prior to boarding, the ground crew will bring a weight scale to make sure you don't exceed your 7kg cabin baggage restriction. Once onboard (by walking across the tarmac, what do you expect?), the cabin crew showed a positive attitude, and they seem very happy to help out passengers wither with difficulties locating their seats or placing oversized items into the overhead locker. The seat was acceptable for a 55-minute flight, the pitch was average and feels pretty comfortable. One thing to note is that is my case, the window was coated with a layer of grease, probably due to the previous passenger leaning his or her greasy hair against the table while sleeping. For some reasons, they seem to really like to use the reverse thrust, even with plenty of runway distance to spare.

The air hostess was rude and argumentative when explaining safety procedures and when she asked if we had any questions and one of the passengers asked one, she preceded to tell him that he should have listened in the first place and to look at the safety procedure on the back of the seat. I will not be flying Tigerair again and will be informing everyone of our poor experience this morning. I also believe that although Tigerair purport to be a budget airline, you appear to profiteer from the meagre cabin bag allowance by charging customers extreme prices for small excess luggage. I fly often, both nationally and internationally for business and I have never experienced such poor service.

Even if you are just a little over they will still make you pay a ridiculous amount. The first time I had to pay $36 and then the second time I had to pay $46. Where did the extra $10 come from.

My flight from MEL to BNE was a flawless Tigerair experience. I even made a note of the cabin crew who went out of their way to help a couple who were having a large variety of issues. I was ready to write a glowing review. However, the leg from BNE to MEL was a disaster. The flight was delayed and so people were slowly notified whilst waiting at the gate. There were a number of ground staff about and they made everyone weigh their bags to ensure they were under the weight limit. No real updates, aside from a delay due to engineering. And then an SMS comes through over an hour later saying it had been cancelled. No notification from actual staff, and no staff at the gate. So, I called their call centre as advised in the SMS. I was told that a recovery flight was being organised but I would have to check in. I go down to the check in counter and there is one staff member, who is having IT issues. After about 20 minutes she still hasn't served those people, all the while the entire planeload of people have now formed a queue. There's also no visibility of other staff. Unfortunately for some, they are trying to check in for actual operating flights and they are getting noticeably quite distressed in the queue. About 45 minutes later Sebastien, a ground staff member, makes an announcement over the PA which can only be heard away from the queue. I then go and ask what the announcement said as there's about 40 people who were all going ""what was he saying??"". I'm advised there is no recovery flight and there are no seats out of Brisbane until at least the following day. There may be spots from the Gold Coast, but best option would be to check other airlines. I had to be back in Melbourne that day (noting I was on a 2.10pm flight, so not cutting it fine by any stretch of the imagination). I ended up flying Qantas. I have received no follow up from Tiger about the cancellation - no email about 'what to do now' or anything. After a few days, I contacted them to ask the process. I got a reply that completely ignored what I had said. Not even an offer to reimburse my original flight costs. So, after many glowing reviews on here (e.g. my review from late Jan - MEL:ADL) it seems that when Tigerair get things wrong, they really get them wrong. No customer service at all.

You have to book another flight. Just 2-3 mins! They just wanted to earn money and this they didn't let me board-in. So I had to pay again for another flight on same day that was scheduled after about 5 hours. Such a bad experience. I would never recommend Tigerair to anyone.

This made our wait time even longer, and people who arrived after us and cut the line got top priority even though we did the same online check in and could’ve already been through. Our flight was supposed to leave at 9:15 am, and the airport has been calling people to go back through check in now to get a paper copy of their boarding passes instead of using the electronic ones on their smartphones. So people had to basically check in two times now, and we aren’t even close to boarding yet even though our flight was supposed to leave over 45 minutes ago. We have to catch a bus after the airport because our travel time doesn’t end after our flight. We are now most likely going to miss the bus we already paid for.

I had no baggage to check-in and normally would have downloaded a boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport so as to avoid contact with this airline's arrogant and rude ground staff. The automatic boarding machine told me that check-in was closed, so I spoke to the female at the start of the Tigerair check-in race who told me that check-in was closed and that I could not fly that day but could get onto a flight on Wednesday for an additional fee of $85. Given that I had no check-in baggage and would normally not even present myself at this counter, I stood my ground and was eventually given a boarding pass. I dashed to Gate 57 to find that the lounge was still full of customers and believe it or not, the aircraft to service the flight had not yet arrived at the gate. The aircraft arrived at 08.15 am and the arriving passengers commenced disembarkation at 08.22 am. Boarding for my flight commenced at 08.32 am. I believe that an unethical method is being used by Tigerair to scam timid customers into paying an additional fee under such circumstances when in the 'olden days' good customer service would have seen a boarding pass issued given that there was no reason not to do so on the part of the airline. Tigerair is a low cost airline, which according to its latest propaganda on page 5 of it's 'tigertales' magazine provides 'value, choice and innovation'.

After doing my own research I found I could get a flight through Virgin or Qantas leaving 3 hours later but was going to cost me almost double in price to get it as it was a last minute flight.
