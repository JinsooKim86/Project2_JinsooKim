A350-900,Economy Class,4.0,July 2018,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes,Taipei to Vancouver,4.0," |  Taipei to Vancouver. I was impressed with the comfort and service. The staff was very friendly, they were prompt with meal time and very accommodating. The take off and landing were quite smooth, and I was happy with how painless the boarding was. The food was pretty good, with enough in the meal to fill me up for hours. For economy class the seats were decently comfortable, and the leg room was more than I was expecting. I loved the touch screens and the quantity of movie choices. My overall experience was as comfortable and painless as a flight can be. I would recommend this airline to anyone looking to take a lengthy flight.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

We flew Premium Economy this time and were very disappointed. The seats are very comfortable and lots of movies to choose from, but the food and service were average. We had flown from Brisbane to Auckland three days earlier and were fed Fried Rice - no other choice(s) that was it! Coming back it was chicken with mushrooms, rice and vegetables. It was OK, but under seasoned and very bland. My husband cannot eat mushrooms and he eats hardly any vegetables. When he advised the hostess of this she came back with a serve of garlic bread from Business Class. That was his meal! He has a healthy appetite and was not impressed. I would point out that the same meals were being service to Economy Class, so not effort made to provide something a little bit better in Premium Economy. Drinks service limited - one with your meal, and another one just after. That was it. I do not think they were ever offering spirits. They also did not come round offering water on a regular basis, as most airlines. Will definitely go Business Class next time - I do recommend that.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

On top of that I am being told they will not allow me to board the gate, they will close the gate on me and that I would be sent home. I was forced to purchase a ticket that I will not use and cannot be refunded on now. All of my friends who flew out to Bali did not have any of these issues or forced to purchase a ticket going home.

I was upset because I was going to now miss the Semi final match between England and Croatia. I gave China airlines a ring was on hold for an hour (at this point I was ready to give up) and then was told at 10:15am that if I get to Sydney airport by 11am they would get me on an earlier flight and reach Taiwan before the storm does. So jumped in an Uber and was 5mins late. Thankfully I was put on an earlier flight as soon as I arrived! ,Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

The transfer process in Taipei airport isn’t as easy as other major hubs as it involved a lot of stairs and lifts and a very confusing layout. The CI lounge in T1 was very crowded and it didn’t feel like a hub lounge for a major airlines, and when the main lounge was crowded they sent passengers to a small lounge which felt like a classroom. Outward journey: we left Taipei ontime. Boarding was easy and smooth. To my disappointment it was an old A330 with very dated interior. The seating was comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Entertainment was again very dated. Unlike my experience with their long haul flight, shortfall flights with China Airlines seem to be a different class. All the crew members on this flight was very friendly and approachable, and they didn’t stop providing any food or drink throughout the flight. It was indeed one of the best flights I had in terms of services. Landed in Bali on time but it was a long wait for the luggage. Return journey: check in at Bali was very slow but the agents were all very friendly. Returning flight was a slightly newer plan (A330). Service was again better than most of the long haul flight but definitely not as good as the outbound journey. Arrival at Taipei was very efficient. Quick immigration check and luggage was out within few minutes.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
A350,Business Class,3.0,June 2018,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,LHR to TPE via AMS,3.0," |  OK service, issue with the planes I travelled London Heathrow to Taipei (with onward journey to Bali) in June with China Airlines. It involved a stop over at Amsterdam and the flight between London and Amsterdam was on KLM, while AMS to TPE was on China Airlines. Outbound flight left Amsterdam on time and arrived at Taipei few minutes ahead of schedule. China Airlines use new A350 for its European routes with the exception of Frankfurt. Once I got onboard I immediately noticed that the seat control panel wasn’t working. As a result there were only three possible positions throughout the flight – sit up, relax or flat bed. The table lamp was also disable because of this. I reported to the crew but they didn’t do anything until almost landing. Service was pretty efficient but not particularly warm nor friendly. Returning lag was slightly better. The CI lounge in Taipei terminal 1 was very dark and crowded until late evening. It was renovated 2-3 years ago but has started to show some sign of poor maintenance. The food and drink provided is substandard. Boarding was late by circa 20 minutes but the process was very easy for business class passengers. I was greeted by name by the cabin manager and the team which doesn’t always happen on CI long haul flights. Some of the crew members on this flight were exceptional. However I experienced problem again with the hardware. One of the toilets was out of order which means there was only one toilet for the business class cabin; the window shed in seat 14K was also broken. Seems to me that CI has a lot of maintenance issues. Overall it was a typical China Airlines long haul flight I’d expected. Nothing special and definitely not as good as it main competitor EVA. However the flight time suits me better (as EVA quite often involves a stop over at Bangkok).",Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0

The flight attendants made no greeting when boarding and very limited interaction during the entire flight. The guy sitting next to me did not straight the seat back when takeoff and landing yet no cabin crew paid attention to it. The meal was okay. I am not picky about flight meal at all. A flight attendant sat on the jump seat with her legs crossed and stared into space after meal service.

When I searched for the flights Air China was among the most competitive in terms of the price (only United and Delta were cheaper). The JFK-PEK legs were on B777-300ER while the PEK-SIN legs were on A330-300. Seat comfort was expected given the class nothing stellar but nothing too bad either. On all legs AVOD was available. Food was decent but as far as I could tell only Asian options for the main dishes were available (featuring rice or noodle and some protein). Portion size might be small if you usually eat big (might be a problem for Americans). Flight attendants did a few rounds bringing water but you could also venture to the galley yourself to help yourself with some water and snack.

Large IFE screen with AVOD although I wish they had a wider selection of English titles. Both flights were delayed by about half an hour. SHA-PEK was bang on time and was on a 777-200 which surprisingly had identical seats to the B777-300ER ie full flat - very nice for a 2-hour domestic flight. Very comfortable and they served a lavish hot breakfast on take-off. Baggage delivery was flawless.

There is a single screen at the front of economy and the entertainment (in Chinese) consisted of what appeared to be 30 second commercials. Late leaving mechanical malfunction before take off. Dinner was bland and disgusting the best thing were the dinner rolls which were fresh and warm. When you order drinks you are given a small 10oz plastic cup of the beverage no cans and good luck getting a refill. After dinner is server the cabin crew vanishes never to be seen again. I was told to call 2 weeks before I left for seat assignment. I followed the instructions and was told they could not issue seats I could not get seats in the US and now I can't get them in China. I was traveling with a child and therefore needed to ensure I had seats together. When I arrived at the airport they were able to get me two seats together for the trip from Shanghai to PEK and then PEK to SFO or so I thought. First leg of the trip the same poor service to which I had become accustomed no change there. When they scanned my ticket before boarding they said oh your seat assignment has been changed and wrote a new seat number on my ticket my nephew was located in another part of the plane. It seems that they do not feel the need to notify you of seat changes until you board. I told them this was unacceptable to which they put me off to the side and proceeded to board a full flight. Eventually they managed to get two seats together. I will never fly this airline again.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight attendants did the basics but disappeared for long periods. They did however keep the toilets very clean. Loading procedures were amateur and chaotic as if the ground staff were improvising. Individual staff were OK but as a group they lacked management. This unpleasantness was magnified by the loading at Beijing. For reasons unknown the SIN and YVR flights had to load using buses out to the tarmac (when gates at the main terminal were obviously available). This is not appropriate for a large plane at capacity. Beijing airport is a liability as a hub. It is very large dreary inefficient and immersed in a toxic smog.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Beijing one month round trip. Flights left pretty much on time nice planes with good food and great entertainment on the long haul LHR to PEK flight - individual entertainment systems. Aircraft were modern. Wide range of refreshments including Chinese beer and wine on both connecting flights. Small issue with return ticket (as PEK - LGW service had been stopped after I purchased) was easily rectified at Hong Kong check in - desk staff spoke good enough English. Point to note: confirm any schedule changes that are sent to you by phone for ease of mind.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,LAX to Beijing to Hong Kong and back to LAX. The staff is mean to you if you are a westerner. The food is terrible - it reminds me of the food you would get on airlines in the 1990s. With every meal they would give you a tea cup but not offer you any tea so the cup just gets in the way while you are eating. The inflight entertainment is very poor some of them don't work at all and sometimes you don't even get any. The staff English skills are lacking terribly to the point that they might as well just speak to you in Chinese. I cannot stress enough how mean they are they are to westerners.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,Flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 2 January 2014. Really clean and nice aircraft. The Airbus 321 looked dirty but smelt like it came straight from the factory. The crew on this flight were excellent! They spoke English really well and were very friendly and service minded. As for the seats they were like any other standard economy seat but with great legroom. For lunch they served chicken or beef. I had the chicken which was good. Not the best food but it was okay for the 3.5 hr flight. We took of on time and landed on time despite leaving Hong Kong during the morning rush hour. I highly recommend Air China!,nan,5.0,nan

I was actually pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and the fact that I had in-flight entertainment for both the 9-hour and 4-hour flights. However on the inbound flight back to London I was extremely disappointed with the fact that there wasn't any in-flight entertainment after being pleasantly surprised during the outbound. The connecting flight was scheduled much too early and the logistics in Beijing Airport meant that we had to be specifically rushed through. I was initially worried that my luggage would not be able to make the transfer but after the hour's delay I was hopeful! In the end my luggage got left in Beijing and after arriving on a Friday my luggage got to me on Sunday. Overall the seats were alright but not quite right either - other airlines like Qatar are better. The food was not bad but the drinks did not have enough variety. The hospitality was very good actually which was a surprise to everyone who asked!,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,4.0,SYD-PEK-LHR return. 1st and last trip with Air China. Hostess handed out glass of champagne/orange on boarding but walked past me 3 times until I finally had to stop her and ask for a drink. Ordered Chinese food from SYD-PEK totally tasteless and no salt/pepper to add. Same awful food PEK-LHR. Only time we saw the stewardesses was when they brought water/juice round which was not often. Their English was very poor no smiles announcements very unclear. 7.5hr wait in PEK. Beijing airport very short on shops/facilities. Food in Air China lounge at PEK just about edible. After having to get someone from reception to unlock shower I was very disappointed. Had to go through security again at PEK even though in transit. Had Chinese option again from LHR-PEK and that was actually passable but none of the meals were bigger/better than other airline economy airlines. Air China has to use Alliance lounge at LHR which had very tasty/varied food/drinks. On the return trip LHR-SYD I chose Western for the last meal (breakfast) and that was quite nice. Had 5 hr. wait at Beijing. I was able to have a Baileys drink from SYD-LHR but when I asked for one from LHR-SYD was told it was only available to 1st class passengers. The only good thing was the fully flat beds try to book row 11 as it's the only one where the feet part does not narrow to the width of 2 feet side by side! Very limited choice of Western movies. The seatbelt signs were left on even when there was no turbulence and staff did not encourage people to open the window shades even in daylight. I have flown Business class to London with Singapore Airlines and Thai and am afraid that Air China is by far the worst airline I've ever flown with.,nan,2.0,nan

Staff were quite stand offish and didn't speak English very well a smile would have been nice. 2 meals supplied were very poor and no English option available. Meals were very basic and no snacks offered. Drinks only offered during meals and they only came round a few times with water. Entertainment was poor very dated films. Beijing airport: staff had no idea what they were doing and caused complete chaos amongst passengers. We passed through baggage control which took 2 hrs only to walk down 24 steps to go through the same thing again. Then transferred onto plane to Australia and service was exactly the same. Return was the same treatment it was -9 in Beijing and hence it was also -9 in the airport the air- conditioning was full blast. The flight to the UK was slightly better only because the staff spoke a little more English. We had to close the blinds even though it was a daytime flight.

No drinks provided other than with meals air hostesses command of English poor. On the way back food was awful on both legs full of very badly behaved children asked for an alcoholic drink and was told could only have one with dinner entertainment system antiquated no really up to date movies too many Chinese ones and very temperamental system. Would be worth paying extra for a better trip as on a long haul flight its needed.,nan,3.0,nan

Compare with other airlines seats offered such as Eva air Korean Air Cathay Pacific Air France Japan Airlines are much better CI flights really need serious improvement. The seat in front of you can recline on you. This makes the whole journey very uncomfortable: difficult to work and difficult to get out of your seat. Food is good but the service is very slow. You don't receive hot towels in the morning and no hot drinks were offered while breakfast being served. Lounges at Taipei and Bangkok airports are not very clean. The receptionists are friendly enough but the lounges are not exactly business-friendly. If you have connection flights luggage cannot be guaranteed on arrival. Even when travelling on Business Class no compensation is offered for late arrival of luggage. Flight attendants are generally friendly. Entertainment channels are inadequate and the TV screen is very out-dated.,nan,2.0,nan

On seating was handed a juice/wine and hot towel. This is a night flight. No problem getting coffee/tea at any time. Eat western food and is generally ok. Could do with some improvement. Staff always coming back to see if you need more coffee/tea. Inflight entertainment fair. Seats fold to straight bed and very comfortable. Got a good nights sleep.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,nan,Shanghai-Frankfurt Jan 13th. Plane left on time. Flight attendant kind and helpful. Got an aisle seat in the first row of the cabin and had plenty of space for my legs. That were the good points. English announcements spoken with an incomprehensible beginner's accent. Movie choice again very violence dominated mostly Chinese audio quality very low. Food was a shame in comparison to even average Chinese cuisine. Though it was a day time flight blinds had to be closed all day. Got a headache having to read all day by means of the dim seat lighting. Worst was the cabin temperature (my watch showed between 16° and 18°). Almost everybody put on his/her coat which sadly did not prevent from the AC which streamed constantly down to the aisle seats. Entered the plane in a sound condition left it with heavy sinus irritations. This decreases the value for money very much. I would not recommend.,nan,3.0,nan

On board the cabin was immaculate and the suites in First very private; the flight attendant was attentive and while there was some small language issues she was extremely accommodating and ensured a fine trip. The food was good but not great the wines fine and there was a good selection of movies on the IFE system.

Held in the plane on the tarmac for 5 hours while repairs were made. Old plane still had ash trays. Customer service was horrible but that could be a cultural issue. Multiple complications arrived late in China missed connecting flight to the Philippines. Coming back was a little better with a nicer plane and a little better customer service. Still had complications on the return flight and issues still unresolved by Air China. Overall in price I saved $200 per ticket but I would rather pay $200 more and avoid all the misfortunes of this journey with using Air China.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,TPE-Koror return in business. Both flights on time. Plane packed both ways. Service was fine. I wish they would ditch serving the main course of a business-class meal in what looks like a coffee filter. Planes didn't have AVOD. Return flight showed a film about the Nazis (not exactly the most cheery thing to see coming back from vacation) and the menu offered a German sausage dish-simply bizarre. There is no lounge in Koror-they give you a coupon for a drink and some potato chips at a broom-closet-sized bar.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,CI 0031 YVR to TPE 22 Feb 2014. At check-in they weigh your carry on and if your carry on is over 7 kg you they ask you to comply and tag your bag. You are then marked for a re-check during boarding expect someone to come and grab your bag impolitely of course and re-weigh your bag during boarding. Computers and duty free items apparently works on different laws of physics on China Airlines. You are not allowed to carry more than 7 kg of carry on because of safety concerns. But 7 kg of carry on + 5 kg of duty free are ok. After boarding I sat in my seat to find it smelt the seat in front of me the magazine safety brochure etc were smeared in dirt. The entertainment was not very good no new movies at all. The subtitles are in Chinese only. Food was bad just like other airlines. I'm not a picky eater but there wasn't enough of it in China Airlines. Service: I asked for another drink and the stewardess gave me an annoyed look and comes back a moment later and dropped a can of pop in front of me. Plane looked old and outdated and had definitely not being cleaned thoroughly. The only saving grace of this flight was the fact that the seat next to me was empty. I'm dreading my return flight now.,nan,1.0,nan

Agent booked me on a China Airlines flight to Taipei and then a follow on flight to BKK. The aircraft appeared to be brand new inside and everything worked well. The entertainment package was up to date and varied. The cabin crew were very attentive throughout the long flight. I especially liked the reverse boarding for economy class as it went quicker with less standing around waiting for people to hide their carry on baggage. The landings were absolute the smoothest I have ever experienced.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Wuhan China with a transit in Beijing. It was an 8 hour flight from Stockholm to Beijing. The flight crew had a rather bad manner towards economy class customers the crew was impatient spoke terrible English and speak Chinese directly to customers. They don't serve wine until it's time to eat. I was sitting only two rows away from a couple who brought their two young kids one of which cried for over 4 hours during the flight. Not single staff member showed up to comfort the baby. Air china lost my luggage in Beijing while I made it to Wuhan.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,I flew from PEK to LAX in Business class on the newer aircraft and seat was basically lie flat. No issues with that flight. Check-in time was much nicer at 7pm since not at 7am or earlier like USA based airlines. On the way back I was from SFO to PEK on an older 747 but I asked for row 83 at the gate (they block it since it is an exit row) and I got it. I still love the peace and quiet afforded to the upstairs passenger by the 747. This is since the economy and crying babies are one level lower. Only a few passengers up there so I had a flight attendant pretty much to myself. Got all the drinks I desired and a double meal of the Salmon. It was so flavorful. The entertainment system truly needs to be like Cathay Pacific as right now it is just not enough movies that are in English and newer. The best part is they did a few announcements at the beginning of the flight and then remained quiet for the rest pretty much. I wish the entertainment system had an ability to not break-off for PA in a language that was not your own. Overall I would say Air china ok for business class. My next trip might be in their Economy and I bet I will not be as happy.,nan,5.0,nan

I asked for a glass of wine but was told that they only open the bottle with the food. My neighbor wanted a third glass of wine and was told he had enough. No spirits in economy. I eat just about anything and I have never really had reason to complain about airline food before but just the smell of the food was awful. Food was bland and servings were small. They had drinks like juice in the kitchen for passengers to help themselves. Our 4 year old daughter didn't get any special attention. The cabin crew didn't smile and it felt like you are a burden to them. Inflight Entertainment had a small choice of bad movies. On one leg there were problems with the sound. Annoying announcements throughout the flight. The seatbelt sign was switched on throughout all flights.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,I booked a return trip from London to Manila via Beijing due to the flight price and we had a stopover for 2 days in Beijing. Having read some comments I was not expecting the most comfortable flight. However I was pleasantly surprised. All our flights were on time and the planes were clean and the seats were comfortable. The inflight entertainment was ok on the London - Beijing route as there was a good selection of films / programmes. The only negative points of our flights were the boarding of the plane at Heathrow which could have been organised better and the quality of some of the food could be improved. The staff could have also provided more drinks for a long flight. However overall this was a good value for money experience.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,I often fly between Houston and Beijing on Air China's nonstop flights 995 and 996. Overall I like their service. Aircraft's are new and clean. Flight attendants provide good service. The food is not bad as airplane cuisine goes. On a recent flight from Houston to Beijing we were 2 hours late departing Houston. The aircraft had pushed back more or less on time (shortly after 1am) but then we taxied out into the darkness and just sat. We sat and sat and sat some more. Eventually a tow truck came out hooked up to the aircraft and pushed it back a few feet. Then the tow truck pulled the aircraft forward a few feet. Then pushed it back. Then pulled it forward. This went on for the longest time. There was no explanation given by the pilot. No comments given by the flight attendants. It eventually became clear that the tow truck was getting the plane turned around. Apparently the pilot had taxied the aircraft into some kind of dead-end where we were trapped and could not turn around without the help of the tow truck and the spotters. Once the plane was turned around we taxied out to the proper runway and finally took off. The flight crew disabled the flight progress display. Maybe they thought that would prevent anyone from noticing that we were two hours behind schedule. There were no apologies or even an acknowledgement that anything had gone wrong. The lack of transparency and honesty with their customers cost Air China dearly in my opinion of them. From conversations among passengers after we landed in Beijing I was clearly not alone in feeling disgusted about being treated by Air China as if I were blind and stupid.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,I was a bit hesitant due to mixed reviews of this airline . I traveled from Sydney to Beijing return and was very happy with the airline. There seemed to be great leg room and the food was really good especially comparing it to the food I ate while in China which was a very low standard much to my disappointment. There was a good choice on the inflight entertainment but don't travel at night as the Chinese nationals on this flight kept up the talking and noise through out the wee hours of the morning making sleep impossible something I have not found travelling to other countries. They sprayed the flight on the way back into Sydney with some sort of insect spray which is something I have not encountered before but maybe this happens on all airlines from China? It would be a problem if you were sensitive to chemicals.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,5.0,Business class from PEK to BKK was a solid flight but I'd suggest eating before you board. The food had an odd aroma as did the damp hand towels that were kindly offered before the meal. The champagne was okay although it was served in a thimble sized glass the fruit was sweet and the rice was positively offensive. How can rice be bad? Not too sure what was wrong with it but it wasn't edible. The flight attendants were observant and wanting to please but everything was done without any smiles. Perhaps that's a cultural thing. Bathrooms were spotless as was the plane. The seats were super comfortable perhaps more comfortable than United Global First seats apart from the slightly restricted foot space. It was interesting that they didn't offer seat back monitors but they did offer individual iPads. The lounge was comfortable and offered limited food selections. Apart from the dismal food and the lack of entertainment Air China provides a very good product.,nan,5.0,nan

Have to say that I was pleasantly surprised about the whole experience. New biz product is great. One of the most comfortable biz seats ever experienced. comfortable in any sleeping position. Some airlines compromise in terms of width or length of seat not CA. Only negative is the lack of a screen on Moscow-PEK route. CA provides tablet but unfortunately mostly Asian/Chinese movies. Food is decent so is service - friendly but not overly attentive. Would definitely fly them again if price is competitive.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Flew Sep 2013 LAX-PEK-BKK. I’d chosen Air China strictly on price and was a little apprehensive. However everything from check-in on was up to international travel standards. The flight was no better or worse than other transpacific trips I'd taken in recent years on more highly regarded carriers. Food was OK and in-flight service was just fine. The coach seats were considerably more comfy than those on the Cathay Pacific flight I'd taken a year earlier. Because it is very geared to Chinese travelers I could see why someone might find the in-flight entertainment lacking. Available English language movie selection was a bit dated and odd and included a fair number of Westerns from the 50’s and 60’s. While flying CA is not bad at all transiting in the Beijing airport is another matter entirely. Before proceeding on to the connecting flight we queued up in a pretty long line for the thinly staffed Chinese immigration desk to stamp us into China. We were then channelled into the airports general security line for re-entry into the airports departure gate area. Very frustrating and very time consuming. I'd be reluctant to take any flight where there is a transfer in PEK. If you have a tight connection you are not going to make it. Bottom line: if the ticket price is attractive and there was ample time between connecting flights in PEK I would not hesitate to fly CA again.,nan,4.0,nan

Lots of food wine and beer served then during the night it was self serve for cold drinks and snacks. Few lineups for the bathroom. Smooth flight from New York to Beijing then we flew 5 days later to Shanghai. Returned to Beijing airport 3 days later and flew back to New York JFK.

All flights were on time and none were full to capacity. The food was standard although no hot drinks served. All cabin crew were very helpful. We could not check-in online (machine not working) and had difficulty with the automatic machines at Heathrow which accepted only one of our passports. The queues at the check in at Manilla on the return flight were extensive and although not vast numbers were flying we were still waiting in line for about an hour as so few check-in kiosks open. Beijing is a very large airport but times passing through security etc is very slow. One lady (by herself) was operating the X-Ray machine and she was also manually checking everything in the hand luggage she wanted to query. She was very thorough but it caused long delays. We had only just enough time to get our connection (final boarding) - which was 90 minutes. On the outward flight we had 8 hours to kill at Beijing Airport.

I booked for convenience of arrival time and it was a mistake. I fly to India once a year and have flown many Asian airlines and they are excellent. When you have 21 hours on a plane you really do expect movie choices more recent than 1960's.

All flights left on time and the transfer through Beijing was relatively painless as all flights in same terminal. Meals were very good for airline fodder and plenty of them along with water and drinks. Staff were well turned out and efficient but as pointed out in another review quite emotionless. A couple of smiles wouldn't go amiss! My only gripe was the complexity of the inflight entertainment remote control. Took a bit of working out and couldn't get my daughters to work on the outbound journey.

nan,First Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,2.0,PEK-IAH April 2014. First Class 777/300. Flight departure time 3.00. My wife and I were at the gate 15 minutes before boarding and the pushing had already started. There was no sign for a first class line so both lines were 20 passengers long. When I finally got the attention of the gate agent she pointed to the front of a line. After boarding we took our seats 1L and 2L. We were served a drink and told we would be the only two in FC. Here is where it starts to go downhill fast. After take off we were served dinner. When I checked the menu on their web site it was supposed to be Australian Beef. They didn't know anything about that but they had a beef meal the only Western choice. OK I'll try it. Soup was cold so I sent it back and it came back cold. Now for the beef. It looked like pot roast with cold lumpy gravy. I sent it back and it came back exactly the same. Dessert was something round the size of a half dollar. Tasteless. Red wine was supposed to be French but I think it was Chinese brand Great Wall Wine. Not drinkable. The AVOD wasn't bad so I watched a movie and tried to sleep. Should be easy with only 2 of us in FC. Then crew moved to empty seats to sleep. Just when I thought I would fall asleep the FA's started cooking in the FC galley. Banging dishes and glasses. The cooking smell went on for several hours. Arrival in Houston was a welcome relief. Priority tagged bags hit the belt about 10 minutes after the first bag. Air China has a long way to go to compete in the International market. They actually make United look great. I was using miles for this flight. I would have been more upset if I had paid for it. When I checked their web site FC one way PEK-IAH was $13.000. Hard to believe they operate this flight with limited English FA's and horrible food as a United codeshare.,nan,1.0,nan

The flight out of HKG was an A321 and left on time. The e-ticket stated we would be served refreshments but they served a full lunch accompanied by a few beers. Water runs followed until we reached PEK in good time for the connection to YVR. Transit visa desk and security were relatively painless although you cant help notice the overstaffing which we will put down to 'security'! The trans-pacific flights were more than simply acceptable especially as the flights weren't full. I like the seating layout of the A330 which allows for better sleeping as there is no third person wanting to get into the aisle for whatever reason. The final flight from PEK to HKG was actually operated by an Air Macau aircraft and crew. An 321 and it got us safely back to HKG on time.

The transfer in Beijing was the most unpleasant and horrible experience I've experienced. We had 1 hour only from our flight CDG-PEK to the other flight PEK-TYO. After passing the corridor when exiting the first plane (CDG-PEK) an attendant was present to ask whether we have a transfer. As we said ""Tokyo in 1 hour' she said Hurry hurry go! and pointed the direction where to go. But a huge queue of passengers was our destination and among them some with a transfer for a flight 3 or 4 hours later. No Airport staffwas present to direct us. We had to apologize to other people to come before them as our flight was leaving in 30 minutes as time was passing and the officer did not dare to accelerate the process of immigration control (for a transit flight!). This queue was a joke as people in transfer had to face immigration control and security control just like they trip would stop in Beijing. All that passenger had already passed these different controls in the country of their departure. Then we had to run for 500 m with our bags to the gate were a bus was patiently waiting for us. TYO-PEK-CDG looked like the same except that we had 2 hours for the transfer. Always security and immigration control with unpleasant and unhelpful officers sure of the power they have to annoy cistomers. One officer even took the external hard drive of my friend in a suspicious way (he had all his pictures in it) making him almost believe that he would confiscate it.

The flight attendant replied with: “Didn't I give you one earlier?” The first bottle I received when I boarded the plane and I asked for the second bottle after I'd eaten my meal. Rather than bringing me a new bottle she proceeded to fill up my empty water bottle. My second complaint was the breakfast. I slept past the breakfast time. When the flight attendant gave my breakfast after I woke up it was cold dim sum. The flight attendant did not bother to heat up my food. My last occurred when I was about to fill out the customs declaration; I was given a choice between English and Chinese on the flight to Beijing but the flight attendant made an assumption and gave me the Chinese one without asking. I've lived in the US for 30 years and would have preferred an English one over simplified Chinese.

The inflight entertainment could have been better. The movie & TV options in English were limited and aged. However they still gave us something to do during the flight. The provided headsets were not very good but we brought our own for the long trip so it wasn't a problem for us.

I was one of the last to board so I just stood in the galley and kept fingers crossed for possible upgrade. No upgrade however I did get an aisle seat so win-win family stayed together and I was in a better seat.

Again no announcements were made as to why we were waiting for at least the first hour and no crew were in sight we just sat there. Food was pretty mediocre and when offered a choice of chicken or seafood they then said there was no chicken and I had to wait.

It turned out that I was given one of only six double seats on the Boeing 777-300 ER! My troublesome right leg was therefore free to move around. The airplane was newish and very clean. All the flight attendants were female young and smartly turned out. While not particularly friendly and making little attempt to socialize with the passengers they were polite and at least one was always available near the midship galley which had tea water juice and cookies for snacking. Seats were fairly comfortable with the usual minimal recline feature. Food was another surprise: tasty chicken and rice or shrimps and rice; but the ""tomato"" juice was atrocious. Late in the flight the faucet in one of the toilets disintegrated. I alerted a flight attendant who examined it gave up on fixing it and then walked away! I wrote a warning sign in English and asked a more senior attendant to write a Chinese version. She did so and agreed with me that locking the door was a good idea.

A smaller aircraft A320 but still fantastic service and the added bonus of a full meal for this 3.5 hr flight.

Arrived in Beijing at 9.45pm and after an even quicker transfer at Beijing boarded flight CA861 to London Gatwick (LGW). A330-200ER.

Our group of passengers finally stumbled upon a security officer who directed us to China Airlines' counter on a separate floor. Long lines and only 2 overworked employees helping us to get the connecting flight. Contrary to the flight crew announcements the connecting flight was scheduled at 2.30pm not 12.30 as announced. Adding insult to the injury China Airlines gave us a meal ticket in Taiwanese Dollars worth about $3USD not even enough for a hamburger.

IFE was horrible being an old plane what you get is a not more than 6-7"" screen and no matter how you play with brightness and or screen position you won't see much. Resorted to music in the end. Games were slightly newer. Cabin crew were nice but their English command was poor. We all know that you get what you pay for but we also know that nowadays in airlines world that is not entirely true. There are very good and cheap carriers operating in Asia.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,2.0,Flew LAX-TPE-BKK and return. The most important thing to know about CI (as of Sept ’14) is that if you purchase your economy ticket through an online service (like Kayak or Expedia) the airlines policy prohibits you from getting a seat assignment prior to day of departure. Unfortunately online ticket purchasers don't find this out until after they've plunked down big bucks on a non-refundable ticket. This lack of a passengers capability to select a seat in advance (not to mention the lack of transparency) is reason enough for you to take your transpacific business to another carrier. The planes used on the transpacific segments of my trip had a tight economy seating configuration with little legroom. It felt pretty much like flying a domestic carrier in the US. Food general service and in-seat entertainment was on par with other airlines on this route. Flight attendants were pleasant. The one benefit of flying CI is that transfer to connecting flights at Taipei's Taoyuan airport is smooth enough to accommodate fairly tight connections time-wise. (This is not the case in Beijing or even Hong Kong). Unless you get an incredible deal on your ticket and you don't care where you sit on a long flight I'd give CI a pass and book with someone else.,nan,3.0,nan

The seat recline was 170 degrees and the feeling was very similar to the business class seats on the Garuda A333 fleet. Food on the outbound leg was fabulous. I do travel regularly but it was one of the best meals that I have ever had on a plane. Sleeping was no problem as the seat reclines to 170 degrees or more. The food on the return leg was lower quality but what can you expect on an inbound flight? The seats were the same as the ones going there and we did have a wonderful night's rest.

They convinced me so I booked. I am now en-route and have hit my first obstacle in LAX. Even though I booked as high of a class offered on my flight I cannot access the First Class lounge. Quite frankly I've put in over 25 years of the Asian travel and during my lay- overs the First Class lounges are much nicer than the Business class lounges. I am now at the Taipei airport Business Lounge and the food and amenities are spare. I have been told they do not offer bottled water. Sounds like I'm complaining I'm really not. Just disappointed. The fare that I paid was in the same ball park of what I've always paid for their First Class and when I have longer lay overs it's nice to have the amenities (food etc.) especially when your paying first class fare. It's clear that China Airlines can get many more of the Premium Business class seats in the airplane but I think they need to understand what their customers seeking First Class ( and are willing to pay for it) expect.

With 2 young children with me, I request the flight attendant if she can offer me some in-flight toys so my children can be seated quietly before take-off. However, the first response the flight attendant offered me was ""you didn't have it?"" and start to stare around our seats to see if we already received; it was extremely offending. Then she came back with 1 set of toy and claimed that they have ran out so my children would need to share, and sarcastically said ""I don't know how to use this so you need to figure out"".

I then ask if can have another pass so I can bring all my children to the lounge. Since China Airlines utilizes contractors and only have 1 direct staff at the Singapore Changi Airport, for every inquiry I made, the contractor would need to stand up and walks few steps to the China Airlines representative to get her permission. Surprisingly, as an elite member of this airline, the China Airlines representative remain seated at her position and for every question asked, the contractor would need to walk back and forth to address this issue. The worse case even after I call the customer service hotline to report the situation, the service attitude did not change. And the only solution the hotline can offer me is that they will ""report back to HQ"" of the situation. Despite the horrible check-in experience with China Airlines, when I arrived at the Changi Airport Dnata Lounge (not operated by China Airlines), when I asked them if I can bring another child in, they said that since your son is so young, of course, we will allow you.

I select China Airlines because they always seem to have the cheapest fares on this route, probably because of the long 18 hour transit in Taipei. JFK to Taipei leg had a new Boeing 777-300ER which was quite nice with good IFE and reasonable comfort and room, even on a 95% full flight. One flight attendant made it quite clear that she would rather be somewhere else and detracted from the other crew. Always a hassle trying to arrange the transit hotel on arrival in Taipei as the transfer desk seem to know nothing about it, despite it clearly being in your booking. Not sure why they use a 3 star hotel (Taoyuan Hotel) 30 minutes from the airport for this purpose. Taipei to Sydney leg on much older A330 that was a full flight and fairly uncomfortable.

Due to Typhoon my flight was cancelled but instead of helping you get on another flight, they make you call and rebook. I understand its not their fault but as a business they should do their best to help you. A check in agent at Hong Kong China Airlines desk was rude and I waited 4 hours for them to find the luggage I checked in early the day before, she wouldnt call to check for me and just told me it will come when it comes. I stood in front of that desk after I was told 3 times to come back at certain times. Other staff there at least checked for me. After an hour wait, our call went through and we got a flight for the next day. Now I'm waiting for my flight back to LA and its been 3 hours. First I got the run around and was told the wrong gate and that the plane hasn't arrived. I went to eat and luckily decided to ask again because they said they were boarding and to hurry to another gate, the original gate I was at when they told us it was wrong. 3 hours and counting.

Water and juice offered on boarding. After take-off drinks requests taken. Champagne (french) chilled and served in Champagne glass. The seat was an angled capsule type. It was a bit hard and would not want to do long haul on this type of seat but for a six hour day time flight is was acceptable. Menus were handed out and dinner requests were taken. Dinner was served individually on china and the fish I ordered was tasty but the food on the whole was not excellent and I would give it 3.5 out of 5. The flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. During our transfer were went to the dynasty Lounge. The food was fine but it did get crowded. I noticed some passengers taking towels to the bathroom so showers are available. The next flight to Vancouver was on the A340 and the seats on this flight while not lie flat as previously stated in reviews are very comfortable. I appreciated the noise canceling ear phones on both flights. Amenity kits were handed out on this flight and I found these rather sparse. The food on this flight was not great my husband ordered the lamb and it was so tough he did not eat it. I again ordered fish and it was a bit dry but eatable.

They were quick to announce that since this was a late evening departure they would be serving only a light meal - but since it was only 11pm I felt this a bit of a cheap excuse since the flight is nearly 12 hours in duration. Even after take-off I had to ask for a drink as it became evident they weren't going to offer any before the light meal - of which there only two choices (one Asian and one sort-of Western) - wine was ok. As far as I could tell there was no service between meals - not even water trips - though they did hand out small bottles early on. Contrary to other suggestions here and elsewhere this route does not have angled beds in J/C Class - only the old z-style recliner seat. AVOD was pretty good - with a decent selection of both movies and music - didn't go back to Y section so not sure what was available there.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,I flew from ANC to TPE with family including one 5 yr old. We had 3 adjacent confirmed seats. The flight originated from JFK. When we checked in at ANC we were put in 3 separated seats because the middle one of our seats had been given to someone boarding at JFK. One of us was given a seat 30 rows further back. I objected and was told that CI staff at JFK can ignore confirmed seats for passengers boarding after JFK and that the plane was full. In other words a confirmed seat didn't really mean that. The seats we were given would have necessitated our 5 yr old sitting separately. I was told that it could probably be sorted out on board. But on boarding the aircraft the aircrew wouldn't even take care of it - I was told that I had to ask the other passenger to switch. I got their attention by saying that we were going to go to our original confirmed seats and they could decide what to do about that at takeoff time. It happened that the JFK originating passenger was willing to switch when he saw the situation but I think it was really bad procedure for CI to have put us through that. Either confirmed seats should mean that or there shouldn't be a pretence that there are confirmed seats. And certainly a young child should never be re-seated to a separated seat.,nan,4.0,nan

Flights between UK and Taipei were full but you can call the airline to pre-book seats.

Flights between Taipei and Bali were half full and we were given exit seats in both directions. Food was ok but don't expect Western food to be great. Entertainment system between UK and Taiwan excellent. Huge selection of current films shows CD albums and games. Check in staff ground staff and cabin crew all very helpful. Taipei airport was ok - worth noting that a new terminal is nearing completion and it looks very modern. Overall a very enjoyable experience and I would use this airline again.

C-class flights to Koror in Palau on a 737-800 and back were a very pleasant experience with a small cabin and comfortable old-style business class seats which are okay for a 4hr flight. The flight-attendent addresses you personally with your name (or try to do so) serve you plenty of rounds of drinks (good Champagne the Geman Riesling was to much ""Spätlese"" to go with your main the Californian Chardonnay was a good choice) and make your stay onboard very enjoyable. The transfer in Taipei was swift and the luggage made it back to Vienna with even 1 hour transfer time. Impressed.

The meals have deteriorated over the last few years. The wine selection is poor amenity kit is a waste of space - why do they bother. IFE is good films are not that up to date but there is a reasonable selection. Taipei Business lounge not great the T2 lounge better than T1 lounge. They use the Sky Team lounge at LHR which is very busy in the early evening but an hour or so before the 1000pm departure it is quiet pleasant. Really nice shower at LHR.

Good selection of films and shows with choice of languages. I had bulkhead seat due to my height bit narrow but legroom gain made up for it despite sitting next to families with babies! Food ok two full meal service and sandwiches available between. The drinks service was minimal as reported by others ( 1 small glass of wine with dinner) but staff happy to provide drinks when asked. Staff friendly and attentive. 90 minute delay on way back in Taipei gate desk had a complimentary drinks station set up within 30 minutes shows good customer service.

Staff at desk in terminal building at Amsterdam very rude and unhelpful. Staff at China airlines in London equally rude in never replying to several communications which were simply asking if such changes are standard procedure prior to making further bookings.

Obviously they'll be far more skilled at preparing the Asian dish.

The inflight service didn't have many 'trappings' (eg. no hot-towel before departure) as some airlines do but was sincere with good interaction from flight attendants. Food was very tasty and woolong tea was the great drink to wind up a meal. The downer was the limited leg room on the A330-300 between Sydney and Taipei considering it was a long-haul night flight.

nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,LHR-TPE-SYD return in C. Very attractive pricing but 5 hour layover in TPE make for 29-hour trip which is on the long side . Outward trip more than acceptable for the cost. A340 C-class seats are quite comfortable; less so for the A330 TPE-SYD leg. Lounges at LHR and TPE both did the job. Meals drinks and IFE all okay without being stunning - to some degree I suppose you get what you pay for. Return leg was problematic. TPE-LHR flight cancelled (no reason given at SYD) ended up rerouted via Frankfurt with a BA short-haul FRA-LHR leg. Main problem with this was a 20 hour layover in TPE (first flight landed at 0400 and FRA flight departed midnight); with a 4 hour wait in FRA for the final leg this made for a 50 hour trip which is really not good. Layover arrangements in TPE were acceptable in the circumstances : comfortable Novotel for the day with meals transfers organised swiftly and efficiently. However the business class product on TPE-FRA (747-400) is really quite poor - it is at least a decade out of date and looks like it. Meal service roughly equivalent to other sectors flown but seat not really acceptable and IFE laughably poor. Overall would consider again and regard it as very good value for money had all four sectors flown as originally scheduled.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Heathrow-Taipei-Sydney return in Business class. Check in LHR T4 was excellent and Skyteam lounge is acceptable. Onboard seating (A340-300 and A330-300) just about adequate - it is not lie-flat. Service ok crews friendly and managed as well as they could given their poor command of English. Meals and drinks services rather haphazard with drinks being served only with meals - and in very small glasses wine selection the same on all flights and not very interesting. Food ok with 3 main course selections but the service processes need some refinement. TPE lounge is a rather depressing windowless facility although the showers are welcome - however it was not open when landing back at 0415 on the return leg nor were there staff available to direct transferring passengers to the correct terminal (flight/gate not noted on the information screens). It eventually opened at 0530 but this needs correcting. Note should be made that the LHR-TPE-LHR sectors are very long as CI cannot fly over Chinese airspace - eastbound was over India Thailand Hong Kong then north-east to TPE (about 13 hours) and westbound was over Japan Siberia etc (14.5 hours). One thing that CI must address - the priority baggage tag system does not work and both in SYD and LHR all bags that had transferred in TPE came off last. The main advantage in using CI for this type of journey is cost - keep expectations low and it is ok.,nan,4.0,nan

Online check in can be done twenty four hours before the flight and was completed but boarding passes would not print out. Check in at the airport is at a dedicated desk and was fast end efficient. China Airlines uses the Skyteam lounge which is close to the departure gate - lounge is spacious and attractively designed and has all the facilities you can expect. On boarding coats are taken and welcome drink appears. China Airlines is not big on alcohol so that drink is Oolong tea. Aircraft LHR-TPE-SYD route have no first class and business cabin is right forward. There was no pre-dinner drinks service and the drink I ordered came on my meal tray. Meals properly served course by course and accompanied by wine wine on offer was adequate but not up to much and it was served in glasses more appropriate for serving a small sherry. The meal was tasty and interesting and there were choices for each course that was presented on good tableware with plastic cutlery. TPE-SYD sector the cutlery was stainless steel. Seats in business class are angled lie-flat ones but the footrest rise is a bit less than adequate and I noticed that several passengers used their pillow to give extra height to bring legs up to a more comfortable position. The seat controls are on the top of the armrest where they are nudged several times on a thirteen hour flight to cause sudden small random movements. I did not use the entertainment. We broke the flight at TPE for a two night stopover which was allowed within the basic fare. Arrival procedures at Terminal 1 very fast and away from the airport about thirty minutes after landing. TPE-SYD sector departs from Terminal 2. The China Airlines lounge is basic and looks like a railway carriage. Close by is another lounge that welcomes Priority Pass cardholders so those passengers may be better off trying that one instead. Arriving at Sydney was not the best. We were parked at the wrong gate where there was no one to meet the aircraft. After some delay and a debate whether the plane would be towed to the correct gate eventually the original gate was staffed and we left the aircraft 45 minutes later. We chose China Airlines because it offers competitive fares on the route and were satisfied with the service they provided.,nan,4.0,nan

I was told there were no other seats available but after 8 hours of screams and people sleeping and crawling on me and other passengers getting upset they moved me to 1st class where there appeared to be several empty seats.

Business class on B747-400 is sort of angled lie-flat but I would not be happy to spend 14h on a transpacific flight in one of those seats. Service polite and friendly and food is not bad. I could sleep a bit and I found the upper deck seats to be better and also the best seats are the ones in row 9. I was quite happy with this flight and think they are a good airline. Four star and no more though. Seat is really borderline for Business class.,nan,4.0,nan

Outbound crew excellent but food not as good as usual. Seats not lie-flat but fine for resting. Return service noticably poorer and dinner rushed on the basis that it was a night flight.

Taipei-New York was in the first newly refurbished 747 which is the same business product as Thai Airlines/Gulf Air/Turkish. Excellent product and nice new pillows and soft duvets. Food high quality and AVOD lots of choice. Quick transfer at TPE but total journey was 29hrs. The price justified the route and choice of airline. Would fly again.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,TPE-SFO. Flight was 2 hours late due to late arrival of aircraft and later a mechanical failure. Boarding chaotic and disorganized. Very tired cabin flickering lights dirty overhead projectors no PTVs not even air nozzles. Blackout twice during taxi and crew had to manually perform safety demo which took up 10 mins both in Chinese and English. They try very hard to sound pleasant and friendly with their English but it doesn't work without 'pleases' and 'thank yous'. Food ok. Overall I regretted paying more for such an outdated product. They're currently upgrading their cabins but that's no excuse for the poorly co-ordinated delay and rudeness.,nan,nan,nan

A medical surgery came up and we had to cancel - since we have fully refundable I didn't think it would be a problem. I read through the terms prior to purchasing. After getting the runaround from the Bangkok sales office I was finally told to do it online. In order to get a refund you have to agree to wait 45 days for the charge back to a credit card. Of course this wasn't mentioned during the purchasing process. I called the ticket office and they told me it would be much longer than 45 days. We will get a refund but weren't prepared for the lengthy time.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"Flights on China Airlines are fine. My complaint is about their frequent flyer program. Don't bother. They give you an award ticket for 30000 miles but it is only good for Hawaii which has no Availability through the year end (a full 12 months at the time of our attempt) at which point the ticket is no longer valid. So we had to make a special request to ""downgrade"" our award to 25000 miles so we could chose any flight in the continental US. Still pretty much impossible to get a ticket. The stupid thing is the staff will sit with you on the phone for hours trying. First they have to plug in a specific flight both outbound and return and then wait for their partner airline to get back to them. It is always unavailable even though the super saver discounted tickets are still not sold out on the web site. So they not only waste my time but they pay their staff to sit on the phone and go through this useless exercise. Eventually the staff will tell you that they can't stay on the phone all day!",nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Auckland to Brisbane return. Modern A330-300 2-4-2 seating configuration cabin fresh and clean if a little cramped. The fare was less for a full service airline than a low cost airline with no meal or baggage allowance - hence the plane was pretty full. Check in was done by Air NZ at AKL and Qantas at BNE so efficient and without difficulty. The personal allowance of 20 kg per person was allowed to be pooled over our family group so we weren't charged for the 28kg case as we would have on other airlines. Cabin crew were mainly young and well presented. Their English was possibly only at a novice level. The seats were comfortable with adjustable winged head rests. In flight entertainment was a touch screen seat back TV approx 7 inch screen; a choice of about 15 current movies plus a catalogue of oldies and regional content as well as the usual games music etc. Outbound headphones blankets and pillows on seat on. Soft drinks served before a light dinner - reasonable quality. Wine served with the meal this was poor - maybe ask for a beer instead. Hot drinks were served afterwards. The inbound was a little different; as the aircraft had arrived from Taipei some seats had headphones others none. The cabin crew distributed these shortly after take off. All in all a decent flight crew were pleasant not exceptional but not poor either.,nan,nan,nan

The plane was an upgraded 747-400 that had personally video screens in economy seats were very narrow and the seat pitch was painful. Food portions tiny.

Two days before our departure China airlines called and cancelled our flight due to the cancellation of the flight from Taipei to BNE. They didn't give us any reason and not even try to find us the alternative route. Although we have the full refund we have to find another airlines in the last minute. Luckily we are able to get on another airlines but it cost us £600 extra due to last minute fare. We are so disgusted with China Airlines and we would not recommend China Airlines to anyone.

Lounge in BKK excellent with hot and cold dishes. Flight was 1 hr late leaving BKK but were given a meal voucher in the airport despite the fact food in the lounge was ample.

Food for lunch was good quality although there was no proper dessert. Problem was that the service felt very rushed even though it was a 3 hour flight. A particular problem I have encountered on all CI flights is that the crew seem unable to co-ordinate the service of wine with food and then to keep glasses topped up even in a small business class cabin. Twice I had to use the call button in order to get some wine. Although it was answered instantly this is no substitute for a proper drinks trolley service.

When my husband couldn't sit down there was much flurry of activity to find him somewhere he could fit. He was embarrassed and naturally we were separated from him for the entire trip - no apology from anyone of course. Ironically people who checked in after us were seated in a front row with leg room.

Flights were on time or only slightly delayed and boarding was efficient. Meals were of a very high standard in economy and the mainly female cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I noticed that the fluency of English (though I understand Mandarin) has improved significantly. Inflight entertainment was personal AVOD but selection was not quite as large compared to Cathay or Qantas. Flight from TPE to BNE was on an A330 with upgraded economy cabin.

I registered with CAL's Frequent Flyer program and ordered a vegetarian meal which was served piping hot before general meals were served to other passengers which was an added bonus. CAL has switched to using their A340-300s on this route. Aircraft's are around 11 years old on average and every window seat in Economy class has a large IFE box underneath with severely restricts legroom. I was lucky on the outbound flight since the seat next to me was unoccupied and I could stretch my legs a bit. On the return leg however that wasn't the case and the 12-13 hour flight was particularly uncomfortable due to the cramped conditions. Seat pitch is 31 inches on these aircraft and the base moves forward when reclined which restricts legroom even further. Entertainment was generally good with the latest blockbusters on offer coupled with a wide selection of older films. BBC and CNN news channels were also available as were a good selection of audio CDs. The crew were very affable and free beverages and snacks were available throughout the flight and promptly served when requested. CAL offers good value for money and the flights run on time so I will definitely fly with them again.

The website is clunky and I could not get a boarding pass despite being able to check in online before the flight. In saying that, the check-in counter at Auckland International was fine - if not a bit slow, with some ground staff (in China Airlines uniform) idle and chatting amongst themselves, rather than serving customers in line. The flight was late around 1 hour for take-off but managed to arrive only 20 minutes late. Boarding, in spite of the lateness was relatively efficient. Unfortunately (fault of the airport staff more than the airline staff) the boarding times between the display and actual boarding time was inconsistent, creating a great deal of confusion. The flight itself redeemed the initial chaos. The plane was an old A330 but the seating was comfortable with decent legroom and width. The IFE screen was very small and resolution was poor, but it was surprisingly responsive to touch and there was a variety of latest movies available. While the IFE was available shortly after takeoff, the headphones weren't available until much later - this should have handed out before the flight. The crew was otherwise lovely - courteous and efficient. The meal, while on the small side, was tasty. The drink service was prompt and serving size was generous.

FA's did a great job of keeping the cabin clean and take safety very seriously.

The check-in was quick but I was not asked my seat preference and ended up in a seat which meant I was disturbed each time the person next to me got up. The Lounge at Amsterdam airport was KLM’s which is an airy space with plenty of seats, food and a bar. China Airlines needs to improve the product it offers on its Amsterdam flights before I book with them again, for now I will carry on using Emirates or Qatar Airways, both having a far superior Business product in comparison.

The quality of dinner they serve is quite good, with 3 choices, Japanese style dinner is excellent, followed by the standard fare like cakes and ice cream. Cabin crew are proactive and polite. AVOD offers a fair choice, not that there's a lot, but sufficient for short to medium haul flights, with noise canceling headset. I find the remote control a bit chunky and awkward to use with the twisted cords. Unfortunately, due to bad weather condition in the first leg, I missed the 2nd leg, the staff gladly arranged a hotel for the night and escorted me wth a car to get back.

In Kaohsiung airport, China Airlines has 3 counters for priority members, but since the counters was also in waiting, so I was converted to economy class counter that vacant. The lounge is standard and I have accessed their lounge for almost one year noticing the food AND drink available was still similar. Boarding was quite smooth and on time. In Hong Kong, since the transfer is quite short, there was no time to enter the Skyteam lounge, but sometimes when the flight from Taipei was delayed then you will have some times for the lounge near Gate 15. As usual, in-flight service was great with the cabin manager would introduce him/herself to us. The food, drink and refreshment they provided in-flight was more than standard.  Arrived in Jakarta, the baggage claim were faster and improving than before, only 15 minutes to wait until I had my baggage with me.",Business,5.0,nan

At that time, it had a reputation of not so good service, older planes, but good food. I have since been using other (newer) airlines going in and out of Taiwan the last few years. Recently, I was told the airline have undergone some renovations of planes, some newer airplanes, and so I decided to use China Airlines again. Much to my disappointment, both its ground service and inflight service are still terrible, to say the least. Upon arrival in Taipei, after everyone had already gotten off the plane and was waiting for their luggage, airlines change the carousel for luggage twice, making all the passenger running all over the airport looking for their luggages. The inflight crews were rude and rough. One of them was so eager and rushed to sell duty free stuff, his cart ran very hard into my seat. Instead of a simple apology, he gave me a mean angry stare.  And throughout the flight, he and several flight crews were ignorant of passenger needs and requests. It reminded of the old days, when many of China Airlines flight crews had that we are holier than passengers mentality. I guess after all these years, nothing had changed.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Both flights were on time, the seats were comfy, there was a decent selection of new release movies to watch with noise cancelling headsets, and the food and service was really good, particularly as these are short sectors. My champagne glass was kept topped up throughout both flights without me asking once! Pre-departure drinks and hot towels were offered in both directions, we were called by name throughout, and were thanked by the purser for flying with China Airlines as we were preparing to land.

Alas, things didn't go that way from then on. They were having problems refuelling the aircraft, and our departure time kept getting pushed further back.

The leg-room was quite tight, and the seat-back screen was small. There was a good selection of movies and TV shows to watch though.

Only after wandering around the check in area then I discovered Skyteam Priority and Business Class check in area and they were happy to check me in. Confusions then arose as I thought being a Qantas Gold Member booked on a QF code flight I was entitled to Gold Member extra baggage allowance. I then ended up paying 13kg in excess bag. The story didn't end there. Upon stepping into the plane, I was upset to see that CI had allocated a regional configured A330 to my flight. The seat did not recline to a comfortable position to lounge or to sleep! So much for paying to fly in Business Class! The seat pitch was so terrible and the cabin temperature was so too hot despite having mentioned to the crew. My flight was delayed and my bags didn't make it to QF145.

Two meals were provided on the flight, second one is cold and both meals are just very average in quality, taste and small in size. Since it was a might night flight, after the first flight the light was off and we are try to get some sleep, however it was so cold so me and my wife had to put on our coats and covered with a blanket, but still too cold so I went to asked the flight attendant and was told the air from outside is cold and the front cabin is ok. No dessert was provided on the flight, flight attendants have no smiles. I came from Taiwan and this was the second time I flew China Airlines Since I was moved to the US 33 years ago. I like Singapore Airlines, but 10 years ago they canceled the route, then I'm happy with the EVA Air. By the suggestion of a friend I fly China Airlines this time, and I was disappointed. My flight from Los Angeles to taipei was delayed 3.5  hours but was never notified, I found it out at preboarding one day earlier.

We were able to book our seats 6 months earlier, although this wasn't made clear to us at the time of booking. We made our seat allocations 3 months prior to the flight and could not get our preferred seating on the Taipei to Sapporo sector. No big deal. Whilst this flight leaves quite late - 11.15pm it gets in to Sapporo at a convenient time, for transfer to the ski fields in Hokkaido. The lounge China Airlines uses is the Plaza Premium Lounge - reasonable selection of snacks, limited choice of acceptable quality wines, average service. It doesn't feel like a 'special occasion'. Boarding is quick and again, professional. Juices and water are offered before take-off. Amenity pack includes lip balm and lotions, but of average quality. Seats are in a 2-2-2- formation in an older aircraft. The food, on both sectors, was the great disappointment of these flights. We have had better in economy on other carriers.

I thought it was very unusual when - on a 15 hour flight leaving JFK at midnight - they turned on all the lights in business class for the mid-flight meal and left them on for 3 hours. It was sure annoying to be woken up mid-flight for some little snack that I'm sure nobody would have even wanted if they hadn't woken us all up. And I don't recall ever seeing it happen on another airline. I asked if I could switch back to Economy where the lights were off so I could sleep, but she didn't get my sarcasm and went looking for a seat for me!!

Leg room on the window seats is obstructed by big entertainment box under seat in front of you. Online check-in on China Airlines website didn't work. Checked in at the airport and found out that my seat requests disappeared and was on standby, strange because I had a confirmed ticket. The information counter was helpful and could give us a window/aisle seat and we were told that for online checkin from Amsterdam Airport you have to use the KLM website (strange because I have CI ticket and not a KLM ticket).

Jakarta to Taipei checked in online 24 hours before departure via CI app. Plane was a B777 and choose the row of 2 at the back of economy. The next morning we found out that the plane was delayed (3 hours) and that they changed the Boeing 777 into the A330. This A330 was old and tired (worn seats) and had seen better days. Cabin crew was friendly. Last flight to Amsterdam an A350, checked in online 24 hours in advance. Seats were already assigned and couldn't change the seats. All the seats were 'not available'. We went to the airport early (5 hours before departure) and tried to get emergency exit seats, bulkhead seats or last row seats but nothing was possible. The checkin agent showed me the screen and told me that it was all blocked. Got the impression that China Airlines give some of the customers more privileges with seat requests because during the flight we found out that the blocked seats (we saw on the screen) were empty middle seats, probably to give the passengers in that row more personal space (this happened with 4 rows in economy). The A350 is a beautiful spacious aircraft. Good seats, even when the seat in front of you is reclined.

I flew into the LA airport from Minneapolis on January 2nd, about 3 hours before my China Airlines flight to Taipei, without a boarding pass for my flight to Taipei because Delta could not issue the international passes. I checked in to the China Airlines business lounge, who recorded my name and flight information and instructed me to wait until the Taipei flight was announced before picking up my boarding pass at the gate. When the flight was announced an hour later, I walked to the gate to get my boarding pass and was told that I was 5 minutes too late. they had awarded my business class seat to another traveler. (I reached the gate 40 minutes before takeoff, instead of 45 minutes.) I had paid roughly $3,000 for that business class ticket, had checked in with the business class lounge an hour earlier, and insisted that they let me board. The staff was unspeakably rude and insisted that I was wrong for being 5 minutes late, and that I must wait 24 hours for the next flight, and pay for my own hotel and other expenses. I remained at the gate complaining that it was unlikely that they could grant my business class ticket to another paying customer within 5 mintues after the 45-minute deadline. Then 10 minutes before takeoff, they told me they found me a seat. They claimed that a China Airlines staff had agreed to move to economy class ""as a courtesy."" Here is the punchline - the seat they ""found"" was my assigned seat, and they had given my seat to a China Airlines employee, and insisted up to the last minute that I must travel the next day. They had booted a paying business class customer so that an employee could take his seat instead. I am a regular customer of China Airlines, and service is normally okay, but this was one of the worst incidents I have encountered in 20+ years of business travel, and it was not caused by weather or technical problems.",Business,1.0,nan

We landed in TPE exactly the time my connecting flight was suppose to leave, I noted that my connecting flight was delayed by half an hour. I thought I may have a chance of making it. Unfortunately, the airline staff did not help at all. From the flight crew to the ground crew no one helped at all. First of all they did not request arriving passengers whose destination is TPE to wait in their seat while people with connecting flight leave the plane first. Once I got off the plane, there was no staff to expedite me from going from one terminal to the other terminal. In the past they have provided car to transport you but this time there was none. The first staff I asked told me that I will miss the plane and to proceed to the flight counter to be rescheduled for the next flight. I proceed to the flight counter and I encountered a second staff who promptly told me that if I rush I might make my connecting flight. To make long story short, I did make my connecting flight by running and without any help from the airline. China Airlines service has really deteriorated as compared to the past.

The food on the return flight is better than the food from the USA. I find this the case on all airlines. The entertainment options are limited however there is sufficient choice to remain occupied. The toilets were maintained in a clean state throughout the flight. All requests were met promptly and there was no staff down on the flight. It seemed there were always enough crew available to serve customer needs. The flight to Bangkok was without incident. Smooth and the captain kept us well information.

The flight attendants were hard to fault on both flights given they were quick to respond to calls and very polite. The meal options were fine but I didn't like the fact they only had Chinese snacks available at the galley. However there was a full bar service throughout the flight and they were happy to keep serving both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks throughout the flight. Aside from the issue with snacks, the only other in-flight issue I had was with the entertainment system not having quite the range of audio and movie options of airlines like Emirates. The only seriously negative issue I had was the transit experience at Taipei Airport with the security area being far too small and lacking staff members meaning long queues. Also Taipei airport terminal 1 departures area was lacking in international dining and shopping options, which is disappointing given Taipei Taoyuan is supposed to be one of Asia's major hubs.

Stewardesses were very friendly and helpful, food was tasty and well warmed, requests for extra wine and a double gin and tonic was swiftly satisfied! Whilst the staff did not go around much offering drinks, they  responded quickly to requests. To my surprise there was no late dinner on the 13 hour leg Taipei to Frankfurt, but requests for some snacks, water and wine was quickly responded to in a very courteous manner. Both aircraft were very new, clean and both flights were without any turbulences. (Happens to me regularly on routes via China for whatever reason).

No queue at check-in, with excellent ground crew at check-in and boarding. Premimum Economy had priority boarding. The amenities pack included slippers, eye shades, lip balm, moisturiser, toothbrush/toothpaste and a hair comb. In flight entertainment was excellent with big screens and a large collection of recent movies. Staff were very friendly and professional.

As a noticably pregnant woman flying with China I was disgusted with the staff. Not one of them acknowledged I was pregnant or bothered to help me get my bags into the overhead compartment, whenever I talked to staff there was thinly veiled contempt in their gaze, demeanor and voices. I was not a customer but problem. As an Australian I have never been treated like this by any other airline. On embarkation the cabin was thick with the smell of body odor, unclean, musty. The seats are crammed in like sardines and the food is disgusting. It was a read eye flight and they kept the lights on and fed us dinner at 2am when all I wanted to do was sleep, the flight was super bumpy and I did not feel safe with the condition of the inside of the plane surely making me wonder about the maintenance of the plane mechanics.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

Boarded in Rome, found my seat noticed a blanket on the seat not in a plastic bag. Opened it out and it was covered in black hairs. Found a flight attendant to ask for new blanket, and she said ""oh that's been used"" I had to ask for a clean one that came in a bag. The food was very bland I made the mistake and ordered vegetarian oriental, flavourless! The crew did not want to be there, they were remote in their expressions and service. When I asked for another water or apple juice they seemed annoyed that I asked. After the 9 hour layover in Taipei we were then directed to an Airbus A330 in my opinion far too small for a long haul flight to Brisbane. It was cramped, as in knees hitting the seat in front, and really uncomfortable. The on board IFE (inflight entertainment) screen was the size of a small paper back book, again not suitable for viewing a movie on a long haul flight. The crew were also detached on this flight as well. I don't expect the Crown Jewels when we fly but some sort of basic service is all one would expect. We would never ever fly China Airlines again, yes it was a good price but we got what we paid for.

Cabin was dated but clean with seats with generous legroom and recline despite the presence of an entertainment box under all seats. Flight attendants weren't the most friendly but did their jobs well, serving refreshments and snacks. The food tasted pretty good, the chicken tasted fresh. Portions need to increase (they were about the size of my passport) IFE was very bad. It probably hasn't been upgraded since the day it was installed way back in 2005. Its resolution was so low that viewing a movie on it was torture. Its touch screen was so unresponsive that I had to literally jab it to get the screen to recognise my touch.

A350,Business Class,3.0,May 2018,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,Sydney to London via Taipei,5.0," |  Sydney to London via Taipei. As a family of 2 adults and a 14month old traveling to the UK, a balance of comfort and budget was important and after extensive research, I decided to give China Airlines a try since they’ve opened a 1 stop route SYD - LGW on brand new A350’s with a design awarded business cabin. I’ve flown business to the UK before with Qantas and Malaysian Airlines. Pre flight was simple with online pre-selection of meals, seats and free WiFi offer available but no limo service. Business check in counter and express path for security meant quick transit to the SkyTeam lounge which wasn’t as nice as the Qantas lounge and limited food & bev options. Priority boarding was available and once on board, the choice of the China Airlines business product proved itself to be a good one. The cabin and lighting is excellent, the flat bed seats/suites are modeled on Qatar and are spacious & comfortable. With an evening departure, our son slept with my wife for most of the SYD - TPE leg. A large screen with IFE including Pepper Pig kept him amused for the short time he was awake. Only downside was some language barriers with several stewardesses & western food was below average. TPE airport transit was straight forward with a modern comfortable lounge, baby room and showers along with good Asian food available. TPE - LGW boarded quickly again with priority boarding for business but once on board, the service stood out as better than the prior leg, largely because the cabin staff all spoke better English. The rules are more relaxed on this airline so letting our son play with his toys in the footwell area of my seat when he was awake was a big plus (Qantas would not have allowed this for safety reasons I suspect). Qantas also insist on making your baby sleep with the baby seat belt attachment on which is awkward and unhelpful when he’s already asleep. The food was also better on this leg and Pol Roger 2006 vintage pink champagne was excellent! Overall, My wife and I felt the seat product is superior to Qantas’ new business product which we flew to Hawaii in Nov. the in-flight service & food is inferior but here’s what the compromise gets you and your family, business return to London for 2/3rds of the Qantas cost or most other premium airlines prices. I’m a gold frequent flyer with Qantas but if they can’t get closer in price, I’ll be flying with China Airlines again for the next UK visit.",Family Leisure,5.0,4.0

Cabin crew were pretty cold, very rarely showing a smile and we felt more of an inconvenience than appreciated customers.

Check in was smooth at a business class only counter. However the CI staff at the information desk was very rude to passengers making enquirers. Not a best representation of the company. It was very disappointing that as a business class passenger there is no dedicated lane for security and immigration. Security queue for both T1 (China Airlines) and T2 (EVA and China) tend to be long and neither airlines have special facilities for their business class passengers. The lounge in Taipei T1 (CI Dynasty lounge, the one closer to Gate A) was ok. It has no window but the design was classic. Food and drink choices were lacking. Boarding was announced in the lounge and there was a business class only bridge so you can skip the queue even if you are late at the gate. Service on this sector was significantly improved. I was offerred food and wine menu and was told that I should be able to change my food choice if I wanted to (I had pre-ordered online). The cabin manager introduced herself and offered a warm welcome. Again attention to details/amenities/food and drink were not as great as its main competitor EVA but this is partly compensated by the brand new airplane. Despite not offering full duvet and turn down service, sleep quality was good. The entertainment system also worked well. I personally found the onboard lounge on A350 a waste of space. I was told by the cabin manager that the lounge on 777 was larger and served its purpose and unfortunately it is not the case on A350. Business class passengers also only have 1 toilet (there are actually 2 but the other is frequented by passengers on deluxe economy). Overall the flight was a easy ride and we arrived at Gatwick early despite a late departure. It is not an overwhelming experience but it did work.",Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0

A350,Business Class,2.0,February 2018,2.0,5.0,3.0,yes,Gatwick to Taipei,4.0," |  Gatwick to Taipei. I haven't flown China Airlines for 20 years primarily due to their poor safety record in the 90s and also due to lack of network in Europe. After they launched direct flight to London I decided to take the opportunity and fly  back to Taiwan for lunar new year. I booked it through online travel agent and it was easy. However China Airlines website is difficult to navigate. Menu pre selection is not shown on your main profile, and entertainment was on another website. Nevertheless the online check in process was very easy. At London Gatwick the ground service is handled by a 3rd party company. They are very courteous and friendly. The lounge was No. 1 at the South Terminal. Nothing fancy but did it work. Boarding was well organised as business passengers were invited to take a seat near the bridge. The flight in the business class section was empty. 8 passengers occupied the entire 32 seats. Immediate reaction was the airplane was spotless and clean, while service was lacking. They only offered soft drinks before take off. It was noticeable how quiet the A350 was - far better than 777 and it was very spacious. The entertainment was good - large screen, good choices of movie and a lot of interaction function. The seat was  comfortable. What fell short (well, when being compared with EVA which is its main competitors) is the ambition to deliver a full service. On EVA you have great amenity, pajama, great selection of wines and food and service was second to none. On China Airlines it feels they are just doing their job without going extra mile. The biggest disappointment is the layout of the A350. There are 32 seats but there is only 1 toilet in the front of the airplane plus one at the rear of the business class section which is often visited by passengers in Premium Economy. Overall it's a ok flight but nothing really stands out. If the price is right I will still fly with China Airlines as it saves few hours and I really like A350; otherwise I would prefer EVA Air or Cathay Pacific over China Airlines.",Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0

However, it is always a painful experience, except the staff who is nice, the rest is really poor starting with the plane itself. It is a miserable plane with much too little space for a 5 hours international flight, this type of plane is usually used for domestic short flights only. Then there is no individual monitor and you have one poor movie playing for the all flight on a common screen. The food is low quality and this flight is usually always late ""due to the late arrival of the plane"". Only one thing is high is the price.

Did not travel with check-in luggage so the only interaction I had with staff on the ground was at the gate. I checked in on-line and needed to get my boarding card printed. This was done promptly and I was directed to board the aircraft. Cabin in Business was clean, neat and looked well maintained. Cabin staff were very professional, used my name and ensured that I had all I required but were not intrusive. Sat in 12K on this leg of the journey, found the ambient temperature too hot, 180 degree flatbed was unfortunately wasted on this leg as couldn't sleep comfortably at that temperature. Arrived in Taipei with a 4hr wait, used the lounge which was comfortable and staff were pleasant, a few of them spoke English which helped. Used the shower facility which was clean. Boarded flight leg to AMS on time, flight left on time as did previous leg. Filled out my breakfast request, put my bed into flat position and fell asleep. Ambient temperature was lower and I slept really well, right through the dinner service. Was in seat 11A on this leg and was wondering to myself whether being in the second row from the front of the aircraft had any influence on the temperature. Seating starts at row 10 on China Airlines A350. When I woke up about 6hrs later, the staff were apologising for not serving me dinner, had to assure them that i was alright, they brought me biscuits and green tea.

I had booked my tickets 2.5 months before my travel date and was only just contacted 3 weeks before I was due to leave through Expedia saying that there had been a change in my itinerary. My returning flight from SFO-TPE-SIN now had an 8-hr layover instead of a 2-hr layover because China Airlines was no longer operating their morning flight that I had previously selected. Despite my many calls to Expedia to mediate this with China Airlines over a week and a half, no appropriate options were given. China Airlines would give me a full refund, but not reimburse me for the higher ticket fares that I would incur since I would be booking just 3 weeks before my date. After exhausting every option I had, I had no choice but to accept the 8-hr layover in TPE. Their inability to provide any suitable options makes me regret that I ever chose China Airlines. This was going to be my first time traveling with them, and because of this frustrating situation, its left me not ever wanting to choose China Airlines.

On the second flight the crew were efficient but not particularly friendly. The A330 seat was more comfortable than the one I had going in the other direction - not flat, but I was able to get a good sleep. My inflight screen didn't work for the whole flight. The vegetarian meals were large but a bit stodgy and uninteresting. The toilets were kept spotless. The leg from Taipei to Melbourne operated on time. I would fly China Airlines again if the price was right.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A330 / Boeing 747,Business Class,4.0,May 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Melbourne to Sapporo via Taipei,3.0," | This flight was cheap and offered good value. Check-in was fast and the Qantas lounge in Melbourne, while very busy, was a pleasant start to the journey. Onboard service was friendly and efficient. The cabin was spotless. On this A330 my seat, which was spacious and comfortable in the seated position, was angled and bumpy when extended, making sleep difficult. The IFE screen was small by business class standards, and my vegetarian meals were rather bland. The transit lounge at Taipei was pleasant. The refitted B747 on the second leg to Sapporo had more comfortable seats and larger IFE screens. The vegetarian meals loaded in Taipei were more tasty than the offerings ex-Melbourne. For the price and convenience on flights to Japan I would recommend China Airlines.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 777,Economy Class,4.0,May 2017,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei,4.0," |  Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei. On our first leg of our trip home from Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei, I unfortunately left my tablet in the seat back pocket. It was within about 30 minutes after leaving the plane that I realized I had left my tablet. I went to the customer relations desk to report it and then when the staff came to the gate I again asked for their assistance. The lady at the gate followed up with me, before takeoff on the second leg, and indicated they had found my tablet and would put it on the next flight to LAX and to speak with the airline staff once we landed in the US. I have to be honest, in saying I was a little skeptical, but I provided my information to the staff at LAX and began to make phone calls the next day. Within a day and half I received a phone call from a young man at LAX that he had my tablet in hand. Thank you again to the young lady in Taipei and the LAX staff member for the extra effort in finding and delivering my tablet back to me.

A350,Business Class,5.0,June 2017,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes,Taipei to San Francisco,5.0," |  First time with China Airlines. Transited from Hong Kong via a Cathay A350 (see other review) and I wasn't expecting much. Lounge and boarding were not good. Poor quality lounge and chaotic inefficient boarding. From then on experience was top notch. A warm crew welcomed us aboard a beautifully outfitted business class.The seat was private, well designed and perfect for sleeping as the flight departed at 11.35pm. IFE was great, WiFi terrific, not a single complaint. Didn't eat dinner but the breakfast served was excellent. The crew bent over backwards to ensure everyone was happy and well looked after. Kudos to them. I'll ride their 350 over Cathay's any time.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0
nan,Economy Class,5.0,December 2016,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Singapore to Taipei,4.0," |  A very reasonable fare from Singapore to Taipei. The cabin was clean, cabin crew was very courteous. Foods served onboard are great. My only complaints are the movie selections. The length of the legroom is reasonable for Economy Class, you get what you paid for. Would travel with them again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
