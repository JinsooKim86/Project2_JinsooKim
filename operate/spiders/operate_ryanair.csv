Boeing 737,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,nan,4.0,nan,yes,Rome Ciampino to Tarbes,4.0," |  Rome Ciampino to Tarbes. Before choosing this flight I read reviews which worried me. I realised the complaints came from incidents, mostly from first time customer like me. To ensure I would not experience the same incidents, I read the procedures: bookings, luggage, check in, arrival time, etc. I booked 07:55 flight on 15 April 2018 from Rome Ciampino to Tarbes for myself, with plus service (this includes 20kg checked luggage). I installed Ryanair Apps to check in online (this is to avoid €55 charge for check in at the airport). I arranged my luggage not to exceed 20kg allowance. At the airport I dropped my luggage at check in counter, wait for boarding, everything was fine.  During the flight, everything was ok. Seats are non reclining, but hey it's only 1.5hr flight. Legroom was sufficient, I'm only 5'5"" anyway. Service was fine although I did not want to spend my euros for meals on board. After the flight I collected my luggage without hassle. So it was a good experience. Learning from those complaints: be prepared, understanding the procedure before choosing the flight, comply with it, you'll get the good experience as I had.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Boarding process was chaotic and we had to walk quite a long distance, in the rain, to the aircraft which was not parked close to the terminal even though the ramp was empty. No boarding gate. Had to use the aircraft stairs which were wet from the rain. Flight was short and tolerable. Landing was brutal - hard initial impact followed by some airtime and a second impact. In fairness to the pilots I think they were fighting a crosswind but there were no announcements warning us of what was to come. We had a gate in Barcelona and quick baggage delivery. Overall, worth what we paid.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

I had pre-booked a suitcase on the flight. My wife had too. Her passport is from the UK: her bag went straight through at the check-in counter. I have a Australian passport and my bag was weighed, tagged and given back to me to carry to another part of the airport for some sort of separate inspection. At the ""Special Inspection"" station I put the bag on the belt and it zipped away - there was no 'inspection'. I have traveled in and out of the UK for 40 years on other airlines and never had to do this sort of ridiculous procedure before. To add insult to injury I had submitted my German residency card and passport for stamping at the check-in counter but the desk attendant didn't stamp my boarding pass and I was given a lot of grief at the gate for 'not having a visa check'.

I was not able to get on our first flight and had to rebook with another airline just to arrive in our destination. The same thing happened on our return flight using them. After spending over three hours on their online chat services which one rude representative disconnected us I was finally able to get them to wave our fee to get on the plane when asked for some kind of compensation for our earlier flight I was promptly told no and disconnected by them yet again. This airline cost us over $500 in fees and lost us two days of our trip to Athens. I will never fly with them again.

I have travelled with Ryanair many time, and am aware that in order to get the low cost airfare you have to follow the rules.  I purchased a ticket from Athens to Dublin, 71.39 euros ,[1st may], received the confirmation booking, and the barcode ticket. When I went to board the flight I was told I could not as the payment had not gone through. I was told to go to arrivals and talk with someone in Skyline desk. I never received a email, text or phone call to say that the payment didn't go through.  I was given a piece of paper with website, call center and working hours. Could not get through to the phone number so went on live chat with Ryanair, got no help, then i told them how terrible it was to be left in Athens and then i was told to contact the Fraud Department - of course no response. I had to buy a ticket from a  travel agent at the airport (so helpful and understand of my situation), go to Paris and then Dublin with Air France, for 210 euro, but money and time well spent. I had the money to book the ticket with the same card I used with Ryanair, and knowing the way Ryanair operates, there was no point in loosing my sanity over a badly run airline. I got back home at 11pm instead of 4.30pm.

They refuse to rebook you on an alternative route, but if you pressure them they will allow you to book yourself. They will however later then refuse to reimburse you the cost of the alternative tickets even they have to according to EU regulation. Worst part is that they know they are doing something wrong.

However we all trooped on in time no issues over seats or baggage - obviously a well travelled bunch. All checked in online - as after all that's what it says when you book the flight (stop moaning about online check in and boarding passes). No problem with seating - spare seats allowed a little flexibility. Staff very pleasant - a little confusion initially as a trainee on board who confused who she needed to get bags put up in the hold. All dealt with a smile and a laugh and we were off. Drinks about average for a flight - arrived on time. Off like a ferret out of a trap at terminal one. Can't complain. Now Stansted airport that is another matter.,Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Secondly trying to check in online is awful. Not only is there poor internet abroad which makes checking in online abroad extremely difficult but it will not allow us to reserve seats together because apparently all the seats on the airplane are already reserved? The online help is again dreadful. I finally got onto the online chat room and asked for help to receive no reply after waiting for them! On top of this they then charge you to call up and ask for help. I will be avoiding Ryanair in the future after a disappointing service.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

This time just OK with one of the old aircraft and a crew who, in general, just did their job with no chat, smiles or eye contact but nevertheless efficient. The exception was the only female staff member - a charming Romanian young lady - who put her male colleagues to shame in getting my case down and carrying it to the airport lift for me.

This was my first 'special assistance' flight alone and the staff who were all friendly and helpful went above and beyond normal duties, helping me to my seat, stowing and retrieving my case from the rack and letting me move from my allocated centre seat to a window seat. Check-in staff were equally helpful - special assistance passengers are directed to the Flexi Plus counter - with only one passenger ahead of me and a wheelchair arriving within 5 minutes. I also tried the new Ryanair 'Full Breakfast' of orange juice, sausages,bacon, tomato, rosti and white pudding, Irish bread with butter and marmalade and choice of hot drinks.- served personally by the chief steward as he had never seen one before ! - and can recommend it at €10 having had far worse on big name airlines. Departing I was helped with my luggage to the airport lift and wished a pleasant weekend. With it also being a new aircraft with the more comfortable seats I would rate this as being one of the best flights, long or short haul that I have had in recent years.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

It was intended for both the bride and the groom of course. However they were the colleagues of my husband, so they bought it in his name. We very carefully planned what to do with these vouchers, when we finally thought that going back to Azores is the best way to spend them. We were about to pay for the 2 tickets from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada, when the system threw an error that only 4 vouchers can be accepted. We had 8. No problem, we thought. We would buy the tickets individually. So we bought the tickets for my husband, all 4 vouchers went through fine. Then we were going to buy mine, when the system disagreed, because the vouchers were in my husband's name. We contacted RyanAir, to ask for a solution. They have been using our wedding present for almost a year, and we naturally wanted to get something out of it. There only reply both through chat and complaint was that ""please read the terms and conditions."" Well. We are very disappointed, that something that has been intended to make us happy turned out so ugly. They have no flexibility, no customer care, no work arounds, nothing.

No Ryanair staff on floor, no explanation as to why the flight is over an hour late coming and going. People pay the money to expect their flight to arrive on time.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Munich to Dublin,2.0,"Munich to Dublin. Had 2 flights with Ryanair, and each flight was the absolute worst. My girlfriend and I checked in 3 days in advance and we were not given seats next to each other, even though the tickets were ordered at the same time and we could *see* that the seats next to each of us were available. Ryanair then prompted us ""Want to sit together?"" We could upgrade. Basically they tried to charge us extra money to get the service that you get included in every other flight. Obviously we didn't do that, and when we got on the flight it was mostly empty and everyone could sit wherever they wanted. Ryanair wasn't doing this splitting the seating to 'improve seating algorithm' or 'allow larger groups'- they were doing it solely to milk another couple bucks out of us from our ticket. Same thing in a different vein for every other aspect of the trip from boarding to arriving - boarding groups, luggage, etc. There must have been a dozen different upgrades you could purchase to bring the quality of their ticket up to the standard quality of every other existing airline. Obviously every airline does this to some extent, but the breaking up seating was the one that really got to me. Their carry-on luggage options were just as bad on paper, though the actual flight attendants were very relaxed about what could and couldn't be brought on a flight. That might depend on the people though- on paper, you would struggle to bring anything onto this flight for free as a carry-on. Caused a lot of needless anxiety as we were preparing to leave our backpacks worked for 99% of other airlines, but would they cost us $80 to bring through Ryanair? If they aren't going to enforce the luggage stuff they should relax it on paper so it doesn't cause travelers so much stress. On top of that, every other part of the trip was irritating in every way. Boarding process started ~30 minutes late for both of our flights. They accidentally left us stuck in a hot and crowded staircase for half an hour waiting for a bus. At some point during the flight they tried to sell us scratch-off lottery tickets for additional flights, which was annoying and loud and also just plain *weird*. Despite how late we always boarded, the flight was never late. The pilots cut down the flight by a lot of time. Very noticeable in landing, I've dropped my phone with more grace than some of these landings. I guess this is technically a plus but feeling like your pilot is rushing is never a good feeling on a flight for me. In summary, it was a miserable experience all around. Hard to grade these things since cheapo flights all pretty much suck (you get what you pay for), but some aspects of this like the 'split up seating' really elevated this one to something special.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

There was one customer service lady, attending to a ‘line’ of about 50 passengers - all frustrated and clueless what to do, where to go, but the queue at the Flexi-desk was kept free.

Pretty easy to book and get the flight I wanted for the price I considered fair. Very easy and straight forward booking process indeed. Very good value for money. As I had already done the online check in, which was very easy to do, I just went to the airport and went straight to the boarding gate. The flight had a slight delay, nothing serious and very unlike Ryanair which is very punctual but the weather was very bad and so it was normal to get delays. Boarding was simple and fast, and ground crew were nice and very efficient. No hassle at all. Boarding the plane was also fast, the plane was very clean and the crew were friendly and helpful as ever, I don't particularly like the Boeing 737, seats are narrower than in similar airbus (not Ryanair's fault, it is due to the plane) and I don't particularly like the orange on blue Ryanair scheme. Seats are adequately comfortable for a 2h flight but I wish they had some pockets in front of you to store your belongings. Overhead bins had sufficient space. Crew were friendly and had the usual drinks and food for passengers to buy and the flight was fast and uneventful. Very smooth flight. Deboarding was fast and I didn't have the need to wait for bags as I had not carried any checked in luggage. I just wish the new cabins come quickly as this design is very dated and honestly, I would start to get rid of the awful stock photo you see on the fron bulkhead.

Boarding was simple and fast, with very nice and efficient ground and air crews. The plane was very clean as always, and I must say I fly this route regularly with Ryanair and others and Ryanair is cleaner than some of their competitors. Also, I never got a dirty plane or seat in any Ryanair flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth, with no problems. I did't buy inflight foods or drinks but there was a decent amount to choose form as there was enough duty free. when we arrived, picking up the checked in luggage was very fast and everything was ok with my bag. All in all it was very pleasant experience, with great value for money, a hassle free experience. Flying made simple, indeed.

No offer of compensation and after trying to contact the airline who refused to talk to us and did not respond to any emails or messages sent. This is a disgrace, customer service is non existent.

Outbound flight: Had no problems during the flight, we were on time, landed a little earlier, flight attendants were friendly (I sometimes tend to get sick and at first I panicked a bit as there were no sick bags but when I asked an attendant she gave me one). Unfortunately the crew was very hard to understand when they announced something on the microphone, I never understood them as the quality was very poor. One thing I didn't like is that we had a group of drunk guys on board and the crew didn't told them to be more quiet, they even sold more beer. Everything else was as expected. Inbound flights: Fine as well, departing and arrived approx. 15 minutes later than scheduled but okay. The flight itself was a little rough but not Ryanair's fault. It was a flight in the late evening and I wanted to sleep a little but the crew bothered a bit as they always tried to sell something like scratch cards. Everything else fine.

However the ground staff needs training in how to help passengers, not berate them. Most other airlines allow for a visa check at the gate. Not Ryanair. I was passed through security, appeared at the gate in plenty of time, but at the time to board I was told to go all the way back through security to a miniscule and obscure check-in desk to have my US passport checked for my flight to Prague. It didn't matter one bit that the Czech Republic is visa-free for US citizens, only that I was required to do this. Of course I was not able to make the flight, but even worse the gate attendant was outright rude, stating it was not her fault. The gist of it is she was right, but her completely unhelpful attitude also tripped out at least 4 other US citizens on the same flight. This regularly happens due to poor ground training and procedures. After writing a complaint to Ryanair customer service the response was predictable, no apology, it is the passengers' responsibility to check the visa requirements. Ryanair needs to amend their procedures and place a qualified individual after security and before boarding so there is no longer the need for paying customers to be inconvenienced by missing their flight.

When we have checked in our bags and gone through security, they inform that not airplane is coming, due to late arrival, until seven to eight hours later. Still they could not offer any hotel room until four hours would pass, as the airplane could come earlier than their estimation. When we arrive the second time the plane is first estimated 30 minutes later than before, then to change into one hour. No personal of Ryanair was reachable neither at the airport nor through phone.

So I have no idea how the plane, on flight service, seats, or anything related ot the flight were as I never made it on a plane. So we waited in line for 3 hours to speak with a customer service representative about booking an alternative flight. When we finally made it through the line (many, many flights were cancelled this day), we found out that ALL Ryanair flights for the next 2 days to every location were completely booked, so the soonest we would be able to get on another flight was 3 days later. We had limited time where we were going as we were on vacation. So we decided to book with another airline (same day meant that it was very expensive). The customer service representative told us we qualified for compensation to make up some of the extra cost, and actually told us it was a good thing we got on another airline with how quickly all their flights were filling up. When filing for that compensation, we were told the cancellation was outside of their control so they would only refund the flight. We were given many reasons why the flight was cancelled by various airport and airline employees. Ryanair was not even willing to compensate money I would have lost if I had rebooked on their airline and stayed in London the additional 3 days.

My flight was delayed by almost 3 hours, resulting in an arrival in Germany at 1am. When Ryanair does the basics well, it is a very good airline. I want to get to my destination safely and an on-time. I have used Ryanair for many years because it never seems to compromise on safety and has had an excellent on-time record.  Something is going wrong with flights from London Stansted, which, I believe, is Ryanair's largest base, as measured by aircraft and passenger numbers. When I travelled to Nuremberg, I noticed that a large number of flights were leaving with delays - my own flight's delay was the longest but delays of 40-60 minutes seemed routine. People have told me that there is an ongoing problem with Swissport, the ground agents at Stansted airport. This may be so but, at the end of the day, Ryanair is responsible for the agencies with which it has contracts and for the operation of its flights. When a ground agent is not available to staff a gate, that is, and should be, a reflection of Ryanair. in the case of my flight to Nuremberg, I was told that the plane was flying with delays because of a concatenation of events: a technical problem leading to a plane change earlier in the day; ongoing problems with Swissport; a loss of slot because of late servicing of aircraft by Swissport; ATC restrictions. The short flight passed without incident and the crew were competent and efficient.

It is virtually impossible to find a customer service email contact. My query is very simple but, as per, large companies such as Ryanair have no concept of customer service.

Both flights were delayed by 1hr 30mins to 2hrs. However, it was the manner that they were delayed that was most frustrating. For both delays there was no communication from the airline. When we arrived there was no mention of delay until it became apparent that there was still no plane at the gate at the listed time of departure. After 45mins waiting at the gate we were finally allowed on the aircraft. However, the delay continued for another hour on the plane where it was incredibly uncomfortable, stuffy and hot. Overall I arrived 2 hours later than what was listed with zero communication from the airline besides an apology text to my phone the next day. The whole experience was not acceptable, even from a company that seems to have a reputation for this type of experience. he flight was the most uncomfortable and rocky flight I've ever experienced (and I'm someone that usually enjoys flying). Ryanair preaches low cost, however considering the multitude of ridiculous extra fees (e.g you have to pay upwards of €15 for a seat even though you've already purchased a ticket?), the consistent delays, the lack of communication, the uncomfortable flights, and the low quality customer service, it is in my opinion far more worth avoiding this company and paying the little bit extra it costs to fly with another airline to guarantee a stress-free flying experience.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

First time ever to fly with Ryanair and this has been an absolute disappointment from the very beginning to the end. Booked my ticket in May 2018 thinking I had a bargain compared to the prices shown by other airlines. I even selected the priority option costing a little extra. This meant I could carry a 10kg bag with a small bag. Arrived at the airport to drop my suitcase but was told I had to pay £50 because I didn't have this on my ticket. Completely shocked I argued but of course had no choice but to pay. After this the flight was delayed for almost 3 hours didn't arrive at my destination until 2am for a conference I had to attend by 8.30 the following morning. Well, thinking the nightmare was over and glad to have survived the ordeal. On my flight back, I thought perhaps the £50 I paid would have covered both leg of my trip only to be told that I needed to pay another £50 on my way back. Making a total of £100 pounds excluding the cost of my original ticket which was £98. While queuing pay for the cost of my laugage, I met several families who had exactly thesame problem as myself. Ryanair needs to state the exact cost implications of their flights. Now if I had known that this flight would have cost me almost £200, I certainly would have flown with British Airways without any doubt. Well, you learn every day.

There were no Ryanair staff in the airport to help or advise - check-in was being handled by other (I presume airport) staff. So, because of the sudden number of Ryanair cancellations all happening at the same time, that meant there was something like 1000 people all queuing to speak to three, non-Ryanair, staff at the information desk. We managed to book flights on another Ryanair flight, 36 hours (and two expensive nights in a hotel) later.The one good thing? I don't work for Ryanair.

I booked online and at the time thought the fare to be reasonable. The website was rather clear as to the charging policy and so I bought priority boarding and paid for a bag too. The priority boarding proved to be a false economy. Reaching Stansted was very expensive by train and entirely negated the few pounds saved against flights from my more local Heathrow. While the shambles of security at Stansted is beyond Ryanair I was concerned to see that my flight had not been on time once in 3 weeks. The bag drop was not well organised at all and the uniformed Ryanair staff member had a poor grasp of English. She actually walked away from an elderly German lady who asked for help with the bag tagging machine. The queue for the flight was poorly managed and regardless of my “priority” boarding I was one of the last to board due to the poor queue management. Sure enough, the flight was just over 1 hour late in departing for Budapest. The cabin crew were lovely people and very friendly and professional. The seat was fine for a short flight and the safety demonstration was conducted in a professional manner. If Ryanair could do something about the expensive train from Liverpool Street I would use their services again. However, due to the cost of reaching Stansted I shall look elsewhere for my next trip to Budapest.

Everyone was extremely frustrated and left without an alternative and no one can provide help particularly if the booking was made online. Even the staff in Hamburg airport were unimpressed with Ryanair and noted this is simply the way they operate.

There was no one to guide or instruct the passengers as to where to leave their suitcase or when it was time to do so, and there was no signage to denote that either.

Asked about how long the delay at baggage reclaim would take, the staff member became very officious and suggested we were arguing with her. We had not been asked to give her our boarding passes until she had become very defensive - ""Are you going to give me your boarding passes?"" - when we handed them over immediately. She was obviously having a bad day, and did not transfer anyone else's baggage to the hold after us. We were left to remove valuables and repack our bags. As someone who works in a customer-focused business, I find it hard to believe that staff can get away with rudeness and off-handed comments on a daily basis.

The staff, not Ryanair, told us there was a problem with the plane and it may take at least an hour to resolve. We received no more updates and the notice boards simply said boarding and gate closed. At approx 9:15, the notice boards stated we had to board again, but from a different gate. The plane was fully boarded by 9:45am. The doors were closed at 10:02am, and we took off at 10:15am. This was a delay of 2 hours and 15 minutes. The captain said it was down to Spanish air traffic control, they told us it was French air traffic control that caused the outbound delay. As Ryanair's terms state that if you are delayed by at least 2 hours, you will receive a text stating your rights, explaining compensation etc. No text received. When I challenged the stewards they said they thought it was 3 hours, not 2! Wow they didn't even know their own rules. They weren't willing to help at all and said I should just complain directly to Ryanair. Which I will be doing.

Value for money is good though, especially if you book in time and don't need to bring much luggage. Both flights were uneventful and arrived on time. The flight from Dublin to Eindhoven (Friday) was however boarded by a rather large group of semi-drunk Irish (wo)men who continued their drinking during the flight, had to use the toilets all the time and blocked the aisle. Headphones provided a welcome layer of isolation. For some reason, on the return flight there was more cabin luggage than could be fitted in the lockers. This was solved by putting whatever wouldn't fit on the floor of some free seats. Not sure if this is standard procedure, seemed a bit odd. Anyway, it was the standard Ryanair experience.

A second problem is that in order to be more customer friendly Ryanair now allows or does not care anymore if you take two or more pieces of luggage into the cabin. Some are huge and well over the size allowance. The result is either you board early or you will not find space for your small piece of luggage anymore. Boarding early does not help if you carry a soft bag as you will later see that the crew even help to squeeze hard suitcases into the overhead holds not caring about the content of your soft suitcase. On this fight I was shocked to see that about 15 very big suitcases were stored in empty rows placed in the free space between rows, the aircraft was about to take off when the chief assistant asked the assistants to remove the bags and place them elsewhere.

As for families with children and push chairs (have you seen the size of them nowadays) I would ban them from cabins at any price.

I ended up having to stay at home and lost parking and hotel deposit. Since June I have my flights to Rimini from Stansted booked and confirmed for Christmas. My family who live in Rimini have just informed me that Ryanair is stopping flying there from September so I phoned customer service to find out. I was told yes it was true and asked if I wanted a refund. Is that all you've got to say I inquired. After a long silence I was asked again if I wanted a refund; there was no explanation. To summarize Ryanair know that they are not going to fly into Rimini at Christmas but have no intention on informing the poor passengers who are looking forward to being there for Christmas. Not only they are holding on to everyone's money. They will hold you to ransom nearer the time leaving you no choice but to fly to Bologna or Ancona at inflated prices.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,Our flight from Limoges France to Stansted was cancelled due to poor weather although other planes including Ryanair flights were able to come and go. The next flight from Limoges to Stansted with availability was 3 days later. So we accepted a flight to Leeds the following day. That was all that was done for us we had to arrange our own overnight accommodation transport to and from the airport etc. My advice is if you travel with Ryanair: Make sure you have access to the internet because you need to react pretty quickly when the flight is cancelled as the airports are usually in the middle of nowhere. Know the location of the other airports Ryanair operate. We were offered a flight from Bergerac the next day but the airport staff could not tell us how to get there by train. Don't book stuff for the day after your arrival. There were people in the queue with connecting flights tickets for the Olympics that they could not use. Based on the above I would not travel again with Ryanair if I was travelling to a tight schedule. In total we got home 26 hrs after we planned.,nan,2.0,nan

It was now the time for the safety announcements prior to take off I do understand that this is important however I have never seen such miserable faces from the cabin staff. We were sitting in row five and it took nearly 1hr to get served I think mainly because they had to keep explaining what they had run out of even before we took off. The list was endless of what they hadn't got. When it was our turn I ordered 1 bottle of water a whisky and a can of coke I was taken back a little when they said that's 11 Euros. I quickly put my money back in my pocket. All they wanted to do was to sell scratch cards and smokeless cigarettes. Overall not impressed at all and will never travel Ryanair in the future. One final thing. Budget airline? My tickets where certainly not cheap or even reasonable.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,Stansted to Pula. Tried to adhere to all rules and regulations but failed to print boarding passes for return journey and hence fined €240 for family of four. This was a genuine error caused by my printing off the outbound boarding passes at too early a stage in my eagerness to do all correctly at which time unable to print for return. Erroneously assumed outbound copies and itinerary would suffice. Hold my hands up and agree nominal fine should be payable but believe that €60 per person is totally disproportionate to administration involved for the error. Walked 5 metres handed over credit card and after a minutes transaction and €240 pound payment returned to check in and allowed to board!

The new Billi section where the cheap airlines operate is once through security tiny poor toilet facilities and passengers crammed in like sardines. Announcements impossible to hear queues for the gates mingling with people in the shopping areas and once at the gates even tighter than sardines. I understand you have to know what you are doing and what to expect with cheap airlines but I will avoid them if I can in future. This experience was stressful and very uncomfortable.

Then was told because my bag was 15.5kg and my wife's was 16kg we would be charged £100 for being over weight if we couldn't re-pack. The ignorant woman at check in couldn't care less about our upset child. We managed to get our luggage re-packed and I was told by another member of staff that my bag would be fine at 15.5kg. When getting onto the plane to get or free for all seat rush. My wife asks for assistance to find at least two seats together but the stewardess snootily told her to keep moving up the plane and find a seat. Luckily somebody moved so that she could sit with our child. Then you have to spend the rest of the flight listening to bored and rude cabin crew trying to sell things. Not the greatest start to our 1st family holiday. Have flown with Ryanair before to stags with friends with only hand luggage but will never use them again for a family holiday. They just don't care about their customers or the quality of your journey.,nan,2.0,nan

I saw myself the size of the bags people were trying to take on was never hand luggage. I paid to put my luggage in the hold but people were trying it on at the gate to get away with it and Ryanair don't move at all on the rules. I also paid for priority boarding as they only sell this to half of the seats on the plane you are almost guaranteed to sit together peace of mind your boarding 1st to save the bun fight when you get to the gate.

The plane was clean and it took off and arrived on time. If you are travelling on a weekend break for 2 adults then I imagine it wouldn't be a problem just so long as you read all the small print and adhere to them very carefully however with 4 small children and no way to book a seat it was extremely stressful. I do not understand what they gain by using this system! Would go as far as to say that it is immoral that knowing that you cannot take drinks on board they do not supply water and a small bottle of water is £3! Staff were miserable and openly complained about other passengers whilst stood next to me. They enforce the rules when it suits them.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,July 2012 Bristol to Tenerife. We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children 10 and 14). We knew that seats weren't allocated but as long as one of our kids was sat with us each we didn't mind. Check in was quick and easy at Bristol as was boarding. Boarding Passes - it clearly states that you have to print them off prior to travelling and you have 14 days to print off your returns if you read the terms and conditions this is quite clear. Yes food and drink is a little expensive but I have never know an airline yet who sell cheap food and drink if you don't like it then buy it in departures prior to boarding. We experience some bad turbulence when landing which meant we had to take off again and land in the North of the Island. After sitting on the tarmac for 30 minutes we were told that buses were waiting for us at the front of the terminal to take us down to Tenerife South other than a little bit of confusion with the staff at the airport this went quite smoothly. People were moaning and complaining about Ryanair and standing in the aisle of the plane when we had all been asked to remain seated until further instructions were given but all I can say is I was happy to land safely rather than Ryanair attempting to land in such bad conditions and put everyone at risk! Staff were friendly enough the return flight was good and they got us back slightly earlier than planned. The plane did not seem anymore uncomfortable than others we have travelled on and it was clean. Lastly if you have young children I recommend you pay for priority boarding or make every effort to get to the front of the queue before boarding if you all want to sit together.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,5.0,Having used Ryanar for the past 3 yrs travelling to Tenerife Gran Canaria and Reus I we can only fully recommend and thank them for their fast efficient service. This is a budget airline and all extras are stated on booking on their website. For all those who wish to pay over the odds eg. extra £700 per family to fly to a destination then book Thomson or Thomas Cook however we used these one way to Reus and had an hour and half delay compared to every flight with Ryanair on time or usually 10 mins early. Some people just like to complain if you have a young family and want to sit together pre book seats or alternatively use Priority Boarding. I only wish Ryanair flew from Cardiff airport as we would save even more travel costs however it is worth the trip to Bristol as you could never fly a family of 4 from Cardiff for £700 to Canaries.

Stress standing crammed into a much too small area with all the other cattle. No facilities (refreshments or toilets) in 35 degree heat for 45 minutes. Stress barging through to the plane. Stress with the bright lights and constant announcements. No quick hostess service followed by a dimming of the lights so you can sleep. Awoken every 20 minutes to an automated scratchcard announcement. Uncomfortable seats which seem to have less padding than others. I landed with a headache which wrote off the following day.

Got a seat after walking up and down looking lost and no thanks to the crew! No issues going over but not good coming back. Why can't they let the kids on first. All they care about is money.

When printing out the boarding pass (which is compulsory) I find that I can only print out the outbound boarding pass and not the return because of the 15 day advance booking in rule (not an Issue with Easyjet). When I asked the Customer services if Ryanair can print the boarding pass for me at Alicante Airport I was told this would cost £70 which is more than the flight cost.

Not travelling with a printer I needed to obtain a boarding pass at the auto check-in point at the airport. Ryanair refused to issue a boarding pass before I paid an additional 70 pounds almost the same price I paid for the ticket. I could have flown to Belfast and taken a 65 pounds taxi to Derry and still be better off. Attendants refusing to make eye contact said it was Ryanair policy and failure to pay would mean refusal to board yet I am still unsure how I was supposed to know this. It therefore came across as an express strategy to extort funds from passengers. Ryan Air's majority passengers being budget travellers makes this particularly mean- spirited. In all my travels I have never encountered any airline penalising customers for having to issue a boarding pass. I count myself lucky I never have to make use of Ryanair's services again and will actively dissuade anybody at risk of having to do so. The only unpleasant experience during a two week UK holiday and therefore one I recount often.

The aircraft was filthy and I had to sit with my feet in biscuit crumbs crisps bread crusts empty drink bottles - it was disgusting. Even when the seatbelt light was on people kept getting up and fiddling with their luggage. Also when the cabin bags were checked many of them pushed and shoved their bags in the testing rack - so much so that one man pulled his handle off and threw it across the airport floor! This testing of cabin bags does not work as several should have been in the hold but these people wanted to get away with paying and were arguing with the airport staff who jut let them through therefore Ryanair is losing out on payments for luggage and honest passengers are paying the price it needs to be sorted!,nan,3.0,nan

Bordeaux luggage collection was unbearably slow and there is no access to toilet facilities in the big shed that passes for a terminal - Ryanair don't have access to the main airport terminal. On the return leg we were kept waiting for 40 minutes standing in a queue to board once again in the big shed with no apology for the delay no air conditioning or fresh air - gruesome!!

My partner was flying to Stansted which is about 40 Miles north of London. After 5 minutes of standing in the queue the Ryanair person working at the desk disappeared and was talking to her friend at the hand luggage and boarding card control desk. I went over and asked her why she was not manning the desk any more and she said ""because I only take luggage 40 minutes before take-off"". When I said ""but we were waiting there and you closed the desk without even telling us"" she then lost her patience and got really rude. Subsequently we paid the 60 euros. They call themselves a ""no-frills airline"" but in effect they are indeed an uncaring ""no-service airline"". I would give them one star out of 10 for their airport staff.

Coming back from Palma it was obvious the people in front of us had used Ryanair before. They were a couple with two children and had put a large bag on the floor with coats on top and got the youngest child to lay on it. The father had another large bag over his shoulder. The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase. After we all boarded a young couple squashed into the extra legroom pretending to let people pass by then were amazed that there was no seats left together so they ended up sitting there.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Manchester - Palma. Paid for extra leg room which came with priority boarding. Well worth the £15 each way to not stand in the queue to board or worry about not being sat together. The seats are very narrow and each seat is separated by an immovable board so you can not straddle empty seats. Can not understand the reviews of people complaining about getting charged for not having their boarding pass. Ryanair email a week before to tell you that you must check in online. No excuse in the world will get you out of this but you are told by email. They also email you the day before the flight with the hand baggage measurements so no excuses there either. Where they do let themselves down is when the flights are delayed they offered no information whatsoever and there was a four hour wait of everyone staring at the screens. Planes are also often dirty due to them not being cleaned in the short turn around time. As long as you're flying to a proper airport and not a satellite (and end up paying for train/taxi/bus to get 60 miles+ to where you wanted to go!) one then they tend to be the cheapest by a long way as long as you play by the rules. For a 2 hour flight I can get over the lack of service and the slightly uncomfortable seating.

The staff have always been courteous and I have noticed helpful when needed. Re people having problems at the airport these are caused by the staff employed by the airport not Ryanair.

We had checked in online and reserved seats but one of our party had a non-EU passport so as directed on the boarding pass he went to show his passport at the check in desk only to be told that he couldn't fly to Ireland as he didn't have a visa. Would it not be sensible for a warning to come up to notify passengers of this requirement when booking the ticket instead of someone arriving at the airport and being refused boarding!

In the US it customary for passengers to print their airline tickets at kiosk by simply entering their confirmation number of their itinerary. When I attempted to do the same the kiosk requested payment of 140 pounds. My husband and I were completely stunned as we had already made payment to Ryanair for the tickets which included priority boarding and baggage fees. When I questioned the employee I was informed that I would have to pay 140 pounds in order to board the flight! We felt completely extorted by Ryanair's unscrupulous fees. After paying this fee we were then told that we could bring on 1 carry on bag-this would include a ladies handbag. We were instructed to place our carry on in this ridiculous contraption. If the bag exceeded this Ryanair informed us that we had to pay an additional 60 pounds.

I have to say though that the flight attendants on this flight Paphos - Thessaloniki on 12 Sep 2013 were very friendly. On the way back on Sep 16 2013 the flight was delayed and we finally boarded at 11.00 pm and of course by then I had learned my lesson and ran to the plane to get a space in the overhead locker. The female flight attendant was obviously very tired and huffed and puffed all the way to Paphos If was very visible that she hated her job and all the pax on board.

Being a first-time flyer I certainly don't have the experience to compare it with other airlines but I must say I don't get what all the fuss is about. Everyone seems to hate Ryanair and I had a very pleasant experience with them. No troubles with luggage we weren't even asked to measure it or weight it at boarding though I understand that was a stroke of luck. Staff were very polite and nice the only rudeness I witnessed were from the passengers themselves mainly some who had the luck of boarding with clearly oversized bags and then were surprised when they didn't fit in the compartments. Seats were comfortable they are no tighter that the average bus/train seat I was expecting much worse from all the reviews I read. Flights arrived earlier than the quoted time. They do play a lot of ads during the flight for their services but you aren't forced to buy anything and the staff doesn't get all in your face with it. All in all a very pleasant flight. I could have never afforded the trip if it wasn't for Ryanair. Just don't go to one of their flights with your mind set on trying to beat their system. If you want it cheap then you must abide by their rules. If you don't want to be bothered with that just go with the pricier airlines.,nan,5.0,nan

We did not have the ability during our trip to remote Spain to pre-print the boarding passes thought this would not be a problem as we had flown with a world class budget airline Air Asia earlier in the year and they provide machines at the airports to check in or you could use you smart phone to display the barcode. Ryanair charged us 140 Euros for two boarding passes which took the girl at check-in 30 seconds to do. This was as much as the return fares from Stansted to Seville.

The over head luggage lockers were already full with many people still clutching bags in the aisle. Eventually after finding a vacant seat I asked the attendant where I should place my bag. I was told to put it under the seat in front of me I tried it didn't fit the attendant tried it still didn't fit so I was told to put it in the space between the seats. I questioned where I would then put my legs to be told that I would have to squeeze them in on top of my case. I said that this was unacceptable for a 2.5hr flight to be told that it was by own fault for not booking priority boarding and that my luggage would be off loaded if I did not comply! I refused pointing out my bag was within the correct size only after some adjacent passengers chipped in did the steward seek to put my bag elsewhere. On the way back the flight was not fully booked so staff sectioned off a few rows of seats just to make sure no one enjoyed any extra space they had not paid for - talk about no frills this is a whole new level.,nan,2.0,nan

Once we got on board only 4 rows were reserved and were told just find a seat after row 5 they are all free. As for coming back from Spain this week all of the Spanish people were pulled out of the long queue and moved to the front. Is it just English people who hate queuing. My girlfriend purchased a wooden gift which weighed no more than 2 pounds and 4 inches wide but it was 5 inches taller than the allowed case height. She had no hand luggage so thought it would be reasonable to take it on board. No it was classed as oversized and the woman in charge having no common sense wanted to charge us the sum of 60 Euro to stick a label on it. Once on board we found several seats still empty.

Held up by Spanish boarding staff team as told not allowed duty free bag as only one bag per customer in cabin - option pay extra 60 euro or put in cabin holdall - which we did but very stressful and which then made cabin bag too big. In the meantime large numbers of passengers passed us making us some of the last to enter plane - chaos on board with luggage and seating.

Also it amazes me when people cry when they have to pay the £60 if they haven't printed their boarding cards before hand. Why not? I do not have a printer so just pop down to a local library to print them out. Yes Ryanair is a bit like catching a bus and you just sit where there is space but so what flight times are not long haul and I'm sure you can put up with it for a few hours. There is a lot of selling during the flight but again so what. Don't buy anything if you don't want to. Food is a rip off agreed so I have never purchased anything.

If you forget the boarding pass that is printed by yourself there is a penalty of££70! The crew on both legs were surly. All they did on a 2.5 hour flight was to try and sell things.

I was ready for a very unpleasant delay with grumpy staff in poor uniforms and dirty seats to sit on but what I got was actually a very good service from what appeared to be a reasonable airline operator. Would I have wanted to fly to St. Lucia on board maybe not as the finer comforts are not there but for me I would definitely fly with them again.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I flew from Stansted to Vasteras on 3rd October with a group (8 people 4 underage/children). Initially our bags were too large to fit through the allowance restrictions they had set so after shuffling the baggage a little they fit perfectly. The staff however showed no respect and little empathy with the situation of a mother carrying baby essentials in her purse. Of course we did not expect this to be the case but some nice treatment would have been much preferred to the screaming we endured about how the airline punctuality would be abused if we did not pay a fine. Before reshuffling the items in our bags the staff insisted that we pay the fine and requested that some of us be through to the plane. The children passed through (passport checked) and waited for the others only to have the staff lock the door on them separating them from parents simply to threaten our group that punctuality is crucial (even though we were boarding ahead of schedule). Unfortunately a handbag was taken (not disposed of but taken) and we made it to our seats. It seems that the staff of the airline are also not fond of people placing baggage in overhead compartments while safety demonstration is on as they requested to be seated and silent until takeoff. The irony in the situation! After that flight it's safe to say that Ryanair has lost 8 potential customers and maybe even more considering the other customers who had to endure the rude woman at the boarding gate.,nan,nan,nan

So hold luggage booked priority boarding additional infant equipment all paid for. Flying from Edinburgh to Faro was okay long queues at check-in but okay.

So on return to UK I complained and requested that the priority boarding fee was refunded. Rather than customer service I received a curt ""we do not make refunds"".

When we finally got on board there were only odd seats dotted around the aircraft. None of the adults could be seated together which was not such a major issue but the Ryanair flight attendants (there for safety not service) thought it perfectly ok to seat a two year old 7 aisles from the nearest adult in our party.

Then after going through quite a security queue I'd been informed by another passenger that the flight had been delayed until 3pm which was confirmed on the displays. The scheduled time then varied from approx. 2.45 to 4pm changing quite regularly. So after a considerable time spent waiting at the airport the flight finally took off well after 3.15pm (by this time I was sitting on the plane and too tired to note the time of takeoff). I would recommend implementing a free beverage/drink for all customers in cases where any flight is more than 2 (or 2.5hrs) late. As this would show an acknowledgement the apology by the company and would not cost the company very much in terms of stock.

I can't really remember but I think the original price on the internet was something like 47 pounds each. They added on a percentage because we booked with a credit card. They naturally added extra for baggage. We knew about this charge but of course Rynair have already worked out that international travellers are allowed 25 kilos but they only allow 15 kilos before excess baggage charges kick in.

This company have a terrible reputation for trying to get money any which way they can however if you read the terms and conditions properly there should be no reason for you to part with your hard earned cash. The seat pitch was fine for me a female at 5ft 4 inches and for the 45 minute duration but I can imagine it must be extremely uncomfortable for men as I can imagine if you tall it would be awful for those longer flights. One thing which I really didn't like was the non-existent seat allocation. I felt as if I was part of a cattle herd trying to get on board as people had started to queue an hour before we were due to depart to ensure families got seats together. Ryanair overall is not terrible you get what you pay for. They are a budget no frills airline and I think people tend to forget about that.

The charges are clearly outlined on the conformation e-mail that you must print the passes before you reach the airport!

Yes I was again told that I had no bag booked on the return flight and it would cost 60 euros.,nan,1.0,nan

The rude hostess not only wouldn't help but told me that it didn't fit because I had filled it too much. I paid 60 euros in bag fees. In a long row only my bag was checked and other passengers noticed that there were other cases far bigger than mine - which weren't checked. Once on board those bags didn't fit in the overhead locker and the crew put them in the hold at zero cost. This is outrageous. I will never use this company again.,nan,1.0,nan

The aircraft left on time and arrived in Corfu early. When we landed we had a trumpet played to us apparently this is always done when a flight arrives on time or is early. The plane was spotlessly clean and to be quite honest looked brand new. The people working on the plane were extremely courteous and very very smart.

Being a party of 5 with a baby we paid for priority boarding. What this meant in practice was that we had the pleasure (!) of standing at the head of a queue for about 75 minutes. The flight was about 30 mins late arriving and departing which must have been known by the departure gate staff yet they made no attempt deal with the queue that formed either by telling people to go and sit down while waiting or delaying checking people through the gate. I have written to Ryanair but am awaiting a response as I write. I can't rubbish them completely as the flight was relatively comfortable and onboard staff were quite pleasant. I understand Ryanair is to introduce a policy of seat allocation this should stop a lot of the problem we experienced though not the part where airport gate staff let passengers through the gate over half an hour before departure.,nan,3.0,nan

The passenger next to me was drunk (shouting and carrying on) when he got on the plane. He then drank at least 10 miniature Bacardis and Pepsi supplied enthusiastically by cabin staff. Mercifully he fell asleep but did not fasten his seat belt during landing although he then stood up while the plane was still moving quite fast. There was no inspection of seat belts by cabin staff before landing nor was he told to sit down. Our seats were near the emergency door where passengers are supposed to assist with evacuation. He was a big man who was in no state to assist and would have been a serious hindrance if there had been an emergency. Clearly the policy of the cabin staff is to sell as much booze as possible and not bother with basic safety or the comfort of other passengers.,nan,3.0,nan

I Flew from Thessaloniki to Milan and it was ok they were still looking at your hands for luggage trying to find a way to charge you with something. On the way back from Milan to Thessaloniki I arrived at the gate at 7.10am (due to a general strike in Milan + an accident on the road) the plane was leaving at 7.25 am despite the fact I told that I was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances the pilot refused to board the plane 15 minutes before take off.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,My girlfriend and I arrived early and were treated to a lengthy queue at Stansted before a manic rush for seats ensued. Does the company not realise that not allocating seats will cause this? It flares up tempers and causes the whole plane load of passengers to be angry from the start. I stored my hand luggage in the overhead compartment and when I eventually got (semi) comfortable in my tiny seat I was asked by the cabin crew to move my bag from the overhead compartment to under my seat. I am 6.5ft tall and I explained this to the cabin crew that I would not have any room for my legs if I did this. Both the outgoing and return journeys were the same with absolutely no comfort whatsoever and incessant adverts being played to us offering to sell e-cigs or take part in exciting competitions. Any food on offer was overpriced. The return flight from Venice (the out of town airport) was akin to my Army days in Northern Ireland. Normally reasonable people cooped up like battery hens in a hot and stuffy room forced to stand for 2 hours waiting for Ryanair to sort their act out. After 2 hours the queue system we have ourselves put in place started to crumble and people began to flare up. Once the doors opened it was literally a stampede. Dozens of angry sweaty people paying for the privilege of running a race. I was exhausted by the experience. They have absolutely no regard for your comfort or well being.,nan,1.0,nan

There is no ceremony involved. Ryanair has a couple of simple rules about baggage and to have your boarding pass before you arrive. If you can't arrange something as simple as printing out a piece of paper and complain that you have to pay for luggage on top of your massively cheap air ticket to begin with then just don't fly with these people. I'm off to Morocco next from Stansted for less than £70 return.

First time I have used them for a while and the gaudy yellow and blue cabin interior is a bit hard on the eyes but the crew were friendly and efficient and the legroom and leather seats were better than the Monarch flight we flew down on.

Stood for an hour at Edinburgh check in then another 45 minutes at the gate in the hope my wife and I would get a seat together (why should we pay extra for this?). On board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. All cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. We heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old Ryanair trick. Return check in at Tenerife was ridiculous 5 Ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks that's nearly 700 passengers. No Ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. Usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege? Its standard with everyone else.

I have to say if you follow the rules that are made very clear to you well before departure you will have no problems. There were a few people who hadn't printed boarding passes or their cases were far too big for the cabin and they were moaning about being charged to check them in etc. Yes the fees for printing are totally ridiculous for printing a sheet of paper but just don't get yourself in that situation! I had booked an exit row seat for an extra £10 which included priority boarding. I have to say it was worth it especially being tall. I arrived at the gate 45 minutes before the departure time to see a huge queue waiting for the boarding to start. The priority boarding queue was empty so I walked straight down and waited for around 15 minutes. Then a member of staff came over and said would you like to come forward we are ready after my pass was checked the barrier for the others was opened. I boarded the plane first after a few minutes wait at the bottom of the stairs of the plane and got settled whilst everyone else boarded. I'm not sure if this system works if there is a bus to catch to the plane? One benefit of being nearer to the front of the queue is getting seats with family/friends and having space to store luggage as many people we struggling to find places for their luggage once the plane was filling up. The flight was comfortable and crew were fairly friendly but seemed in a rush to serve drinks and were quite sharp with a few customers who were asking for a drink of water. The people in front were drinking their own alcohol and were sharply told that they couldn't consume their own alcohol on board. Overall I found the experience far better than expected even though the service of other airlines isn't present but the price was far far lower!

This leaves us with the migrane inducing yellow the bright cabin lights and the constant procession of scratchcard sales and frankly annoying announcements about the still overpriced microwave food to moan about. They seem to have at least stopped the irritating soft drink adverts on replay. I guess Ryanair are an option if they are flying where you want to actually go but my own conclusion - as a relatively frequent flyer - is that there is no point in saving a little bit of money if it costs you a lot of time and hassle which on this trip it still did.,nan,5.0,nan

Because of my flight times this means I will have to find a place to print out my boarding pass while away.

First of all a flight 2 weeks in advance from the booking date for £9.99 one way can not be denied this is a brilliant price for an on-time flight on a virtually brand new 737-800. The one gripe I'd have is the allocated seating (something that most airlines use effectively). As a frequent FR traveller I pick the same seat every time unfortunately the common sense of booking and then finding your seat seems to have evaded some people as it turned into some chaos - so I'd advise to still get on the aircraft towards the front.

A male steward took Ryanair's poor customer service to a new low - he was extremely rude bad humoured and swore in front of my 11 year old daughter. Additionally Ryanair's new seat allocation policy appears to be at the expense of carrying on your hand luggage if your bag is not in the first 90 bags on board. Not only had I the inconvenience of lugging my case around the airport but had to wait for it in Bristol as it was taken off me as I boarded.

You can still check in up to 15 days before the flight without having to pay for an allocated seat despite what they say. In fact if you are crafty you can actually choose your seat free of charge by doing the following: click on 'Choose a Seat' check which ones have already been allocated knowing that they allocate the seats in alternate rows front and back starting either side of the overwing exit rows. If you are happy with the next available seat then exit this page and click on 'Do not Choose Seat' and you will get that seat.

Lucky for us we were OK but numerous passengers who 'could not fit' theirs were made to pay £50 which were then put in the hold. Why did the check in staff not ask to weigh their cabin bags at check in - in my opinion this is the way they make an extra £50 per passenger - some cheap flight for these unfortunate people (students) many of whom were going home for half term and short of money to begin with - for me never again.

I do feel sorry for those who innocently don't pay enough attention to the very thorough pre flight reminders you always get sent. My flights are about 2.5 hours and that's fine but the seats are a tight fit and do not recline (I am not large but fellow passengers often are) so would not want to be onboard much longer than that. Aircraft's are in good nick and always clean and staff are generally friendly and helpful. Food is edible but only in an emergency! Coffee is fine and sensibly not served too hot.

This was my first Ryanair flight for nearly two years and I'm happy to see that some things have changed for the better. No queue at the bag drop desk. Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate. Crew on board were professional and what I've noticed is that they smile and are happy to have friendly banter with passengers now - so that's a really added plus since my last trip! Seats not amazingly comfy but ok for the short flight. Arrived in Porto ahead of arrival time and bags were on the belt almost immediately (this is something good that hasn't changed!).

Check in even suggested throwing some clothing away to keep the weight down even though the same clothing weight had been ok on the outbound leg.

Paid for hold luggage as I had a laptop bag as well. Reserved seats were welcome. I printed the boarding passes off before hand and arrived in plenty of time. Onboard reasonable bit garish and the selling wasn't too obnoxious given only a 50 min flight. Depart and arrive on time. So overall the experience wasn't too bad but then everything worked ok. The nagging feeling is what if it hadn't? But given the price you get what you pay for. Would I fly with them again? Given it was the only airline to that airport then yes.

However nowhere did it mention that they would be charging for the privilege or I most definitely would have booked easyjet who have had the free 30 day check in for sometime. In relation to Valencia flights they have two scheduled flights a week. In the past after disagreement with Valencia they just cancelled the whole route so I was pleased it recommenced even if it was from Manchester. They have now had to push the Monday flight back by half an hour and have given me 3 weeks notice of the change. It now lands at 11pm. Now that doesn't seem like a lot but unfortunately it has quite an impact cost wise as the majority of the car hire firms in Valencia close at 11 and therefore charge you 30-40 euros to open later. Sadly I'll have to now give up on Ryanair just when I think they were really trying hard. I have always followed the rules and never been disappointed with them to be honest you get what you pay for but I'm finally getting to old to try and stay ahead of their next money making change and 7 days check in is ridiculous so it's back to Easyjet.,nan,3.0,nan

It's great to see that they are finally trying to improve customer service and it was definitely better on the way out. Having allocated seating now is much better although it was not clear when I booked that seats are allocated free at online check in so I unnecessarily paid £40 to do this in advance. Also what on earth is going on with the 'only the first 90 bags' can stay in the cabin idea? Great that you can now take a small bag (handbag laptop bag etc) and put it under your seat. However only the first 90 passengers are allowed to take a correctly sized and weighted wheeled case on board. At Tenerife they decided that everyone had to do this before they got on the plane and it was chaos with people trying to work out what they needed to take out. Strange also that they only pick on wheeled cases even small ones. My partner had a rucksack the contents of which were about the same weight as mine yet my bag was tagged for the hold. By the time I'd taken out all the valuables - camera iPad Kindle etc there was very little left in it. Also there was plenty of empty space on the overhead compartments once we got onboard. All completely pointless. I do think they are trying but they really don't think these things all the way through! All that is going to happen is that people's 2nd bags are gradually going to get larger and larger and there will be the same old rows at check in and the gate as there have always been! Other than that it's pretty good value for money I guess although I agree with other comments about flights times. Lots of them get into Stansted too late for the last trains which prevents me booking with them. Oh and the seats not reclining and no pocket for belongings continues to be tedious.

We do not believe that EURO 70 for printing a boarding pass is justifiable by any standard. It is in fact more than the airfare itself and more than the fee for an extra luggage (EURO 60). While we accept the error we made the punishment was well beyond anyone's imagination hence it is not reasonable and not justifiable. We felt like being robbed on highway with no way to escape. And we still do. We must point out that the check-in gentleman was kind enough to show us a self-serving Internet kiosk/access point where printing was available.

The second complaint is about the way in which the duty manager a lady handled our request for help. She was arrogant in our view.

People moaning about not being able to print boarding passes or check in for more than a week in advance should book reserved seating on the aircraft this allows you to check in and print boarding passes for the following 30 days!

I said I can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didn't have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. Their attitudes were like robbers and I didn't have any options then because there was nobody beside me. Actually when I returned from Barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but I've used a belt to tie it up. Therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. Due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when I left form Barcelona for Birmingham I've also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. I understand terms and conditions of Ryanair in advance. But what a shame the attitude of Ryanair’staff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. How come they charged it without any warning (If I could have one more minute to organise my suitcase.) before boarding especially originally I've been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate.

Not being able to read Italian I didn't realise that Boarding Cards had to be obtained on- line (FOC). I thought they would be issued when booking in as per my previous experience with BA etc. When we arrived at Stansted we had to purchase the boarding cards at total price of £140.00.

No one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. Eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. Really poor customer service in my opinion. Hiding behind a telephone. Other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. Do under 5s not eat and drink? Although this is a first for me with Ryanair the 10 hours we were actually stuck in the airport as no one would let you out was exhausting and for that reason along with the rubbish customer care I will never fly with them again.

Charming staff on-time flights and good landings. Well done Ryanair. (And I never thought I'd say that!

There were no flights on the same day or the following day from any Milan airport. We had to commute to Milan Malpensa to buy expensive alternate flights to Budapest with an overnight connection at Warsaw. Ryanair is an absolute nightmare of an airline.

Overall not too bad I guess for a budget airline but the new introduction of the 7 day boarding pass malarkey meant we were stung on the return flight for 70 euros. As this is on the return flight we had obviously spent up and had to contact one of the groups husbands to ask if we cold charge to his credit card to get us home. At no point was this new procedure explained to us (and yes I appreciate it is probably in the very small print but if you are a regular flyer with Ryanair (which the girl who booked was) you would expect something like this to at least be mentioned when you book) and I can in no way begin to fathom how they can justify 70 euros. It is simple case of robbery and Ryanair should be ashamed of themselves. We were by no means the only people caught out with this phenomenal fee and it certainly feels like you are being held to ransom. Another peev was that when we boarded some people had to put their hand luggage in the checked in luggage area as we were told there was no room in the above holders - lie! They were nearly empty. Because of the unjustifiable boarding pass scam I will certainly never book a Ryanair flight of my own accord and I will be telling anyone who chooses to to think before flying Ryanair.,nan,1.0,nan

In February we were unable to land at East Midlands because of high winds and were diverted to Birmingham. We found Ryanair to be very organised coaches waiting and back to East Midlands in no time.

This meant checking in at the airport for the sum of £70 per head (£140 in total) for myself and my wife.

Then when you get there be prepared to pay 10 euros for every kilo overweight (max 20 kilos per checked bag most airlines give 25 kilos per checked bag). Finally don't forget to print your boarding pass because if you don't you will pay 70 euros per person for them to do it at the airport (this was twice as much as the actual ticket).

We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA.

Flying from Stansted to Treviso Venice for 7 days holiday we were fine on our outward journey as we had been able to check-in and print off the boarding passes however the system would allow us to do the same for our return at that point in time. Where we were staying we had no access to a computer or printer but assumed perhaps foolishly that at Treviso airport they would have the same system as they do in Stansted and we would be able to check-in and print off at their machines for a nominal fee. How wrong we were. We arrived well before the 2 hour time scale but ended having to pay additional 140 Euros! Money making at its worse I feel very sorry for the staff at the check in desks whilst we were there I saw at least another 2 people who were in the same position as we were. It wasn't until I got home I saw the email from Ryanair advising of the additional costs. I received a text message at 23.00 the night before our departure at 9.50 reminding us we needed to check-in and print off the boarding card if they had notified me in this text of the astronomical charge awaiting us at the airport we would have search around the entire city of Venice for someone to assist us but it wasn't included!

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,nan,no,nan,1.0,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.,nan,1.0,nan

Its not so much the delay that's the problem it is the total lack of communication or an apology for the late running. We were asked to queue up for boarding and stood there for over an hour with no communication. Worse was to follow. On the following Saturday we were booked on the 22.00 flight out of Pisa for Stansted. Again no communication or apologies were forthcoming from Ryanair. 150 minutes after the flight should have left we were told it was cancelled - no apology again. We were not offered any refreshment during this three hours. They then booked the passengers a hotel but had only a mini bus to start with to take 16 passengers a time randomly selected by Ryanair staff. We eventually arrived at the hotel at 03.00 but had to be up for an 07.00 departure from the hotel. No food or drinks were offered by Ryanair. No staff were available at Pisa airport to speak to or to hand out vouchers. The service was shabby at best. No apologies poor communication no-one to talk too and no refreshment vouchers either.

We accidentally had two pieces of luggage too much (this was our own fault) so we paid the extra other airlines do the same so its not just Ryanair. Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them? Do they do it on purpose maybe hoping they get the full service and not paying for it? I like Ryanair they bring you very safely from A to B for very little money.

I was unable to print off boarding passes at home I had to do it at the airport using Ryanairs computerised screens. This cost £210 for three people. Why? I could understand paying £10 but why on earth £70? That's typical money grabbing Ryanair.

I see that the staff have new marching orders and that intimidation is no longer the order of the day. This new more normal”attitude is already being noticed. Passengers are already taking liberties with hand luggage it will probably not be long before a new clampdown” will be enforced and unpleasant situations will once again be splattered all over the review sites. I made sure I had ticked all the boxes and weighed in before travelling this time. My previous experience has made me paranoid”about using this airline. I would have preferred not to have used Ryanair. They offered the best price for the trip and as money is tight I was compelled to take the risk. We can remain optimistic and hope they carry on in this manner. Perhaps in 3 to 5 years they will have a positive reputation. I still have reservations Ryanair inflicted such needless blow to my family that I am afraid to say it will never be forgiven. In the meantime I will reluctantly use the airline when needed and hope for more uneventful flights.,nan,5.0,nan

In fact the planes are in such bad condition and poorly equipped there's not even a pocket in front for you to put a magazine or something all of your safety notices are printed on the back of the chair in front which means you have to amuse yourself with possibly scenarios throughout flight just by looking at it.

As being called 40 mins before and getting to gate 35 mins before we thought the plane would be there in 10 mins. It wasn't and was there no earlier than 25 mins of waiting at the gate. We were rushed on to the steps to Tarmac whist pax where deboarding and we where on it around 3 mins before our scheduled departure time. We where off 15 mins behind schedule. The flight was smooth and fine. I had a Pepsi and just looked out of the window no IFE or food. We sat in row 5 and had priority boarding. The aircraft landed 10 mins early and we had the usual fanfare. We where de boarded quickly and went straight through to meet relatives who have a 2nd home and took our bags with them. La Rochelle to Stansted. We got there 2 hours 15 mins before flight and we went through security. Relatives driving back took bags with them. There is 1 duty free shop and a cafe. There where 2 aircraft departing at same time and being the first in the lounge gets us a seat. (La Rochelle gets overcrowded). The aircraft got in 10 mins early but the other Brussels flight was late. Boarding began 10 mins before departure and we where off just after the Brussels 15 mins behind. The flight was ok. My seat was dirty and had gum under the seat in front. Again row 5 and priority boarding.

Finally Ryanair has understood that free seating leading to a scrum has had its longest time. The allocated seating for decent fees is a big improvement. Onboard only harassed once for a lottery. No constant announcements for buying this and that anymore. Leg room stays a problem though as they press 198 passengers into a Boeing 737-800. Wouldn't bear a FR-flight longer than two hours. All in all a decent experience for less than 200 euro rtn for two including bag priority boarding - worked well but isn't really necessary anymore with allocated seating - and reserved seat. If you reserve a seat at the time of booking you can can check in 30 days prior to departure.

All flights were late leaving but made up time except for the Poitiers- Stansted leg which was delayed by 1 hour due to a passenger injury at boarding time. My only gripe is that I had booked a Shannon-Nantes flight and Hertz car hire in January. Ryanair cancelled the Nantes fight in May offering a flight to Poitiers or money back. Transfer went very smoothly. However Hertz told me that they did not have an office in Poitiers and my only option was to cancel which I did only to be charged a 50 euro cancellation fee even though I had booked through Ryanair.

Then for almost 2/3 hrs we were told different stories about what was happening. It turned out that the plane required full checks before flying why oh why couldn't we have had the truth up front. We were herded together like cattle in departure with no air conditioning no drinks were offered for the children until just as we boarded. On the positive our hold case was brought through to us so my husband could get his medication. In fairness my husband and I were assisted by a lovely lady who fast tracked us through as we were both struggling with the long walk and queues through the checks both having mobility problems.

There are no internet cafes in Sliema Malta so thought would print off boarding pass at machine at the airport. On arriving at Malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy Ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me I was too late and should have done this in Malta (How exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel?) before finally pointing me towards the computer where I could do this. This touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so I was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this woman's complete lack of customer service. An EUR 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. What gets me is that I knew I had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. I noticed Lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. I had to beg this woman to tell me where was the Ryan Air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me I was too late etc when I still had time. However reading other reviews it looks as if even if I had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged. I am sure they can afford to install these with all the EUR 70 fees they have been stashing away this summer.,nan,1.0,nan

Checked-in online with only a trundle. Drove from Leicester to Stansted. Arrived 2 hours before the flight and were met with chaos as my niece (on same flight with us) who had come to visit needed to drop off her suitcase (also already checked-in online). Passengers of numerous flights had all been lumped together into one disorientated heap of people with check-in operating at slow pace. The usual clue as to the destination above the relevant individual check-in desks was not there and was replaced by one single queue/lump of chaos. One distraught couple told me that they had already been queuing for 40 minutes at the wrong Ryanair desk round the corner. I asked a passing Ryanair staff if we were in the right queue (although it was hard to describe it as such) and pointed out that our flight was about to close. He confirmed we were. 15 minutes later he asked passengers for the Bremen flight to come forward. Our flight had already closed whilst at security which was as chaotic. Mercifully the flight was late taking off. I have never experienced in all my years of travelling to all the continents on the globe such chaos stress and anxiety. There was nothing leisurely about this trip. We had to run (it was very hot) all the way through corridors and shops only to be met by a train (not a gate) taking us to the gates. We were lucky that our gate was in the thirties not seventies as we would have missed our flight for sure. In the end we arrived breathless hot and sweating in front of another lump/queue of passengers with just enough time to use the toilet. I should also mention that the word priority on your check-in paper does not mean a thing. Our little trundles of less than 10kg were put into the hold on our return journey.,nan,2.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,This airline continues to show it has no interest in customer service or staff training. Only bottom line. After arriving at Stansted 3 hours before the flight was due to depart we arrived at the boarding gate during final flight call. Why? Because of the throng of people Ryanair euphemistically call a queue attempting to check- in their bags at their bag-drops manned by the Ryanair Gestapo. It appears these rude unhelpful staff's main training was on extracting extra cash wherever it is physically possible. To watch so many people removing items from hold bags only to add them to their cabin luggage is farcical. Or would be if it wasn't so sad. In my own case my bag was 5kg under and my travelling partner's was nearly 1kg over. No problem you would think there is still a net difference of -4kg. But no as the tickets weren't booked on the same reference number we were deemed to be travelling separately. Even though we had booked seat numbers next to each other and paid the extra we were still flying separately according to the misery behind the counter. Ok so it's no real effort to undo her bag remove a few bits and put them into the bag you are going to take into the cabin with you. But multiply that with the amount of people doing the same and you soon end up with massive queues. And both bags are going onto the plane anyway!

So in effect you are being charged for having your bag with you. I am a regular traveller so don't take hold luggage to avoid the waiting at the destination.

However upon arriving at East Midlands airport for our flight to Tenerife South recently with plenty of time to spare we found that there were 12 flights departing at roughly the same time. 12 flights of people that needed to check in and clear security before boarding. It seems that Ryanair just bung everyone together regardless of which flight you are on Some people were panicking as their flight was taking off soon and were stuck at check in when asked to jump the queue were told they would have to wait like everyone else! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and clear security. Queues were snaked round the airport (although admittedly this is not Ryanair's fault!) but a better system needs put in place for Ryanair check in. We managed to get to the boarding gates just in time albeit at the end of the queue. There we were kept waiting for 20 minutes as staff now needed hand luggage to put on the hold. The staff member was very aggressive and rude to us trying to grab our bags to put in the hold we told her that we needed the bags for inflight and one contained valuables that we wanted to keep with us. She tried to snatch my husbands backpack from his back and took my daughters small suitcase from her before I took it back. We eventually offered one bag but I had to remove everything that was needed and carry it in my hands she wouldn't even give us a carrier bag. She went up and down the last remaining passengers trying to grab peoples hand luggage but as nobody else would offer a bag she came back to us telling us she needed our bags we refused but She wasn't having any of it and barked at us we didn't have a choice as we were at the end of the queue and if we didn't put our hand luggage in the hold we would be fined £60. Her attitude was appalling and if she'd have asked politely we may have tried our best to accommodate her request. She wouldn't let the last people through the departure gate thus holding up the flight until she had the bags But no way were we giving up our remaining (small) bags. We eventually got on the bus to the plane and on the flight there we sat for another 20 minutes before actually taking off! It was never made clear that only the first 60 passengers were guaranteed to take their hand luggage. Yet on our return flight home everything was smooth queues moved quickly and staff were very pleasant helpful and polite. We packed our bags accordingly and offered our hand luggage for the hold.

Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. Overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly Ryanair.,nan,4.0,nan

Crew were trying to be helpful but abusive and drunken behaviour from a mixed group of twenty something's caused us to miss our revised take-off slot while the police removed them. As long as you read the website carefully and follow the booking and check-in instructions Take a bit of responsibility for your own arrangements then there shouldn't be a problem - although it never ceases to amaze me how many people forget to pack their brains when they travel.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,I have flown Ryanair many times over the last few years and never really had a bad experience though it was clear they were pushing the low cost model to extremes. My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes. Ryanair finally seems to be aware of what attracts customers apart from low fares and is addressing some of the issues I hope it continues.,nan,4.0,nan

On the flight over I ordered a small bottle of Prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. She did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. I had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. Thankfully it was white wine. On our return flight I badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the co-pilot and finally I had to stand up. I was told from the toilet to sit down I was again told to sit as the co-pilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. I again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated I use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. (I was in row 9). As I approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat I had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on I tried to explain and eventually stressed I had to use the toilet “now”. Then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which I did. The was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board I do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes. I will avoid using this airline again if at all possible I am extremely disappointed.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,My experience of Ryanair was negative. The only saving grace for the company was the onboard staff particularly the chief steward who was polite friendly and helpful. The online booking I found absolutely puzzling. I travelled with Monarch on my outward journey which was straightforward and cheaper. As I was travelling around for a month beforehand the policy of having to print off the return boarding pass the week before you travel is ridiculous! The fact that if you can't do it you're charged is appalling! When I arrived to check in I was informed I had no baggage therefore I had to pay £35 more! The way I was told was very abrupt. My family with 2 young children had no seat allocation so had to wait for it to be sorted out. This despite having paid for the flight. Our checking in took in total over an hour!

The doors where shut at 10.30 and the safety demonstration was played in English and then French. We were off around 10.35 just 5 mins behind schedule. The inflight service began with drinks and snacks. I had a pepsi which was in a small can. Then the duty free service before rubbish during our decent over London. We landed just before 10.45 10 mins early. Yet again no fanfare but a little announcement about there low fares and the fact they have a 90% punctuality record. Overall they just get you there on time which is really all that travel is so I would recommend them if you are on a budget or Stansted is your local airport.,nan,4.0,nan

It was evident from the beginning when the crew did a half-hearted safety demonstration that no-one had authority to run this flight. Passengers became increasingly distressed as the stag party shouted and swore aggressively ran up and down the aisles and openly drank from bottles of vodka while standing behind Ryanair staff. The crew evidently avoided eye contact no public announcements were made to warn them of the consequences and when I complained that the situation wasn't being managed staff simply ignored me. Although they did drag their feet bringing the trolley down the aisle they eventually served these men even more alcohol. This was a potentially very dangerous situation. On landing all of the men (aside from one who was incoherent and staggering) behaved perfectly properly as they exited through security to avoid arrest which suggests that they would have responded to warnings about their conduct during the flight.,nan,1.0,nan

The air host and hostess sat at the front of the plane as was I for extra leg room spent half of their time looking in the mirror in the bathroom playing with their hair and touching up lipstick. The staff at the back of the plane frequently came to the front as they were having some kind of disagreement and arguing over some gossip from another flight attendant that was not present during our flight. It was a he said she said thing that involved all of them. My partner and I were not able to get seats together when I booked for extra leg room for us both so we had aisle seats however the 2 seats in front of my partner were empty and it would have been nice for attendants to have offered us the seats so as we could sit together. I have to say our flight home was much better and the flight attendants were friendly helpful and professional throughout. Our flight on the 25th August 8132 at 14.10 was appalling.,nan,3.0,nan

I'm not expecting 5 star service but at least some sort of service. Only good thing was that we landed before time this was because the crew didn't clean the plane in Riga when it landed from Dublin. It was filthy rubbish everywhere. The flight crew were so rude would not communicate with passengers when you bought food from the trolley they did not even say how much it was.

So we did as is British do and joined the queue they then waited ten minutes to open a second check in desk they then shouted people forward. The weigh scales where broke and so the queue grew and grew eventually after thirty minutes of entertaining a four year old we were up. We checked in and struggled with the ladies English which was broken at best but none the less she was polite. We then waited until our gate number was up and boarded the plane. Right from the start it was just one of those flights a family had checked in late so all ended up sat individually much to the fathers disgust as a result he allowed his two year old to scream the entire flight! We then tried to order food when the cart came this was a particular joke they had nothing. This was thirty minutes in we then very foolishly asked for water (imagine the cheek) to find the very abrupt cabin crew member to say ""none left"" so I again foolishly said what do you have? ""Heineken"" at this point I will admit I was very cross I wanted a drink for my four year old son and she suggested beer.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,I fly Ryanair and easyjet to Malaga from Liverpool every 2 weeks and have done so for 2.5 years. The service from both is good and Ryanair are normally the cheapest. I have had 3 delays due to weather and one diversion to East Midlands last year due to the weather. I do hear complaints every now and then on flights for both airlines the majority by people who are not seasoned travellers and only fly on limited occasions. The complaints were mostly why cant I sit at the front because they see these seats are free but they are told you cant have these seats as the aircraft needs to be balanced. Most accept this others don't and they hold the queue up by arguing. Then you get the guy and his mate who hover around the extra leg room seats to see if they can get one and they block the aisles and hold the queue up. Now that allocated seating is on all aircraft these problems seem to be resolved apart from the odd idiot who says I want to sit next to my mate but we did not get that option when we booked so can you sort it this again holds the queue up. With regards to the aircraft staff yes they have their bad days but that is not surprising as they see the same type of idiots flying in and flying out. The expression you pay peanuts you get monkeys however does not apply to the majority of staff I have come across and the vast majority of regular travellers appreciate the stewards and the service they give.

I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,nan,1.0,nan

I find this quite incredible for a flight to take off with a 2 year old baby sat on her own.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,I have always praised Ryanair as good value when considering the cost however they really let themselves down on 29th Sept. Arrived at Stansted near midnight and could not even see terminal from where plane stopped. Then had to wait nearly 30 mins as staff had not thought to arrange transport even the pilot was fed up with their lack of organisational skills. Sorry Ryanair very disappointed.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Actual flight both ways was good but the handling at Stansted and Rhodes wasn't. We felt like cattle not customers. Stansted we were held up getting to airport we had priority booking but had to wait with everyone else as priority queue had gone therefore one of the cabin bags had to go in the hold. At Rhodes we were first to check-in and they took the first 90 cabin bags in the hold. Surely it should be the last? There seems no reason now to take cabin bags at all! The benefit apart from the cost is that you can exit the airport much quicker at your destination. Waiting for cabin bags takes as long as waiting for large luggage. The overhead luggage compartments were half empty. It just seems like another Ryanair useless rule.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,1.0,Flew Ryanair many times however most common route I fly is KIR-LTN. Most recent flight SNN-SXF. Ryanair is a very good airline in my opinion. Despite flying to airports that only the CIA has heard of and advertising the airport for the capital city of Slovenia (it's Bratislava) as Vienna it's very handy. I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible. The snacks and drinks on board are still a reasonable price and the crew are friendly. The toilets are excellent being bright and clean. Ryanair gets the job done.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,Flight number FR694 on the 6th of September from Prestwick UK to Ibiza Spain. The majority of passengers onboard this drink fuelled flight were unruly drunken and aggressive towards other passengers despite the best efforts of the 4 onboard cabin crew. Language throughout was absolutely foul. As a grandmother travelling with 2 young infants under the age of four the condition experienced in the cabin were shocking. Passengers were swearing were drinking open duty free were throwing objects from in front and behind us. Safety announcements could not be heard as passengers were playing music from bluetooth devices and the cabin was totally out of control. Cabin crew were very concerned however despite the best efforts to contain behaviour there was no way they could control the passengers. The crew threatened to divert the aircraft to France and also threatened the majority of passengers with the police meeting them on arrival at the destination. The main point is that safety notices were completely ignored myself and my family felt totally unsafe during the flight. My grand-daughters aged two and three have never been exposed to such outrageous language and behaviour - the conditions on this flight were not safe and were not suitable for a family. Access to toilets involved standing for 40 minutes in crowds of alcohol fuelled louts. Many of the passengers boarded the flight inebriated one group drank a litre bottle of duty free vodka onboard the flight whilst throwing coins around the cabin. We are feeling extremely anxious about our return journey.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Very short flight from Barcelona to Palma (FR 6362) yet the crew managed to do their inflight service and the usual thing of hawking a few scratch cards. What was more amazing is that the crew were in a good mood seemed happy enough to be there and actually seemed to like each other - they even had the pax laughing! After numerous FR flights with miserable looking crews this was a pleasant surprise. Maybe the new positively is filtering down to the cabin crew? Only downside is the trumpet sound or whatever it was when landing but great all round otherwise.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received on the evening of 26th Sep in Wroclaw airport related to a Ryanair flight. I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.,nan,3.0,nan

Myself and an elderly lady with hip problems had booked assistance which didn't materialise. Last on the plane we were told that a) the booking hadn't been made (even though we produced our booking papers) and b) there were no wheelchairs available and we had to make it to the terminal under our own steam. As the next set of passengers were queuing at the foot of the steps we felt compelled to get off. No staff took responsibility for us once we were on the tarmac. Luckily a Stansted Airport employee was passing by the window and saw me struggling down the steps on crutches and rushed to our aid. She was horrified that we had been abandoned and quickly obtained wheelchairs for us both. Herself and a colleague took us all the way to the outside. No credit at all to Ryanair who's main objective was to get us off the plane so that the next flight could get under way.,nan,3.0,nan

I will keep using Ryanair because their prices are extremely hard to match and their rules are simple just read the terms and conditions and be patient too many people criticise them because they don't know any different well done Ryanair once again and thank you! 1000 miles of air travel for £25.99 is a huge bargain!,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,Flew STN-CIA-STN with flights on time for both parts of the journey. Everything was what one might expect of a low cost carrier so no surprises there. However I missed my first flight due to 'visa check' procedures they require for those who are not EU/EEA citizens. Even though I did not require a visa for either of my destinations their insistence on this was not the real problem however but that they had so few agents working that this process took much longer than the security check on both legs of my journey. So it really spoiled my experience (especially in missing my first flight which then caused me to incur additional charges to get onto the next flight) simply because they did not have enough agents working. Additionally because they made such a fuss over 'checking visas' I would have assumed they would be able to provide UK arrival cards on-board since they would know non EU/EEA citizens need these as I've always done this with any other flight instead of having to fill one out after landing. They however did not have these on the return flight which meant I spent even more time at the UK immigration check simply because they did not have them.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Flew Frankfurt Hahn to Plovdiv and returned a couple of days later. The flights were on time and the planes were reasonably clean. We travelled with hand baggage only and didn't pay extra for seat allocation. We travel regularly with Ryanair and rarely experience problems - I find them more reliable than many other airlines. The return flight was 2 1/2 hours and I think that this is the limit that I'd be prepared to fly with Ryanair. After two hours you do start to notice the hardness of the seat and lack of leg room but for short flights they're good.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,2.0,I travelled from Frankfurt (HHN) to Stansted (STN). The flight was as good as any cheap airline. Can't say much about seat comfort or staff as you really don't expect that from them. Really new to the concept of bringing your own boarding pass from home and being charged if you don't. I'm pretty sure there will come a time when these airlines would want you to bring your own seatbelts and oxygen masks. The ground staff very strict for checking your baggage weight. First at the check-in then again after the security check which was an inconvenience and didn't really make sense. Overall it serves its purpose of getting you from point A to B.,nan,5.0,nan

I explained that I did not have access to a computer but that was no excuse - they said I would have to pay or I was not going anywhere. I had already paid 30 Euros for my piece of Luggage at time of booking so after paying and having requested wheelchair assistance on my original booking I was told to sit on a bench and wait. Eventually I was taken the departure gate only to be told after waiting 1/2 an hour and asking that the plane was 45 minutes late and would be leaving from a different gate. When we finally boarded - I did have priority boarding but that didn't seem to matter I had to walk across the tarmac to the plane and with much difficulty walk up the steps to the aircraft with my small carry on (I was not offered any assistance) to the last row. The last straw was when we were finally airborne I asked for a drink of water to take some medication and was told it would cost me 3 euros.

You can print your boarding passes from 2 hours up to 30 days before you fly - this information is not in the fine print it's in bold print and you even get a follow up email well before your departure date.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Just returned from a trip to Budapest. There were 6 people in our party. My wife and I were outvoted and Ryanair was selected because they were cheaper. As first time Ryanair flyers we were extremely worried about all the hype that seems to follow Ryanair. The check in at Stansted was smooth and friendly no waiting. The flight was 15mins late taking off but arrived early. The plane was clean and more room than I had when I flew with Virgin.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,2.0,"AGP - LPL. Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",nan,4.0,nan

Found there are no better routes connecting SVQ and GOT/GSE these flights were the best option. As a point to point airline Ryanair never puts any responsibilities for any delays causing missed connections. We had a sharp 2 hrs at Paris to catch the next flight while the first flight from Seville was delayed a slightly over an hour due to extreme weather. You cannot expect a better pilot on SVQ-BVA route who was very informative and explained to us the delay causing him to change the parking three times and eventually used the airbridge. Flight from BVA was delayed allowing us to have an extra time. Return journey was fine. All in all very satisfied with the flights. We enjoyed both food along the way. They are kind with the cabin baggage. Ryanair today seems to be the 2.0 version than the one in 2000's. Very pleasant flight!,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,no,nan,2.0,First and last experience with this airline. Outward flight from Leeds Bradford to Chania was OK and if it had been the same on the return flight then we would have flown with them again. Check in at Chania was an absolute shambles made worse by the fact I'd bought a bouzouki in Crete and was unaware of Ryanair's attitude to musical instruments. At the check in I was obliged to pay 60 Euro and had to have it placed in the hold. I accept the fact that a musical instrument can be a bit of a hazard on a plane but it would have easily have fitted in the overhead locker. None of the cabin crew on the return flight had English as a first language and were unable to offer me concise instruction on how I was to claim the instrument at Leeds Bradford. The menus were in Euros yet the cabin crew asked for payment in sterling with the inevitable delay whilst currency conversions were carried out. This slowed the catering service down so much that it wasn't worth bothering with. We paid extra for priority boarding although this does not seem to offer any priority at check-in and is a complete waste of time at Chania as staff try and make as much bonus as they can by finding oversize and overweight hand luggage. We were ignored by ground staff when we tried to use the Priority lane. It's a case of first come first served until one of the check in staff decides to stem the flow and call the priority passengers forward. We also paid a premium for extra legroom in row 16. The extra legroom was appreciated but the seats are very narrow with fixed armrests and were not very comfortable at all. Also the cabin crew are ruthless about loose items in that seat row and my wife was made to wear a cardigan she had on her lap until the aircraft had taken off. No doubt there will be many who are obliged to use this carrier to visit family or their holiday homes abroad and they will have obviously conditioned themselves to flying with Ryanair but I can assure you that so long as there is a choice we will not be repeating the experience.,nan,2.0,nan

No choice but to fly with them due to virtual door-to-door nature of route for quick Maltese holiday with a bit of business thrown in. Was expecting the worst but pleasantly surprised by on-time flights for both sectors decent if unspectacular seating and lack of the patrolling of queue by staff looking for oversized baggage - it appears that they've chilled out a little.

This is by far the worst airline I have flown and I am 59 years old and have travelled all over the world in many different airlines. The customer service can not be worse respect for the customer (after you have paid) is horrible. They are charging 70 British Pounds for printing your boarding pass or sitting you in a crowded airplane with uncomfortable seats with crew members that are air merchants who charge you extra money for even a glass of water. Also after you have paid for your ticket or are in the process of paying they come out with a series of add-ons that when you end paying this nightmare of flights from third class airports like London Stansted or Frankfurt Hahn end up costing you the same or more than flying with a prestigious airline like British Airlines or Lufthansa from a premium airport.,nan,1.0,nan

Liked the fact there was a priority boarding queue even though I wasn't in it. Boarding front and rear of plane. Very efficient. Flight on time. Plane clean and seemed plenty of room for everyone's luggage. The seat on the plane was one of the most comfortable I have encountered on a short haul carrier and I even managed to have a very relaxing shut eye. I have travelled with Thomas Cook several times recently and the flights were very uncomfortable. On outward leg of this journey I was at a window seat and was invisible to cabin crew however on return journey at aisle seat crew very pleasant and helpful.

We had no luggage to check in and had booked priority boarding. The flight was punctual both ways. The flight crew was polite. The reason that at times they have to be a bit pushy is that people take an eternity to get settled and low cost airline have to stick to strict time schedules. I hear lots of horror stories about Ryanair but I assume that if you stick to your part of the deal it is OK.

The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days. May it long continue.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,Ryanair is fine to fly most of the time to get from A to B and if you can go hand luggage only. But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.,nan,3.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,nan,no,nan,1.0,"Tallinn to Milan first and last time flying with Ryanair. Ryanair is by far the worst airline I have experienced in terms of customer service fees and travel experience. This was our first time flying with Ryanair and after booking our flight we were traveling often without internet service when we got to the airport to check-in 2 hours before our flight we were informed that there would be a 70Euro fee/person! We had no email from Ryanair about the need to check-in online 2 hours before departure. The online check-in cut-off time is arbitrary as it serves no purpose other than a deliberate tactic by Ryanair to extort additional funds from paying customers who at that point have no alternative but to pay and board the flight. We then were forced to wait in a crowded gate area and our flight departure was delayed by over an hour. During our time at the gate several Ryanair ""customer service"" agents made their way through the crowd demanding that some passengers must check their carry-on luggage. Almost every passenger with more than one carry-on item was ordered to leave their additional carry-on at the ground by the plane to load in to the hold. After making our way across the runway in freezing rain and snow we slowly made our way up the outdoor stairs to the plane only to be met with a surly male steward who was talking with a staff member instead of greeting passengers. All of the staff were rude and only spoke to passengers to ask to purchase items. Every item including water was provided only for a fee. We arrived in Milan only to be told that we had to sit on the plane to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal. One bus came and filled with passengers. We were in the back of the plane so we had to wait another long period for another bus. Bottom line - this was the worst travel experience in my 30 years of global travel. Yes the airline industry has changed significantly to cut costs and keep fares reasonable but there is no need to intentionally make customers feel worthless.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,"My wife and I live in Spain and had booked a flight from Malaga to Stansted and a return flight from Stansted to Malaga some five weeks later. The night before our flight out of Malaga I duly went online to the Ryanair website to do the Online Check In. I filled in the flight details and submitted it then there was on option to print the Boarding Pass however I didn't have a printer my apartment so I assumed that since I had submitted the details all would be fine. This was not the case however. On arrival at Malaga Airport the next day we went to the Ryanair check in point that was at least 100 metres away from any other check in desk (probably so that other passengers could not hear any passenger complaints) We were asked for our Boarding Passes. I said that he had checked in online but had no way of printing the Boarding Pass. The Ryanair representative said that her computer was not showing that the Online Check In had been done. Although I insisted that I had submitted the Check In form online there was no way that I could prove it. The Ryanair Online Check In requires that the submit button is clicked on numerous times as it wants to sell extra luggage allowance hotels car hire and selected seats. If the submit button is not clicked on by-passing each of these selection options then the Online Check In does not go through. The Ryanair representative said that we would have to pay 70 Euros each for not submitting the Online Check In and for printing the Boarding Passes but as an alternative we were then told to take our laptop to the Ryanair Information Desk where they could have 15 minutes of free use of the Wi-Fi to find the details. The Wi-Fi was password protected however and the Ryanair staff member was not exactly showing any signs of wanting to help. I am of the opinion that it was extremely difficult if not impossible for a passenger to be able to retrieve the data. With time to board fast approaching we had no option but to pay 70 Euros each a Rip-Off total of 140 Euros to print two boarding passes.

The plus point was that travelling with a small child the arms of the seat lifted up and being flat it was easier for my daughter to sleep on the journey. The only down point that I could say is that the staff talking on the intercom I could not understand very well their English or Greek. This could have been a fault of the intercom. I found them excellent and compared to other airlines very competitive. It was the first time I had travelled with them and would do it again.

As I was in the front of the line my wait was short. The flight was full and everybody seemed to have carry on that well exceeded the limit so I was glad I paid the extra and checked my bag. Nobody was called out re succeeding the luggage limits so overhead space was at a premium but they got it all stowed. Cabin comfort was average and flight crew were pleasant enough.

So I had no option other than to pay an extra £20 for 'allocated seating' which turned out to be no different from normal seating. Friends have also reported this experience. Also been caught out by paying travel insurance because to opt out of this is not made clear.

Manchester airport suffering from a 1 inch 5cm snowfall they were unable to cope with causing many delays and cancellations this is not the airlines fault just plain bad airport management. Arriving very late for the flight due to traffic delays the friendly gate staff smilingly allowed us onboard (45 mins after boarding began). As soon as we boarded the Capt announced a 30 min delay. Calculating a 5 hour delay I immediately asked to be disembarked - the capt responded immediately arranging stairs and ground crew. In minutes we were off with helpful crew around. As we entered the terminal the airport announced closure and the flight delayed by 90 minutes plus. Fact was it departed 4 hours 46 minutes later. We cancelled our seats. A few hours later I received an email advising that I could claim a refund or another flight. I opted for a refund and a few hours later received confirmation the refund had been processed!,nan,4.0,nan

I didn't take luggage so no cost benefit to me. At Stansted I did get through security about 10 minutes quicker. Priority boarding going out was standing on the Tarmac for longer. The return from Morocco didn't give me any benefits as whilst the priority boards were first onto the bus to get to the plane everyone else was on the bus so we had to stand in a long queue. I do feel you should provide a hot drink and a snack at least as part of the package. Regardless of this the staff as always are helpful and kind.

Only gripe is with those passengers who don't pay to pre-book seats but expect those that do to move so they can sit with their kids. Last 2 flights from FUE have had families creating because they want to sit together.

With any other airline landing cards are offered to persons like myself during the flight. This saves time filling it out later at customs. However they are never offered on Ryanair. On a recent flight home from Gdansk I decided to ask the crew for a card since I figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. The crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in Arabic half in French which appeared to be for passengers arriving in Morocco. It was completely different to the standard form. Later in the flight I spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. She giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it 'just in case.' I pointed out that she was not making any sense. How hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight? If this is for some reason not possible then perhaps the staff need better training in terms of what to do if a passenger request one. Perhaps they could simply tell the passenger 'sorry we do not carry those on-board.' The whole episode was just silly.,nan,4.0,nan

The food was expensive and the service below average. The seats were cheap and flimsy and uncomfortable. You weren't allowed to get stuff out of the overhead lockers for some reason.

There was an announcement was that the plane was fully booked. We couldn't understand this as we were surrounded by empty seats. Then it was announced that they were waiting for some passengers who had been delayed. The next announcement was that the passengers were 70 Spanish schoolchildren. Eventually after 45 minutes after departure time the plane finally left. The landing and take-off resembled a roller coaster ride with much screaming and shouting.

However the purchasing of tickets is laborious and time consuming. The cost of the flights easily double should you reserve a seat (standard elsewhere) or want to stow luggage in the hold (standard elsewhere). The cabin crew were unbelievably poor and one even had a broken shoe ripped trousers un-ironed shirt and jacket and tie that was thrown on. Looked like he had been pulled through a hedge backwards - never seen anything like it.

Never once did I see a smile from the two female crew and seemed to see passengers as a necessary evil of their daily job but the male steward was more approachable but he had a ticking off about something with the in-flight catering by a more senior stewardess in earshot of myself which was most unprofessional.

At the gate there was an expected 15 min wait in a crowd on the stairs leading to apron. Not pleasant for parents with crying children all around but bearable for solo traveler. A short walk to the plane then got to my seat. Since it was an exit seat can't say anything about standard legroom. What I had was fine. No seat recline. The seat was ok. Announcements were not noisy. Flight took off late and landed before schedule. I didn't buy anything onboard. Long walk on arrival. Bag on the belt when I was off the immigration. Don't have an idea what if things went wrong but what I got for my money was predictable and trouble free.

The gate crew and on-board crew were all friendly cheery and helpful the plane itself was surprisingly comfortable (muchmore comfortable than the United 757s we flew to/from Dublin the week before) and on-board food and beverage choices were decent and not horribly pricey. We departed promptly on time arrived on time and getting on/off was efficiently managed by the crew. Nearly everyone else on our flight was part of a huge school trip (kids about 12-14 plus their ""keepers"") and the crew members were great with the kids - kept them as organized as possible and were flexible about changing seat assignments so that friends could sit together - very nice to see! Here are the only two reasons I didn't give Ryanair an overall ""10"" rating: 1) I received mobile-phone alerts reminding me to do online check-in and get mobile boarding passes. Sounds easy enough but after four tries I was still unable to input our information - no explanation given. Finally on the fifth try it worked: I added all of the requested info (passport numbers etc.) for our party and then got a message saying ""We are unable to issue mobile boarding passes"" - again no explanation at all. Since I didn't have access to a computer or printer I began to panic especially after reading that there was a fee of 70 pounds per person to check in at the airport! Thank heavens our B&B owner came to the rescue and offered me the use of his personal computer and printer to complete the online check-in and print boarding passes. 2) We arrived at Stansted with more than two hours to spare before our flight got through security in record time and began checking the boards to see which gate we'd depart from. We sat down in the Coast to Coast restaurant to grab brunch while waiting all the while keeping an eye on the Departures board but out gate number wasn't posted until 15 minutes before departure time! Worse it turned out that our gate was a nearly 10-minute walk from the restaurant so all of on this flight had to do a mad dash for the gate at (almost) the last minute. I've never ever seen a gate number posted so late in the game especially when the gate was fairly far away - that was just baffling.

The crew were polite and helpful but despite offering an extensive 'cafe' service the only food available was a hot panini. As others have mentioned families were split as the flight was full then these people expected others to move so they could be together. I was not asked but others were annoyed. The flight was delayed and I lost count of the times the cabin crew and pilot stressed it was because of earlier problems at Manchester Airport not their fault.

After being kept waiting she eventually told us that some coaches were being arranged what happened to the one that were a few minutes away? After a 3hr wait sat on a cold floor (no seating) the coaches turned up and we were face with a 1hr 45m journey to Leeds.

I had to drag my suitcase up the stairs to board the plane and stand waiting there for a good 10 minutes until other passengers had taken their seats. When we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. My husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. During this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. Menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didn't have enough to go round. It was a lunchtime flight and I was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if I could buy a panini. I was told they had ran out (again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats). No alternative was offered. The staff looked tired and fed up. Also there was a hen do on board with one idiot randomly shouting at the top of her voice. I didn't see any cabin crew addressing this. I would only fly Ryanair for very short flights if desperate.

It was confirmed that this would be fine. When we got to the airport we made sure it was still ok as my mother has limited mobility and finds air travel extremely difficult. They confirmed again that they had kept the seat we had paid for. When we got to the gate my mother had paid for priority boarding but a stuff up by the staff there meant we were left waiting to get onto the plane until after they had removed one of the sets of stairs.

Not only did Ryanair representatives lie directly on a number of times to me they had sold the seat within 30 minutes of our first contacting them regarding the flight issue.

The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow.

As we were in remote places with an old blackberry phone we were prepared to pay the still unreasonable boarding pass printing charge.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,I flew from Stansted to Tours. I was very careful to read and understand the rules. Two of us traveled so I booked 2 seats which also gave us priority boarding and enabled us to print off boarding passes well in advance. The flight was excellent as was the coffee. For such a short flight I did not need extra legroom even though I am well over 6ft.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Unusually this was my first trip with FR for 4 months. CCF to STN return. Surprised to be allocated the same back row seat for both flights even though I'd not paid for seat choice. I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? £4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative. Happily nowadays I'm quite keen to recommend them to anyone on any route if getting from A to B in the shortest time for the least money including bags etc is a priority.,nan,5.0,nan

The yellow tagging farce is actually funny to watch - the policy as I was rudely told is the ""first 90 bags"" however it was totally random with customers with large trolley bags walking through and then other customers behind them being tagged?! There is no correct monitoring system for this whatsoever so you are at the mercy of the poorly trained staff on the gate. You then get onto the flight to find several spaces in the overhead lockers and several empty seats! Quite frankly I am fed up with the continual poor service so I have now booked with Aer Lingus for my next trip to Dublin.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,I have been a passenger with numerous airlines since 1957 and in recent years frequently from Alicante to several different British airports. Ryanair is one of the worst I've ever travelled with and definitely the worst on this route. On the outward Alicante/East Midlands Airport journey we sat on the runway for almost an hour because they had missed their slot. This made for a long and tedious journey. This however was nowhere near as bad as the return flight. We left plenty of time to return the hire car and arrive at the airport in time to have a leisurely lunch (as we always do at Gatwick) as we knew that it would be late when we arrived home only to discover that we could not enter the departure lounge until 2 hours before our flight was due to leave. This would have been okay if there had been somewhere for two elderly passengers to sit (all chairs were taken and we were left standing with all our luggage) or somewhere to have a decent meal (there is one very unappetising place with food served in cardboard). Also two hours would have been sufficient time if it hadn't taken more than an hour to wind our way through the queue to the check in desk. When we arrived at the desk we were told that our case was too heavy (1kg overweight) most airlines will waive this fractional overweight but the representative told us that we had only paid for 15kg and would have to put the excess in our hand baggage. This we did in full view of the other passengers and consisted of 2 tee-shirts and a pair of light shoes. Whilst we were waiting to board the aircraft the attendant asked us if we would like to put our hand baggage in the hold free of charge! My logic and fairly basic grasp of maths cannot make sense of this! I had been warned not to travel Ryanair and I never will again.,nan,3.0,nan

Eventually I said I would try to climb the steps of the aircraft and was allowed onto the plane. At no time was I given any assistance. On arrival in Malta I had to struggle to baggage and out of the airport as no assistance was available. You need to be fit and agile to use this airline.

No complaints about the flight - I think some of the food/drinks are overpriced but in general there is a good selection. I have noticed on recent Ryanair flights that the level of customer service have improved. There seems to be more Irish and British crew on the Irish and British flights too. I noticed the crew were especially friendly with the children on board with 2 young kids being shown into the cockpit as they saw the pilot on exiting the plane and the male cabin crew member on the tramac waving at other children as they came down the aircraft steps.

It may be said that one gets what one pays for but by the time Ryanair has ripped through you with thier suite of extra charges many of which are simply an unfair cash grab on their unsuspecting customers at the booking counter when there is no chance of taking another airline Ryanair is not well priced. On a flight from Dublin to Bristol we were encouraged to use Ryanairs smartphone App or print out out a boarding pass to avoid an extra charge to have it printed at the booking counter. Unfortunately the App didn't work so on arriving at Dublin we were directed to the misnamed 'Customer Service' counter to be 'helped' by the most unhelpful unpleasant rude eye rolling young woman I have ever had the misfortune to encounter in many years of air travel with many airlines all over the world. When I explained the problem she tried to tell me that if the App didn't work I had plenty of time in Ireland to hunt down an Internet cafe or similar with access to a printer to print out my boarding pass and that she should now charge me for printing them out at the airport. I was then charged for an extra 3kg of baggage even though the two of us had no carry on baggage. The plane was dirty tired and run down and the cabin staff non professional. The seats are small and cramped. In summary terrible service from rude staff will strip you of cash any chance they get tired dirty aircraft poor inflight service.

The maitre d' shouted and yelled and my son who expressed his concern regarding fresh air and cooler air temperature in the cabin. Ryanair is a budget airline and I'm aware of that but budget does not mean poor maintenance and rude and unfriendly flight crew. As a very frequent airline passenger I must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,2.0,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight left a little late but made up for the delay in the air and landed on time. Cabin basic and not particularly clean- we literally passed the departing passengers from our plane across the tarmac so obviously no time there to clean the plane - however if speedy turnaround keeps costs down I can put up with a few crumbs. Did not pay for allocated seating but got two decent seats one by the window. If they reduced allocated seating costs I might have considered it. Return flight also bang on time leaving and arrived early. Pilots friendly and informative although very difficult to hear as engines seemed much noisier than other airlines. Staff were definitely not as friendly as other airlines rolling eyes at passengers etc which is a shame as being cheap shouldn't mean poorer customer service. I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge.

There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me.

I have never been a fan of this airline but I have to admit they are moving forward and slowly getting closer to what I consider to be an enjoyable carrier to fly with (for short haul flights). Flew BGY to SKG last week for a short Greek holiday with no issue at all: on time departures/arrivals good rate for the ticket and above all some improvements I did notice compared to the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. The main one is of course the seat allocation for everyone which prevent people from rushing to the aircraft as if it was a bus school trip. I also found seat comfort and legroom to have improved and even the cabin crew seems a bit more professional and friendly now even if they still talk too much in my opinion during the flight to try and sell whatever the can to the passengers. Another positive news is that there is no longer (at least according to my experience) an obsessive check of your hand baggage dimensions and weight at the gate which I do appreciate. Generally speaking if you check the rules carefully and comply with them you can get a great value for money as well as good and frequent direct connections. The day they stop boarding the plane half an hour before the plane is actually ready to welcome passengers onboard (thus causing people to wait on the stairs/bus/apron for up to 15 minutes) they will probably see me much more often on their planes.,nan,4.0,nan

Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week.

These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control. My bag was already on the belt I was off the airport 20 minutes after landing. Absolutely bearable experience; you'll have no trouble if you carefully read their instruction and spend extra 10 minutes on booking process.

I paid £8 for seat 1C (extra leg room and priority boarding) and £15 to check in a bag online the day before departure. Bag drop at Edinburgh was efficient. On time departure friendly staff quick flight early arrival can't complain. Apart from the lousy dry cheese sandwiches and drinks you get on Lufthansa/Austrian the difference was minimal.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,"Flight FR9810 from London Stansted to Barcelona El Prat T2 on Monday 4th May 2015 scheduled to leave at 08.15 However due to Barcelona being fog bound they had delayed all flights into Barcelona apparently from many UK airports. We were firstly informed that a delay of 1.5 hours was estimated. After a while we were informed that another 1 hour had been added. So all passengers sat on the plane for 2.5 hours. Our first complaint - Sitting in a stationary hot metal tube for 2.5 hours is not my idea of enjoyment particularly when nobody was offered even the smallest drink of complimentary cold water in order to alleviate the discomfort. During the 2.5 hour delay there would have been time to have some water delivered. The irony in all of this is that shortly after take-off the cabin crew came round selling drinks. Our second complaint - Flight FR9015 Thursday 7th May - El Prat to Stansted. Taking advantage of the 10kg on board baggage allowance + small bag we purchased a second ""carry on"" cabin bag (size within stipulated regulation). On the outward journey not a problem. A different story on the return flight though. On entry to the plane I was told by a Stewardess ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I explained that we had no problems on the outward journey the cabin crew were quite happy. Not being convinced she repeated the statement ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I again repeated my statement and then went to take my seat and stow my cabin bag. Little knowing that my wife was behind me she said again in a rather snide voice ""That is not a cabin bag!"" Not wanting to cause an argument my wife just reiterated the fact that it was acceptable on the outward journey. So in summation we have a rather dim view of Ryanair. Booking of future holidays will take into consideration who the airline carrier is and if it is Ryanair we will attempt to make alternative arrangements.",nan,3.0,nan

The flight itself was bang on time, smooth and a joy. A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old.

When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours.

Our real issue as we were waiting in the queue (towards the back) to embark a ground staff came up the line and attached yellow stickers to our hand luggage and boarding pass. She spoke no English, and we eventually worked out our hand luggage (which was all we had by choice) was now going in the hold. This was a bit of a disaster for us as we were now being forced to wait at the baggage reclaim at the other end , a wait which proved to be about half an hour meaning we overshot out car parking time and had to pay excess. Despite this sticker business some people behind us in the queue were removing the stickers prior to embarking and just taking the luggage on the plane anyway. But we played the game and tried to safeguard some delicate stuff we had. Despite this on arrival home we found that some articles were damaged, something that should never have happened in the first place.

When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

Check in easy at MAN, no hassles over cabin bag sizes and the hassles and stress seemed more passenger driven than airline provoked.

Crew fine and we were in the STR rental car building in 25 minutes on arrival. On return STR didn't inspire with cold war security and check-in chaos but FR honoured our seats and we strolled on 10 minutes before departure. Nice coffee and informative FO pointed out sights.

That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat. The flight attendant walked by and asked that I store the hand bag I had with me in the overhead as it was an exit row. Priority boarding was relaxed and more civilized. Print boarding pass before you get to the airport. If you printed your boarding pass, you can go directly to the gate. I was able to check in my rolling bag for free because the flight was nearly full and there was need for overhead space. Weigh your hand luggae and ensure it is within the rules.

Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance. Ryanair certainly seems to be more passenger-friendly these days but it is still advisable to be aware of the rules to avoid any possible pitfalls.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The cabin crew were friendly and did a good job on board. The only negative comment I can say is that they had ran out of Prosecco (except for 1 bottle) on both flights and we were sitting in Row 3! The bar seemed poorly stocked and on the return flight I heard that there was no hot food available. I am not surprised as the passengers were only getting off our aircraft 5 minutes before we boarded it to return home. I never saw an aircraft turned around so quickly in all my years of travel.

When we asked what we should give the girls to drink, the air steward advised red bull! Otherwise they had tomato juice!

Didn't love having the safety card stuck at eye-level on the seat in front but again, this is a budget airline. Had a very quick taxi and takeoff from Stagnated which was great and the landing at Krakow was smooth. Great pilots. Love the comical fanfare as you touchdown.

No one wanted to help or give me answer to the fact by law there not allowed to fly without a parent but yet you feel it's ok to separate my children from their mother. In the end a passenger actually moved so I could sit with my young children, if he hadn't my daughter would have been made to sit in the corner with 2 men who actually got really drunk and had to be spoken to on several occasions. I was told it's all to do with balance I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

They have an app, it reminds you of your flight even without, and the email in gmail tells you to check in (gives a link) follow the link and it tells you to print, or download boarding pass. Anyway, extremely efficient. Which was wonderful with 3 kids in tow. I cannot complain whatsoever. The luggage was not a problem again you just have to be savvy and dont try to go over just incase.

The check-in clerk however could benefit from a refresher course in customer service as he appeared extremely bored and disinterested. However my complaint starts when we did not print off our return boarding passes in advance of the holiday and although we tried to reserve our seats for the return flight, so my family could sit together we were unable to do this via their web-site. We gave up after 2 attempts and assumed we would check-in on arrival and take whatever seats available. We of course were not aware that they would be an additional charge for printing a boarding pass and was advised by the desk clerk to check-in on-line, again we tried to do this via our smart phone but again were unable to access the booking on the web-site. As we had spent a considerable amount of time and with mounting stress from my wife, I was forced to pay the additional charge. The 3 boarding passes were duly hand written in 10 minutes by the Servisair clerk and 135€ extracted. The clerk even told us we were lucky to get the last 3 seats even though we had booked and paid for them. I find these charges levied by Ryanair are totally disproportionate to the administration involved and are punitive in the extreme and are extracted under stressful circumstances. Up to this point we had enjoyed a fabulous holiday only to have it spoiled on our return. I have a number of issues with this penalty charge, firstly; it is not clear on their web-site when making the on-line seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight (or is it Ryanair’s intention to catch out the new customers?) and secondly, I regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes. I regularly use on-line booking and the barcode via smart phone but generally this is within 24 hours prior to departure and I have never been charged for a boarding pass, this is not the industry norm.

Yes, prices can be slightly high, but they are on trains too, but not too over priced, in my opinion. Certainly was no strong selling on this flight. Further delay as we approached Palma, this time due to the weather, but again superbly informed and updated by the pilot, who made sure to tell us we had enough fuel of course. Eventually arrived approximately 1 hour late, into a torrential downpour, thankfully to a stand and not a remote stand with bus trip.

Payments are done in a different ""office"", so I had to go there and stand for 20 min in a very unorganized line. When I came back to check-in the agent was very upset that we didn't pay for our suitcases, almost yelling at us. Guess what? we didn't know about this as well. So now she sent me again for the same ""office"" to pay another 200 Euros. Now, however there is only one line instead of two, so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee.

However 220 euros airport check-in fee is twice the price of our total ticket cost! Finding this cost info on their website is almost impossible (it is literally hidden on the website - you have to search for that particular thing really). Their ""don't forget to check-in online"" e-mails can easily be ignored because they don't mention any airport check-in fee. It looks like a choice, not a must-do. At least three more couple of people paid that meaningless fee. Because they were not aware of it. If this airlines were for budget travelers and really cared about customer service, they would warn travelers about those ridiculous add-on fees. A fee should offer a service, so its value should be reasonable compared with the service it gives. So we paid 220 euros for a single check-in (not four - because normal airlines do a single check-in per reservation) done by a sour-faced check-in officer who scolded us like we were little kindergarden children.

The busy Friday evening flight from Liverpool to Dublin I took last week was no different to usual.

The ground staff checked tickets and passports. If for some reason you decide to bring large baggage with you, you will be charged. The airline are far less strict about size and number of bags carried these days. Ryanair staff are patient in my experience, they take alot of abuse from a minority of passengers who can't be bothered following basic rules. The flight is short.

We have always booked online and never had an issue with any other airline until it had come to our attention that we had to pay to sit together with was £20 each. At the time we assumed it was because we had booked short notice so we was fine to pay that. However, when we got to the airport (after checking in online a week before ) we were asked to pay £70 each for luggage on the way there and £35 each on the way back! I was so angry as there is nothing that states when you book your holiday that you have to ""check in"" your luggage too? The only question you are asked is if you want to check in ""extra luggage"" - well to me we didn't have extra it was just a standard suitcase and hand luggage (which pretty much everyone takes when they go away). So when you book online that's how they catch you out as they word it wrong by saying extra luggage rather than just a standard luggage. The staff were really abrupt and rude and not really bothered about the hassle this had caused us. Following this, my partner had to ask about luggage on the way back they didn't inform us. Again, there was nothing whilst we were booking to inform us that we had to do this only to check in ""extra luggage"" and I was not aware that my only suitcase had to be classed as extra. Its very misleading!  We normally don't take our bank cards with us on holiday but its a good job we did. To everyone that reads this please take it on board as some people may not be able to afford that kind of money upfront when they charge you which was what happened to the couple in front of us! The staff at the desk said that the information was in the ""small print"" which I think is awful as a vital piece of information like that, in my opinion, should not be in the small print! I have never known so much hassle to go on holiday in all my life and we have booked before with other airlines online and never ever had any issues with luggage. We will never fly with Ryanair again and strongly advise to anyone who is thinking of flying with them to think carefully and go with another airline if you can as you will probably end up paying again what you pretty much paid for the holiday.

Usual melee on board, staff pressuring people to buy rubbish food, drinks, duty free goods and lottery tickets (and complaining loudly to each other when failing to do so!) Big problem when we came in to land at Chania airport. Pilot failed on first attempt - think he was travelling far too fast for runway - and despite perfect weather conditions, we had to climb again and were then an extra 20 mins in sky and ten mins landing. No explanation given by crew, lots of people worried in case it was a pervasive mechanical problem (unable to drop landing gear for example) or just a careless pilot - neither are happy thoughts to have as you circle your destination!

I arrived 2 hrs early at around 1130 for the 1335 flight. At around 1300 our Boarding Cards were checked and we went down the ramp to embark. At around 1320 we were asked to return to the Departure Lounge due to a technical issue. For the next 3 hrs we were not advised of the issue nor of the plans to get us back to the UK. Gradually over that time people would ask the 2 (relatively junior) staff members of Ryanair and 'news', or lack of it, would filter down the line. No announcements were made. By around 1700 we heard that a plane was on its way and we would depart at around 1930. Ok, 6 hrs delay but at least we'd be home. The 2 officials then handed out photocopies of the EU regulations regarding flight delays etc - useful, but to be honest we just wanted to get home! As can be imagined, people then were asking lots of questions of the 2 lads. At around the same time food vouchers were being handed out and stamped by the 2 officials. However, not one of the food outlets would take the vouchers because Ryanair had tried this in the past and had not paid their bills to the food outlets! At around 1830 the 1930 departure disappeared off the departures list. We heard that another flight had been delayed and our rescue plane had been used for those passengers - presumably to avoid 2 sets of compensation!! Time progressed slowly, we then found out that a flight would take us back to the UK around 2305. The flight actually left at 2330 - 10 hrs late. During the 10 hrs, the 200 or so customers were shunted at least 5 times between Gates - can you imagine 200 people racing around getting from A to B! Ok, these things happen. Lessons to be learnt?  Ryanair, have someone on the ground such as a manager to deal with the situation and inform people officially by adequate communication. Pay your bills to the local food outlets. Having reported all the above, I've travelled extensively for the past few years to Spain and back and used Ryanair a lot. Mostly they are cheap and get you there on time; its just at times such as the above where you realise their service is quite flaky.

My flight to London was delayed for almost 3 hours; none of the staff at the gate informed us about what was going on and what the reason for the delay was (only when people started walking up to them and asked, everyone kind of found out from the people sitting next to them). Conveniently the flight was delayed just a little under 3 hours so you're not even able to claim a refund. Because of the delay I missed my connecting flight in London (it was already about 8pm), which is why I went to ask for assistance. Their employee was pretty rude and offered no help; she just told me that I booked the two flights at my own risk and that I wasn't gonna get any assistance by Ryanair. Unfortunately there was no flight left to my final destination that day (which I would have had to pay out of my own pocket, of course), which is why I had to book an overnight bus and had a horrible 24hr trip instead of 8 hrs. On my flights back everything luckily went smoothly, but I noticed that boarding was really chaotic at all flights (a woman with her baby in a stroller was pretty much first in line to board and had to wait about 20 mins until all other passengers had boarded to get some help carrying the stroller down the stairs - of course, staff also weren't able to turn on the escalator at least). I wouldn't fly with Ryanair again, because despite their (in my case not even that cheap) prices their service is just the worst I've ever experienced. I've gone on many flights and faced many delays but have always received assistance and been booked on another flight/hotel etc at the airline's expense.

The following is their list of price determining factors : number of passengers already booked on a flight : flight time : Day of travel : time of year - high season/low season etc. Given that we are travelling on the same flights and the same period which have virtually only just become available I fail to see how such a price increase can be justified other than pure greed and the mindset that they have a captive audience.

Reason being I had booked a flight (bus flex) for my daughter and her friend (14 and 15 yrs). During the booking no ""warning"" was given and also while trying to checkin, which did not work, no mention of the fact that children under 16 are not allowed to fly without anyone above 16 in company. By chance parents of the friend found out under AGBs that our children are not allowed to fly on their own. With repetitive chat, call and email I am told - it is written in the AGBs! Ridiculous - if you would have children stuck in a foreign country without money and place to live you give a damn to AGBs which are almost always ignored anyway. I had to break my schedule, spend hundreds of Euros to just pick up the two experienced travellers vs many above 16 I know who cannot travel alone. If Ryanair wants to stick to this ridiculous rule, they ought to find a way to cleary and ""loudly"" inform during the booking.

I booked in July for a holiday to Faro in December, party of 4, of which 3 are disabled, 2 of which needed to use the abulift to access the aircraft. I booked special assistance at the time of booking and was allocated specific seats for out party to be able to access easily. We all booked in and went to special assistance area. All fine and good! Well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. Flight called, we were taken to board the plane. Wait theres a massive problem, theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift, but we were told Ryanair would only take 4! It seemed 2 others hadn't pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and Ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldn't take more than 4! We got as far as the tarmac, sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. We were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance, thankfully I always keep the paperwork safe. No other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. It seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help.  Ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was, for us to actually get on the plane. We were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its Ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. Maybe when Ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous, it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag, forget those who are confined to a chair.

We didn't know what to do at that point. We tried to call their customer service team but could not get an answer - later discovered they all go home at 6pm, because all problems go away at 6pm clearly. We eventually got hold of someone the following morning who told us that they would put us on the next flight to Edinburgh - 6 days later. Having small children at home and a job to go to this was not acceptable. Neither was their insistence that they would not pay for our extra accommodation costs as 'it wasn't their fault'. We discovered that Ryanair were the only airline that cancelled flights due the strike - everyone else just diverted. When we questioned them on this they could not give us any answer. After much discussion, they finally agreed to transfer our booking to a flight from Alicante to Dublin on Thursday (2 days) later however we would then not be able to get a connecting flight to Edinburgh until the Friday morning. On asking if they would put us up for the night in Dublin we were told no, we could keep our receipts and claim back but nothing was gauranteed - as again 'it wasn't their fault'. To add insult to injury, the flight from Dublin to Edinburgh was delayed. We had to pay out for 2 nights accommodation in Spain, a night in Dublin, meals, extra car parking at Edinburgh.

They tell you that you can take a bag into the cabin and then spend the next hour or so harassing you at every opportunity and asking you if you would like to check in that bag for free. The seats are bolt upright and cannot be moved, the pockets on the seat in front of you have vanished and there is approximately 4 inches between your knees and the seat in front (for a person with average length legs anyway). If you sit next to the window you end up freezing cold and getting wet as ice forms on the inside of the cabin wall and when you point it out on the way off the plane the pilot explains that it's because their air conditioning system is so efficient that it ices up. The call to go to the boarding desk is far too early which results in at over 150 people standing strung out across the boarding gates for three quarters of an hour whilst the staff checking you through to the plane know full well that the plane hasn't even landed, and of course they are happily chatting away in their seats behind the desk so they don't care. This is just cruel and unfair, especially to those people who find standing around quite difficult. The staff on board the aircraft were more interested in gossiping and playing around than paying attention to the passengers. They know that most people won't buy anything because Ryanair rip you off so they are totally disinterested in what they are doing.

If you find a really cheap flight with Ryanair, go for it, but just beware that if you try to change anything their customer services will not be helpful in any way or polite. The gates they get are always on the edges of the airport and they do not give you water on the plane if you ask for it. You have to buy bottled water. Every other airline I have flown gives you a cup of water. You will be charged for anything extra and it isn't cheap for the extra stuff (which includes suitcases).

I fly this route several times a month and usually default to Aer Lingus as they can be cheaper if planned and booked in advance. This time fares on both airlines were exorbitant thanks to St Patrick's Day and the Cheltenham Festival and Ryanair came out cheaper. Brand new 737 with new interior and the very pleasant staff resplendent in their new uniforms. After a very stressful journey to the airport it was lovely to be greeted by such friendly staff, relaxing interior, comfortable seat (I had paid for exit seat for extra leg room so can't comment on the regular seats) and lovely relaxing music. It all felt surreal because our go-to response to anything Ryanair has usually always been negative but this looks like it's set to change. A few years ago, when I had taken my first Ryanair flight in many years I actually laughed at the state of the garish interior but not any more. Why ever did Ryanair not make these changes years ago, I imagine they are going to elicit quite the competitive response from competitors and not just from the no-frills market either. One comment I would always have to make about Ryanair is that although they can be categorised as 'no frills', the same can't be said about being a 'low fares' airline as some of the fares, particularly on this busy route can sometimes resemble long-haul fares.

The seats are uncomfortable and cramped. No seat pocket annoys me and puts me off buying anything (still way overpriced). As does the broken tray table with a 45 degree slant meaning anything placed on it rolls into your lap. The fan fare on arrival irritates and is frankly crass.

Check in was very easy although there are still quite a few extra things they give you the option of purchasing at the last minute which can be annoying.

We sat near the back of the plane and had the three seats to ourselves. I really like the seat allocation as this has completely eliminated the mad rush that I remember. We didn't have anything to eat or drink as it was a short flight but we did buy our coach tickets from the FA and saved a few pounds. All staff encountered throughout were very friendly and helpful.

This is the first time I have flown with Ryanair and I paid for business plus which was a total waste of money. I was expecting what they advertised, priority boarding, no hassle on checking-in lugagge and security. In fact, I was had to queue up like usual to check in luggage, I did jump to their so called ""BusinessPlus"" counter to ask where to check in, staff asked me to stay back and wait, and nothing happened. When I was about to go into the priority boarding area, staff stopped me and asked me loudly: ""you have priority?"" When the bus came and we are about to board priority staff again stopped me and asked me again, ""are you in priority?"" I did have priority boarding but not on the plane, but only on the bus that transported us to board the plane. So when boarding the plane, we still boarded as usual in a long queue. The seat onboard is normal and I was sitting in the front row near an aisle, which was really annoying as the corridor was so small and people kept going to the toilet located just in front of my seat, and therefore, I could not enjoy the ""long leg room"" as the space is just too small. Overall, Ryanair is economical to fly with but remember, don't waste money on upgrading especially Business Plus which is a totally waste of money.

Booked the return flight separately as paying in euros saved money, even using my credit card. Had problems trying to check in online as our computer does not seem to like the new Ryanair website and in the end could only do so via the old so-called Legacy website, only to discover that airport security and boarding gates struggle to read the boarding codes. Outward flight was fine and everyone seemed to get their hand luggage on board despite the flight being full. The return journey was less satisfactory. It was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology given. Boarding at Malaga was in 3 groups: priority first, then rows 22 - 33, then everyone else. We could see that it made sense to board the back rows first when using an airbridge, but some prior warning would have been helpful as the existence of the display notices indicates that it is Ryanair policy. Then as the rest of us were boarded, the boarding agents immediately began to tag our cabin baggage for free hold storage without any warning, which necessitated extracting items wanted on board as we waited beyond the gate. It seemed that there must have been a pre-determined number of passengers to be selected for hand luggage removal as those at the back of the queue were allowed to keep their bags. In fact, as there was a large school party on board with minimal hand luggage, there would have been plenty of room for everyone's bags. We couldn't help feeling unfairly treated as we were near the front in the original queue, but relegated towards the rear and then selected for baggage extraction as well.

I'm sure this is due to the 2 hour delay for boarding and turn around time. Captain made PA-regulation/restrictions would not allow us to push back for 45 minutes (crew laughed at this PA). This seems like more than enough time to clean a plane. Female crew in the aft of the plane giggling through their safety demos, looking behind at the other female crew and making jokes. A lady pressed the call bell and I could see the crew ignoring it and eating crisps instead. What if it's a medical emergency? When she finally came to check she was still chewing. Crew were running through the cabin, with scratch cards laughing at 1am. No hot food, no tea available. The crew found this hilarious and kept laughing when people complained. It took 1 hour+ to get to row 25 with a drinks cart. The crew kept using the call bells during service even though people wanted to sleep. One female crew could not even form a sentence toward the end of the flight. During all her landing PAs she was laughing. She had to stop and start two safety PAs because she could not stop laughing. All the crew were having a fantastic evening. The customers however, after 3 hour delay and terrible customer service were not. Then as we left the plane the crew didn't even look up or smile.

It's amazing how much the airline's customer service has improved in recent years, particularly with their allocated seating, extra cabin baggage allowance, use of primary airports and excellent mobile app, features, all of which, have significantly enhanced the overall travel experience. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Ryanair have begun using satellite 2 in Stansted for some of their flights, which offers a far more relaxed boarding experience, along with much more space and seating compared to satellite 3 (which is the main gate area from which Ryanair flights operate). Ryanair should definitely consider making more use of this facility, as it is very underused and often empty for long periods of the day. (In fact, there were only 3 flights operating from there when we flew out). Onboard, I noticed that service has improved too, and there are no longer as many tedious announcements as before, particularly on evening flights. On both flights, cabin crew were very friendly and professional. Clearly, Ryanair have come a long way since their improvement plan started, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.

We had to queue for an hour to check this bag in as there were only 2 desks checking in all Ryanair flights at the airport. We should not have had to queue at the check in desk to drop a bag when we had already completed our online check in. To our horror, we then had to queue for another hour to drop the bag as the airport doesn't take your bag from the check in desk to the plane on the usual belts (but that's not the airline's fault). There were two further queues at the gate to board the plane. With all the time wasted we had no time left to get our evening meal (we had allowed a generous 3 hours before our flight but it was not enough time). So we were relying on the cabin food once onboard. But they had run out of everything. Only a few pain au chocolat, crisps and coffees were left to share around all passengers onboard.

I had to drop my trolley at the aircraft due to full cabin which was a bit annoying. Since you have seats assigned boarding is absolutely comparable to any other airline. Once in the cabin you need to get used to the strong colors. The seats are absolutely sufficient for the 1,5 hours to STN. Announcements had been in clear and understandable English. Take-off was on-time and the flight to STN was absolutely smooth with a safe landing in STN. As usual there is service against charge onboard as well as Duty Free.

I have flown on this route about 6 times this year and have consistently been very satisfied with Ryanair. There are 3 other budget airlines which I could choose but Ryanair's fares are always the cheapest. They allow a cabin bag plus another small bag (e.g. laptop), which is generous for a budget airline. They boast about a 90% on time arrival (within an hour), and given my experiences I can believe it. I have been delayed once and that was because all flights were grounded due to weather. The staff are fine, friendly enough. Boarding can be a bit chaotic, and I would recommend paying the small fee for priority boarding (note that this does sell out, so do it at time of booking rather than a later add-on). Personally I don't care about in-flight entertainment, magazines, or drink services, so I won't make any judgement based on those (which is good, because they are either non-existent, or average at best). If you want a good trip here is what to bear in mind. Have expectations that match the price - this is a budget airline that tries to deliver best price by having no-frills. Read the rules and stick to them. Cabin bag dimensions are a bit smaller than usual which can catch you out. Only 20cm width as opposed to normal 25cm. Would have caught me out once but fortunately they didn't check bags at the gate. Be sure to check in online prior to arriving at the airport. They do not have check in desks, and if you haven't checked in you are setting yourself up for a hefty penalty. Only the first 90 bags will be boarded, the rest will be put into the hold free of charge. This means that if you insist on carrying your bag, you will have to queue up at the gate to make sure you are one of the earlier passengers to board. If you sit down and wait, go for a coffee or whatever, and then board later, you are not taking your bag on board. The only thing I wish they would change is to remove the bright yellow colour scheme from the cabin. Maybe it's branding, but it just lends a tackiness to the whole experience that seems unnecessary. I am sure they could adjust their brand to something slightly more tasteful. Overall I have to give them top marks. I am not sure they are the best choice for families with small children, but if you're a single traveller or a non-fussy couple/group, and you want to get from A to B cheaply, you won't beat them (on this route, at least).",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Check-in at Dublin was chaotic. We had no way to print our boarding passes and they were not downloadable. Not knowing there was a place to print them at the airport, we were reprimanded by the attendant at the bag drop but she printed them for us anyway. The boarding on both flights was somewhat chaotic. Again, we didn't bother to pay for priority boarding (why bother); but one of the flights didn't even have a plane at the gate, and we were herded like sheep into waiting buses which drove out on the tarmac to a waiting plane. Both flights were boarded out on the tarmac, climbing stairs to the plane. The FA's were all friendly enough but the head FA's making the announcements were difficult to understand (they weren't Irish). The flight from London Gatwick was delayed but no fault of the airline; it was due to heavy air traffic (and they only have one runway for both incoming and outgoing flights).

I'm happy with Ryanair's budget approach, but over many years of using their flights there's been a consistent changing of goal posts that inevitably disadvantages the customer. These do not seem to be writ large all over their website. My latest encounter involved printing boarding passes. I do both the mobile and the printed- belt n braces kind of approach. I was printing the passes from saved pdf files which displayed all images and the barcode perfectly. The boarding passes printed beautifully except for the barcodes. I altered every possible parameter on the printer, even printing as a super-fine image, with the same outcome ie perfect adverts, lovely table for the barcode info, crisp text, but the barcode a grayed-out blur or totally absent. I went online to their 'chat' - 'well i don't know change your printer' : I phoned customer service - 'use a different browser' - nobody else boarding that flight has had this problem so it's your fault'. Being an OCD sort I actually scrutinised the pretty-looking boarding pass I printed. Unlike earlier iterations, the barcode is now a smaller element of a foldable page stacked with big, colourful adverts. Many users may glance at this and not notice that the barcode is wonky or absent. Most customers will now, I guess, be using the mobile app. Which means that it looks like Ryanair have spotted a niche market represented by the digital divide - ie, if you aren't technically aware, and don't own a smartphone, you'll get 'fined' at check-in. Be interesting to see if any other customers have also experienced this. It interests me that in neither of my encounters with customer advice did the operative advise me to use the mobile app instead - which is the logical answer. In both encounters it was the usual Ryanair indifference plus assigning blame to 'stupid customers'.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

I said you can check on my Ryanair account which shows clearly when logged in I had 4 other flights booked in the next 2 months plus the previous 100 taken in last 2 years, again just a sigh and no help. I feel that the staff really do need to be recruited better and trained to help and find a way to express themselves. You do not even need a passort to fly from UK to Ireland so what was the problem? I ended up catching an Aer Lingus flight back from Heathrow to Cork and what a treat that was - a far cry from Ryanair in every detail such a professional outfit. I tried again to contact Ryanair when back for my next flight to UK, but their chat line / phone and email (to which I had no response) was unsatisfactory and no help whatsoever.",Business,3.0,1.0

I am writing a review on behalf of my partially sighted 76 year old mother, who flew alone on flight FR9943 from Cork to Lanzarote on the 8th of Sept. 2016 to meet other family members who were already holidaying there. My mother who also suffers from a chronic back problem can not walk quickly, nor can she walk long distances requested wheelchair assistance and a person to walk her on to the aircraft to find her seat as she is incapable of reading seat numbers due to her sight. All this information is clearly stated on the boarding pass. EASY, SIMPLE, wouldn't you think, not so for Ryanair, my mother was wheeled to the departure gate area and left there. Eventually after a period of time she managed to make her own way to the departure desk to inquire what was going on. The person there literally man handled my mother and ran her down the gangway onto the aircraft dropped her luggage on to a seat and left just as the flight was about to leave. There was not one member of cabin crew helped my mother, other passengers on the flight helped her to find her seat, she put her luggage on the floor as she would be totally unable to put it in the overhead locker. As any traveller would image, a very uncomfortable 4 hour flight with luggage taking up the small space where your feet should be. On arrival at Lanzarote, she and another passenger with need of assistance were left waiting at the exit door of the aircraft for a very long time (I don't know exactly how long but it was certainly long enough for family to start worrying and try to find her, afraid that they had somehow miss her). My mother was so upset with all she went through, that she could not, even 2 days into her holiday relax and enjoy herself. Her flight home was changed (by family, an added unexpected expense) to a different airline, only then did she begin to enjoy herself. Ryanair, shame on you.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I had never flown with Ryanair before, and was not expecting much with it being a low-cost airline. Entering the terminal (Manchester T3) we were annoyed to see that Ryanair checks in all their flights at the same counters, and that there was a huge queue, stretching all the way to the cafés nearby. We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for €3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile. After landing in Barcelona we had to wait 25 minutes for our bags to arrive. On the way back to Manchester two weeks later we were cautious and arrived at the airport 2h 30m before the flight instead, but check in and security were very fast and we spent nearly 2 hours in departures, and with big glass windows this was great for me, being an avid plane spotter. The gate was surprisingly in arrivals, and therefore we had to go through security again to get to the plane. After waiting for 20 minutes to board we, along with everyone else were directed towards arrivals, rather than towards the plane, which ended up in a big confusion for the airport staff. Like on the way, the attendants were attentive and kind and although we had major problems with ground staff the airline is very good value for money, and I would recommend it for those who do not have much money to spend on their flight, although if there is a flight with a different airline with a similar price, I'd pick the other.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Flight departure was scheduled for 6.55am and by 6.25 we were standing outside the airport buildings at the head of a long queue waiting for boarding. This is probably the worst part of flying with Ryanair and such as passengers may be exposed to the elements for quite some time waiting to board, thankfully on this particular morning it was dry, not too cold and bearable. The crew appeared about 6.30 and by 6.40 we were in our seats watching the oncoming passengers in what appeared to be a full load struggling to find overhead locker space and, some their seats. Departure was delayed by half an hour for air traffic control purposes but, once airborne everything went very smoothly and I managed to catch up with some sleep on the way. Cabin crew were friendly, informative and appeared to meet all the needs expected of them by passengers. The return trip was somewhat similar although check-in in Santander was through normal processes, i.e. we all queued up for two desks and took our turn with everybody else to check-in our bags, there was no special service for business plus but that was not a problem as the staff at the desks were quite efficient. Again, the wait outside for boarding, this time in nice sunshine, aboard in plenty of time and airborne exactly on schedule. A newer aircraft this time with the more modern Boeing cabin lighting etc. Good service from the crew and this time we availed ourselves of the excellent coffee and a croissant at an acceptable price.

However, Stansted Airport was a disaster, and I would never again fly out of there. Add to the unbelievably large Duty Free Area the fact that a gate is not assigned until about 40 minutes prior to departure. That is unforgivable - that leaves scant little time to get to that gate. In our case, the single escalator leading up to the Gate 40-59 waiting area was out of service, so 180 passengers per flight times 19 gates meant over 3400 people were trying to ascend a single staircase. The obvious fire-hazard aside, it meant a crush of humanity in the passageway and an exceptionally long transit time from the hub to the gate.

However, I decided to try them when I found a very low price to my destination, and also because a friend told me they'd improved their customer services considerably. The on-line booking and purchase were simple and straight forward. I received several follow-up e-mails reminding of any additional services I might like to add. Check-in at Berlin Schoenefeld was fast and there was no line. Boarding on-time. Although my carry-on day pack was probably a bit larger and heavier than the rules permit, no one looked at my hand luggage or hassled me about it. I had paid for priority boarding, which worked well. There was separate priority line and we were allowed to board first. The plane was clean, the seat reasonably comfortable, and the service was friendly and efficient. I noticed none of the excessive announcements or heavy selling that I'd read about. Take off and landings were on time. The return flight from Vilnius was equally good and without problem. I was pleasantly surprised by Ryanair and would certainly fly them again.

Boarding was fast and we departed late but not as late as we were expecting. The airplane was clean. The crew was very friendly, smiling all the time. Not sure if this happens every time but whenever I travel in the last flight of the day with Ryanair, the crew seems to be much more friendly and playful, with a light mood and doing some nice jokes to cheer the passengers. On board sales service was well provided and prices were affordable. Once again, the crew was very effective and helpful with passengers buying items as I did. Flight was very quiet, with zero turbulence (which is rare in a flight to the Azores) and although we arrived with a delay, we manage to recover some of that 1h delay, arriving with something like 30 to 40 minutes late.

I have experienced long lines in order to access the plane and have a place to store your luggage - it doesn't matter if you have assigned seat. Passengers have to stand more than 45 minutes before the call to board, and even after this they made us to wait other 30 minutes before entry to the plane. Once inside there is a big rush of people trying to put their luggage in rack without any consideration for the next passenger.

Meanwhile at the next gate, the correct boarding procedure was followed without a hitch.

The aircraft are clean. The flights are on time and the prices are ridiculously cheap. You can get Edinburgh to London single from £9.99 if you book early. I find the staff on board tend to be very pleasant and helpful. The seat is fine, it is certainly not the most comfortable ever but given that they only do short flights this is fine. The only slight annoyance is that there is no seatback pocket to put anything in. Overall I would recommend them highly, I think that the value is much better than BA. Ryanair do not charge for a credit card payment, BA charge £5. Ryanair are more frequently on time in my experience, and the prices are often around 1/8 of BA prices. No contest I would choose Ryanair. Stansted as an airport is fine, the security was better before they meddled with it, the staff can be rude, but this is the same for anywhere, the main problem is that other passengers at Stansted are just awful, but once you've been a few times you find the quiet seating areas away from everyone else. Ryanair is a good experience, especially for the price. To sum up it does what it says on the tin.

As seats on Ryanair do not have pockets, the price list in contained in their magazine. On this occasion, none was offered. Instead, cabin crew simply started selling. I asked for the list and was astonished to find the prices expressed in euros. When I questioned this, the steward told me that this was because Ryanair was an Irish airline. When I asked what the conversion rate to sterling was, I was told it was roughly the same. Crews are now equipped with handheld calculators. I was 'allowed' to pay in sterling, but, when I asked what the exchange rate was, was simply told 'Ryanair's own'. So, to sum up: lack of transparent/any visible pricing, exorbitant on-board prices - and not even a half-melted ice cube in sight! Why can't the CAA set some basic standards and sort Ryanair out once and for all? We know the fares are cheap, but that shouldn't be an excuse for trying to bamboozle people. And certainly a price cap is needed for printing boarding passes at the airport. The flight back was in complete contrast: well-dressed cabin crew, girls made up immaculately, good piloting and on-time landing. Needless to say, this time I didn't try to buy anything on board.

An interesting phenomenon of the new wing form was that the vapour trail formed much nearer the trailing edge and was observable from row 28. Outbound was on time but return was delayed 30 minutes due to a combination of Stansted passenger delays and a strong head wind giving a rather lumpy ride on an older aircraft.

The outbound flight was early in the day however was ideal as you got an extra day in Barcelona. Return flight again was ideal, as you got home at a reasonable time. I booked extra leg room seats, 2D was my seat for both flights. With that you got priority boarding. Extra legroom was excellent, I'm 5'11 with back problems and I found this seat comfy and could straighten my leg out full with passengers who sit in 2D/E can get past me without hassling me. So I recommend anyone flying with RyanAir to do this! I would like a bit more cushion for your bottom. Priority boarding is good, as you don't wait in the normal queue, however its annoying when you are boarded first, and everyone is trying to get past you to get to their seat, and are hitting you with their bags etc. However great for you when you land, you are off first. One thing on the baggage, is on the Ryanair website they sound like they are strict with the baggage allowance. I noticed many people having 'bigger' bags getting on the plane okay, no questions asked. Thought that was a bit unfair considering I had cabin bag size. Mobile boarding, love it!  However I would like Ryanair to do what easyJet do, and alert you of the gate via your phone. Anyway, I would fly again with Ryanair, always on time, never late, cheap, and very good!!

That added more delay and resulted in a slot loss and in a 30-minute-delayed departure, that could problably had been partially avoided with a better coordination. The flight time was shorter than scheduled, so that we catched up the delay and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule. The onboard experience was good and being asked to move to a vacant seat in the emergency exit row gave some rest to my long legs. Awesome, isn't it? Negative score to the bar service: the food products we selected were unavailable and that was a pity. I don't mind having a snack or to dine on board instead of doing it at the airport, but with no guarantees about the products available, I'll start to consider the airport bars when flying with Ryanair.

Boeing 737,Economy Class,3.0,January 2017,nan,2.0,nan,yes,London to Cologne,3.0, |  Ryanair provided exactly what I was expecting for the price paid flying from London to Cologne. Check in was fine as this is done via their app but boarding was late as always and the ground staff predictable indifferent. Once on board the seats were bearable with only a small amount of leg room. If I were over 6ft then it would be uncomfortable. Cabin crew are okay but spend the most part finding places for people's bags as they continually fail to impose size or weight restriction at the gate given the bags people bring on board. The flight was late arriving but nothing to severe and disembarking was a breeze with front ant back doors used.

I also felt that the policy of trying to sell you food, drink and lottery tickets on every minute of the flight had been changed. You are limited on leg space but that is true of all budget airlines. The plane could have done with a more thorough clean between flights.

There were various other annoyances (not enough space for carry-ons, gate information not available until right before boarding was supposed to begin, etc).

The flight out was excellent the flight crew provided really good service, were polite and very friendly. The return flight was delayed due to a medical emergency flying to Venice, where the flight had to make an emergency landing on the way out to pick us up. The flight finally arrived with less than 30 minutes to spare before the airport closed, they managed to turn the flight around in around 25 minutes which was remarkable, all the crew deserve a big thank you from all the passengers, and the company, again the flight crew were really friendly, and attentive even though they were obviously upset by the medical emergency.

nan,Economy Class,nan,August 2016,nan,1.0,nan,no,Bristol to Dublin,nan," |  I've had bad experiences with Ryanair before, as it's just part of travelling economy with them most of the time. I purchased a flight that I immediately tried to check in on. However, I found I'd lost my passport. That's fine, I'd only booked the ticket 20 mins ago, so thought it would be reasonable to get a refund. They don't give one. So I want to change my flight, that's okay within 24 hours. There's a £5 charge anyway, but that's okay. Except that Ryanair won't allow you to upgrade the next flight to match to price of your existing one, forcing you to undercut your ticket price and lose money. Ryanair don't refund this money back to you, won't allow you to use this money as credit on other flights or services and don't allow you to add options to your new flight, like additional baggage, ect. The customer service advisers I spoke to were awful, none of them made any suggestions or offered help, but continually spammed the same response about terms and conditions over and over. So I find that I can fly to Ireland without a Passport anyway, since I'm flying from the UK. I can use my driving license. Except you can't with Ryanair. You can with other airlines, but not Ryanair. So pretty much in every way, Ryanair have made this mistake as costly for me as possible. While I appreciate I made a mistake in that I should have made sure I had my passport to hand before I booked, the inflexibility, none existent customer services and just all around terrible service I received have made me decide to avoid this airline in the future.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I normally fly with my partner and our seats are always placed side by side without us paying extra. Lately it seems they are in such desperate need for money that's they are splitting up family members in order to get them to pay the seat selection fee. This is dangerous in case of emergency.

I assumed at the start of the hire that this was for the fuel and would be refunded when I returned the car fully fuelled. Apparently this is an extra charge to avoid ""administration"" fees should you return the car partly fuelled. You still have to pay for the used fuel. As far as I'm concerned it's a scam I thought I'd covered all the scams hire car company's use. I photograph the car damage before the hire started and the return.

As a consequence we were allocated random seats. The craziest thing is my wife found herself sitting in the middle seat between a husband and wife who were also allocated random seat numbers. Anyway, we got our revenge by frequently wandering up and down the plane to speak, thereby causing delays to the cabin trolley service.

She spoke to us as if we were stupid and just kept repeating ""1 each,"" even though we had already explained multiple times! Seems ridiculous that the system could generate my documents with accurate information but couldn't do the same for hers? It reeks of a huge scam to get customers to pay more, even if they've already paid for extra baggage allowance. Boarding at the gate was entirely disorganised and messy, and the staff kept forcing passengers to prove that their carry on luggage was within the restricted size, only to tell them that their bags would have to be checked because the cabin was full. The staff in general were extremely rude and kept yelling at people to get out of the business class waiting area, even though there weren't any signs properly demarcating the place.

Me and my sister paid for allocated seating going and coming back from Bristol to Malaga which cost us £20 in total, which we didn't mind because we knew we'd be sat next to each other. Once we sat down we found it quite disrespectful to see passengers moving their loved ones next to the empty seats next to them and the crew allowing them to do so, and it wasn't just the one it was several. The flight finally departed and we was in the air ten minutes in a cabin crew member came up to us and asked if we would be separated for the flight for a lady that wasn't very well, when I explained that we had paid for these seats and many others hadn't but moved her response was roll of the eyes and stormed off.

Since I went for the low price I didn't want to add any extras, so no reserved seat. It's irritating how Ryanair keeps pushing you to buy a seat 'or maybe you won't sit together'. On the outbound flight the computer put as together at an A and B-seat but on our way back we were punished for not buying our seats: my wife and I were seperated about 15 rows and put both in a B-seat. Why is a mystery since there were enough seats next to each other and the cabin crew allowed me to join my wife. I would suggest that Ryanair stops this mocking of passengers. Apart from that: a flawless, efficient flight with not too friendly crews, but it gets you form A to B for a really low price,,so in that regard they keep their promise.

Ryanair’s recent charm offensive seems to have gone in reverse given the way seats are arbitrarily allocated at check in, unless you pay to choose your own. My wife and I were given middle seats in two different rows whilst both the seats adjacent to us were unoccupied. Bizarre!!

This now goes beyond cheeky and is into the realm of despicable behaviour. Seats have always been filled on a first come, first served basis until now, so it is clear that this is done on purpose so as to generate more profit. But do you know what? This profit is not going to be coming from me, as I vow never to fly Ryanair again. I am a very regular flyer who tends to sway towards budget airlines, so EasyJet will be seeing much more business from me in future (unless they try the same filthy trick as Ryanair).

Boeing 737,Economy Class,5.0,July 2017,3.0,3.0,1.0,yes,Rome to Stansted,2.0," |  Rome to Stansted. The flight was fair and reasonable. Firstly, I booked on the basis of cost and secondly on their flight schedule. The equivalent flight on BA at similar times was much more expensive. They charge for drinks and snacks but it was not a rip off. Flight attendants were polite and presentable. Seating felt a bit cramped but it was a 737. Flight out landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule but the return was delayed 45 minutes at the gate at Rome Ciampino. This is a small busy airport consisting of one terminal and one runway, which I would now try avoid at peak times. In summary, I would fly with Ryanair again and its worth checking out your flight schedule options from different UK airports to your chosen destination, with Stanstead being their main hub.",Couple Leisure,5.0,1.0

However the trip to Alicante from Manchester was a surprise. It was a newish plane with comfortable seating not reserved and reasonable legroom for a six footer +. Staf were friendly and not at all pushy as I had been led to believe. In all a pleasurable flight. Return however was different as it was an older type plane and although we had prepaid for seats on the return leg, they were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. They reminded me of the old ""cattle class"" seats when airlines didn't consider the customers just got as many on board as possible. I couldn't put the tray table down level as it was balanced on my chest! Staff were good again and friendly. If I book again I would need to know which type of aircraft it was before making a booking.

They are making you wait for a bus to take you to the plane. Now my experience might not be typical but the wait was quite long during which time a second queue formed alongside the original. When the bus finally came the priority boarders were slowed down by those that required assistance and the second queue piled on. I would like to point-out that I did not pay for priority boarding however I managed to get behind them in the first queue.

They come across as a low cost airline but they make up for it in as many ways as possible. If you want checked baggage it is an addition a fee of approx €35 each way for a 15kg bag! If you don't have a boarding pass before arriving to the airport they will charge €50 to print each one and their latest trick is to try and get people to pay for their desired seat allocation. If you don't want to pay for your seat allocation they will purposely split you up, myself and my partner were about 10 rows apart on our way to Palermo and back from Dublin. We know there were many others in the same situation including families with children. On my return flight I even had a free seat next to me. Seats don't recline on the planes and there are zero complimentary refreshments including basics like water. If you're flying from Ireland, just pay slightly more to fly Aer Lingus as at least with them, what you see is what you get.

Seats apart if you don't pay Ryanair's fee, and forget luggage in the cabin unless you pay for priority boarding. And this is the second time they ruined a holiday for us - first time they simply stopped flying to our destination from the airport we had booked to fly from, costing me car parking charges and hassle of arranging an alternative holiday not in term time; second time they lost us the first day of our holiday by putting back the departure time by 6 hours - a useful ploy to get them around the three hour delay EU compensation rules.

Pretty scruffy aircraft, obviously the late arrival in Poitiers left insufficient time for a thorough clean. Aisle seats are not great given the constant movement of trolleys and the inevitable knocks to arms and legs. Random Seat Allocation - This term is somewhat of a misnomer. The only way it is random is that if you don’t pay to select a seat before travel you will certainly be allocated seats away from others on your booking. BA despite their recent demise usually have the sense to allocate passengers on the same booking adjacent seats. On this flight we were seated just 15 rows apart. From the comments of other passengers and on social media, this really must be considered an ‘own goal’ by the airline. Surely it would be better to increase lead in prices a little and get rid of this ridiculous policy and stop antagonising numerous passengers. Until the last couple of months I had been increasingly impressed by Ryanair’s more customer focussed attempts. In future I will travel with another carrier wherever possible. Hopefully, the ‘bean counters’ at the airline will revert this ridiculous policy

We have flown with the best, Etihad, Cathay, Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. We have also flown with many budget airlines around the world. We can now say we have flown with what must be, the worst airline on earth. We were in the middle of a cruise with no internet. We docked at Ibiza and went for a coffee. Whilst there we got internet access and received an email from Ryanair saying if we didn't check in, we could be charged $50 Euro each. To our disbelif, we tried to check in online but at the final stage, we were kicked out of the website. We tried several times. At that time there was a global virus effecting everywhere and our search engine Google was not allowing us to access many websites. We were in the Ryanair website but could not complete the check-in. We eventually gave up and decided to try later. Our next stop was Palma where we departed the ship. As we did not have internet access, we decided to get to the airport early so we could hopefully complete check-in well before the 2 hour window Ryanair gives. We arrived at Palma airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We waiting in the check-in queue for around 25 minutes. When we finally were called we explained to the check-in lady that we could not check-in as their website wold not let us complete the checkin the day before. She then went out of her way to try and check us in on our mobile phone. She gave us the thumbs up, but then she must have had the same problem. She tried again but could not check us in on our phone. With 8 minutes before the the 2 hour window, she gave up and said sorry you have 8 minutes good luck. We tried but could not check in on time. Then we went back to the check-in counter and the lady gave us a docket to go to the service counter to pay the $100 Euro ($50 x 2). We walked to the service counter and stood in line for another 15 minutes. We paid $100 Euro because we had no option. When we originally booked this flight, we had other options and wow didn't we regret flying this airline. Whilst waiting in the check-in queue and the service counter queue we heard complaint after complaint about the service/procedures. When we boarded the plane, we saw the seats and could not believe our eyes. The tightest seating I have ever seen, including all the Asian airlines. Scattered crumbs, loose hair and rubbish on just about every seat. I brushed the food off our seat and then thought to take a photo. I wished I took the photo before? When you view the seat photo, the yellow is the head rest of the seat in front. This will show how tight the seats are. The plane looked dirty. As we sat down we heard a lady with a British accent discuss the lack of baggage storage. She had a small bag. The Ryanair stewardess said ""bad luck, take your seat"". The lady passenger yelled ""Typical Ryanair"" The photos attached show the condition of the plane. The seating stunk, worn leather. So on top of an extra $100 Euro we flew the longest hour of our lives and were counting the seconds to get off. Thankfully there were no more dramas after we landed. Do not fly this airline. The response from Ryanair was a standard reply and we could tell they did not read our email. Now we can brag about the best airlines and the absolute worst - Ryanair.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Memmingen to Dublin,5.0," |  Memmingen to Dublin. My boyfriend bought me 200 euros worth of Ryanair flight vouchers for my birthday last year. When I tried to use them to purchase a flight, they wouldn't work. I spent hours and a couple of days with customer service trying to get them to work. Over time, flight prices go up, and they were not offering any solutions. They kept blaming my browser, although I had tried it on various computers, phones, and browsers. Ryanair refused to refund the gift vouchers that didn't work and they refused to book the flight for me. Finally, their solution was for me to purchase the flight with my own debit card and then they would refund the money. I did this, and I did not receive a refund until a month later after having to contact them multiple times to get the refund. In the end they did not refund the full price paid with my debit card. The flight I purchased was less than the balance on my gift vouchers, so I should have gotten new vouchers with the remaining balance according to the terms of the gift vouchers. But, the gift vouchers expired during the time it took them to refund my money, so I guess that money is just lost. I have filed a another claim to try to request the full amount be refunded to my debit card and to receive the remaining balance on new gift vouchers, but after the experience I have had with them, I do not expect to ever see it.

We bought the tickets several months in advance. Forty-eight hours before the flight I got an email saying that we had to pre-check-in to avoid a 50 Euro additional charge. I used my cell phone to go online and do this, but when I got to the website I went as far as I could with the pre-check-in and thought it was done. I clicked on every button that seemed to advance me to the next part and then came to the end. When we got in line to check in we were told to go to another line where we learned that the pre-check-in never went through, so we had to pay an additional 50 Euros for each ticket. There were also others in the same line who had the same experience. When we finished the trip I wrote to Ryan Air about it and got back a curt letter saying there was nothing wrong with their website, and that they would not reimburse us. I think this is just a super-sneaky way of getting more money out of some customers. So beware!",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

My carry on was less than 2 kilos. I made it fit and guess what - they didn't have any space in the plane so I had to put it with the checks bags anyways. Ridiculous.

Boeing 738,Economy Class,5.0,August 2017,nan,4.0,nan,yes,London Stansted to Sofia,4.0," |  My longest Ryanair sector so far, considering I have flown many times with them before. If you play by the rules, and do as they say you get a cheap flight that's usually comfortable and on time. Using Stansted for this, the gate was far away from the terminal which is fine. Having bought priority boarding, I was one of the first to board but somehow that doesn't matter, just be at the front of the regular queue and you'll save a few quid in the process. Only 90 carry on's can be placed in the overhead locker so I asked for mine to be placed in the hold, gate staff are more often than not happy to assist in that matter when they are asked. Bag tag goes on and I left my suitcase with a baggage handler. Onboard the aircraft was with the old Ryanair cabin on one of their oldest Boeing 737-800 although, she didn't look it. The majority of the Ryanair fleet have the older, more padded seats in a 189Y configuration so good if you're a little larger, like myself. The newer in the fleet with the Boeing Sky Interior have the lighter-weight seating which has far less padding but more legspace although I cannot vouch for that. The seat was comfortable and legspace was okay although another inch would of been beneficial for all 6"" of me. Crew attentive as always passing through the cabin twice on this three hour flight providing a refreshments service which I find to be overpriced so buy before hand in the airport where you'll save money. Crew also passed through the cabin with some perfumes, electronic items and the famous Ryanair scratchcard. Onboard was rather warm but the flight was near enough full so that's to be expected. A comfortable crossing. A smooth landing into Sofia and we parked on a remote stand. Bussed to the terminal on a sweltering old bus into Terminal 2, the better of the two terminals. Ryanair being one of the few low cost carriers to use Terminal 2. Passport control was smooth with border police just visually checking my passport while there was a short delay with getting my bag on the carousel. Returning was a similar affair. The gate staff at Sofia look for oversize bags at the gate so please be warned in carrying oversized bags not to the restrictions. They were also checking for oversized second carry on bags too. I asked for my suitcase to be placed in the hold which the obliged. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to a delay with the inbound aircraft; something that does happen from time to time with the last flights of the day with Ryanair. I slept for most of the flight home onboard a full flight. Air-conditioning was on although it was rather warm onboard and I slept comfortably for such a small space. A quick left hand turn onto short finals ensured a smooth landing into London Stansted. Parked on a remote stand again and was bussed on an old London bendy bus to the terminal where my bag was waiting on the carousel. If you do as your told and play by the rules, you will get a cheap flight. Book ahead in advance and it will be cheap too. If wanting to travel with luggage, the daily BA offering from London Heathrow might be a cheaper option when travel to airport costs are included.

The plane was too hot, with the air above our heads barely blowing. The seats and floor were dirty, with the seat next to my husband covered in melted chocolate. We were so far apart from each other we couldn't see any other member of our family, even though my children are not yet 18. They are deliberately splitting people up if they refuse to pay the extra to choose seats. So if you leave it to chance you will be guaranteed to sit apart.

Crew were great under a very good cabin supervisor who was Polish and I felt sorry for him as people would not take their seats. A lot of angry passengers from what I heard with what appears to be the policy of people getting separated under the automatic seat selection process, but if you area paying a low fare why not pay the the extra £4 or £5 to sit together? It's not the end of the world. Cabin service was good, they went around plenty of times with the trolley, as this was Agadir they were also selling alchohol at very reasonable prices.

Never again! There's always a problem. It is not worth save the extra £50+. Food is awful, just eat before. Seats terrible, small and uncomfortable.

They never have any staff on duty to help or book you in on time and the ones they do, genuinely couldn't care less about you and your journey. Shocking customer service. On the outbound flight I arrived 2 hour and 10 mins early and queued in line (after checking in online the day before) to check my bag. They had only a few members of staff and failed to book us all onto the flight because of lack of staff. I missed my flight. I then had to queue in the customer service line for 2 hours and the response was awful. I was told I had to pay another £100 to be reboarded three days later. Apparently it was mine and my fellow stranded passengers fault we missed the plane (the plane that left half empty, according to my colleagues who were onboard who didn't have to check the company gear). I had to find and pay for another flight to join my colleagues online for the conference (for which, you will recall, I had the gear). Oh and did I mention that they lost my passport at the outset when they randomly checked it. My return flight was no better even with priority booking (oh yes, don't be fooled that means nothing!) they took my hand luggage away because the flight was full, meaning I couldn't do my work and then the flight was delayed by an hour and 20 mins.

We checked in a day before the flight and it turned out that although we had our seats assigned in two diffrent parts of the airplane, we were seated in extra legroom seats (1, 2 and 16 row) and that was a pleasant surprise. I really despise the Ryanair’s boardnig procedure – the gate opens before even the airplane finishes its previous rotation. It causes a necessity of waiting in the bus which drives you to the aircraft for a long time (up to 15 mins even on a domestic flight). The cabin was not fresh but despite that, it was quite clean. The flight was smooth and everything went without delay. The thing that made me uncomfortable onboard was the air in the cabin – it smelled as if it was really polluted which made me difficult to breathe. What is more, it seemed like the cabin crew‘s only duty was to sell food/scratchcards/duty free products to the ‘customers‘. They didn’t really care about passenger safety and comfort (some safety announcements were only made in Polish). To conclude, I really appreciate the effort, Ryanair puts in providing low fares and on-time flights but still, they should improve some parts of their service.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Significant delays experienced on both legs of our journey - 2 hours on the way out which seriously interfered with our plans, including a very uncomfortable 45 minutes sitting on a packed plane on the runway, and 2.5 hours on the return journey. Updated announcements for both delays were fed out incrementally every 10-15 minutes, when we could clearly see that the plane was still on the tarmac at the other end and had no hope of reaching AMS/ DUB for at least 90 minutes. To top it off, once on board, it was announced that the Captain was ""negotiating with ATC"" but with no success, when in reality the Ryanair aircraft on this route had missed their time slot earlier in the day resulting in each subsequent flight being pushed back. The staff on the return flight looked really weary but were troopers and delivered good service. Aircraft on both legs were untidy with detritus from previous passengers. Thankfully we had paid for priority boarding and seats and so apart from the inconvenience, were somewhat insulated from the full brunt.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

We had delays both sides, the cabin staff wouldn't take litter off anyone until the end of the flight. I know not all airlines provide complimentary food but I think £13 is ridiculous for a rubbish toasty and a water. It was 4.5 hour flight that was delayed you would think there would be something.

I saw the same bag inside the airplane with no ""oversized"" ticket on them.

However, planning a last minute trip to Barcelona with other low cost airlines proved tricky due to flight times so I bit the bullet and booked with Ryanair. I shouldn't have worried as I really couldn't fault the airline. My boyfriend and I flew out of Liverpool to Barcelona and home again, with great ease. Boarding was simple, as we downloaded our boarding passes to our phones (as we always do whenever we fly, so much easier!). We didn't have luggage to check in so can't comment on that but sailed through boarding easily and were delayed slightly before take off (20 mins or so) once on the plane but it's August summer holidays so to be expected! Staff were all super friendly and very quick coming round with the food and drinks trolley. Yes the food and drinks are expensive in general, and in comparison to other airlines. However, if you have a massive problem with the prices they charge then bring your own food on or just wait until you reach the airport at the other end to eat. Seats are not super comfortable or luxurious but they're decent enough for a short haul flight, and you get what you pay for. Overall would definitely fly with them again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The worst thing is the fact we have a 4 year old boy with us who obviously wants to be sat next to his mum they've gave him a seat one side of the isle and his mum a seat the other side.

The only issue was boarding, it was pouring rain and we were sent out to board the aircraft and reached the aircraft steps to find the crew were not ready and were sent back into the terminal and just as we reached terminal door we were turned around again to board, got soaked in the process. The on board crew were actually very nice and it was a training flight with additional cabin crew members. Purchased three new ""breakfast burrito"" on board and in fairness it was lovely, aircraft was ""well worn"" and not the cleanest but short hop it was fine.

Ultimately, I had to buy another transfer directly from the bus company, which was cheaper anyway. I asked for a refund. They are giving me a transfer credit for one year. The likelihood of using it is very low. They know this I'm sure. Why would they allow a customer to buy a transfer that cannot be confirmed?

nan,Economy Class,3.0,September 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Glasgow to Dublin,2.0," |  Glasgow to Dublin. Absolutely horrifically awful. We got some warnings on this airline, and I wish I had heeded them. It's true that they have the best price initially, but they have so many hidden costs it's obscene and I really feel strongly that a reputable airline is the way to go. I will never fly with Ryanair again. The staff member we met to check in was the rudest person I had ever dealt with in customer service - I don't even know how to describe it, the whole interaction left me in a very sour mood - she informed us that because we had not done the online checkin two hours before our flight (we were standing in front her 1 hour and 45 minutes before our flight, without exaggeration), we now had to pay £100 to have her check us in. This was more than both our tickets combined. It was 6:30 in the morning, and we were the only ones there. I couldn't believe it. The next lady we spoke to who was charging us this fee advised that we had 'checked our email wrong' since there should have been a reminder (there wasn't- I went back and checked, even the junk box). The booking email does mention this fee at the end of the page. If this airline wants to save money by limiting staff and doing things online, I support that - but I should have still been able to check in myself then at that time - to cut off the online checkin 2 hours before and charge a ridiculous fee at that time is just shady, wrong and I felt so angry. They already have additional costs for everything - we had paid to check our bags, and we had paid extra for 'priority' seating so our seats were already reserved - so why would we check in??? So angry and disappointed. The worst part is, this airline clearly does not care about what their customers think, and that makes the customer totally powerless to ensure that the service they're receiving is fair, and this case it's not. I hope this airline does not continue to be supported, and I reiterate my strong recommendation to go with another airline.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

I chose a flight for 86 Euro round trip, and ended up paying 170 Euros. A registred baggage of 15 kg now costs 35 Euro (compared to 15 not so much time ago), if you want to sit near a person you travel together with you have to pay (previously persons checking in together were placed beside each others). Even web check-in is not free if you do it more than 4 days before the trip (previously it was).

I chosed a round trip for 86 Euro, and, at the end, the final price was 170 Euro, having to pay 35 Euro for registered baggage of 15 kg and for doing the web check-in. 2) Badly organized website. I filled in ""billing address"" section when I made the ticket, thus expecting to get an invoce, only to discover later that Ryanair does not issue invoices for international flights without VAT - something there was no notice about. This caused me a lot of problems. 3) Badly handled customer care. I contacted them via live chat to solve problem listed under number 2 and I was promptly dismissed. I could email them, I was told.

There was plenty space for many other bags in the cabin - strange procedure. Outbound flight staff were rude. Didn’t smile. Were not polite and too busy flirting and handing out their number to a group of lads rather than dealing with their other customers. Money making scam! We would have had to pay a further £27pp on both outbound and inbound to sit together. Inbound flight I was row 31 (very back) and my boyfriend was row 3 (front). What would happen if there was a potential emergency? All you would want is to be close to your loved ones or the people you have come away with.

Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,October 2017,nan,4.0,nan,no,Manchester to Palma,2.0," | I booked the flights with Ryanair months ago on the basis of price and appropriate dates, only to have the goalposts moved later, so that I needed to pay for seats in order to ensure that my wife and I sat together. Later still, the cancellation farrago threw the whole holiday into doubt until Ryanair was forced to publish the lists of flights affected and we learned that our flights were still on. Then the day before we flew we received an email warning of a ban on carrying alcohol into the cabin and telling us what would happen to any alcohol bought in the ""duty-free"" shops. This did not affect us directly as we never buy any ""duty-free"" but we did wonder whether the flight was going to be full of hen and stag parties. By then, any faith we might have had in Ryanair was pretty well dispelled and we had no high hopes of the flights themselves. In the event everything went fairly smoothly. Boarding for the outward flight was handled efficiently by a single agent while the cabin crew were both pleasant and hardworking. The cabin manager, in particular, carried out her duties very responsibly (for example, not starting the safety demonstration until she was sure that she had the attention of practically everyone on board) but with good humour. There was some changing of seats before we departed, but we were only a few minutes late rolling back. We arrived early (cue the awful triumphal blast) after an uneventful journey. For the return flight, boarding was slightly delayed though it did not impact upon our actual departure time. The cabin crew again worked hard but it was difficult to hear any of their announcements, due to the speed with which they were made plus the conversation level within the cabin. The actual flight was equally uneventful and we arrived marginally early, so we had the trumpet blast again, which this time was greeted by ironic cheers. After all the various alarms beforehand, therefore, we made it there and back without any real bother, but my wife and I have still decided that we will do our best to avoid Ryanair in the future. How can you trust a company that changes the rules after you have booked, yet denies it has done so, or cancels flights on a whim and tries to wriggle out of any of the consequences? My overall rating here therefore balances out the pluses of the actual flights against the minuses of the doubts and uncertainties beforehand.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

After going through the booking system online and reading some of the reviews online we were not looking forward to the flight. The booking system is quite obviously setup to seat people as far apart as possible so the priority seating charge can be applied to sit together, this method leaves you with a feeling of being ripped off, a fact born out in most reviews we read. I personally would prefer the £3 to be automatically applied to the fare with an option to be randomly seated for £3 less, this would leave you feeling you had a bargain instead and cut down complaints and as most people prefer to travel together the airline would probably make more from it and everyone would be happy. We recieved 3 reminder emails from ryanair prompting us to check in online and avoid the airport checkin charge which was good. We were pleasantly surprised by the flights, both journeys were on time and even landed ahead of schedule. The planes were clean and looked new and the staff were proffessional and curtious. At dublin after dropping our hire car we underestimated the time it would take to get through security as it was very busy and by the time we got through our gate was closed. After a mad run the full length of terminal 1 we got to the gate 10 minutes before take off with the gate deserted. However after jumping up and down and waving to the pilots who we could see through the windows, he instructed one of the ground crew to come and get us and bring us to the plane, cant thank him enough.

Their staff was one of the most uncooperative and unprofessional I have come across, I very politely confronted one of their staff member regarding the luggage cost, and her response was ""do you want your bags shipped or not?"". I personally found it extremely shocking and disappointing. ",Business,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,5.0,September 2017,3.0,3.0,1.0,no,Liverpool to Prague,2.0," |  Liverpool to Prague. Booked with Ryanair despite all the recent bad publicity and were lucky to not have our flights cancelled. Thought we had paid for seats next to each other on the flight out but the transaction mustn't have completed as I ended up in seat 8d and my husband was sat in 32d. Rather a dramatic difference, but then I suppose that is how they rinse you of more money! I'd come to terms with not taking a suitcase for a whopping £80 return, so I had squashed my stuff into a little hand suitcase and was happy with the fact you had no waiting time at the other end for your case. Unfortunately, as we got to the gate to board the plane, I was told my little case was to go into the hold for free as there were now more than 90 passengers with hand luggage! But it didn't get whisked off by a memeber of staff, oh no, I had to carry it down the steps, and put the thing on the suitcase truck myself! Once aboard the plane and once we realised that our seats were at the other end of the plane, I sat down in my seat and crossed my fingers for a good flight out in between all the stag and hen dos shouting to one another as none of them were sat next to each other either! Makes sense that doesn't it! So we set off on time and the cabin crew have to ask 4 times for everyone to shut up while they carry out the safety demonstration. Four times they got ignored! Throughout the flight, the toilet queue was always 10 people deep, the cabin crew were abused left right and centre by the passengers but eventually we landed safely. Peeved that I had to the stand in another queue waiting for my suitcase, having purposely not spend £80 for the pleasure of not having to wait for it, we stood waiting for 10mins to pick it up. The flight home was much quieter, much smoother and minus so many hen and stags. We paid the extra £4.08 for my husband to sit in front of me and someone kindly offered to swap so we could sit together. I was able to take my little case on board and we all made it home in one piece. I am grateful that our flight wasn't cancelled and I appreciate that the unpleasant flight out was due to the passengers and not the staff. However, I will not be flying with Ryanair again.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

When I did the check in online I couldn't select my own seat as I used to be able to do even though there was a free seat next to me. I had to pay extra just to sit next to my friend.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,October 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Alicante to Kaunas ,4.0," |  My two friends and I were very unlucky to fly with Ryanair during the mass strike in France this October. We were supposed to fly from Alicante to Kaunas on the 10th of October, but when we arrived to the airport it appeared that our flight was delayed. We waited for ages, then they put us to the plane, where we waited further. Then they returned us back to the airport and said that our flight was canceled due to the strike in France. Not delayed but canceled! Now we only had the option of getting back our money (which was ridiculous, since with this little money we could not possibly buy a flight with another company) or waiting while Ryanair offers us something else. We chose the last variant since we are pensioners and don't have spare money, and we especially chose Ryanair because they offer the lowest prices. We stood in the biggest queue for the whole night! Thank goodness there were 3 of us and we could substitute one another. Throughout the night Ryanair never offered us even a bottle of water! When it was finally our turn to apply for a change of flight, Ryanair offered us a flight for the 18th October! They were only were willing to pay for one night's stay for us (and this chance had already passed since that was the night we spent in the queue). How we were supposed to live until the 18th October in a foreign country apparently did not concern them. Since we needed to go to Kaunas (Lithuania) we finally managed to board a plane going to Poznan (Poland) which was the closest destination to Kaunas and flew with it. I must say that Ryanair behaved so unprofessionally through the whole situation. Not to offer water to the passengers was the last drop really. I doubt I will ever use this low-cost company again, thank goodness there are other options these days.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I booked a flight with Ryanair to go see my girlfriend, within 10 seconds of paying for my flight I realised I booked the wrong date. At this point I had just paid £75 for a flight I didn't need, thinking I might be able to change flights, I called Ryanair and asked for my flight to be changed. I called and spoke to a lovely girl and great at customer handling, I asked if she could change my flight so that I could fly the weekend before the week I booked. She looked at the flights and said as I'm in the 24 hour period I wont be charged, Great, she did say that the flights I booked totalled £66 so I would be losing out on £9, a bit annoying but not end of the world. How wrong was I, apparently Ryanair have a policy that if you need to re-book the flight, you will get charged or not is not done on the total cost of the flights, but on the individual costings of each flight and compared with the flight you originally booked. So I looked at the flights and yes my flight there was in fact more expensive than the flight there for thew following weekend, then I look at the flight back and the new flight back is £25 more expensive, so I now not only lost £10 on the total cost change going from my original flight to the new flight I have now lost another £25 because I want to change the flight. So Ryanair have now got an extra £30 out of my 10 second mishap, one mistake I shall never make again, I will never fly with Ryanair again.  Ryanair are stingy when it comes to releasing cash, they have changed flight times for 3+ flight of mine in the past.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,July 2017,nan,2.0,nan,yes,Glasgow to Sofia,2.0," |  Glasgow to Sofia. My flight was delayed for 3hrs, I was stuck at the airport and waited. By the time I got to my destination, Sofia it was past midnight. Metro has stopped running, the only way to get into the city centre was via taxi. Since I’m a budget traveler, I didn’t want to waste money on the taxi, so I decided to sleep at the airport and wasted the money for the night of hostel I booked. A day or 2 after, I got an email about flight delays, and only just found out that there was an EU law that any flight delays for 3 hrs and more, the customer is entitled to a claim. I immediately submitted the claim. About a week later, Ryanair rejected my claim, saying my delay was under 3 hrs! Well, the flight was delayed 3 hrs exactly, we didn’t board until 3 hrs later, but it could have landed less than 3 hrs later, which I wouldn’t know, because I didn’t check the exact time I landed, it could be about 2hr 50min later than expected in Sofia. Ryanair also said, any flights that are delayed more than 1.5hr, customers are entitled to claim back expenses during the wait at the airport, providing receipts are provided. At the same time, they closed my case. I took this as a complaint, I asked for the exact time it landed in Sofia; asked for the reason of the delay; explained due to the delay, I lost a night at the hostel, and had to explain to them that I had to sleep at the airport; and why no one informed us there would be spending expenses for delays over 1.5hr?  When I got a reply from Ryanair, the staff was not even answering any of my questions, he just repeated the same thing as the first person said, told me to submit any receipts. Also that the flight was delayed for less than 3 hrs, so I was entitled to the 3hr+ claim. I tried again, explaining this further, but once again, it was no use. They were not doing anything about it. I just wanted to warn anyone flying around Europe, if there’re any delays, make sure you check the time, and make a record of it if possible. You can always get it from the website afterwards and save a record for it, if you need any claims. If it’s delayed for less than 3 hrs, check the airline’s policy and see what you’re entitled to. Because obviously they would not just tell you the freebies you could be entitled to, to save their cost! Anyway, Ryanair service is bad, all the emails I had with them back and forth, they were terrible. A different staff reply to my email every time, just repeating the same things over and over again, and not answering to my questions.

A few days ago, I received an email saying that I had to ""check in"" for my flight online, a flight that was supposedly ""cancelled"". I talked to support for almost an hour, and they're still talking to me while I type this review because they're claiming that after the booking was ""cancelled"" they tried my card several more times until it was successful. Now that would have been perfectly fine if I was told that my card was continuously being tried as the payment method; or I was told when my card worked and that I would have been charged the money. In either of those cases I would not have spent more money in order to buy a new ticket from a different airline. Support also claimed that they have ""no cancellation policy"" - which is not even the situation right now. I'm only looking for a refund on the ticket that was presumably ""cancelled"" which still charged my credit card - which they say they ""cannot do anything about"". I know the price is very appealing to people, that's why I decided to give them a chance, however I can say clearly now that they aren't worth it.

Everything went well. The flight was on time departing and arrived 10 minutes early. Ground staff and flight crew were all charming. Flight almost full and several cabin bags ended up in the hold, but all passengers affected seemed to be content about the arrangement as they did not have to pay extra. Most noticeable that several passengers also brought more than their cabin bag allowance on board, both in number of bags and in the size of some of them. Some bags removed to the hold were too large for the overhead lockers. I have never yet had any problems with Ryanair, their service or their website. I have always found the website clear and easy to use, and I am not very computer literate. I have used this route with Ryanair ever since it started operating from Stansted to Carcassonne many years ago, and on only two occasions has anything gone wrong, and on both occasions, the weather caused diversion to another local airport. In both cases, busses were laid on within an hour to ferry passengers between the two airports.

You get the feeling like they are strict only about matters that are in Ryanair's interest, such as those that translate into revenues, because the oversize fee wasn't exactly ""lowcost"" - it was almost the same price as the flight. All luggage costs in total were the same as what I paid for the flight, so i paid double. So much for lowcost. I felt ripped off and also felt the underlying greedy vibe of a company that only uses the ""lowcost"" label as a means to market and boost their brand. The only thing low about this company is friendliness, legroom.

The airline has yet to be on time for flights, and for this trip was delayed both ways significantly. (An hour sitting on the flight to Dublin and already 20 mins to Budapest.) The attendants are rude and unhelpful and do not provide any useful information. For example, telling the cabin the delay is from a attendant who was going home because he's sick instead of the reality that he never showed up, which is what was said earlier. It wasn't that only instance where the staff acted errantly. On the way back to Budapest my fiance and I got belligerently approached by a staff member who demanded to know why our ""Visa Check"" had not been completed and that she didn't have time to check it herself. (Even though we've been waiting in the delayed priority line for the plane for 20 mins). I tried to explain to her that the staff we dropped our luggage off with said we had nothing else to do but go to security. Finally, the website also needs to have a better system of checks when offering other services, like car rental. My fiance and I rented and paid for a car in Dublin, knowing that an extra fee is often charged to people under 25. The site gave no indication that this wasn't taken in account for, or that there was an issue with our rental. When we showed up the company would not give us a car, and did not offer us a way to contact the airline for a refund.

The DVLA Web site was not available when I attempted to collect the car. So, the car rental required an additional £15.00 in order to use a Premium Help Line and get the passcode. Last, but not least, they asked me to sign a clause granting the rental car company to charge my credit/debit card of any fee, fines, even if I was not present.

As I checked in the agent handed me back my boarding pass and travel documents but kept my passport by mistake. By the time I realized it was missing, I was at the gate but with 40mins to spare till the flight went. I though a simple phone call to the check in agent would solve the issue. First there was no signs of any Ryanair staff at the gate. Only Swissport agents who could not care less about my issue. I had to insist for them to ring the check in desk. The agent acknowledged they had my passport. However they would not bring it back to me. I had to go get it myself. The gate being the furthest away meant a 20 min run both way. In short there was no way I could exit security and return to the gate on time to catch my flight. I asked them if they could wait for me for a few extra minutes rather than offloading my bags. Their answer was no, and the gate will be closing soon too. Any airline who respect their passengers would have had the passport rushed to the gate on time by one of their staff. Especially so since it was the check in staff fault.  As a result I ended up missing my flight and best of all I had to pay a re-booking fee of 100 pounds, even though it was the check in staff fault. I also had to book a room at the airport hotel which cost me another 100 pounds. I did wrote to Ryanair about the issue and other than standards letter of apologies explaining that they can't be held responsible for the agents lack of support they were not prepared to cover any extra cost involved. This is a gross misconduct coming from Ryanair. Ryanair already have a very bad reputation, and this is just adding on to that pile. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The plane landed just 15 minutes before the 3 hours delay which would have entitled us for compensation by European law. On the plane we were never offered any kind of complimentary food or drinks. We were not offered water. The toilet door handle broke during flight which made the front toilet unusable until the refuel landing in Frankfurt. We would've chosen another company if it was possible but they're the only ones flying direct. I will also mention the flight there from Berlin was delayed two hours after boarding.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 737,Economy Class,4.0,December 2017,4.0,3.0,nan,yes,Podgorica to Stockholm,3.0," | Podgorica to Stockholm. This airline doesn't have a very good reputation for service, so expectations were low. But since the route was perfect for me, I still chose it. And I was positively surprised. Having recently flown a major carrier I actually found the Ryanair flight better. Check in is easily done with their mobile app, and it is of course a bit annoying that you have to pay extra to choose your seat. But still a lot better than it used to be when you had to stand in line to get a decent seat. They also have a very good system for cabin luggage. Either you can pay to take it on board, otherwise they only allow a limited number of large cabin bags, the others will be placed in the hold free of charge. This makes boarding much easier, and you can actually find place for your duty free bags and coats in the plane, something that can be almost impossible on other airlines. They now also allow an extra small item, which is far better than they used to be. I was also surprised by the leg room, which was good even for me who is quite tall. Since the seatbacks cannot be reclined you don't end up with someones seatback very close to you. The next surprise was their meal service, where they served good food for low prices. I even manage to find a gluten free meal, which was easy to determine since all items were clearly marked with allergene symbols. The departure was delayed for an hour due to snow in Sweden, and before landing we had to wait more while the runway was cleared from snow. But I found all staff very professional and pleasant. Ryanair used to be an annoying airline with bad passenger service. But while other airlines are constantly deteriorating and copying the low cost airlines I am happy to say that Ryanair is getting better and better. If it wasn't for their annoying habit of seating passengers travelling together apart from each other unless they pay, I would give it a higher mark still.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

While the show the ticket they told me i had to recheck in and while there were 5 min left before the flight was closing the system wouldn't allow me to check in from the app and while I was in the office they told be to pay extra 50 euro because the had to check me in.

I have just checked in for our flight. We really don’t care where we sit on the plane but after checkiing in we selected free allocation and were offered window seats 7F, 23A and 31F they could not have been anymore far apart. When we looked at the seat map we found that next to each allocated seat were two free seats - how ridiculous and mean is this. I can’t have our nine year old sitting at the front of the aircraft in 7F next to a total stranger so we had to pay for one adult to sit next to our son. I believed that it was the law that an airline could not split children up from at least one parent. When your travelling with children and booking a ticket with Ryanair you do have to select if your travelling with children. I believed this was to stop the system splitting a child up from at least one of the parents. The child fare is the same price as an adult with Ryanair so why do you have confirm one of the passengers in the booking will be a child? Ryanair this is extremely tacky, and obviously a money spin to earn more money. Not happy or impressed how you treat families with young children, shame on you.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Thankfully other passengers helped me to get on board. When I was on the return flight home same happened, didn't even bother to ask. At one point my daughter had dropped some pringles which we paid ridiculous amounts for and a passenger stepped on them so I couldn't pick up the little crumbs.  The crew member walked past and picked up the crisps and muttered other passengers have to board this plane too you know. I just thought how rude! And also why do they not clean the aircraft between journeys! It was filthy to start with. Greasy seats and magazines on the floor! Just shows you get what you pay for. If the service was better then it would have been full marks!

We paid 85 euros for a Hamburg to Lisbon (round trip) plus 10 euros for a seat Reservation, which is just ridiculously cheap. One thing that I did not like - and which I haven't experienced when flying Ryanair before - is that the system for the online check-in is splitting up Groups on purpose to make you pay for a reserved seat. However, 5 euros are okay for a seat reservation. The 737-800 was quite new, seats are as usually not too comfortable and food and drinks were not included - which I am not expecting when I am paying such a low fare as I did.

Simple check in, speedy boarding, departure on time, nice crew. Departure and arrival just on time. Clean airplane, not very roomy but that is the B737 fault as those boeing planes are a bit narrow and so elbow room is not the best available.

Check in has been a bad suprise, since the ""random"" seat assignment resulted in 8 people seating in 8 different rows! Before confirming this seat assignement a notice prompted me to pay if I wanted the freedom to choose seats. This is exactly as any other low cost airline promises in theory, since most airlines advertises that you have to pay to choose your seat. Recent experiences on other low cost airlines (easyJet, Wizz Air, Vueling) however resulted in all the people booked together being seated together without any extra cost. For this reason I was surprised to have all of us scattered around the plane. Except this, the flight was good and on time. Seat Comfort is average for low cost. Anyway I feel this ""trying to force"" the extra charge for choosing the seat is a bit rude and out of common low cost market practices.

Not an email, not a text message, I was only informed about it when I was in front of the gate to embark. The delay was of 2 hours which is not refundable but got me into a lot of trouble. I only had one bus to go to from the airport of my arrival to my destination and that bus was scheduled for 1:30h after a normal arrival. Since the flight arrived around 2:30h late, I missed the bus. I couldn't get the bus ticket refunded (20€ to waste) and I had to stay in the airport for 10 hours waiting for the next bus as I was traveling alone and leaving the airport with heavy luggage is not comfortable at all. I was trying to write to Ryanair to at least get some discount on my next flight since the delay was on them but I can't even get in touch with them because they have it in the system that the delay was under 3hrs so by European law it is all okay.",Business,2.0,nan

Asks the stewardess for some water to be told I would have to pay (despite EU regulation and Ryanair website explaining after 2 hours they will feed and hydrate passengers). I was told to get food we would have to go to the terminal except they wouldn't and couldn't open the door.  6 hours later the captain promises that help is on its way in the form of a staircase to take us back inside Stansted but still no sign of a staircase (unless you count the one outside the aircraft gathering snow). 6.5 hours later we depart.

Ryanair seems like a good deal at first but suffers from obnoxious pricing schemes (randomly allocated seating just makes a huge mess at takeoff and serves no logistical purpose besides coercing you into paying an extra 25 Euro per person to sit next to your family) and absolutely terrible customer service that refuses to directly answer the questions you ask them. First they had a mistake on their website when I booked, causing me to pay for unnecessary priority boarding. At the airport we didn't actually get priority booking because a bus took us to the plane which was full of passengers who didn't pay for priority booking and we boarded after them. When I contacted customer service they refuse to acknowledge the initial mistake so I asked them questions about the new baggage policy which they won't answer directly, but simply copy and paste from the website (I can actually read, thanks). When I explained that I didn't even get the priority boarding that I paid for I get another copy and paste about how they are a non-refundable airline. It's impossible to have a dialogue with the customer service team because there's no way to answer on the same thread that you opened, even when I went through their complicated Contact Us menu, and try to update an existing complaint, the system said that the customer service number I've been given is not valid as it is 7 digits instead of 6.

Ryanair, while servicing its customers with prices that are reasonable for flights in nearby countries (such as in my case, when visiting Spain, and flying to Morocco), knows nothing about customer satisfaction or conflict resolution. Aside from experiencing technical difficulties upon departing to Morocco when trying to check-in, my flight prior to and when boarding was equal, and my experience incredibly poor. The flight was announced to be delayed only 30 minutes, when the plane really landed over 2 hours later than scheduled. This caused for me to be stranded at the airport late in the night, as I arranged with my hotel to be picked up from the Marrakesh (RAK) airport, making me feel very unsafe. During the flight, one of the male flight attendants was being very flirtatiously aggressive with two women traveling together that I was sitting next to on the plane. Every time, in passing, the male flight attendant would take the opportunity to engage in unprofessional behavior with one girl in particular. At one point, the two exchanged phone numbers and planned to meet after the flight landed in Marrakesh (RAK), and this event caught the attention of other passengers on the flight. Also, en route, many of the passengers that were traveling in groups were kneeling in the seats, and talking to friends that were sitting behind them. This happened in multiple groups and was never addressed by airline staff. My experience with Ryanair has been frustrating and communicated very clearly to those working with Ryanair, three times. Unfortunately, it seems that Ryanair is a company that knows its own rules and regulations very well, and if you do not (as a passenger), you are considered unfortunate and will only receive a mere apology for any uneventful experience had with the airline.

You can't check in your return trip without paying extra for early check in. This wouldn't be a problem if they provided digital/mobile boarding passes. They don't - as usually when you are travelling you are not taking a flipping printer with you, you have then pay extra in order to print your boarding pass in advance. Completely unnecessary/archaic and incredibly poor service. Also, think of the trees people.

On board, warm welcome by the male cabin crew member at the rear door and the cabin crew seemed to be on hand to help the last minute boarders who didn't want to be separated from their hand luggage. Very standard level of service on board, goods sold efficiently and the usual Ryanair announcements made. No word from the flight deck at all which was strange. The crew slightly irritated me talking loudly in the rear galley (I was in the second from rear seat) but one of them was lamenting the fact she had a ""loud voice"" so I don't think this was deliberately rude!

We didn't want to ruin our evening, so we didn't object, we just wanted to get home smoothly. After boarding the aircraft and after having found a small space in the cabin storage compartment to store our coats, two late passengers arrived, each of them carrying a rather large suitcase. Without saying anything, the flight attendant took our coats out of the storage compartment from above our heads and into my wife's lap. She then pushed one of the suitcases inside and left. No explanation, no intention of helping us store our coats somewhere else. My wife stood up and tried to store the coats somewhere else. This got the staff angry, because they were keen on making up lost time and wanted to depart as soon as possible. They started shouting through the microphone, urging everybody to take their seats and saying that taking your seat is really easy to do. Not only were we denied our minimal confort, decency and respect, but they were now also offending us in public. When I asked them, during the flight, if their attitude seemed normal to them, they started shouting again and they immediately joined the one I was adressing as to create pressure and intimidate us.

The plane took off more or less on time and arrived to Birmingham on schedule. 1 thing I will say about the priority boarding is, it's worth the extra money, it allows you and your partner/family sit together and gives some order to boarding having 2 lanes, I remember when it was 1 queue of boarding it was chaotic and seemed much longer to board.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

Even though I flew all the way with Ryanair I had to purchase two separate tickets and therefore had to check in twice. Once in Knock and again in Stansted. We were an hour late leaving Knock, no apologies or explanation. My flight to Athens was for 6.10pm but I wasn't allowed to go to the departure lounge until check in opened and had to hang around the arrival hall for three hours. One coffee shop and a fast food joint, nowhere to sit. Finally get to check in and there aren't any employees! In the check in area, 10 out of 20 weigh stations weren't working and when I found one that worked it was after three attempts. There was one lady outside the check in counter and her job was to tell you to lift your case into the conveyor belt and scan the boarding pass. Didn't offer to help anyone. I checked in one case and had one carry-on and a small bag. The carry on was fine from Knock to Stansted but was not acceptable Stansted to Athens! This I learned while boarding so my carry on went into the cargo. I didn't have time to open it to get some items that I wanted to ""carry-on"". Flight was supposed to leave at 6.10pm. They called us to the gate at 5.25pm and we stood there until 6.35pm, finally told to proceed, got stuck on the stairs 15 minutes and to add insult to injury another 10 minutes in freezing temperatures at the bottom of the steps attached to the aircraft. We eventually left at 7.10pm, an hour late. Again, no apologies or explanations. Of course I was delayed in Athens because I had to wait for two bags instead of one!

That Ryanair is low fare is well known and so I did expect not to have much space on the plane and that I was able to take one bag into the cabin if lucky. When I was already sitting on the plane from Bratislava to Stansted I received my e-mail that my flight from Stansted to Aalborg was canceled and I could not get off the plane to Stansted because it was too late. In Stansted, I was told that I have to wait 26 hours for a next flight and I had a right to have a refund and at least a hotel room where to stay till the next day. After waiting for 7 hours at the customer service I was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available. After another 3 hours they told me at the customer service that they don't know anything about a hotel room and that they will give me a standby ticket to Billund and I can try to catch it, because in that time I had less than an hour and there have been more standby tickets and they took just limited amount of them. It was hell, but after problems at the airport check-in and running for life (and plane) I got there. I arrived in Billund at late night and I had to travel to Aalborg by buses until the morning. I asked for refunds and they told me that I will receive them within 10 working days. That was in September 2017. I did not receive anything and I tried to contact them multiple times but either I was ignored completely or they just wrote me that they forwarded my e-mails and complains to different departments. In December 2017 I finally was able to contact them and account department of Ryanair wrote me that I will have my refunds on my account within 28 days. 28 working days passed and I haven't seen a penny. Honestly, I would not recommend using this airline no matter what. If you have a chance to use a different airline or transport please do.

Furthermore, we are two travelling, and when I made the checkin online the system gave us two seats far away from each other. Next option was; ""You are sitting apart, do you want to sit next to each other?"" Click yes, and an extra supplement is charged to change one of the seats to be next to the other one.

The cabin crew could perhaps pay more attention to the passengers. When serving drinks and snacks, they missed out row 26 altogether. Slight delay due to a technical issue with the aircraft, however we were transferred efficiently to another aircraft, meaning the delay was restricted to *just* 61 minutes. I was travelling with a family member on the same booking, however, we were not allocated seats together. This is not the first time we have been separated in the past few months with Ryanair.

However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude. And of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?).

I checked them in first and got seats 9e and 20b. When I checked in next I got seat 9b. Clearly they could have given my husband seats near each other but they clearly want to make a point. Every time you press proceed you get asked if you want to change your seats at a cost. It’s a pathetic money grabbing system.

I’ve flown with them before but never again! Firstly the ticket is affordable but each bag costs £40 which means the cost of bags will exceed the ticket (so flying with a more expensive airline with more benefits and quality assurance will technically equal the money you will spend with Ryanair). Secondly, unlike every other airline it now requires you to pay £6 (yes because £80 isnt enough) for you to be able to take a small bag on board. I took a small trolley bag as I knew this was the policy and they still tagged it. My bag had no lock, was not strong enough to be put in the deck and had very delicate things inside. They only gave me time to remove my computer and all my appliances/makeup/many other products were left to be thrown away in the deck (and we both know what happens, bag breaks and all my things inside break). The best part is they only tell you about this policy in an e-mail after you buy the ticket! Yes it is written in the small letters of the terms, yet they know we don't always read it all, especially when I’ve flown with them before and never had to do it so just assumed everthing was the same. When boarding, I realise half the top shelfs were empty which means this could all have been avoided, but like I said, money tops it all for this airline.

Boarding at Dublin swift and efficient and staff were very nice and courteous on outbound flight. On time arrival into CIA. Due to not having priority boarding our bags were taken off us at the aircraft and we weren't waiting long for them at the terminal. On the way back, a similar pattern, really nice staff on board, highly efficient and pleasant. Interestingly they turned off the cabin lights and toned down the service after about an hour which was really welcome. I have to say the constant selling is tiresome but on this flights the hour and half with dimmed lighted was very pleasant and appreciated by all passengers. Small delay on take off as wind was 15 knots which was too strong under Italian aviation law but we were well updated by flight deck. More notifications as we flew right over Paris and over Heathrow I wouldn't have any problems flying Ryanair again but play by the rules.

Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Frankfurt to London Stansted,1.0," | I thought I would flag what appears to be a persistent problem for Ryanair passengers flying from Frankfurt and the lamentable response from ground crew and Frankfurt staff. Bag security takes place at the gate at Frankfurt T2, not on entering the departure lounge (only passport needed). I arrived at the gate ~50 mins before the flight departed (let's face it - at STN with Ryanair you only generally start to board ~5 mins before the departure time) to be confronted with a large queue, all for the same flight. Security did not seem unduly concerned. Far from being last in the queue unfortunately I was directed to a very slow moving parallel screening queue for Xrays etc - which did indeed leave me one of the last downstairs to the gate, where I was witness to a queue of some 20 people already arguing with the gate staff who told them they were ""late"" and could not board. The situation was made more ridiculous as there was a half-empty bus waiting outside, for at least 10 minutes while the team of 2 on the desk refused to let more people past. Eventually this bus departed, only for another one to turn up - again we were not allowed to board this by the gate staff. Someone else turned up and we were effectively told tough, go and re-book as they would not let us through. As a result families were split as the block was seemingly arbitrarily applied from one passenger to the next - which was appalling, moreover he had medication for his wife and they still would not let the guy through nor make any attempt to get these to him. Clearly there was no communication between security and the gate which was hugely frustrating, security was understaffed as they could not physically process the volume of passengers in the timeframe (if I were more suspicious I would think there may be some 'special arrangement' to engineer this). Moreover this happens regularly - one of the gate staff told us *45* people were denied boarding under similar circumstances the day before and a quick twitter search showed this happened at least once more this same week. Overall it was a lousy experience but it seems to be a common problem - be warned if flying Ryanair out of FRA, get to the get super early.",Business,1.0,nan

All starts at boarding where a tag with limited liability is attached to your hand luggage if you don't pay ""Priority"" (which btw, seems to be bought by half the passengers nowadays). The ""fake receipt"" is then glued onto your ID which once resulted in one staff member actually breaking my plastic ID card. This tag is so made up you can just rip it off and try your luck getting your hand bag into the cabin. If you are traveling with your SO or a child, expect to pay just to sit together because it will purposely ""randomly"" allocate you as far as possible.

Those who often bump into everyone and will actually hurt you when you have an aisle seat, obviously without any apologies, that keep selling lottery tickets enhancing the flea market spirit even when turbulence requires all passengers to be seated. They sometimes forget to perform the safety procedures demonstration from start because they're on the phone. I once even heard one of them screaming when we ""bumped"" into some turbulence! Good luck trying to sleep if there are constant announcements over food, perfumes, tickets and other diversified sales. Also, Ryanair seems to think they're above EU regulations, no beverages are offered in case of a significant delay. Now the plus: It's simple and sometimes very cheap (although it often requires you to waste tons of money and pay exorbitant train tickets to reach its remote airports) Ryanair keeps growing without proper scaling and training, disregarding its customers and aiming towards maximum profit only. If an airline forgets the holidays of its pilots how can you expect it'll care about its customers?",Business,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Manchester to Barcelona,3.0," |  My trip to Barcelona was only one weekend with my friend and had the most disrespectful trip on our way back. From Manchester, me and my friend who are European citizens, arrived just fine to Barcelona with no problem, our passport or ID was eligible for the trip, however, on our way back which was the day after, we passed just fine through the security checks and everything and we were trying to board on the plane but it appears for some reason that we couldn't. According to the ladies there checking our boarding passes, we had to have a visa card and they wouldn't board us on the plane. We thought there was a confusion since we arrived just fine with the same exact documents, same airline, same airport the day before and we had no problem through security but they appear to have a problem and wouldn't let us on the plane. We were trying to explain to them that we are European citizens and that we do NOT require visa. They wouldn't listen to us or even try to help us since we couldn't understand their response which was unreasonable! Everyone is boarded but us two and the gates closed and we started panicking, we couldn't believe that they will actually leave us. Until one lady that was working there too, thought that there was something wrong and she tried to help us by just calling her superior to come and check if we do need visa and she just simply said ""no we do not need visa"" . That was it! That was all needed to be done by the staff members who didn't care leaving two girls alone in a foreign country.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,February 2018,3.0,5.0,nan,yes,Dublin to Gran Canaria,4.0, | Had flight cancellations due to weather going back home to Dublin from Gran Canaria.

I tried web check in whole day of travelling date but not able to web check in because of web issues and also i called customer care to solve but got reply to go airport for check in. When i reached airport, they charged 55 euro for boarding pass, this charge is almost similar to flight rate, i am very disappointed with Ryanair, i didn't face issue with any flight but worst experience is with Ryanair.

My hand luggage was at the dimensions and weight under the maximum limits. Without any reason they don't allow me to take it into the cabin. Other luggage belong to other people that were bigger were allowed to take it to the cabin. I will not fly again with Ryanair.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

No happy at all. I think as customer that we deserve information at moment to advise our families and the plane should be cleaned properly. At customer I feel upset as I think we deserve better treatment.,Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 737,Economy Class,4.0,February 2018,nan,2.0,nan,yes,Athens to Thessaloniki,2.0," |  Athens to Thessaloniki. Very cramped waiting area at the gate to board. They have been enforcing the new policy which makes it obligatory to hand in the hand-luggage before boarding, so that it gets stored - unless you pay for priority boarding. As I only had a rucksack I was allowed to have it in the cabin. The new policy has made more space in the cabin, boarding and leaving the aircraft has been quicker and the cabin was more comfortable. Some passengers have been complaining though, as they don't like that they will have to wait to collect their hand luggage. People have been moving around seats, in order to sit with their peers, however as this is a short flight it was not too much. Flights were punctual and almost full. Very cheap (40EUR return).",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Edinburgh to Brussels,1.0," | Edinburgh to Brussels. Worst experience ever and I’ve has many good and bad. Arrived through customs 2 hours early then stood in a 45 minute line while our flight was delayed only to get to the gate and be told I had to verify my passport at the airport entrance a half mile away, go through customs again, and get back within 5 minutes or miss my flight. At least 12 other passengers had the same dilemma and not all of them made it. I had an asthma attack but made it. My wife is British and printed the tickets so didn’t read the warning as it didn’t spot to her and was tiny. Ryanair must either require non EU customers to check in manually, or have the first security gate flag up the need to have your passport checked. I’ll never book with them again even if it’s free.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Supposed to be flying Toulouse to Stansted at 9.30, the flight has been delayed 2 hours with no explanation.

That's fine. But the fact that we had to wait 5 hours at the airport for the bus to take us back to La Rochelle is unacceptable! Half the people from the flight didn’t even speak French and didn’t understand anything on arrival in Nantes. No one was keeping us informed. Only got to my destination at 2am. I have taken so many flights with Ryanair, and they have been getting worse every time! They are not even offering money back or discount.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,nan,2.0,nan,no,Knock to Toulouse via London Stansted,1.0," | Flew Knock to Toulouse via London Stansted. Although departures and arrivals are on time, it is a shame to report the irony of the travelers having paid for their trip at a low price. Handlugage taken as for checked lugage because there was not paid extra for it (handlugage is not checked lugage right? This forced me to wait another extra 30/40 minutes on arrival). And on the trip back, surprise, 10 euros tax per passenger to pay at Knock airport (if we wanted to have our flight). None of this was notified either by e-mail, check-in, or even booking. A disaster, the budget explodes even more. No smiling flight attendants. Without forgetting to notice the dozen calls ""Ladies and gentlemen, we ask for your attention please"" to announce the selling of the duty-free products (whereas one would understand there is something serious / important happening). A little quiet flight and so commercial: when it's free, the product is the traveller.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,January 2018,nan,nan,nan,no,Milan to Manchester,nan," |  I have just tried to check in on line for a forthcoming trip to Milan with Ryanair, having had the debacle of trying to sit together with friends -  this is just not possible unless you pay extra up front again!! Thought I had solved the problem by paying an additional £6 PP Per flight for priority boarding. Only to discover that due again to their policy change this no longer includes early check in. The only way to sit together is to reserve your seats. Which is also a cheaper option than priority boarding but it doesn't tell you this when you make the booking. It is also not possible to change your Priority boarding to reserving a seat! The other point worth mentioning is that when you do book in the 4 day period before you fly, the Ryanair system seems to be designed to ensure that you are as far apart from your family as possible, which causes chaos at boarding as everyone then boards the flight and tries to sit with their family. If I have a choice Ryanair will be my last choice of carrier. No longer the cheap option they once were - they give you the distinct feeling they are trying to rip you off. Most certainly the worst of the cheap airlines! I will not use them again unless there is no other option - even if I have to pay more for the flight. Don't try to complain on the phone - they have no complaints department, just someone who keeps on telling you their policy has changed and to look at their website if you want to complain.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
