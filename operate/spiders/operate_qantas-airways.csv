Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Brisbane to Christchurch,5.0," |  Brisbane to Christchurch return. Check-in easy. As am Gold Frequent Flyer, was given a priority boarding card. For the first time ever, the card worked, was given priority access at security, the attendant even stopped the line and slotted me in front. The Qantas Lounge at Brisbane International is welcoming and comfortable. While lined up to board, a message on my phone indicated that I was upgraded to business class, the first time in 12 years of flying with Qantas. A nice touch to a great flight. At Christchurch Airport, off the plane and out the front door of the airport in 15 minutes. Can’t beat that. The return flight was uneventful, row 4, front of economy was dressed up like premium economy on the bigger jets, including pillows and noise cancelling headphones. Only let down for this entire trip was the 40 minute wait for bags at Brisbane International.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A380,First Class,4.0,July 2018,2.0,3.0,4.0,yes,London Heathrow to Mebourne via Singapore,2.0," | QF2 London Heathrow to Singapore in business. Uneventful flight. The service was ok but not extraordinary. Pre-dinner drinks are apparently not offered anymore. Quick meal service. The food was bland, but maybe I have chosen the wrong option. QF36 in premium economy. The food was better than the previous leg in business. The premium economy seat is fine except when the passenger in front of you puts his seatback in the sleeping position. There is no decent way to get out of your seat. The passenger in the middle seat who wants to get out will have to do some gymnastics to get out of the seat. Strange situation with the seat allocation. I had the bulk seat 24F and the day I had to travel this disappeared from my seat listing. Calling Qantas I was told I had to be reseated because an infant was booked in that seat. Well, as you may guess there was no infant in the seat or using the bassinet. Neither was the passenger who took my seat related to the other passengers in the same row. I don't mind to be reseated if this seat would have been used for an infant, but I do not want to get incorrect information if this is not the case. This is unprofessional behaviour of the airline towards their top tier travellers.",Business,2.0,nan

Flight was very busy and was assigned seats 74 A & B. The seats were very comfortable with lots of leg room. The under seat foot net was again very comfortable and allowed me to get a good nights sleep. The crew were very friendly and helpful (on both legs). The only issue I had was that the headset plus was inside the left arm rest, this kept on being dislodged when I moved around in the seat. I would happily travel with Qantas again, and have recommended them to friends and family.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes,Brisbane to Sydney,3.0," | Brisbane to Sydney. A very smooth journey with some amazing Cabin Crew. I was greeted very well during the boarding process, and take off was on schedule compared to my previous flight. The inflight service offered a lunch service with plenty of beverage variety. IFE was slightly limited though the flight was just over an hour long, so it was adequate. The Crew stood out most from recent memory. They were beyond friendly, great to chat with and incredibly engaging. Touch down in Sydney was bumpy because of strong winds and the overall flight experience was amazing.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
A330-200,Economy Class,3.0,July 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,no,Sydney to Brisbane,4.0," |  Sydney To Brisbane. Everything started off fine, from Check-In to Lounge access and boarding. From there, it was a 30 minute delay because of baggage and cargo being loaded and the finalisation of paperwork. I don't understand why there are so many delays when they operate a wide body aircraft on domestic routes, something always come unhinged. The onboard service was good but it did not make up for the unnecessary delay. IFE was limited, not the best content by past experience. Once we landed into Brisbane, there was another issue with deplaning as we were delayed by another 10 minutes because the pilot couldn't park appropriately. By this time you can definitely tell a large number of passengers were getting irritated by the simple fact a trained pilot couldn't park a plane properly. I will fly Qantas, but if they can't sufficiently fly an A330 for domestic routes without consistency in schedule, just stick to the 737 as it's so much better this way plus it will free up a wide body aircraft for International routes.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Dissatisfied and disappointed with lunch meal selection. The selection is either a potato leek soup, a sandwich or a salad that I think is not appropriate for substantial lunch. The reply I received from Qantas was also inadequate and dismissive. The reply was full of the airline promising high quality and variety of food and beverage selection but unfortunately they failed to deliver from my personal experience. I am wondering what they offer in their economy class for lunch if I did not travel in business class. Recently the airline has removed all music from IFE on tv screen or IFE app even on audio page still showing extensive selection of CD library from latest pop , jazz and rock to classic albums are available. So be prepared you need to BYO your music. Only Podcasts, talking business and kids audio books are available if you are interested in. Cabin staff has also advised no more Movie will be provided from drop down screen on 737 aircraft.

Qantas decided to waste 40min in Canberra this morning, making the arrival in Sydney 40min late. The staff on the Canberra to Sydney plane asked me to get of first and run to gate 1 where ground staff had been advised that i was coming. After waiting several minutes for my bag that was tagged premium hand luggage i ran to gate 1 only to be told that the flight had closed 8 minutes ago. They booked me on the 12.30pm flight and said bad luck, cant do anything else. When asked about a lounge pass the reply was no! Very bad experience.",Business,1.0,nan
Airbus A330,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Perth to Brisbane,4.0," |  Perth to Brisbane. This was the only flight Qantas offered to BNE on a widebody aircraft (all the other direct flights were on a 737) so I opted for this red-eye flight to Brisbane. After terrific service from the ground crew, and a short delay boarding, I was surprised to see a lack of seat back TV screens onboard, but an iPad with a variety of audio and video entertainment. The meal service was a snack, and rather than a breakfast being served prior to landing, only bottled water was provided. The seat had surprisingly little legroom. Crew on this sector were all terrific. Immaculate service, and I would recommend.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Brisbane to Adelaide,4.0," |  Brisbane to Adelaide. Terrific ground service, and a wonderful cabin crew on 2.5hr flight to Adelaide. Dinner service was wonderful, with a choice of Pork Curry with complimentary beer and wine. However, the aircraft itself was an ancient 737-800 from the old generation, with drop-down LCD screens that were starting to show their age. Despite this, it was a wonderful flight.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Sydney to Osaka,4.0," |  Sydney to Osaka on a refurbished A330-300. Due to mechanical fault the flight was delayed 5 hours with Qantas giving regular updates. Due to this, arrival in Osaka was in the middle of the night with no option of public transport into the city. Qantas arranged several buses to varying locations for passengers. Service onboard was very good, including staff dealing very well with a difficult situation of an arguing couple. The new entertainment system worked very well. The new seats are comfortable, although the foot nest is awkward. A proper folding down foot rest would have been much better. It would have been good to have received an amenity kit on the return flight.",Couple Leisure,5.0,1.0
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,October 2016,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,SYD to WLG,3.0,"Having booked my ticket 10 months ahead, not only did I get a very good price, I was able to choose my seat at row 4, which is the first row of economy just behind business. Considering the business class seat is only slightly wider, with almost the same sized TV, I think I had made a very wise decision. As business class would have cost me 5 times more. Had I paid for that, and knowing what I got, I would have kicked myself. Being a One world emerald member with Sri Lankan airlines, I was greeted by the purser warmly, with immigration card, fast track card and business class headphone offered. Not only that, I find with both my flights, the seat in the middle was simply left empty between me and my neighbour, which kind of turned into a European style business class. Meals and drinks are of course from economy class, which was no problem and delicious. Being emerald member allowed me extra 20kg luggage and priority baggage handling, it really made no difference to flying in business class actually, except I was paying very cheap economy price, but still with all the perks.

Left on time, arrived on time and the inflight service was impeccable and the breakfast provided excellent. I would really like to give a higher mark but when you pay the same dollars for 38 inches and a standard reclining seat on a 737 in Business Class across the Tasman as you do for a fully flat bed on Emirates the value is simply not there.

Yes it's a bit tight when the seat in front reclines but not a huge deal. Service was friendly, attentive and faultless. Food was absolutely woeful on all legs. Ordered on Q Eat prior to check in but still got asked what I wanted to eat - not sure what the whole point in ordering ahead of time is as the cabin crew seemed oblivious to any pre-ordered meals. Small portions, terrible choice of meals and the food itself was pretty sub par; probably on a level with some of the worst economy food I've ever tasted. Toilets could have done with an occasional clean. Choice of inflight entertainment was great - enough to keep me entertained for both legs.

Frustrating 40 minute delay after boarding, as it was discovered that oxygen bottles used the previous delay had not been refilled. Very cramped with narrow seats and tight spacing.

Very good quality breakfast served, but this was spoilt by very long delay in clearing away. Only 4 crew, 2 serving 162 economy passengers.

A380,Business Class,2.0,September 2016,2.0,4.0,1.0,no,LAX to MEL,2.0, |  Los Angeles to Melbourne with Qantas. The food choices on this 10:00 PM flight consisted of supper only and were disappointing. Qantas seemed to be skimping because the flight is a night flight. The IFE options remain poor with few current movies. The all female FA crew were unimpressive with little interaction. Passengers were never addressed by name and any request outside the usual was not dealt with. Breakfast was small and a second coffee was not offered. The Sky Bed is a generation behind the benchmark and storage is lacking.,Business,3.0,nan
A380,Business Class,3.0,September 2016,2.0,4.0,1.0,yes,MEL to LAX,2.0, |  Melbourne to Los Angeles with Qantas. I flew business class after previously flying Virgin Australia on the same route. The meal choices were surprisingly limited. The wine was reasonable for business but nothing outstanding. IFE movie choice was very poor with only 1 movie that looked current. The all male crew of FAs were good. The Sky Bed is showing it's age and is at least a generation behind the benchmark on other airlines.

Aisle seats of choice for two of us. Appeared to be a fairly full flight and dinner served. Gluten Free meal option for coeliac was potatoes meat with green beans that was good.

A380 / Boeing 737,Economy Class,5.0,September 2016,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes,LHR to TSV via PER & BNE,4.0," | London to Townsville via Perth & Brisbane with Qantas. When it comes to legacy airlines, especially those that have only just come back into black from near financial ruin, one doesn't expect much when travelling down the back in economy. In these circumstances it would be easy to say that my expectations were exceeded because I wasn't really expecting much. However, the overall quality of product and service goes far beyond this. I was booked on QF10 from LHR-DXB. It's a relatively short 7 hour flight and having travelled this route with both British Airways and Emirates I thought I knew what to expect. It was therefore a real pleasure to find a large, comfy pillow and lovely wide seat to relax in. The non-alcoholic welcome cocktail was a nice touch and there was a good selection of other drinks to choose from. I had been super intrigued to find out how the Qantas 'no tray' meal service works. In effect you do get one small tray on which sits the hot part of the meal. A pre-buttered hot roll is rested on top and the dessert comes in a separate disposable pot. It's an original and quirky idea which does work. However, I couldn't help but think that this deliberately allows Qantas to cut back on meal add ons like cheese and biscuits. Luckily the lamb curry and crumble dessert were of a decent size and tasty. The wine was of good quality and the post lunch hot drink offering was good. I wish I had gone for the hot chocolate and marshmallow option when I saw it was available but opted for the healthier peppermint tea. Throughout the rest of the flight the crew remained in the cabin offering water, juices and fresh fruit. The second snack meal was a tasty, heated pastry. One could help themselves to sweet granola bars from the galley during the flight. Cabin crew were professional and generally hospitable. The flight took off just a few minutes late despite a technical hitch in London and landed on time in Dubai. Luggage quickly arrived onto the carousel and I was out of the airport in next to no time. My second flight to Australia was with Emirates before rejoining Qantas in Perth to fly onto Brisbane and then a second flight up to Townsville. Check in at both PER and BNE was fully automated from seat selection to luggage tag printing and bag drop. Although this was efficient it did rather take away the human touch. The first flight to BNE was on an old 737 with little in the way of leg room and generally old, tired seats. Although there was no seatback IFE the plane was fitted with an audio/visual streaming service which was complimentary. There was a good choice of movies, TV shows and music. The second flight was just a short 2 hour hop. However, it was operated by a 737 with the new Boeing Sky interior, with seatback IFE. A dinner service was operated on this flight along with a chocolate Lindor to finish (a great touch). On both flights the crew were natural, warm and friendly. The new uniforms really stood out and showed off the crew in a good way. All in all a great experience with Qantas. I would highly recommend them after these flights.",Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,November 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,BNE to CHC,5.0, |  Flew from Brisbane to Christchurch. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. The aircraft was around 70% full. Meal service included a hot or continental breakfast option. I chose continental and it was plentiful and filling. Coffee and tea offered along with soft drinks and water. Seperate water runs conducted before and after meal service. Inflight entertainment was well stocked with latest media content. Aircraft clean. Bags out quickly in Christchurch. The price I purchased these flights at makes it very good value for money. Very happy with Qantas.,Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 747,Premium Economy,5.0,October 2016,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,SYD to JNB,4.0,"Sydney to Johannesburg with Qantas in Premium Economy. Boarding was quick and efficient with sparkling wine or fruit juice offered prior to take off. The Senior Cabin Attendant came round to introduce herself and advised who would be providing service during the flight. This is the first time we have experienced this personal touch, and throughout the flight the service was excellent, including the cabin attendant coming round to say goodbye and wish well on arrival. The premium economy seat is very comfortable and has plenty of space, although the leg / footrest could be improved. This was a 14 hour daylight flight. Bar service after takeoff included an excellent choice of wines. Food was very good. Slow roasted lamb shank - newly introduced Neil Perry meal featured in Qantas magazine - was superb. Second full meal, also very good, was served about 6 hours later. A snack was then offered about an hour before arrival. Throughout the flight the crew were available, and came round on a regular basis. The entertainment on offer is extensive, and whilst nothing appealed in the wide choice of films, none of which seemed very recent releases, there was an extensive range of CDs from which a playlist could be compiled, and enjoyed through good noise reducing earphones. Overall this was an excellent flight despite its length, and whilst the aircraft was very good, the difference was the superb service.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Check-in at Melbourne was a breeze; all self-service where you print your own luggage tags and boarding passes. Many would call it impersonal but there were plenty of friendly Qantas staff around to answer questions. We were through security within 10 minutes of arrival. Boarding was efficient and on-time, with the crew courteous and professional right from the start. Nice to see an airline which sometimes get bad press for cost-cutting still try and put itself apart from the budget carriers with small touches like attitude. No seat back IFE in the aircraft we got but live streaming Sky News as well as streaming video via the Qantas app would have provided ample entertainment even on a longer flight. Soft drinks and a snack (bag of cookies) were provided - very basic but then again the flight was only an hour long. On-time arrival in Sydney together with efficient deplaning and swift arrival of baggage. Couldn't fault Qantas on this trip.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Having flown into Dubai with Emirates, The transfer to Qantas was like travelling back in time to the 1990s. Oppressive dark cabin with dark grey pods six abreast in groups of two. The seats are just satisfactory but the small touch screens deliver only the most basic information about the flight. Departure and arrival were on time and the meals were good, particularly the dinner before landing. But instead of lighting up the cabin, we ate in semi-darkness that just added to the depressive environment. Staff worked hard especially before landing. What is particularly annoying, given the cost of flying with Qantas, is that the airline has a three section cabin upstairs. At the rear is Premium Economy, in the middle Business, and in front of the service section is a sort of small Elite Business for those with high Frequent Flyer points, which unlike the main cabin, was only about half full.

This was about the tenth time I have flown with Qantas on an international flight, normally Qantas food is exceptional though on this route I was slightly dissapointed as the dessert was nothing special - however my main meal and garlic bread were served warm and tasted great, and the panini I had towards landing was excellent. The entertainment on Qantas is great especially the travel and lifestyle section. The crew were extremely friendly and I had a great chat with them.

On the return flight last night, the dinner choices were 1) Cold Duck salad 2) Fish and 3) Chicken. I chose the chicken meal which consisted of three small grey pieces of boiled chicken. This was accompanied by some green spinach and white rice. It was absolutely shocking. I know I do not fly for the food, but please put some thought back into QF airline meals.

The toilet is more like a small cupboard with absolutely no amenities in stark contrast to the roomy Emirates bathroom complete with shower.

Really good food, and more than adequate entertainment. My only complaint is other passengers: Just how much cabin luggage does one person need? Can't fit it in the locker above your seat? Then put it under the seat, not in the overhead space used by other passengers! Ideally, the airlines would enforce this for more comfortable travel, but they want to get their aircraft into the air on schedule.  Airfares are now cheaper than they have ever been, and people are still complaining.  One last request: Please try and consider the passenger in front of you. Banging and kicking your seat is very annoying. And you can actually stand up and sit down without using the headrest of the sleeping passenger if front of you!",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

It is hard to find something to say which means it was a pretty uneventful and steady run with Qantas again. On time departures and arrivals at all ports. F & B was fine, the FA's were great and always nice to hear a reassuring Australian voice at the controls. Two things. One was the flight being completely full. Really packed. Is it time for Qantas to have two London flights from Sydney or possibly to add a Perth flight? Last few times on QF1 & 2 there have been no empty seats. All well and good outsourcing some of the flights to Emirates but will always choose Qantas where possible. Second, Qantas should fit WiFi into the A380 service. EK has it and was good value. Being out of touch for 20 hours whilst flying is not really acceptable these days. These days getting on a Qantas long haul jet means it really does feel like home when stepping on.

The aircraft cabin was clean and modern, IFE was quick and screen large with great content. The moving map was not operational on this flight. I especially liked the 2-4-2 seat layout. Seats are comfortable with good recline and good leg room. The flight departed Singapore 30 minutes late but arrived on time in Sydney. The meal service was OK. The welcome drink was cordial which I feel is a bit tacky. The main meal was very flavoursome and a good size, dessert a dry cake. We were only offered drinks once with dinner which was disappointing. Most airlines do a drinks round pre dinner, with dinner and after dinner. Not Qantas. Breakfast a pastry with a chocolate filling. It wasn't very tasty. I would have liked a choice of a hot meal. Staff were professional and friendly. Communication was great. Would I fly Qantas again? Possibly, but would more likely go with an Asian carrier.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

Firstly late departure, no inflight entertainment as it was broken since flying from Brisbane earlier that day and not fixed - we can give you a magazine to read, never got one. The dinner was average and later the fresh fruit was a choice of banana or banana, the complimentary greeting drink was a bottle of water and the breakfast a dried shrivelled burnt danish with no filling - inedible in a cardboard box not fit to give to a dog. Qantas need to lift their game other Asian airlines win hands down for service and food. When I complained about the danish the flight attendant said we could get you another. What another burnt one?

A frustrating start to my journey as confusing signage at SYD led me to the wrong check-in area, before a staff member rather rudely redirected me to a desk for online checked-in passengers - even though the desks in the area I was queueing for said the same thing. The flight got off to a shaky start too, as boarding was delayed for more than half an hour with no explanation from gate staff other than two vague and non-reassuring references to a ""technical issue"". I was certain we'd be very late, however to Qantas' credit they made up time with the quickest boarding I've ever seen and we departed less than 5 minutes behind schedule. On board, the A330 was comfortable and modern and the IFE was amongst the best I've seen - certainly on par with Emirates in terms of quality, although perhaps not quite so much choice (but certainly more offerings to my taste). The 2-4-2 seating layout makes the A330 the ideal aircraft for travelling in a couple. Some crew were friendlier than others but overall I felt looked after. The meal choices were rather limited although the food was of a good quality. I would have preferred more frequent snacks. Service was excellent for the first part of the flight but all but disappeared around half way - disappointing as I would have preferred further drink and snack runs and was left hungry. To be fair, some turbulence late in the flight precluded the crew from offering a full service. Arrival in Singapore was smooth, with efficient deplaning and quick baggage offload. Overall a very comfortable and satisfying flight, Qantas could be excellent if a couple of customer service issues could be ironed out.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Breakfast (now served in boxes instead of trays) was a choice of Bacon Frittata or Yoghurt Granola. I opted for the Frittata and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty and flavoursome it was.

However, the crew did a great job, they worked hard throughout the flight, and always with a smile on their face. The food was nice.

A380,Premium Economy,5.0,November 2016,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,SYD to LHR via DXB,4.0," |  Sydney to London via Dubai in Premium Economy. I’ve traveled in PE before on Qantas and it’s been underwhelming. On the last occasion and this time, I used QFF points to upgrade from Economy, but no matter how you get there PE is an expensive jump in cost and in the past, it’s not lived up to the hype. This time was different and service was impeccable.  There were frequent drinks top ups and constant attention to detail. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and drink for the most part. Wine was served from full size bottles of decent brands and the dinner out of Sydney was excellent. I’ve heard people say that Premium Economy food is the same as Economy but in this instance the dishes on Q-Eat were I think different between the two classes – I had ordered on both – before and after the upgrade. Anyway, it was a very nice dinner service with all the trimmings served on white linen and felt like a premium service. The seat is not too bad, it’s wide with lots of leg room and I managed a few hours of sleep up to Dubai. For solo travelers 24A and 24K are the best seats, window seats on the exit row. The blankets, pillows and headphones are the same as Business Class and you share the rear Business Class bathrooms. The only disappointment was the strange supper dish served before landing in Dubai, it was an egg roll with an accompanying chicken sausage. It was really not at all nice but I ate it as I was hungry by now. Then to the second leg out of Dubai and it soon became evident that this leg would be back to the Premium Economy that I remembered from the past, so Y Class with a tablecloth. The cabin crew were nice enough but it was not the same level of service. After what seemed like quite a time after take-off they came around with a supper service of hot sandwiches which were OK, but it seemed like only coffee or tea or juice was loaded on the trolley. This was in the middle of the night out of Dubai at the start of a night leg into London, who wants coffee at that time? Me and many of the people around me asked for a glass of wine or similar. That was met with a call back to the galley and a small bottle of economy wine was given to each. When the trays were cleared no more drinks were offered, though I guess you could request them. That was pretty much it for that crew until two hours before landing when they served a substantial hot and cold breakfast and then they were done. So hot towels like the first leg, either on decent or after take-off, really just Y service with a tablecloth. The crew were nice enough but some of them need to be reminded that PE is an expensive seat and the service level should match the expectation of a ticket costing two or three times the cost of Economy.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The lounge was far too busy and offerings were very average.  The new layout in the reconfigured Boeing 747 is very tight up front and there is little room to navigate your way to washrooms when people are sleeping. The staff were less than impressive in my cabin they seemed more interested in some friends or family than the paying clients. Qantas does this thing where its late at night after the poor lounge experience all you would like is a snack before you sleep, 2.5 hours after take off they begrudgingly offer you something to eat. I always thought American Airlines was terrible, but my last several flights on them have far exceeded my Qantas experience.

There is an open bar for Australian wines, so there is really nothing you can complain about. Yes, the planes are relatively old but as long as they are well maintained it is a pleasure to be onboard. On the short flight from AKL to SYD we got a warm meal, a rarity for many airlines nowadays.

They're not gone but it seems that someone in Qantas customer service has taken on board the feedback and the new fleet is being rolled out with something akin to a liveable environment. They are not revolutionary, they are pretty much the same as Emirates and Etihad, but they work, they are comfy and if you select your flights correctly (they are currently only available in the new Airbus fleet) they are even available on short haul interstate flights (Syd-Mel).

Furthermore, the were a number of choices for the meal. Once I had got my meal, it was fabulous. Conversely, the cabin crew seemed to be impolite and unfriendly to me. Some of them did not want to serve me or the other passengers. (Fake smile or never smile) Moreover, the cabin looked a bit dull.

We've booked seats with AA advantage mile members program 11 months in advance, and were very much looking forward to it. The pickup Mercedes van was comfortable, as well as the special check-in counter. We were escorted through tax refund and custom and had a lovely hand and foot massage. As it was a midnight flight, we had plenty of time to sample the highly anticipated Niel Perry menu. I was surprised at how ordinary it was, as I was expecting a restaurant quality I could only rate it only as that of a good cafe quality. We had the much talked about Salt and Pepper squids, Braised beef in red wine, and the deconstructed Pavlova, and by the end of the meal, I was really hoping that the quality will improve once we embarked. The seat was spacious, but showing the signs of age. The staff are fairly attentive and well groomed. The bed was made for us and was very comfortable. The Mezze entree plate was tasty, but the lamb Koftas were quite undercooked, and looked raw inside! My main couse of Patagonia tooth fish was nothing special. I found the fish to be quite strong in flavour. As it was quite late, I don't remember being offered any dessert. Breakfast was served a few hours before London arrival, and it was one of the worst breakfast I've had flying! The meal was delivered lukewarm, with 2 grey tasteless sausages, tepid scrambled eggs and a slop of mushed cold baked beans. Needless to say, I hardly touched the breakfast. My husband also had a glass of champagne knocked over him by the Service Manager! He offered the customary laundry receipt claim etc, which we declined as it would have been too much of a hassle. My husband was disappointed also to find that his clothes was being treated without care, by being hung carelessly on a hanger. This overall experience, made us realised that First Class is not worth the money, especially on Qantas. We've flown CX, Qatar, Etihad, Alitalia, all in Business and I have to say that they are far superior to Qantas first class.

Compared with Garuda Indonesia on this same route, Qantas is sub-standard when it comes to passenger comfort. Both Qantas and Garuda Indonesia use an A330-200 on this route, however it seems that Qantas has opted to squeeze more seats into the economy cabin than Garuda Indonesia, as the amount of personal space, or lack-there-of on Qantas, is more than noticeable.

I have to call Qantas Australia to enable the change to my correct name. This was the first. Qantas also have a seat allocation problem unlike many other reputable airlines. As a frequent flyer with over 300,000 air-miles to date I am unable to choose a seat online. Even when checking in at the counter was told the flight was full. When on board there were whole rows unfilled and many rows with completely full. So a number of people moved around on the plane once airborne. Some bad planning here with little customer consideration. The seats in Qantas economy are so close that my knees were jam packed against the seat in front. The person in front of me reclined their seat as soon as airborne and I had a screen no more that 20cm from my face, making me have to recline my seat straight away, which in turn would have affected the person behind.

What are Qantas doing? Either you fly Jetstar for the supposed budget end, or Qantas for full service. Food was chronic. People lined up like sheep at the toilet at the rear, whilst they were not allowed to use the business class toilet, as that was for the six or seven pax in business. That was understandable, as they had paid the princely sum of around $1700 return for a seat little better than those horrible European business class offers.

As a result, about two dozen Qantas passengers arrived in Buenos Aires without baggage and had to go back to the Airport the next day to pick it up which took half a day of my vacation.

After being ripped off and treated with contempt by management, My wife and I decided to use up our accrued frequent flyer points before ditching Qantas for good. The outward flight was via Singapore was very acceptable. Naturally, we wanted to return the same way, but had to fly via Bangkok and Sydney. If we'd had sufficient points for all flights, we would have had to fly Jetstar via Melbourne. How stupid and inconvenient is that? Previously, we had to cancel a flight from Tokyo to Brisbane and could not do so online. The so called customer help line is a joke with minimum waiting times of at least one hour and I wasted 18 calls totalling 150 mins. before I could speak to someone (at 1.20 in the morning). The automated call back service seems to be non existent as not once were any of those calls answered. Qantas simply refuses to employ sufficient staff. My numerous emails were also ignored. The $60 we paid for advance seat allocation was non refundable.  Regarding food, on two occasions between Brisbane and Singapore, the meal we wanted had run out. It seems that the caterers assume that most passengers will be Asian, therefore two of the three choices are spicy Asian dishes.  I would like to point out that we have never had a complaint with staff either on the ground or in the air. This airline has lost two loyal frequent flyers due to the arrogance of management which is motivated by greed.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

At check-in I was given seat 51J and my son was given 74C. The staff at the boarding counter asked if I want to change the seat in order to sit together so I said okay. However, he changed our seats to 87D and 87E without my consent. I went back to him when I found out that the changed seats were worse than before. I told him I wanted our original seats of 51J and 74C back. He said he could give back seat 74C to my son but there was no way to give me back seat 51J. I was very unhappy sitting in a worse seat for more than 22 hours from London to Sydney. I was not happy with the cheap meals provided for long haul flights. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

This leg (Dubai to Melbourne) I have done 3 times in the last year with an infant and it is terrible. Emirates and BA are 1000 times better. They actually make an effort to welcome you, chat with you, make sure your children are settled before you take off. Firstly, they have cost cut to the point of it being ridiculous. No basic amenities such as a toothbrush and a few pencils for my daughter to play with (unless asked). Service is unfriendly and rude. The amount of packaging for their food is huge - rubbish everywhere. They don't use a tray to serve you so you need to juggle individual bits of food on your little table. The food quality is poor - my salad was gritty and the greens were slimy. No walking through the cabin offering water in the middle of the night - you have to track it down. We have been fortunate to have bulkhead seats on 2/3 trips however the seat room is shocking - you would need to be under 160cm to fit.

Left hotel at 4.30am for 7am flight to Sydney from Christchurch on 2 February. Check in fine though check in girl didn't smile and seemed unhappy to be there. Boarded plane on time and pushed back early.Then nothing - after what seemed an age the captain said that one of the engines seemed to be leaking fuel. They were going to run one of the engines and see if it stopped. After 1.5 hours on the plane we were told we would have to deplane We were given a 20 dollar voucher but only one cafe to spend it in, so the queue was enormous. The business lounge was reopened but very little food was available until lunchtime. No information was forthcoming, eventually our brother in law in Sydney told us that it was showing on the computer that the flight was leaving at 1540 but we had not been told this. Eventually it got round that it would now be 1640 but still nothing official to business class passengers - if announcements were made outside they were not conveyed to us. Eventually a woman told us at 3.00 pm that the flight was cancelled - no empathy, no real apology just that we had to reclaim our baggage and recheck in. No announcement was made where our baggage would be and no sign appeared on the belt, and eventually it appeared on a domestic carousel. Eventually we were called out of the queue and told we would be put on Emirates flight. For the first time the attitude was more appropriate. When we went back to the lounge as Emirates passengers, the same woman who had told us an hour previously our flight was cancelled appeared to have no recollection of that event.

What a shock. 2 refrigerated rows of old pre-packed sandwiches, a Bain Marie of over-salted rissoles (inedible), 2 really overcooked, mashed pasta dishes and 1 other meaty looking mess we weren't game to try and some over-cooked rice. Opted for a bag of crisps and parked ourselves in a couple of hugely high-backed, hard and uncomfortable chairs. Disgusted. We have patronised business class lounges for Emirates, British Airways and other Qantas lounges and never experienced the likes of this. Not sure whether QANTAS or OR Tambo Airport are responsible but definitely the Shongololo Lounge is the absolute worst.

London Heathrow Check in quick and easy but the promised FastTrack security proved anything but (not the airline's fault). Cathay Pacific Lounge provided nice coffee, a good selection of food and a nice view of the airport. Boarding was ideal with no queuing. IFE provides a wide selection of films and tv, music and radio too. Dubai stopover short and sweet, good lounge with direct access to gate. What a good idea. Melbourne immigration now completely automated so more passport stamps.

I wasn't allowed to web check in stating the reason that I'm on a codeshare partner flight but to my surprise if I paid AUD30pp roughly ($25pp) they were ready to check me in and all this was happening 10 hours prior to my flight time when usually the seats become free to choose. I was on my honeymoon and they assigned me seats on the 4 seat configuration inspite of me requesting them to shift my seats to the row with 2 seat options. They refused to help me for the same, stating that the flight is full but in reality on the website they had more than 45 seats easily available. When I told them about the availability on the website they said, ""that's not the real time availability sir, even if you try booking it will not accept your seat selection"" which was completely false as I just had to pay AUD60 and the seats were mine. They basically lied and were really unhelpful and non-accommodating, not the behaviour you expect from the national carrier of Australia. All they wanted me was to pay them AUD60 for those 2 seats just 10 hours before my departure time.

After not receiving my refund, I called them and after waiting on hold for more than an hour, I was told that I should have sent them details of my PoLi payment so that they can process the refund.

Each time coming home we have been unable to make the connecting flight and for some reason Qantas don't put you on the next direct flight to Perth but they reroute you adding signifiant delays to arrival and more flying time. The long haul economy esp on 747 has become quite dated and dirty in parts. In the future I will be flying Asian airlines to the USA and Canada who guarantee one stop to USA at a much cheaper price and who's airports have access to showers in case of a delay.

In the past seven years I have flown business class with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar. Qatar Airways is far and away the best, and I would love to try Singapore Airlines again. Unfortunately I was flying to South Africa and so had little choice - Qantas or Qantas. Not only did I have to pay a ridiculous $5,000 one way for each of my wife and I, the aircraft was an old Boeing 747-400 and the cabin service was barely better than economy on other airlines. There was no 'experience' to this flight, and certainly no feeling of being 'treated' as a premium customer. It was slap-dash, here-you-go service. The food was very ordinary. There was not even a pre-dinner drink with canapes, and no after meal offer of cheese, chocolate or liquer. No, it was whip the tray away, lights out and crew disappeared. The second leg down to Cape Town from Johannesburg was a codeshare domestic business class operated by South African Airways and what a contrast it was - premium service from beginning to end, and SAA was absolutely professional, and enjoyable. I recommend checking the operator if you are flying Sydney to Johannesburg and picking the day when South African Airways  are taking you - that way you might get value for money.

I was pretty unimpressed by how difficult they tried to make it for me to claim even though they were in the wrong. I ordered vegan meals, which were average at best and beside the fact that I had a 9 month old on my lap the entire flight and couldn't really eat them (of course they charge you extra for the child who isn't even occupying a seat) but they brought the baby meals containing meat and didn't give the option to choose something else. I didn't feel like they wanted to help me much either. The staff seemed put out by even getting me hot water for my son's formula so dare not ask them to mind him while I went to the bathroom!

The LAX-JFK-LAX sectors were operated by refurbished 747-400ER aircraft, and although the flights and service were fine, the 747 is starting to show its age. Noise levels and (dry) air quality are noticeably different to the A380. Our return flight out of JFK was delayed due to the crew being caught in a traffic jam en route to the airport.

A380,Premium Economy,5.0,March 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Dallas to Sydney,5.0," | Dallas to Sydney and the final leg with Qantas of a round the world trip. Dallas Airport, Terminal D, is great. Very clean, new, plenty of food options, seating, shopping. The only disappointment is the Admirals Lounge where it is comfortable but the food choices are very limited. No issue as there is plenty available in the terminal. The flight itself is typical these days of Qantas long haul ie professional, courteous and great. On time departure and arrival around 8 minutes after scheduled time. I go out of my way to fly long haul on the QF A380 and save for the odd glitch have yet to be disappointed. The F and B can vary a little. Outbound from Australia is usually always better than inbound but this is due to local (US) catering so understandable.",Business,4.0,nan
A380,Economy Class,5.0,March 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Sydney to London via Melbourne,5.0," | Sydney to London via Melbourne. A typical uneventful ride on Qantas QF9 from Melbourne until we reached Dubai. In the economy cabin but had a whole row to myself so could stretch out. Delayed arrival due to ATC in Dubai and this seems to be getting worse. Upon landing we were advised that there was an engineering issue. The onward departure would be delayed by an hour which is what happened. Boarded, left the gate and whilst heading on the taxi way to the runway the problem clearly had not been fixed so we returned to the gate. A delay of around 6 more hours and eventual arrival into London some 7-8 hours late. As the captain said: Safety before schedule. These things do happen and I like my engine issues to take place on the ground and not in the air. Having lounge access helped but the Qantas ground staff were also great in providing refreshment for those who could not use the lounge.",Business,4.0,nan
Boeing 747-400,Business Class,4.0,March 2017,3.0,2.0,4.0,no,Los Angeles to Perth,4.0," |  Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane. We did encounter one leg with average service; my husband’s morning coffee was served spilt, a few napkins shoved underneath to absorb the mess, basically half a cup of coffee, and no sugar (as requested) – a quick apology was given, but it really shouldn’t have been served this way and accompanied by a cold serve of scrambled eggs. Not a bad run, considering we flew four legs in total. Overall, the meals were pretty good. Of all the Business Class experiences we have had (Etihad, Emirates, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines), our Qantas experience has landed at the bottom of the list. On our return leg, we had booked row 3 seats in the nose of the plane (747), weeks in advance. A last minute aircraft change saw us separated, so a customer service rep via social media offered us two back row business class seats – the last remaining together apparently – we reluctantly accepted. The very next morning I logged in to check seating again and noticed the aircraft had reverted back to the original. I messaged our social media friend to obtain our existing seats, only to be told ‘bad luck’. Our seats were gone, and we weren’t getting them back. I protested a number of times only to be hit with ‘cut and paste’ replies on operational aircraft change jargon. Eventually, they just ignored me. I also sent a complaint via Qantas online and recently received the same ‘cut and paste’ response about aircraft change. In all honestly, they could have just given our original seats back and kept us happy, considering the above was all within a 24-hour window. The reason we wanted row 3, was that those Business Class seats (FYI) are in the nose of the plane and more spaced / private. We flew over in row 2 and enjoyed the experience. The second part of the 747 is where the seats are 2-3-2. Basically, a very ‘Premium Economy’ experience albeit your bed lies flat. You don’t have a feeling of personal space and can easily bump your neighbour getting in and out of your seating. Two of our legs, we’re flown in an A330; this is a much better aircraft for Business Class, with seating 1-2-1 for personal space, and a nice big entertainment screen on the front seat, as opposed to the small pull out ones on the 747. Unfortunately though, the A330 aircraft cannot be used for long haul flights. Based on the above experience, and at a cost of $20,000 for the return trip, we will not be flying Qantas again for our next journey in June. We have already sourced an alternate airline. I believe our seating error could have been handled better. Unfortunately, we are not Platinum members, so I feel we were overlooked and brushed aside.  Had our original seating, which was booked weeks in advance been honoured, we would have rebooked with Qantas in June.  Do not change your seats with aircraft changes until check in. And, do not rely on Qantas social media customer service. I hope the above assists with your travels plans.",Business,2.0,nan

Qantas were outstanding and earned my vote as one of the best airlines. Service on both sectors was excellent. The entertainment options were varied and extensive enough to occupy 15 hours of flying. The seat was far more comfortable than other long haul airlines I've flown and the food above the standard economy fare. The A380 is also an amazing aircraft to fly on.

It was the end of my two week holiday in Japan, and was looking forward very much to the flight home. We happened to arrive at the airport the moment check-in was opened, good timing really. After, we decided to go straight to the Qantas Lounge which was conveniently located right next to our gate. The flight was handled by Japan Airlines ground team and they are very smooth with boarding procedures. Qantas flight attendants gave one of the best on-board service on my journey home as they were welcoming and made sure the business class cabin was well taken care of including the customer service manager making his way around and welcoming each passenger. Dinner was delicious, and a small breakfast was much appreciated. Definitely looking forward to flying with Qantas very soon.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 747-400,Premium Economy,5.0,April 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Tokyo to Sydney,4.0," |  Tokyo to Sydney in premium economy with Qantas. I was surprisingly comfortable on this night flight. I found seat pitch to be good and width adequate. Recline and comfort were not bad but it was a little difficult getting in and out of your seat when everyone's reclined for sleep. Food was decent as was service and in-flight entertainment—in fact it was better than some business offerings, e.g BA. Importantly for me cabin temperature was cool but not cold and the supplied blankets and pillows were excellent. You felt fresh with good air circulation throughout. Personally I'm a fan of the refitted 747s, which while not ""modern"" are large, fast and comfortable. Everything was clean and in working order so no issues with the older aircraft. While Qantas PE wasn't particularly well priced you could see where the money went. It is a viable alternative to business for shorter sectors in my opinion.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 737,Economy Class,1.0,April 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,Singapore to Perth,1.0," | Disgraceful for what used to be the Spirit of Australia. I flew to and from Japan on Thai Airways, Japan Airlines then finally Singapore to Perth with Qantas for the last 5 hr 31 min. Of these 25 hours travel, Qantas was shamefully the worst. Sadly, I have always told people how proud I was of the flying Kangaroo. Well, never again! Here is my list of why I will never choose them again. Aircraft stinks - bad odour. Staff make sure to let you know that they are only doing a job, not providing a service: e.g. JAL staff attending a massive Boeing 777 so graceful and polite. 1hr 30 min into Qantas flight : not even a drop of water offered. Later found that they had small water bottle in pouch. 1hr 30 min into Thai Airways I have had snacks / drinks and main is being served. Entertainment system : Qantas, you have no excuse for this! System froze intermittently, no remote so you are at the mercy of the dirty touchscreen working which it didn't for about 30% of time. This is beyond embarrassing: 1 toilet for 180 people in Economy and they even broadcast this. The queue for the toilet stretched along the length of the economy class. Qantas, are you serious? Sadly after 4 years of being my go-to airline, Qantas, you are now on my list of totally avoid from now on. I see no way in which you could compete with the culture of leading budget airlines.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

I booked this flight because the scheduled aircraft was an A330-300. it was only when we boarded that I discovered that the aircraft had been substituted.  The seating configuration and the angled flat bed were most uncomfortable A330. The crew were very good and did their best to make up for our disappointment.

Aisle seat as selected and fortunate to have empty middle seat with empty row in front so comfortable space. Was reading and as cabin staff moved through cabin they were kind enough to put my light on without me asking. Light snack, I declined the snack bar as it was not Gluten Free. Cabin crew member said she would find an apple and also brought some Rice crackers but due to wheat added was unable to have. Cabin staff apologised and found a gluten free biscuit.

Cabin is well appointed but amenities provided are very basic, appeared to be like any normal economy class except for the pyjamas. Food and beverage selection and service was mostly average. But the seating comfort and full flat bed comfort was fine. One major issue of this travel was the toilet availability. The business class has only one toilet which kept occupied throughout the flight with a long queue before it! The toilet accessibility was also quite difficult as it was merged with the pantry area.

Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,April 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Brisbane to Christchurch,4.0," |  Brisbane to Christchurch return. Return leg via Sydney. Used the recently refurbished Qantas Business Lounge at Brisbane Airport. A real sanctuary compared with its former self. The attendants on the mezzanine level were friendly, offering hot breakfast options, to make coffee, and assist in any way. Qantas have done well in improving service here. Boarding was quick enough and hassle free. Landed in Christchurch on time and bags on the belt within 10 minutes. My bag was premium tagged and was fourth bag on the belt. Christchurch to Brisbane via Sydney on return was a day of flying I'd rather forget. Our flight to Sydney was delayed by over four hours due to fog at Christchurch and the aircraft being diverted to Auckland for fuel and waiting for fog to lift. As I had an onward connection in Sydney, I inquired at the gate desk with a well rehearsed reply from the gate agent, ""when you get to Sydney, it will be all sorted, someone will be waiting for you at the gate."" Of course, this was not the case, but I did learn that Qantas at Christchurch is contracted and apart from getting passengers on planes, they cannot do much more for you. It was interesting to note that Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 suffered the same fate. Over the PA was announced, ""Singapore Airlines apologises for the delay due to fog etc, we have $20 vouchers for food and beverages."" Qantas passengers were not afforded any such appreciation, and who I might add, had been waiting far longer than Singapore Airlines passengers. Once the Qantas aircraft arrived from Auckland, things seemed to move quicker and soon enough boarding and on the plane. Once departed from Christchurch, the service on board was excellent.  The food was good and there were a couple of water runs on this three hour flight. This flight, albeit late was one of the better ones I have had with Qantas. Once in Sydney, I had a Qantas agent phone me, while still taxiing to the international terminal advising my original flight had been cancelled and I was rebooked onto a 7pm flight to Brisbane. This was so much later than my original 11.30am arrival into Brisbane. As I had a bag checked, I had to take the flight as it was the only one available. The Qantas agent appeared to want to help but could not give me an earlier flight due to unavailability. So, after rechecking my bag through to Brisbane on this later flight, I proceeded to Sydney Domestic and waited in the Qantas Club for the hours to pass by. Thankfully a PA announcement requesting passengers from later flights to go on a 4.30pm flight was announced. I took this up. The Qantas staff at the Qantas Club were helpful but I feared that by changing my flight, my bag would not change with it. Sure enough, after arriving Brisbane, my bag was still in Sydney. Bag was delivered a day later. It was just a day of mishaps, but I was happy with each of the Qantas staff I dealt with.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Seat configuration not ideal as passengers with windows have to climb over passengers in aisles. Best seats are in the middle section so no acrobatics. Overall seats are comfortable however and it may be me when fully reclined I found the seams dig in to my hips making sleep a challenge. They need a bit more padding. Service in both directions was excellent. Cabin staff were attentive. On return journey from Dubai to LHR I received probably the best in-flight service of the past 5 years flying. I am Emerald OneWorld and a frequent flyer.  The food on both journeys was very good, and plenty of choice. Would have preferred more choice of fruit and this seemed limited on the aircraft travelling out of Dubai. Drink selection in particular wine was excellent. Only gripe was the switch at Dubai and getting on and off the aircraft, clearing security again is a hassle. Also the timing of the flight is not ideal from a sleep and managing jet lag. Definitely would take route again. Previously I have flown Singapore Airlines via Singapore and this was my preferred route. So a nice choice to have.",Business,4.0,nan

Nice seats, IFE was a touchscreen and one that I have flown in many times across to Perth. The FA's were very distracted and had to cope with a large number of passengers with special meals. Result was a meal service that was pretty shambolic. Also having been on 12 sectors alone this year on a Qantas A380, A330, fine craft that it is, just simply felt very crowded and a step down from the A380. The return from Singapore was on QF6 and was one of the unrefurbished ones. My tablet has a screen bigger than the IFE, seats had been well used and pretty lumpy. Being a red-eye I imagine Qantas have taken the view that it is no point putting on the new ones as most people will be sleeping rather than watching a screen. Not sure if its the case but the FA's on the A380 service have been consistently better than on the non A380 craft whether to Singapore or domestically. I'm a great fan of Qantas but now long overdue for new aircraft to fly the medium haul routes. The Boeing 787 cannot come soon enough.",Business,3.0,nan

The phone number did not work at all. They then told us to call the international number. Tried using the pay phone but all my coins were exhausted after over a 20 min wait. Eventually got skype working on the wifi and was told I would need to pay over twice the price I paid to fly. Ended up just purchasing tickets with jetstar.

Food was great, crew happy to be there and looked after the passengers during the flight. Amazing the difference having PJs to change into make.

Great online check in, and paperless boarding system as boarding pass is sent to phone and you can use your Frequent flyer card to check in which I regularly do too. Lounge is always clean and lounge staff are extremely helpful. Lounge food is basic but fresh and the drinks are always served with a smile. Seats could be a bit more roomy but they are very reliable with I would say better on time departure KPIs generally in comparison to the alternatives, much more reliable as I have often been delayed when I have been forced to use the alternatives. I once needed to modify my flight to get home urgently to a sick child and although my ticket was not a flexible one they accommodated me at no change cost, upgraded me to business and made sure I was first off the plane.

No meal arrived! 2+ hours into the flight suddenly the lights dimmed to sleep mode and a steward came by 30 mins later and offered me something on a tray - either an apple or a chocolate. I said I'd have both since dinner wasn't served. He said no one wanted dinner this was a sleeping flight. When I said I had been given the dinner menu he muttered something and said ""did I want the whole tray of snacks then?"". I put my call light on later to ask for some water and a female flight attendant asked me if I knew I had the call light on and what did I want. I'll fly JAL next time this was a waste of money. Finally got breakfast before landing which was woeful both in selection and quality with the worst coffee I've had on a plane and that's saying something.

It is the British Airways lounge and fine to while away a few hours. F & B was standard. The washroom amenities in that lounge are pitiful and in need of an upgrade. Regulation flight back to LAX due to late arrival of QF11 and later still due to congestion in the area. This meant an arrival at LAX at 9.35 pm and boarding for the return at 10pm. Unfortunately insufficient time to get up to the lounge which is one of the nicer lounges in the USA for Oneworld. The leg from LAX to Sydney was typical A380, smooth and unremarkable all the way.

For the first time on the Sydney to LA sector, the FA's acknowledged a QFF with gold status in economy, something that Emirates do all the time. A glass of champagne was brought down and most welcome. Nice touch. Otherwise it was a regulation flight on the A380, smooth and comfortable all the way. As always its a mad dash at LAX to get through immigration clearance, pick up bags and recheck and then head to the next departure gate. It's just not as simple as at Dallas FW which is my preferred route to get to NY. The B747 from LAX to JFK has seen better days. Still comfortable to ride in but very noisy in comparison and one that is overdue for retirement. It is nice to be in QF aircraft all the way but to be honest the American Airlines services I have taken from DFW on their newer aircraft are far better (save for the catering) in terms of new aircraft and comfort.

I notice this flight was very uneventful, the team members from the ground and cabin were just not lively at all. They were very robotic and moving through the motions. I know it's Economy Class, but I have high expectations from Qantas. The departure was at 2PM and I was pretty hungry by then, and instead of receiving a reasonable meal I was presented with some crackers and olives. It tasty good, but not well portioned at all. On the positive side, I appreciate the In-Flight Entertainment from the Ipad provided, loving the new movies. Overall, it was a good flight but the duration of a flight should not be a factor of how much service should be provided, standards should be consistent.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I recently flew London to Sydney with Qantas (April 2017) on the A380. This was a surprisingly average experience compared with other airlines. The seating was generally not as comfortable, the food was only just okay (sorry Neil Perry), and the entertainment was the most limited of all the other airlines I have flown. Most disappointing of all was the cabin service. Specifically very slow to clear dishes on trays so passengers are left locked into their space by their trays. Food was slow to be delivered and at one point I did wonder if we were even going to get breakfast. All in all Qantas is now bottom of my list of preferred airlines for business or first class.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

In-flight service was also pretty poor, cabin crew handed out pies which were stone cold, after people started complaining we were given a couple of crackers and a slab of cheese, very poor. Landing at the Gold Coast the disembarking was very slow and the wait for bags was over 30min, Qantas is no longer what it used to be.",Business,1.0,1.0

Qantas made the situation very easy by putting my reservation to their 11:15 departure for Auckland. The Business Lounge was very busy, though being a 11:15 departure that was inevitable. Still, the Lounge had great food and beverages including very attentive staff members. The flight at times was quite turbulent, it affected the timing of meals being served and the overall schedule of the Cabin Crew. The service was definitely quick pace, but I felt the Crew did it with great professionalism and poise without making everything a rush. The food this time around was very delicious, I had a prawn cocktail for my starter, and my main was a Turkish mince lamb pizza. Overall, great job Qantas.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The negatives; they left my bag behind in SYD on the way up to the US (they did forward it on to me in New York, arriving about 30 hours later but it was still inconvenient); the LAX-SYD flight was downgraded to a B744-400 which is a significant downgrade from an A380 (tighter legroom; more crowded; less fresh air); legroom on the B738s is really tight.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

It is now 11:45am and we are awaiting another update at 12:15pm. QF seems to be having a few problems at present. Is it old aircraft or inadequate preventive maintenance or a bit of both.

But the seat in business I can only sleep in for about 3 hours before I get uncomfortable. The screens in Qantas are inferior to Cathay and Emirates. Now the bags in the overheads I usually sit in 1A and the people who fill up my overhead with their bags really annoy me.

Hot chocolate service without peppermint tea although it was mentioned in the menu card. Crew walked through quickly without paying attention to passengers as they did the service had to stop them to get coffee as they just chatted away in their own world while supposedly doing a coffee/tea service. Crew generally okay some better friendlier but there was a senior attendant who seemed unhappy to be on the flight - showing her displeasure with attitude like throwing things around on the trolley and not looking at passengers when serving.

Try and always get a window seat if you can - the extra storage bin on the side is really useful.

After walking through the huge Business Class cabin the Prem Econ cabin feels more intimate and much quieter. I am a big broad guy at 6'2 & around 100kgs and found the seat quite comfy and wide enough. It does not go flat (or close to it) but I was comfortable enough. Doing this trip annually in Business Class - usually on Middle Eastern airlines - I was quite happy to save the $3k-$4k and still have the benefit of fast boarding/check-in and a nice relaxing trip without the excess of a limo to and from the airport etc that you really pay for.

It was evident from their body language that they were not the least bothered about being polite to passengers. I am not saying that all of them were rude but most were. The food was pathetic and in the name of hot food only omelette was served and the quantity and quality of the food was not up to standard.

A couple of hours or so after we departed Sydney the meal trolley came around and we were offered juice soft drinks tea/coffee or wine or beer with the meal only. That was it no tea/coffee trolley after the meal you had your wine/soft drink and coffee with your meal and that was it. Didn't see the staff until breakfast then. This was indicative of the lack of service. One passenger asked for a spare blanket and was told there were none and to put another jumper on. The seats also seemed ""flimsier"" than the other airlines I have used. I have not flown Qantas for years I gave up using them due to the rudeness of the staff which seems it has not changed.

The seats were reclining armchairs which is fine if there is plenty of room between rows but there was not. The consequence of this was that when the lady in front of my husband decided not to eat dinner but recline her seat to its fullest extent he had her head in his lap whilst trying to eat dinner. It was impossible to gain access to the aisle from a window seat without physically clambering over the person seated next to you not good if the person seated next to you is a complete stranger. When I enquired about the entertainment system I was told that there was an iPad in the seat back pocket I thought it was a joke. The iPad was streaming films etc but had to be held or propped up on the tray table impossible to watch and eat at the same time. The ear phone jack plug did not fit properly with constant loss of picture and sound every time you moved. Totally unacceptable in business class.

Outbound flight was pleasant enough because the aircraft was near empty in the rear cabin allowing us to stretch out. Cabin crew accommodating. However I could not eat the main meals offered. Return flight full. The food again was unappealing. Main gripe was that the cabin crew did not request those seated in front of me to put their over-reclined seats upright for meal times. I had to ask the PAX to do so. Based on my previous flights with Qantas it is most apparent that the cabin crew makes all the difference and in this regard Qantas seems to be still a hit and miss affair.,nan,3.0,nan

I had need to fly to Perth for business and these comments take into account recent flights in the last 3 months on airlines as varied as LAN American Air Tahiti and Qantas. Today the excellent staff had to keep apologising for the lack of space on one of the most expensive sectors in the world. Welcome to coffin class - where you pay a fortune for the privilege of sitting in the most uncomfortable seats (and expensive) in the sky. Upright coffins. The passenger in front reclines into you. Your TV screen is at your side at lap level too close and in your face. I'm disgusted at the advertising - lie flat seats to Perth perhaps plain lies. Business class for bad backs forget it.

This is sort of ok but after take off I was asked to swap seats with someone who couldn't get his IFE to work which I was pleased to do but then found myself surrounded by a bunch of passengers who were it seems trying to drink as much alcohol as possible and who invited their mates up from the back of the plane to join in the party which generally took place in the isles or at the front of this cabin. This made for a terrible flight experience as one could neither work nor sleep due to the loud talking and calls for more drinks - which I was slightly surprised to see Qantas staff obligingly provided. On the return travel the staff at the boarding gate insisted on changing my boarding pass to give me one for someone of another name (it was a woman's name as well and I am not a woman) and then arguing with me that this other passenger was me! A bizarre and embarrassing experience to say the least especially as this also held up the boarding process for some time with other passengers glaring at me as if it was all my fault. My guess is that this boarding pass was for a woman who they had given my original seat to.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,3.0,DXB to LHR on A380 Economy Class. I picked up an inexpensive Emirates flight to Hong Kong and one of my options for the DXB to LHR leg was to fly on a code share flight operated by Qantas. I have never flown on the A380 nor have I experienced Qantas before I decided to take this option rather than stick with Emirates for the whole return journey. Sadly I have to say that this was a mistake. Emirates outshines Qantas in just about every respect. The first problem was not of Qantas's making insofar as we were delayed by over 2 hours in Dubai because of the late arrival of flight QF1 from Sydney. Obviously this is beyond the control of the airline. Embarkation was pretty chaotic. There was no call for families with younger children to board first resulting in kids blocking the gangways and frustrated parents attempting to get them into their seats before other passengers came along. Seats in economy are a little wider but they also seem to be lower so I was constantly scraping my shines when trying to extend my legs under the seat in front. There really does not seem to be much room from the seated position to the back of the seat in front of you especially if the person in front decides to recline their seat so watching a movie is not very comfortable. The entertainment on offer is nowhere near that offered by Emirates and as for the food – the best way to describe it was inedible. For supper the offering was a chicken filled wrap and tea or coffee. I know that airline food in economy is hardly considered gourmet class but this offering was disgusting. In comparison the Emirates flight from HKG to DXB offered a fish dish on Thai noodles or a beef bourguignon together with dessert and cheese and a granary bread roll a lot better than a floury disgusting wrap. The inflight entertainment on Qantas can best be described as adequate. Emirates entertainment is far superior. Finally a word or two about the cabin crew. On Emirates the crew members seem to want to help you. On the flight I have just taken it seemed like an Imposition to ask for anything. The crew were all in the galley area and I wandered down to see if I could get a cup of coffee. The looks I got from one stewardess in particular seemed to scream that I was being a pain. I am sorry to be so scathing about Qantas. I was looking forward to the experience of flying with them. Sad to say the expectation greatly exceeded the reality and Emirates will get my custom for all the legs on my next trip to the Far East or beyond.,nan,3.0,nan

The attendants on Emirates are in our opinion more obliging more approachable and must I say a lot younger maybe explaining their increased enthusiasm for their job. This is an observation that we could not help but notice. At the end of the day customer service should be the main priority of these employees and if the enthusiasm and motivation to deliver this service has waned the company has a problem.

Qantas don't have a lounge at this airport but we were given invitations to the ANZ Koru Lounge which is located before the security screening area. It's a comfy lounge with fairly basic catering but a decent selection of beers wines and other drinks in the fridge hot soup breads cheeses and other snacks and good views of the tarmac and airstrip. The flight boarded on time and we were greeted on the aircraft by the smiling CSM. Pre- departure bubbly coats hung safety briefing done and we were away on time. Throughout this short flight the service was faultless the wines were good the food was nicely presented generous in portions and very tasty and we even managed to watch a movie on the seat-back AVOD system. Noise cancelling head sets were provided when we boarded along with a blanket pillow and menu. We found the leather recliner seats to be comfortable enough and although they obviously don't hold a candle to the Emirates A380 product that flies between Australia and NZ they were adequate for a comfortable flight across the ditch. Arrival into Sydney was on time there were no queues at immigration or customs and for the first time the SmartGate worked for both of us!

This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting.

Flight from Santiago to Sydney did not get off to a flying start due to a ridiculous check in system that took 20 minutes at the counter and another 10 minutes waiting in a line for a point to point journey. Unacceptable for business class. Flight was on-time and the Boeing 747 was complete with comfortable fully flat beds which while in a conventional forward layout were incredibly spacious and converted into a full length bed. IFE was AVOD had a good number of options which while not as extensive as some ultra tech savvy carriers like Emirates was wonderfully edited with excellent selections. The food was wonderful with a clear emphasis on fresh food that included a number of options prepared onboard. I loved the flexibility of choosing from an extensive menu at any time instead of the conventional set options at set times. The crew service was mostly exceptionally warm and attentive save for one crew member who seemed totally out of place. SYD-HKG was on an A380 and once again the check in time was far too long although the agent herself was efficient and friendly. Boarding staff greeted me in Hindi. A380 had the same seats and was immaculate. The small lounge area was a nice touch. The catering on this leg was excellent beating the high standards of the previous legs and I can safely say that it was one of the best inflight meals I have had. Crew were friendly attentive relaxed and very efficient. I was overall pleasantly surprised. There are some issues however particularly check in and certain crew and ground members that are marring the work of other staff who are going above and beyond and an airline that is trying to compete with the best in the business and seems to be pretty much up there particularly in terms of product quality.

The lack of a hot breakfast on the 7 hour flight was also disappointing and the breakfast of yoghurt and cinnamon scroll left us very hungry. The overall flight experience was awful.

Check in at Sydney was a little chaotic as the First Class check-in area was overwhelmed by large families of Platinum members using the facility but then having the usual priority immigration and security available to premium travellers I enjoyed the Qantas First Class lounge. An enjoyable spa treatment. The food at the sit down restaurant was one of the best lounge restaurants I have been to. On board service was indeed First Class with staff making sure they knew all passengers by name and able to respond to any queries. The seat itself is comfortable and infinitely adjustable although the controls for it are rather complex and take a little time to get used to. Made up as a bed it is easy to get sleep with adequate privacy and space to sleep on one's side and upright it is good for relaxing eating and working. Inflight pyjamas were better than those provided by other airlines and the amenities kit more useful as well. The massage function is enjoyable although a bit noisy. Quality of food for dining was excellent although it would have been helpful to know that the supper menu either side of the Dubai transit was nearly identical. Large range of food items although I thought the dessert selection was rather poor and the champagne in the lounge was better than that inflight. Inflight entertainment system excellent with a good choice and high quality screen and headphones. Transit at Dubai is pleasant at the enormous Emirates First Class lounge although at the time I travelled the spa was closed and it wasn't entirely clear when the boarding announcement would be. On arrival at London we had the same experience as other travellers and it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive - hardly priority. As an added touch it was good to be able to use the AA Arrivals lounge for a shower and a quick cup of coffee before heading into town.

The bad points; seats in economy are possibly the most cramped and un-comfortable of any airline I have ever flown with even the newer 737-800 aircraft have a very tired and old look and feel inside some of FA's seem to just go through the motions and boarding at Perth Airport is just a cattle stampede but that is not all down to Qantas.

This was my worst air travel decision and flight experience ever in 40 years. The customer focus of cabin staff from the point of boarding to alighting on the two legs outward bound legs of the journey were appalling and I cannot think of anything positive to say. The return journey was only marginally better and the cramped condition of economy seating cleanliness of the plane poor standard of food and inattentive crew made the long haul flight for the most part unbearable. I would usually rate Qantas as an adequate carrier no more no less but it's ticketing partner Emirates will do nothing to improve the perception of Qantas' reputation.

What shocked me was the food offering. Since when did flying Qantas become a no frills airline in terms of food. Served in cardboard boxes the food was uninspired. Breakfast was a hard cold cake/bread type of ""thing"" along with yoghurt and granola. The coffee was dreadful. Dinner was a cold chicken and potato salad. What shocked me was that you used to get a proper breakfast and dinner hot and quite tasty for airline food. The food was delivered so quickly and taken away so quickly it was like being in a cheap cafeteria. While Sydney Airport is immaculate and very well presented Melbourne Airport was dirty and looking very worn. Sydney Airport was renovated for the Olympics and is well maintained and updated. Melbourne looks like it did 10 years ago and like it hadn't been touched in 10 years especially in terms of maintenance.

Just before boarding our baby pram was taken from us saying it will be given to us in Singapore. The pram was not given to us in Singapore as we exited the aircraft. To collect the pram we had to cross immigration and collect it from the baggage carousel. Singapore onwards was covered by Qantas and was a dream. Ironically I had the best inflight Indian food on any airline and this was on the Qantas flight between Singapore and Melbourne. Seats were spacious in economy class throughout - to Melbourne and even within Australia. The cabin crew were always helpful - always enquiring if our 2 children (7 yrs and 14 months) were comfortable and if they could do something for us. All calls were promptly attended. If the flight had empty seats we were allotted seats with empty seats next to us to provide additional room due to kids. Inflight entertainment was excellent with latest movie releases and media content to address all age groups. On the return leg from Cairns to Delhi our Qantas flight out of Cairns was delayed and consequently we would have missed our international connecting flight out of Brisbane.

The seat itself was rather narrow and the seat pitch was rather narrow (and I have a height of 5ft 5!). However we can attribute this to the size of the aircraft. The Flight Attendants themselves were fantastic and were overall bright and cheerful for the early flight time despite one haughty young woman (no more than 20) who was leering and smile-less for the entire flight. When I merely asked her for a blanket and pillow she gave me a scowl as if it were the hardest thing for her to do. However the overall flight was great. On to the A380 service to HKG. The seat pitch was more than sufficient and the width was great. The IFE screen was large and had more than enough entertainment for the 9 hour flight. The Flight Attendants were bright and cheerful for the whole flight and the catering of lunch and pizza bread refreshment was hot and fresh - probably due to the introduction of induction ovens on the A380. Overall a great Qantas experience.,nan,5.0,nan

Demonstrated excellent customer care service from my point of view. Nothing was too small or big a deal to ask about and I felt genuine warmth from the cabin crew even after over many hours of catering to everybody else's needs both on my way to LAX and returning from LAX. The cancelled flights in L.A resulted in Qantas putting us up in a Hilton Hotel in Anaheim and we even got food vouchers!

When I questioned why I was told there wasn't where else to put it.

My long flight from Sydney to Dubai was rendered intolerable by a crying infant but the comments that follow concern only the Qantas provision. Cabin crew: brusque and uninterested in passengers. From start to finish all members gave the impression they had a lot of hard work to do. Why is a smile something so difficult to provide? There was no pre-service of aperitifs (even though aperitifs were listed on the menus handed out at the start). The food was excellent: I really enjoyed the taste of all that was offered on both legs of my SYD-LHR trip. Wine appeared to be supplied grudgingly and there was no offer of ""seconds"" of coffee — routine on BA flights. Legroom on the A380 was adequate. The plane was clean. The seats were not comfortable — after a bit their hard pressure on the backs of the thighs became annoying.

We enjoyed the return trip from Sydney to London via Dubai. Unfortunately the Sydney-Fiji-Sydney route was a disaster it was operated by Fiji Airways.

Crew were friendly and efficient and with a little prodding provided me a set of PJs (albeit XL). Food was surprisingly good - had the linguine with sardines and tomato. Flight departed on time and arrived slightly early - almost a first for Qantas. The return flight is a nasty overnighter departing around 7.20pm local time and arriving around 6.30am to Sydney. Sleep is very uncomfortable on the older angled beds (Airbus A330) so only dozed for around 2 hours. Again the food offering was good but the airline is definitely penny pinching offering only a 'supper' (instead of full dinner) and a 'cafe style' breakfast rather than the previous a la carte service. Crew were outstandingly friendly and efficient - a real credit to the airline in this instance. Qantas IFE is still amongst the best in the skies in terms of choice  although my screen did crackle a little on both legs (seat 3K). The sooner Qantas buys the new planes (eg B787) the better - the older A330s with the old business class simply don't compete with the other major carriers. A refurb is due later this year but it's too slow given the current offering by competitors.,nan,3.0,nan

I had seat 1C going there and 2C on the return journey. The seats are very uncomfortable for Business these days. They are very angled and with the bulkhead directly in front of me on the trip there and the seat pod on the way back the seating felt very claustrophobic. The fact that Qantas still does not have all aisle access seats in 2014 is beyond me and in both directions kept being woken up by my neighbour clambering over me during the night. On QF 21 I ha the crew going into the storage cupboard all night and banging the door shut again disturbing my sleep. The food now supplied in Qantas business is pitiful. I think the Asian and Middle Eastern airlines serve a better meal in their Economy cabin than Qantas does in its Business cabin. Furthermore they have done away with the refreshment hot towels. On both legs towels were offered only once and that was just before landing in Sydney nothing on the flight to Narita! The crew on the flight to Narita would have preferred to be anywhere else except on that flight. The crew on the return flight were better but cannot be compared to the Middle eastern airlines crew for attitude and service. I am a Platinum member of Qantas but will not fly them again on an international flight on an aircraft operated by them. The cost cutting is very evident in the services provided to their Customers.

However as I am still a Qantas Gold member I decided to remain loyal and travel back to Brisbane (via Sydney) from Bangkok. This flight used to have Premium Economy but since the introduction of the 330 aircraft there is only Business or Economy and so because of the exorbitant price for Business Class ($3920) I chose to travel Economy. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable with a ridiculously small amount of leg room (I am only 178cm so I have no idea how a tall person would cope). The seat fabric and carpet was very worn and faded and stained and the entertainment system only worked for the first 2 hours of my return trip. The food was terrible but thankfully the wine was good. However by far the worst issue is the FA's most of them have obviously been in their jobs way too long and no longer seem to enjoy what they do and show it through their couldn't care less attitude and lack of attentiveness to their customers.

I had a rack of lamb for dinner with some quality wine. What I'm not happy with though are the Business Class seats. They are very ordinary indeed and there are much better offerings available from many other airlines. The seats are ageing lack storage space and seem to have functions that no longer work - at least my seat was like this. Wobbly armrest and a TV that wouldn't lock down in place. The footrest is particularly uncomfortable as in its folded position it sits ""proud"" of the rest of the seat. The tray table was unsteady and made for some interesting balancing acts for food and drinks. There is very limited space to put drinks on the narrow shared arm rest between seats with not enough room for two drinks to sit side by side. If you have a window seat you don't have direct access to the aisle and end up having to leap over the person next to you if they have their seat extended for sleeping. Even with the new ""mattress"" to put on top of the seat for sleeping the seat is still hard and you end up with sore hips / back after a short period of lying down.

Hot lunch was served which was satisfying and beer/wine was offered throughout the flight. Good range of IFE for a domestic economy flight. Overall very pleased with experience.

On one flight I boarded with an upset stomach and the flight attendant brought me some quality white wine from business class which helped enormously. Generally very full flights but on-time departures. I especially appreciated the careful route track selection to avoid headwinds on the westbound flights and to take advantage of these strong westerly winds for the eastbound flights meaning all flights either arrived exactly on time or were early. The Perth Qantas Club lounge is huge but at peak hour is still somewhat difficult to find space to sit down. Qantas have very annoying and intrusive people mover buggies sounding their warning sirens while moving around their Brisbane terminal (also the same in Sydney and Melbourne) - and mostly just transporting crew and friends about - what's wrong with a bell or soft honking horn as is the case in terminals such as Hong Kong?

Excellent seat designs and seat pitch. The Economy Class food was a choice from three and these were premium selections and were considerate towards passengers with special dietary needs such as vegetarian. Premium selection of alcohol wine and soft drinks and with every hour the cabin crew did drink rounds. A snack bar was provided for passengers at the rear of the aircraft. The In-Flight Entertainment had ample choice of videos but their audio selections weren't as great as Virgin Airline's RED. Cabin crew were polite and civilized towards passengers. However I was scrutinizing the tiny details that would have made the flight truly exceptional compared to its competitors. The check-in personnel at BNE could not fully advise me on the cutoff time to drop bags with its codeshare partner Alaska Airlines. Qantas did not play any cabin music during boarding which would have set the ambience. No amenity kits were handed out for Economy PAX. The toilets were kept clean but had only basic toiletries (hand soap). No in-seat power for your electronic devices. Some TV channels on the IFE did not stream and there were no onboard internet.

The new look cabins and uniforms were also nice and a great improvement. I am a short person so leg room doesn't bother me but it could be a bit restricting for a taller person. The only draw back was I couldn't get the complimentary ipad to work and neither could my travelling companion however having a decent movie to watch compensated for this.

I would also suggest they get back to basics with the menu and ditch Neil Perry.

If you get a good Qantas cabin crew you will get some of the world's best. Perhaps a word should also be said for the level of engineering and technology that we take for granted these days: it simply amazes me that an aircraft (747-400 in this case) can transport us accurately for 14 hours non-stop over the remote Antarctic Ocean in absolute comfort and safety and also arrive at destinations within one minute of scheduled times - incredible.,nan,5.0,nan

Boarded aircraft at LHR and offered a drink however once finished glasses collected and despite a 2 hour delay nothing further was offered. Not sure what the current procedures are on Qantas however once the plane had finally taken off it was another 2 hours before a meal or drinks service was offered bringing the aggregated time of almost 4 hours without any service. This is simply not acceptable when compared with the competition. Once the service had commenced the food and drink offering was significantly more Spartan than previous trips on the carrier. The stopover in Dubai was OK - the emirates business lounge was enormous however the one thing that was not sufficient were the shower facilities with a 30 mins wait despite the overall lounge being almost the size of a football field! Once on route to Sydney service again was slow following take off demonstrating that the London leg was not a one off. The IFE package was however excellent and the seats on board very comfortable. Something that does seem a waste of time is the so called on board business lounge and self service bar. Tiny area with the offering at bar comprising of a half drunk bottle of red wine 3 cans of coke and 3 packets of crisps. If this is the offering suggest that Qantas consider removing this facility and replace it with additional toilets as every time I went to use these facilities there was a 10-15 wait which is something one hopes to avoid in business class. On arrival in Sydney everything worked like clockwork and returned to the levels of service that I had previously associated with Qantas.

Very efficient friendly professional mature and younger female FA's. Food was nice particularly good from BNE. Hot chocolate ice creams and fruit served during the flight.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,I have always received excellent service from Qantas. In particular I thoroughly enjoyed a recent A380 flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne. The flight attendants were friendly yet professional and the A380 was great too. I particularly loved the self-serve snack bar and in-flight entertainment on the A380 as well as how quiet the aircraft is. Despite flying in economy I managed to get a good rest on the overnight flight. The plane departed and arrived on time too.

First question why don't airlines and I only fly Qantas place families with children throughout the aircraft and not in a designated area on the plane preferable at the rear of the plane. Secondly we had a miserably crew flying back (a great crew flying up) it seems that returning crew are not that interested in serving or smiling and on this flight took ages to serve a simple meal. I am a real fan of Qantas and will always support them but on this occasion this flight was not what I expect from Qantas.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Caught flight from MEL-DXB-LHR. I'm always concerned when I catch a flight because in all reality it comes down to two things - food and staff. I have said it before and I will say it again Qantas needs to dump Neil Perry. His food selections and food inspirations are 'tripe' and while some people enjoy that most don't. On the other hand the staff were great. Acknowledged me by name and were very attentive. All in all a good flight but one that will always be marred due to the food IFE was OK buy could do with a wider selection.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,I flew Sydney to Christchurch in economy class. Check in went very smoothly and staff were very helpful. There was a 45 minute delay for the flight. But the airline did apologize for it and said that it was due to bad weather. When we boarded we were welcomed by a smiling and friendly cabin crew. The plane was a brand new 737-800 which had an almost spotless cabin. The seats were very comfortable with plenty of leg room and a reasonably sized IFE. The food was great and was very filling.

We were lucky enough to snag seats 32 J&K which are a pair of bulkhead seats in the economy section on the upper deck. It was a peaceful oasis at the back of the plane. Seats were comfortable and we had plenty of legroom due to the bulkhead. Storage bin in the side was excellent for storing handbags coats etc for easy access. Service from staff was excellent. Very friendly and efficient. Food was surprisingly very good. Drinks and fruit/snacks were offered regularly throughout the flight. I hope we are able to snag these seats again next time we fly. So much better than the downstairs economy section. IFE was good with plenty of movies games TV shows and music to choose from. All in all a very satisfying flying experience.,nan,5.0,nan

There was a medical emergency on the flight and I thought I would not make the connecting flight. The crew got me off and had someone escort me to my other flight. That was amazing considering this was not a Oneworld partner. Qantas really stood out from the pack!,nan,5.0,nan

If I had paid for this poor excuse for business class I would be more annoyed than I am already. Old scruffy dirty seats that obviously are or were Premium. Food slop (get rid of Perry!) Only two choices of wine? Never would I fly short haul business international ever again with Qantas. So very overpriced and certainly not what you would expect in (supposedly) Business Class. Flew Emirates BNE/Auckland. Chalk and cheese. What business should be! After almost 40 years with Qantas I now give up. I am at the age to want to enjoy comfort when travelling but will be looking at other airlines as if this is business on Qantas - forget it.,nan,1.0,nan

Very cute little lounge area at the nose of the cabin to chat to passengers over a glass of wine and watch a large TV monitor. Configuration of 2+2+2 is a little more cramped than SIA (see earlier review) but still relatively acceptable. Although seat width is smaller by far the flat bed is very comfortable. Good food and wine. Altogether a great experience if one's upgrade application to use points has been successful. Would definitely choose another off peak flying date and repeat the journey to DXB on the flagship A380.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight great and a wide selection of IFE. The staff were friendly and even made a mandarin announcement for a Chinese tour group on board while we were delayed at SYD on the tarmac due to a late departing aircraft at our gate. Return trip was QF524 on Boeing 763 with ipads available. Again staff excellent and friendly. Only comment on both flights is that the cost cutting is quite evident with shrinking portions and less options (even at meal times).

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,4.0,QF3 and QF4 Sydney/ Honolulu return. Having read the dire reports of this particular route we went equipped with an extra inflatable cushion each plus a neck roll. The seats were not as bad as we expected although as cramped as you would expect in Economy. The price for travelling Business on this route is outrageous. Boarding at Sydney was a complete shambles. All the departure boards announced that the gate was open. However when you arrived at the gate there was a surly security man ordering everyone to sit in a holding bay next to the gate. Countless people turned up at the gate and explained that the boards said it was open to be given no explanation but ordered to sit elsewhere. The problem was that there was a JetStar flight to Honolulu that was late leaving and all their passengers were also in the holding bay. There was not one announcement as to what was going on. Occasionally a passenger would be called by name and allowed through but the rest of us had to stand and endure the glare from the security man. Eventually a woman security person turned up and was much more amenable but was muttering about 'security' procedures. Eventually they opened the gate and all the passengers went through. By this time the Qantas and Jet Star passengers were all mixed up and of course after the Jetstar flight had been called and was about to close there was one poor passenger who was still mingling in with the Qantas passengers and almost missed his flight! It was then announced that it was the 'late arrival of the cleaners' that had caused the problem. Total shambles. Onboard the cabin crew were cheerful and willing to help. The service of drinks is a bit bizarre they don't serve a drink before the meal so if you don't want wine (which was vile) you end up having a gin and tonic or other aperitif with your meal. Or not as the case may be. On the return leg I asked for a G & T they said they would bring one back but never did. I couldn't be bothered to ask again. The food was fairly awful. My husband had something described as pearl cous cous it looked like spider's eggs and tasted of nothing! The ice cream after dinner was the best part of the meal service. The Ipads are a complete waste of time the sound is terrible and after trying to get two or three to work we gave up. The staff must hate them as they seem to spend a lot of time sorting them out! On the way back boarding at Honolulu was very well organised. The plane was full but the cabin staff again were very good. Two of the call buttons got stuck and kept pinging every few seconds for about two hours but eventually they managed to stop the noise. Again the food was forgettable. All flights were on time and we arrived safely so that's what counts but 10 hours was quite long enough!,nan,4.0,nan

These flights are excellent and interesting and offer (if one is lucky) unbelievable views of the Antarctic Ice Shelf especially at this time of the year as the aircraft follows the necessary 'Great Circle Route' to and from Australia. Top professional service and a sense of a quality product on these 747 flights .I only wonder why Qantas doesn't offer Premium Economy Seating on its A330 flights into Asia as does Cathay Pacific.

If you would like to be critical the iPads take a while to get working if they don't work all together the cabin crew are very quick to replace it with another most of the time it was just a matter of turning it off and re booting. Both the domestic flights were also good as we travelled with a family of four we also found the baggage allowance of two check ins per person by 23 kg fantastic.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,2.0,MEL-SIN on an A330. As a long time QFF I was a little disappointed with many aspects of this flight. Our flight was delayed 2 hours due to 'faulty cockpit part' which had to be flown down from Brisbane. My partner and I travelled in Economy - the seats were dated with little leg room. The entertainment system was old tired and responded poorly to commands from the remote. The food was reasonable with a tasty side salad and a good offering of drinks and wine. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The flight was three quarters full so we were able to spread out during meal times. We arrived late but gladly at one of the best airports in the world - Changi. On international routes (aside from its flagship MEL/SYD-DBX-LHR) Qantas compares poorly with competitive modern and innovative Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. I suspect most Australians who fly Qantas do so for the QFF points - which day by day diminish in value and are harder to earn. Particularly on a route to Singapore the options for better cheaper and more modern travel are best serviced by Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Offering the more popular Premium Economy options is one way. More modern aircraft (think: Dreamliners and A380s) and a more diverse menu offering are other helpful ideas.

The A380 mini Business Class Cabin with three rows is quiet and comfortable. My ear phones were not working and a couple of FA's offered to have me sit in the lounge to watch a movie which I did and they brought me a snack. The device did work afterwards in my seat. The flat bed really helps on a 15 hour flight. The food service was great. FA's were ready to offer any food and beverage throughout the flight. SYD-DFW had a great crew- exceptional attentive personal service. Chose 5J on the reconfigured 747-400ER and love that solo window/aisle seat. Food was good breakfast is the best and presented to you from the galley- not on a cart. ( pancakes fresh fruit smoothie/energiser drink tea toast with jam - you will not find this in the U.S.). Great conversation with a FA during landing as the Crew seat is in front of the 5A/5J seats. Slept for 7 hours on the 14 hour flight love the flat beds and the option for a mattress cover and blanket/pillow to add to the comfort. FA's are so eager to make up the bed unlike Domestic/U.S. airlines. This was one of the best experiences flying internationally second to Cathay Pacific.,nan,5.0,nan

Despite a lunch service and 1.30pm arrival wine not offered but I think you could request it.

Service on the Dubai - London legs both ways from the London based crews was absolutely superb. Professional friendly slick. I would fly Qantas every single time without hesitation if this was the standard. Unfortunately the service from the Australian crews on the Melbourne - Dubai legs both ways was kind of amateurish. Hot towels given out to one side of the cabin and not the other; crews coming through and starting to deliver pyjamas water and amenities kit without noticing that this had already been done; some customers receiving drink orders before dinner while others did not. The list goes on. Not earth shattering but disappointing. Row 12 is excellent with very few distractions or noise.

Whilst Qantas still advertise a basic amenities kit on both flights these were not offered. I found the staff service was friendly and efficient. As a gold FF member I put in for points upgrade and was lucky to get short DXB to LHR leg on outbound flight but would seem very hard now to get an upgrade on this flight. The possibility of the upgrade is why I choose Qantas over Singapore Airlines. Return flight home was delayed by 3 hours with an SMS notification which was later updated to inform the flight was on time only to turn up to the airport for and find out the flight was delayed so a 6 hour wait at Heathrow. The flight was only half full so I extra space made the seating more comfortable than it would have if packed in.

Excellent service from FA's. Meals can be a little inconsistent but have generally found this when the catering is resourced from London in particular. As a comparison my wife travelled out earlier on Emirates also on their A380 service. Same metal but more cramped and an inconsistent level of service from the FA's.

Surprised at the poor quality of food curry or lamb stew on Dubai leg the curry AGAIN or macaroni cheese on Sydney leg. Breakfast was a muffin so arrived in Dubai hungry had to buy breakfast from pain quotidien which was best meal on the trip! Crew were very ordinary.

The crew were terrible. They were miserable rude and surly - with the exception of the cabin manager who was trying hard to make up for the rest of the crew. A passenger in front of me asked for some ice with his drink. The attendant called (yelled) to another attendant in the galley for ice who yelled back down the aisle that there was none. She then made an excuse that no ice is loaded on such short flights. After the fuss died down a miraculous cup of ice was delivered to the man by the cabin manager.

Bag drop at Melbourne and check-in at Alice Springs (no check-in kiosks) were easy. Due to strong winds which affected the incoming plane the Alice Springs to Melbourne flight operated about an hour late. On the 4½ hour flight to Darwin a pleasant cold breakfast was served (yoghurt muesli etc) and just before landing a couple of biscuits and mineral water. On the return flight from Alice Springs my vegetarian roll looked better than the squishy meat pies and sauce served to the other passengers. The seats were comfortable enough for the flight sectors. The second flight was booked using Emirates frequent flyer points. Unlike a previous experience there was no problem checking in online via the Qantas (not Emirates) website 24 hrs beforehand.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,We travelled to Melbourne from Dubai on QF110 in economy last month. I have flown Qantas for forty years and each time I fly the seats are more cramped and the service is reduced. Never again. My seat 67B would suit a child of 12y or younger. My knees came to within 5cm of the seat in front of me and when the girl in front lowered her seat it was right in my face. I could not stand up to get out of the seat but had to crawl across the seats to get out. I am 70 years old so this distressed me and I could not face 13 hours in such a cramped situation. The staff were kind and as the plane was not full (am I surprised!) my partner agreed to move to another seat freeing up the three seats for me and allowing me to lie down. We had already flown 7 hours from Madrid with a 2hr stop over in Dubai so were very tired. I slept for a few hours on the mini seats but the armrests don't completely disappear so it was very uncomfortable. We had 2 meals in 13 hours all forgettable. However the wine helped. I am not heartless and did swap places with my partner to allow him to lie down too for a while.,nan,2.0,nan

The seat was very very comfortable the service was exceptional and the main course was delicious although not so the rather boring pumpkin empanadas that I chose for starter. Qantas flight attendants are some of the most attentive and professional I have come across. The amenity kit was nice and included what one would expect. The printed menu was a bit too casual and three were left for me which was a bit confusing because they were all different. It took me a while to realise (small letters which I find hard to read) that two were from the previous Sydney to Santiago and Santiago to Rio legs (on 11 June the Rio service was a special for the World Cup). Qantas certainly are well above the average and are different in many ways from other airlines. They try to be so different that they do not have a sign for the Business or First classes check in areas in Australia but instead there is just one in black that says Service. This is annoying and idiotic. I went the length of Sydney domestic terminal trying to find the Business class check in area which of course I did not find and was directed to the 'Service' area by a Qantas employee.,nan,4.0,nan

The food was an inedible tasteless disappointment with no choice as to what you would like. Lucky we brought some snacks from home! No seatback IFE only a shared boring movie on a screen I could not even see. Come on Qantas entertainment is available on Jetstar for a cost but who cares. How can you expect people to just sit there for 3.5 hours. The small shared screens are an absolute joke. Please either use newer planes with IFE flights 3+ hours or give out ipads Q streaming as is done on the 767. Flight back was on the new VH-XZO with IFE and the food was a lot better and with choice this time. What a difference it was like flying a completely different airline. I really hope these inconsistencies are dealt with. I have always been a fan of our national carrier but why pay more if you are getting less then budget airlines are offering.

Both legs of the flight were really well done (very good crew) and good food - the omelette with fetta and smoked salmon at breakfast before landing in Sydney was especially good. The bed worked well - it is the first time I have slept solidly on a plane (and I have flown in Business many times). It was quite amusing seeing the mature FA wrestle the bed cover on with such vigour! I reckon she could take down any recalcitrant passengers easily!

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,I'm putting in a late review for travel Darwin-Sydney and return in early June because I was impressed by their handling of the ash cloud disruptions. Unlike another airline that completely mishandled my bookings Qantas called me regularly rescheduled flights quickly and allowed free changes to connecting flights that I couldn't make because of a problem with a different airline. That's generally the biggest plus about Qantas - their customer service and ground organisation is efficient and problems are generally resolved quickly. Inflight the experience was good with nothing special. Medium-quality food. Service appears to improved drastically compared to a few years ago. Quality individual IFE on the 737 from Darwin-Sydney but the 737 in the opposite direction didn't have individual IFE - which really seems outdated for a 4 hour flight on a major airline.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight back to LAX 3/7/14 delayed due to storm boarded aircraft but sat on tarmac waiting. That is acceptable however the temperature in the economy section was dangerous even a crew member said it must be over 40 degrees. Of course the back section was the only hot area. The captain made several apologies but we still roasted. Food on this flight was a disgrace. Crew were great and agreed all was not good. Also the entertainment system had not been changed from the June program. A380 back to SYD 9/7/14 paid extra for exit row on upper deck discovered that this is really a walkway for passengers to get to the toilet. Food once again below standard wine some generic brand and no pre-dinner drinks allowed. One new film had been added to the menu.

If you compare the Qantas IFE to the ICE entertainment on Emirates I actually found the Qantas one to be slightly more appealing. This is because there were more recent movies that were actually attracting aboard Qantas whereas for Emirates it is just sheer breadth but the amount of movies that I actually wanted to watch was just a handful. As I have a habit of collecting playing cards from airlines I travel with I found it slightly frustrating that you have to actually have to buy it aboard Qantas whereas you get it for free onboard airlines such as LH CX KA EK SQ AY. Nevertheless the seat pitch comfort and food service were top notch for economy. What stood out the most were the most friendliest cabin crew who did not hesitate to help during any time of the flight. As there was a tight connection I love how the ground staff isolated passengers connecting on EK380 upon disembarkation in Dubai so they could speed us through immigration and transfer.,nan,4.0,nan

When we boarded our flight in Dubai on Friday 8 August there was neither a baby nor a bassinet to be seen. They had simply given our front row seats to two other passengers rather than letting us have our reserved seats back. If this is how the Qantas/Emirates codeshare works I want no part of it. The Purser on the flight was bemused as he told us that they were not expecting any baby or bassinet at 43B and C. Also our flight from Dubai to Sydney was going on to Auckland and the menu for breakfast arriving in Sydney was almost identical to that for the Sydney to Auckland sector just some subtle changes. I have no idea what the Trans-Tasman passengers were actually served as our flight was diverted to Brisbane for fuel when Sydney airport closed due to fog. Our flight arrived in Sydney about 11.00 instead of 06.00.

Soon after take off they distributed water bottles which was appreciated as nowadays with the rules on bringing fluids in the plane I tend to forget to get that bottle on the other side of customs. Our hostess was very friendly genuinely interested in the passengers she was serving and smiling even at the end of the very long flight. Plenty to choose from the on board entertainment system and a very smooth flight. I will certainly consider flying Qantas again for the long haul flights.,nan,4.0,nan

After making the booking Qantas changed the flight time which reduces the gap between the two flights just to 30 minutes. This was not a big issue however simply put the seat pitch and width made it one of the most uncomfortable long haul journey with my wife and two kids. EK417 seat pitch is 32-34 in with 18in width whereas QF2 seats were 17.5in wide with only 31in pitch hard to move in and out very painful with the front seats reclined. Besides that the service was better than Emirates (flew on Emirates Sydney-Dubai on the same trip). Emirates served meals thrice whereas on QF2 it was twice.

I regularly travel to USA and have never encountered that. Travelled to Phuket with the kids and shunned Jetstar (who fly direct) and paid extra to fly Qantas via Bangkok. The kids really had their hearts set on in-seat entertainment and games so we decided the extra money wasn't too much and the extra 4 hours it added to the trip wasn't a big deal if it kept them quiet. Well what a mistake that was! Qantas in-flight entertainment was poor on the way over and non-existent on the way home. Said there was a ""Technical Fault"" on the return and apologised at the end but really? The planes are just too old. I tried to watch a movie but the ""buffering"" and jumping made that impossible - I gave up after the 2nd attempt and just went to sleep. Ordered Duty free when the hostess came around approx 40 mins into the trip (6.25pm departure from BKK) and tried my best to stay awake but was woken at 3.30am when she finally arrived with it (but had the order wrong anyway).

Food and wine were fantastic and the crew personalised the service by using my name this is a nice touch and not all airlines do this.

This particular flight was BKK-SYD and I was just relieved I was able to secure an aisle seat (with the added bonus of the spot next to me being unoccupied). Online check in was not available for this flight for some mysterious reason. The cabin crew need a lesson in grooming and customer service ASAP. All of them looked bored and somewhat angry. The service as usual was disinterested and disconnected. Breakfast was just thrown at the passengers. One of the ladies looked like she just rolled out of bed and one of the male attendants needs to shave so as one doesn't look like they've been awake for 24 hours. The food service was mediocre (as usual). Most notable was their 'breakfast' which was a small muffin yoghurt and orange juice.

This trip turned into a nightmare due to an unimaginable 'operations' decision that adversely impacted the travel plans of 50-100 passengers. As background QF runs the JFK-LAX flight for passengers going onwards to Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane. It is a huge convenience as there is no need to change terminals at LAX no need to go through TSA security a second time and generally better to fly QF transcontinental USA than the US carriers except on this night. That said the JFK-LAX flight on this particular evening was running about one hour behind schedule due to late arrival of the aircraft and typical JFK evening delays - this isn't all that unusual and the delay not all that long. For inexplicable reasons however Qantas chose not to hold the LAX-MEL flight for all of the passengers on the JFK-LAX flight who were Melbourne bound. Even with the one hour delay on the domestic leg we still arrived LAX before the scheduled departure time of the overseas leg and the LAX-MEL flight was running 30 minutes behind as well so Qantas had no legitimate reason not to hold the flight for another 30 minutes or so to get all Melbourne passengers on board. This forced all 50-100 of us to fly a packed B747 instead of the more comfortable A380 lost seat assignments and change planes in Sydney which is more complicated than you would think (domestic and international terminals aren't close and there is no easy from one to the other) and even worse added approximately five hours to the trip. It is inexcusable and Qantas has been unapologetic and unresponsive to emails I've written them about their decisions on that evening. It is no wonder that their international business is suffering - on this evening they disrupted the travel plans and offended 50-100 passengers with one very poor decision.,nan,1.0,nan

A car was booked. It should have been there end of story. Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day. That is not ""first class"". 2) Baggage. Qantas advertises that First Class bags will be ""among the first"" to be delivered off the plane. On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry. Avocado was unripe. Pancakes were also dry and overcooked. Coffee was weak and burnt. That is all. 4) The champagne. Qantas advertises three varieties.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,An eight hour wait at Changi airport I assume because it's more important to Qantas to fill their plane to capacity than it is to schedule enough services to avoid excessive waiting times. The inflight service was awful. I'm a vegetarian so get meals served before other passengers and I can only assume this is a crime on Qantas flights. On Flight QF52 from Changi on Saturday 20/09/2014 I got my meal slapped in front of me about an hour into the flight and then the tray sat there for around two hours whilst everyone else was served and their trays collected. I would guess I was probably the last passenger to have their tray taken away. By the time one of the stewardesses took the tray I had back pain and was cramped from being trapped in one position for so long. Likewise I got my breakfast shoved at me before everyone else too and what a breakfast - a stale croissant and a sachet of awful tasting marmalade. I was given only a spoon with which to slice my stale croissant and spread the marmalade and when I requested a knife and a sachet of butter I was grudgingly given the knife but butter was obviously out of the question. Personally I think passengers seated near babies should be given a decent discount because it's simply unfair to be forced to spend long flights being prevented from sleep by crying babies.

Because of this we and many others missed connecting flights. Qantas on time performance is a joke. They got us to Singapore an hour late and nearly matched it on the way back.

nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,Due to fly QF8006 Business to BNE via Dubai. No airline communication but Chauffeur rang to ask us if we knew anything about flight being cancelled. No. Rang Qantas who knew nothing and then Emirates who knew less (Codeshare). Eventually transpires mechanical problem with Airbus delay at least until 11.45 am (departure due 22.15 today). We need to get to BNE so suggest less attractive flight available (with seats and originally lower cost) from BHX or MAN. QF say Emirates unwilling to reroute us Emirates say unable to alter as only QF have the ability to do this! An hour spent on telephone to all corners of the globe and finally both QF and EK agreed they need to do something and we should wait. Number given for direct contact. No call from either airline but chauffeur rings us to ask if we know what is happening (No) and arranges to pick us up at 4.30 am to get to Heathrow. So arrive at least 13 hours late in Dubai means we miss connecting BNE flight (only one per day) and arrive at best 24 hours later than planned. An extra 24 hours travelling. Do you think we will use QF/EK again? Zero communication ability from airlines.,nan,2.0,nan

The attention and service is very nice bigger seats and plenty of legroom but I feel somewhat let down by the catering. It's very nice to have a gin and tonic for a pre lunch drink but do I need the pretzels they also serve in economy. There were only two mains offered a hot and cold option hot being duck which I don't eat and the cold being couscous. The meal was nice enough but expect a bit more for Business Class. A warm bread roll and small bowl of fruit made up the meal and later Maggie Beer ice cream. A beautiful Riesling was served throughout the meal while partner opted for red and assured me that both were extremely good labels. While the overall experience is very nice I would like that little bit extra in Business food wise that distinguishes it from Economy. Perhaps because the economy product is generally very good is the problem - after all you get cheese and crackers on some flights a hot meal and ice cream too.

IFE of good standard with a great selection of movies and recent TV shows. Very comfortable seat and nice turndown service. Seat turns in a bed and I managed to sleep 6 1/2 hours on my way back from LAX. Not so fortunate on my way to LAX but crew kept me happy with good quality snacks and drinks during the entire flight. Did not use lounge in BNE as I am not overly impressed by this lounge. New lounge in LAX very nice but too small to handle all passengers departing on various QF flights in the evening.

No in seat entertainment even though it was a new A330. Seats had slots for iPads but no iPads on board. When someone asked steward explained that it was a new plane that was waiting for fit out which sounds like nonsense to me. No kids pack (same on the way over). We travel frequently with kids. The last time was July and this is the first time no kids pack has been offered. Must be something else QF has decided to cut costs on. Food was average at best. My wife and I commented how the food service had deteriorated over the past 10 years. No care or attention from the predominately male crew. Flight 20 mins late.

Checked in with no problems but at boarding gate were advised our seats had been re-allocated. We made the point that we had actually pre-booked and paid for the seat allocation and were a bit put out that we had been selected to be moved when in all probability there were other passengers on the flight who had not gone to the trouble of pre-booking seats. Apparently a family wished to be accommodated together. The clerk at the counter gave us our new boarding passes row 88. We said we were happy as long as they were not next to the toilets. We don't make a habit of sitting near toilets in restaurants or airplanes hence the reason we paid the money to pre-book allocation. The clerk checked on his monitor and categorically assured us they were not next to toilets. Having boarded the aircraft we realized we were duped. Row 88 is the farthest row back and is sandwiched between two toilets. Furthermore the seats have limited recline. They are also immediately in front of a bulkhead behind which is situated some form of noisy refrigeration unit for the self service galley area immediately behind us. We were not provided with equivalent seats for which we had paid. More to the point they were arguably the worst seats on the plane. The constant noise from the flushing toilets and refrigeration unit made it impossible to intelligibly listen to any IFE. My partner was very upset at the reallocated seats and credit to the cabin crew they were sympathetic towards our situation and indeed was not their fault. Whilst on the flight we walked through the cabin to check out our pre-booked seats. By no means was it a family with young children in our seats.

This trip turned into a nightmare due to an unimaginable 'operations' decision that adversely impacted the travel plans of 50-100 passengers. As background QF runs the JFK-LAX flight for passengers going onwards to Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane. It is a huge convenience as there is no need to change terminals at LAX no need to go through TSA security a second time and generally better to fly QF transcontinental USA than the US carriers except on this night. That said the JFK-LAX flight on this particular evening was running about one hour behind schedule due to late arrival of the aircraft and typical JFK evening delays - this isn't all that unusual and the delay not all that long. For inexplicable reasons however Qantas chose not to hold the LAX-MEL flight for all of the passengers on the JFK-LAX flight who were Melbourne bound. Even with the one hour delay on the domestic leg we still arrived LAX before the scheduled departure time of the overseas leg and the LAX-MEL flight was running 30 minutes behind as well so Qantas had no legitimate reason not to hold the flight for another 30 minutes or so to get all Melbourne passengers on board. This forced all 50-100 of us to fly a packed B747 instead of the more comfortable A380 lost seat assignments and change planes in Sydney which is more complicated than you would think (domestic and international terminals aren't close and there is no easy from one to the other) and even worse added approximately five hours to the trip. It is inexcusable and Qantas has been unapologetic and unresponsive to emails I've written them about their decisions on that evening. It is no wonder that their international business is suffering - on this evening they disrupted the travel plans and offended 50-100 passengers with one very poor decision.,nan,1.0,nan

nan,Premium Economy,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,I agree with the problem with the seat recline in Prem Economy although I do not think they need to reduce the incline but remove a row to give more room to the seats behind. I had an aisle seat but even then found it difficult to get out of my seat when the passenger in front was fully reclined. My fellow passenger in the window seat really struggled to get out. (This could be a safety issue too). I flew the same route same class and Qantas A380 four years ago and feel that they have reduced the spacing between rows since then.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,We recently returned from a holiday in South Africa. We flew Qantas on QF63 returning on QF64. Prior to travelling I tracked every flight to see what type of aircraft and what configuration we would be likely to get. Knowing that the run is 100% 747s I documented the age Registration number and name of the aircraft used for 96 flights. During October you were more likely to be flying in one of their oldest planes average age 23 years. 57% of flights which meant that if you were unlucky you got one of these and as we were flying Business class the cabins were still angle flat beds. As I have a bad back I really wanted a full flat bed and you guessed it we got an old plane. Coming home on November 4th we got lucky and were on a younger aircraft with the A380 configuration and full flat beds. We were up in the bubble both ways. The older aircraft have 24 up top the younger models just 18. A big difference with space a bit tight on the older 747's. Since Qantas switched the Sydney Dallas run to A380's the pendulum has swung and you are now more likely to get a newer 747 with re fitted cabins. Aircraft - 5 out of every 7 flights now being the lay flat A380 cabin layout. If you are in the bubble be warned the newer planes have just one toilet upstairs in Business where the older 747's have 2.,nan,5.0,nan

We boarded and were served lunch within an hour which was average but then no more meals until 8oclock at night when we were given a packet of crisps and on a 14 hour flight found this very disappointing. We travelled back with Emirates as they on a code share and the food was really good.

Large wine list in the magazine but as others have noted - phantoms - with only 2 choices of red or white offered. Service was not at the level of other business class products on our around the world trip. The male steward was the busiest refilling water bottles throughout the flight.

On time departure from MEL and early arrival into SIN. IFE ok and easy to use. Return flight QF 36 on 21/10 was a much less enjoyable experience. Full flight cabin crew took almost an hour to begin meal service (as is often the case on QF overnight flights) and then hurriedly dispensed meal trays.

Ground crew and cabin crew service was fine. Great service of lovely meals.

I have to say as much complaints you can have about Qantas I actually found their inflight service comparable if not better than most Asian Carriers. The flight attendants onboard were New Zealanders and their service was top notched! They offered a few rounds of drinks to all passengers and even remembered requested drinks. I normally will hesitate to fly with Qantas especially with their inflexible rules with ticketing however I feel the need to support our national carrier.

The flight from NY to LA was outstanding with the crew making it a fantastic experience. The flight from L.A. To Melbourne was also nice. It is really noticeable how friendly the Qantas crew are after flying on American carriers. I found the flat beds comfortable with a good variety of seat and bed positions. Having flown Air New Zealand last year the seats on Qantas are superior. Food was ok and agree with other comments not much choice for snacks.

Pros - complimentary chauffeur pick up/drop off in London/Sydney flight timings (late departure from London early arrival Sydney and vice versa) good IFE with many options pyjamas provided albeit of a sub-standard quality friendly staff albeit service offering strange. Cons - not all seats have direct aisle access the food/beverage service/options are absolutely sub-standard. Offered first drink within 30 minutes after take off and then a top up/glass of wine with dinner. That's it. For a 14 hour flight that is pretty shocking. You can stand up and go ask for another drink but I hate having to do that as it feels like asking someone to do me a favour. The entire Business class cabin shares 4 lavatories of which the rear ones are shared with Premium-Eco. The staff are friendly but are limited to the designed service offering.

Missed connecting flight SYD-MEL due to SYD airport being busy but were put on the flight we wanted straight away (more than 6 options given). Only problem with family travelling with kids Qantas and AA would always have the Prams ready for collection at the gate of the aircraft everywhere in the world except in SYD and MEL.

The seat was quite comfortable in sitting / lounging mode and while the mattress topper made the seat more comfortable in bed mode the angled flat was still not very good for sleeping. The 2-2-2 configuration is also not great as I was in a window seat so getting to the aisle mid-flight in the dark was a bit of a challenge. Food and drink were both excellent and the service provided by the crew was faultless - naturally friendly and professionally efficient. The IFE is not good enough any more with barely any movies on offer and an old poor quality screen to view it on. The Qantas Club lounge in Hong Kong was very nice and not too busy.

The flight to Sydney was pleasant apart from the old style seat that offered little back support -- no match for the seat I experienced recently on a Virgin A330. Service and breakfast were good and the plane operated on time. On the return leg there was no business class boarding queue. The seat on the B767 was more comfortable.

I did not expect much in the way of lunch for a 2.5 hour flight but I did expect more than a muffin and an apple and a couple of tea. Flight was full - fair enough but my most abiding impression of the service on the flight was the rudeness and perception of seniority of the female flight attendants who looked after the economy cabin. They were on the older side chatted to each other continually and just shoved out the lunchtime morsels on the dinner round. They simply did not seem to recognise the passengers as being worthy of their attention. To be fair baggage came out reasonably quickly at the other end. I paid $239 for flight and would have expected more than I got. No loss for me I have long ago given up on getting any decent value on the QFF programme - so this flight has made me eager to leave for the other side.,nan,3.0,nan

Seated in row 2 I think has some of the best seats on the plane. The IFE did not work properly and when it did there was a very limited selection. Lunch (or dinner) on the flight was adequate I actually can't remember it so it neither impressed nor repulsed. The flight crew were friendly if a little inattentive. Breakfast healthy and a lovely coffee. The seat for an overnight flight was one of the most uncomfortable I've slept on. Especially compared to CX and similar offerings.

This is the first time I have flown Qantas in a number of years and sadly the business class offering has not got any better. Despite being an A380 the seat was broken and was uncomfortable in the upright position. The cabin already looked worn and the side lockers frequently popped open. After the initial boarding drink it was 2.5 hours after take off when the meal was delivered and a second drink finally offered. However they did manage to have time to walk the isles offering duty free for purchase. Considering the flight didn't leave until 23.30 even small things such as socks were not available until approx an hour in to the flight which was quite frustrating for those wanting to get quickly in to the night time routine. The crew were abrupt to the point of being hostile. I can't think of a worse business class experience than Qantas.

Repeatedly these break down and have to be restarted so good luck watching anything. My last flight the meal service was only put up one aisle after 30 minutes the second aisle took 1 hour 45 minutes to get half way down and there was no choice vegetarian only. To sum it up Qantas aren't worth their costs anymore. Due to cost cutting they are insulting the customer by cutting everything possible from the customer service and frequent flyer bonus aspect of their business even though this is exactly where their earnings originate. I'll be letting my QC lapse. I'm disappointed as I had always recommended them to all I work with but now it's the opposite and am warning all others flying this sector (at least) that the value for quality is long long gone. I've already taken 10 staff with me to Virgin as of the first flight of 2015. Recent correspondence with Qantas was basically ""Sorry to see you go it's been nice knowing you"" which falls in line with their attitude this year.

Yesterday my flight did three circles over Cessnock before heading to Sydney landing us nearly an hour over time.

The FA's were professional and friendly giving us extra bottles of water upon our request. Really cannot fault the service on board. Breakfast was simple - just muesli milk and apple slices adequate for such a short flight.

We were offered drinks early in the flight and they even had a brandy on offer! On the six hour flight we were asked twice more if we would like another drink. The meal was good for Economy and we got little extras offered like an ice cream. On the Qantas QF10 flight Dubai-Melbourne we had paid the extra for the exit row seats in economy but to our horror we were seated in 48 B and C so were adjacent to the cabin crew's work areas and kitchens. Note to self- don't book these seats again on an A380! While the Qantas cabin crew were very friendly but we were not asked if we would like a drink of any kind until quite a way into the flight and then it was a small glass of cordial out of a jug. Then we were given a beef wrap (not bad) in a box (no tray) which was the last I saw of any service until two hours from Melbourne when I was offered a banana. Mind you I was sleeping for a lot of the flight so it's unfair to criticise as I didn't really need service but what would I have got had I been awake I wonder? The meal offered at the end of the flight looked very poor and I opted for cheese and biscuits. Sadly we concluded that we wouldn't fly Qantas again on a long haul flight if we could get an Emirates option at the same time. Compared to Emirates it would seem that everything about the inflight service on Qantas flights needs a big shake up.

Poor level of comfort in business on the A380. Emirates business is first class compared to Qantas business. The meal (dinner) was ok pretty basic but after 2 hours in the Hong Kong business lounge I wasn't overly hungry. The service was poor. Not a lot of attention given to individual passengers. Awoken a full 2.25 hours prior to landing for the worst breakfast I have ever had. Filling out a breakfast order form ala room service is just an aid for the staff to get it over as quickly as possible in the morning. No other airline requires this just poor class. I was looking forward to the relaxing flight home in the flagship plane. Never again for me. No wonder the National Carrier is in trouble financially. 4 of us going to Europe in June yes with Emirates even though Qantas are now sharing the route.

Just a couple of minor quibbles reflecting concerns of others. The foot rest extending from seat is a bit of a waste of time. I am only 165cms and it was too short for even me. Also the seat recline perhaps goes back too far making access from window seat tricky resulting in a bit of arm rest gymnastics. I had no trouble with IFE or meal table with seat in front fully reclined as reported by others though. The meals were fresh and tasty close enough to business class quality. PE now shares washrooms with business on upper deck. Thought the queues would be bad but not the case after all.

I didn't manage to get any sleep (never do on planes) but enjoyed the flight nevertheless and arrived feeling relaxed. The espresso coffee was excellent.

Currently based in Singapore I've been travelling SQ mostly but a recent trip to London then down to Sydney then back up to Singapore I found the best pricing to be on QF business class. The A380 flight from London to Dubai was reasonably OK but only just. The A380 business class was very disappointing. The food and service was great but the seat and comfort was extremely average. I connected to Sydney in Dubai on an Emirates flight (QF flight number). Why would anyone fly Qantas on the same leg? When you are paying $8K+ for your airline ticket Qantas just doesn't cut it. The difference between Qantas and Emirates was extreme. Emirates was probably the best business class I've travelled on. Service and food was exemplary (despite the noisy Australia soccer team being on the same flight). But unfortunately it got more disappointing when I got on the A330 flight from Sydney up to Singapore. This just doesn't compare with any of the major airlines business class. It's simply not worth the cost at all. I was very disappointed but I will say the crew were great and the food better than Singapore Airlines. Qantas really have been left behind. I may get on another international flight but It would be my 4th or 5th choice and I would only do it if it was my only choice.

We then changed planes to a former Jetstar A330 and got upgraded to business there were no TVs but rather iPads which didn't bother me. We then heard because of the delay we have no catering because it would take too long to load the food on the plane and if we put the food on we wouldn't beat the Sydney airport curfew. Because there was no food they had to use leftover pretzels and drinks from the other flight. Then when we taxied to the runway we had to return again because someone dropped their headphones which stopped the door from closing then we finally took off and the flight attendants didn't want to be disturbed (which I don't blame them) but they where still quite responsive and they had a great sense of humour.

Now to be fair Ryanair do at least advertise themselves as a budget airline and the prices are cheap to reflect that. Qantas on the other hand are not! As a national carrier they should be ashamed of themselves - but to codeshare with the likes of Emirates is nothing short of farcical in this day and age. They are simply a world apart and do not deserve a 4-star rating. There were times past when BA were pretty abysmal but sadly Qantas have managed to take that a step further. So we booked Economy seats but spent an extra £100 each to get extra legroom by the exits. By the exits also means by the toilets so we suffered the inconvenience of people treading on our toes as they used the area to queue and perform their inflight stretching. But that is nothing really to moan about. What was really unacceptable was the general nonchalant and uncaring attitude of the staff - who freely admitted to being new to the long haul. It was New Years Eve and one might have thought that being Australian was a good enough reason to celebrate the occasion as we flew across the various timezones on our Melbourne-Dubai-London flight. But no - Qantas managed to sidestep that and the thought that just a few of the passengers might appreciate a small bottle of bubbly to see in the New Year. Fat chance! About half an hour into the flight we were offered their 'Welcome drink'. A scratched plastic jug was waved in front of us containing some lemon and elderflower cordial. The dinner service followed about an hour later (about 2am Melbourne time) - though I wondered why? The food was actually pretty good - so no complaint there. But the general lack of attendance by cabin crew was appalling. Friends had warned me not to book Qantas - and it really would be my last resort from now. Anyone heaping praise on them in their review clearly expects vary little in the way of customer service. It begs the question what airline they normally fly on. Sorry Qantas - get your act together your were shocking!,nan,1.0,nan

For only a very short flight I was pleasantly surprised that seat-back inflight entertainment was provided with an excellent range of movies television music etc. The interior of the cabin was sleek modern comfy and clean with plentiful legroom and seating space. The FA's were professional and friendly giving us extra bottles of water upon our request. Really cannot fault the service on board. Breakfast was simple - just muesli milk and apple slices adequate for such a short flight. Only negative was that my headphones snapped after opening the packet but this was easily forgiven when the lovely FA promptly fetched me a new one. Without a doubt this was the best domestic flight I had ever taken! Would definitely recommend.,nan,5.0,nan

I have to say this was one of the most comfortable long haul trips I've ever had to Australia. I think the economy seats on the A380 are as good if not better than anything that has been offered in economy before. I thought the staff were very good overall although a couple of flight attendants were not very friendly. The food is now largely served without trays which is fine by me. I thought that the food was mostly good especially the chicken salads offered on several legs. However I was a bit annoyed to miss some of the food which was delivered while most people were sleeping. I think they should perhaps deliver some of these things while more people are awake. I ordered the meal in advance on my Sydney to Dubai leg and this was a bit ordinary but overall I thought the food was decent. My main gripe with the service is that they no longer offer a complimentary toothbrush on this (very) long haul flight. I think it is a bit mean to deprive people of something with which to clean their teeth on effectively a 24 hour journey and I hope they reintroduce this again at least for this very long haul flight.,nan,3.0,nan

This was my first time on Qantas in many years as last time I flew them I felt they were very poor but have read how much they have invested in improving the product so wanted to try again. This was the first leg of a multi-leg journey in combination with partner airline Emirates which made for an interesting comparison. A380 although relatively new was starting to look tired inside.

Tasty meal but for an evening service where dinner would normally be served very limited. A tiny carrot muffin and juice served just before landing. Qantas are obviously cost cutting evident through their reduced meal service adding more rows into economy by removing a number of toilets at the rear of the A380 and lack of legroom.

Negatives were that both flights left around half an hour late with limited announcements and no obvious cause for delays other than the ""late arrival of the incoming flight"" mantra which airlines love bandying about these days. I'm not aware of being late to your last appointment being an acceptable excuse for being late to your next one in any other form of human activity. The other negative is the Qantas approach to pre-booked online seating. The tactic seems to be to open up very few seats in the hope that you will select an emergency exit at extra cost. I am happy so long as I have an aisle seat which took a bit of negotiation both flights and meant sitting next to the rear toilets.

After much effort and huffing and puffing the consultant told me that it was bad luck I should have checked in earlier the plane was full but lucky me we could have the bassinet seats. Lucky us. The A330 is a disappointment at the price. Old seating not lie flat. My seat wouldn't fully recline and lets admit it it's an embarrassment compared to Emirates and the like. Tiny screen almost impossible to watch and a poor selection. On the return trip the controls wouldn't work. No priority boarding in Bangkok. No care at all.

I have flown Emirates many times and considered them to be a 5 star airline because of their quality of service the food and the ambience. However the fight back to Melbourne was on Qantas QF 154 on 26th March 2015. It was like chalk and cheese. The aircraft was a Boeing 737. The flight was full and it was cramped. There were many people flying back to Melbourne from Auckland after the cricket - I couldn't understand why Qantas were not able to have a larger aircraft. The food and service was pretty ordinary to say the least.

No entree no dessert atrocious service all a bit of an effort from the older female flight attendant who clearly had lost her enthusiasm for the job. Dinner was served in economy however. No pinot noir on trolley just a shiraz and cab sav it is very clear where a large proportion of the profit has come from.

Luckily I packed myself some goodies from Bangkok Gourmet supermarket. However I have to give top marks for ingenuity as I love the hot chocolate offered as an option to coffee or tea. Entertainment is the old school loop back movies on tiny screens simply not worth watching. Music collection is rather sad and limited a drastic contrast to those who are so accustomed to the Emirates ICE system. While Emirates would get 5 star on entertainment sadly I can only give 1 star for Qantas. Plane is old but immaculate no mood lighting no tooth paste in the toilet. Seat is cramp. Despite this I am glad sitting on the aisle seat and manage to sleep for a good few hours. The Qantas seat is definitely better than the one emirates deploy on their Airbus 330-200 which will give you a guaranteed back ache if ever attempted on a 9 hours flight.

As for the flight. Departed a little early the captains announcements were clear and audible that initially he expected to arrive early but due to some storm cell in the tropics he chose to navigate around we arrived on time. Very smooth flight. This Qantas flight was the best I have experienced with them in the past 12 years or so. Meals which were tasty edible and plentiful were served with a good range of drinks within 1.5 hours of departure. Seat comfort good and to our enjoyment on this daytime flight of 9 hours the PAX in front did not recline their seats into my face. I did notice that the crew automatically asked other PAX to put their seat in an upright position during meal times. The cabin crew in the rear section of economy class had a positive attitude for the duration of the flight and worked tirelessly and with enthusiasm. They were approachable jovial friendly professional communicative genuinely interested and most importantly personable. They were fun to fly with and made this a most pleasant flight Compared to some major competitor airlines with good service but rather robotic - like cabin crew these crew were a refreshing change and significantly an improvement over other Qantas flights experience in recent years. In conclusion a most pleasant and relaxing flight - and clearly worth the extra money over so - called “low cost”airlines.

The only downside that prevents me from giving full star ratings overall was a couple of us had to queue for the toilets a couple of times because they were being used by Business Class passengers from upstairs.

They tried to correct but we had to drive to our final destination in the end as we had missed our last flight and Qantas say they probably won't pay for the car rental.

At the counter my oversize baggage was checked in without issue. The food was great and it seemed like every hour or so crew were coming around with desserts ice creams or drinks. The crew dealt with a drunk unruly passenger seated in front of me in an assertive way and the CSM disarmed the situation. The staff seemed to strike that balance of being friendly and getting on with the job in an efficient manner. As we approached Santiago from the south the Andes came into view on the right - definitely choose the right side of the plane if flying QF27! This would have to be one of the most scenic long-haul flights in the world and certainly gave an adventurous feel to the beginning of my 3-month holiday. Coming back the other way on QF28 I again had awesome views of the Andes from the left-side of the plane as we tracked very far south over Chile's Patagonian archipelago. One negative I would highlight is the price. The fare to South America is generally expensive so it's worthwhile waiting for a sale. I paid $2350 return but have a sale fare booked next year for $1600 in Jan/Apr. It helps if you travel a few weeks either side of Christmas. Staying on cost Qantas charges for seat selection. For me it's window seat or nothing so I didn't mind coughing up $25 each way but its worth noting that competitor LAN offers free seat selection. Lastly the entertainment selection is good but the provided headphones only provided sound through one ear. Combined with the roar of the 747's engines at the back of the plane I couldn't really settle into a movie as I was straining to hear the audio. I flew LAN's 787 within South America and the quietness of that aircraft made watching movies much easier. Something to consider now that LAN flies the 787 on the SYD-AKL-SCL route. On the flip-side its comforting to know you're on the tried and tested four-holer 747 as you cross the deserted Southern Ocean (and you don't need to make the stop at AKL making for a quicker flight).,nan,3.0,nan

The seats were very worn out the screens were ridiculously small (tinier than an iPad Air) and in-flight movie choices were so limited I watched Big Hero 6 twice. Service was ok but I have experienced much better service on Emirates or Singapore airlines. As Qantas is the only one offering direct flights to Shanghai (code share with China Eastern) there's no other choices for time poor travellers. I dread to be on that plane again - my colleague didn't even want to fly Qantas anymore if she had a choice and we have to go again in July.

We weren't able to land in Dubai so circled for a long time before diverting to Bahrain to refuel. Waited there and flew back. This added over four hours to flying time. I was given one can of ginger beer in that time (and that was offered with a scowl). The seats were all right but nothing special. The service was diabolical. In many years of flying all across the world this cabin crew was one of the worst I have encountered and did nothing for the reputation of Qantas.

Nobody onboard actually complained about the lengthy delays. However I soon discovered I was on an older B747 aircraft the entertainment system was difficult to use onboard as it wasn't a touchscreen and it crashed often. The whole design of the interface also resembled an old computer operating system from the 1980s-90s. There was also not a lot of choice of movies compared to the QF A380.

No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Once again the helpful, friendly and professional Qantas staff in Australia went above and beyond to resolve the Emirates problems we had encountered. Qantas staff were both on the ground and in the air very friendly and professional. Food, drinks and service excellent during the flights, the Business Class flatbeds allowed for comfortable sleep for the 9.5 hour journey. A little bit more variety with the onboard movies I think would help particularly when travelling with children, however not a bad selection overall.

Only two of the 4 toilets were operating (the other two became unserviceable soon after the flight departed) to cater for probably at least 80 passengers. As a diabetic, it was a pathetic attempt by Qantas to not only understand the dietary needs of diabetics but to also provide a suitable meal. At one point soon after takeoff, the Flight Attendant brought round sweetened water. I questioned him as to whether there was any sugar in it and if so how much. He was unable to tell me as he admitted he didn't know. About an hour before the main cabin's dinner was served, the Flight Attendant brought an aluminium foil covered dish and plonked it down on my tray table. No water was offered nor served at that time. That was the meal, nothing else, not even a bread roll or a fruit dessert. My fellow non-diabetic passengers had what looked like a wonderful food fare. Then when a snack came for me, it was a huge banana and a sweet roll both not suitable for non-Insulin dependent diabetics. Breakfast was barely edible but by that stage I was so irritated and tired that I had lost my appetite.

Qantas offers you warm cordial out of a jug Aeroflot-1970s style. This is a 12.26 hour service. The food consisted of a small chicken wrap (in a no-name box), a small packet of potato crisps and an indiscriminate assortment of edible things from different manufacturers, called dinner. It's the first international flight I've ever got off feeling hungry. The seat was broken. The flight attendant wouldn't take his hands out of his pockets as he strolled up and down the isle - never, of course, actually carrying anything. But the worst of all was that this was Grand Final day in Melbourne, and they didn't even know who had won, for heavens sake.

The crew were welcoming and happy, but the service once in the air was not as good as previous flight. Meals were still good, but slow in coming and not quite hot enough. No wine was offered at all on this flight (which would have made the remaining 7 hours flying time more relaxing and helped sleep a bit more). Breakfast was brought around when we started descending which we thought was not well planned. Felt like we had to rush so trays could be removed before landing.

A 9.30pm departure is hardly 'late night' but the obvious objective was to cut down dinner to 'supper' and leave everyone to sleep and/or starve until breakfast. This is the longest commercial flight in the world and at 16 hours I need some proper meals! Supper was a cut down meal with a starter of nothing but lettuce, a basic main (e.g. toasted sandwich, paella bowl) and one choice of dessert. If you are hungry after that they only have chips and biscuits - no hot snacks like many other airlines in business. Having to pre-order breakfast may save cabin crew time but it comes across as working for their convenience, not yours. The presentation, offering and options were very poor for business class. Service was OK but went missing overnight. The armrest based TV is much smaller and poorer in quality than (say) SQ and CX and just gets in the way.

Having not flown Business on a Qantas long-haul flight for some time, I have been left feeling disappointed. Of all the things that stick out in my mind, it is the poor service of the Business class crew. Maybe my expectations were off but at no point was I made to feel special. Examples include only 75% of the cabin being offered the bed turn-down service - I'm not sure why I and a few others were excluded from this. Being handed a bottle of water while the crew was looking and talking to someone else (I found this particularly rude). It was just about shoved in my face. Not having my meal order being taken while the person directly beside me did, and then being told by the crew ""oh your order isn't on the list I assumed you weren't eating, let me see what I can do"" as if she was doing me a favour! These are all small insignificant things, but when you drop $7K+ on a flight you expect better. The seat is comfortable enough, although I note Qantas has a 2-2-2 config versus Emirates 1-2-1. The interior of drab cabin colours aren't particularly appealing either for a 22 hours of flying. No WiFI (which I can live without, yet other airlines have it). Inflight entertainment was satisfactory, but Qantas policy doesn't allow you to bring out the screen until you are in the air.

I called Qantas and was told that we were reallocated with no plausible explanation. I was told that this would be their new A380 product. When we got to the airport and checked in I asked the check-in agent about the aircraft, she told me the flight was being operated by an old 747 that was not refurbished. We proceeded thru customs and security and went to the Qantas Lounge to find that it was completely packed with not one single seat available for use. We were told 3 separate times that our flight was boarding, the original time of boarding at 10.15 came and went then we were told 10.45 and then 11.00, the actual time was after 11.30. Onboard the seat controls worked sporadically, the stained and worn seat had little if any padding, when I brought this to the attention of the flight crew they offered to put on a pad (they call it a mattress) on it. This did little to alleviate this discomfort. The meal was a pork chop consisting of a piece of meat that could not be cut and wen I asked for a salad they told me they had run out. The breakfast offered some 10 hours later was even worse with stale breads and hard. The crew told me that the IVOD system was broken and that nothing could be done.

The A380 is a beautiful aircraft, really quiet and there was hardly any turbulence. I thought the selection of movies was disappointing - there was a lot to select from, but I had either seen them or wasn't interested in the rest. I should have also caught an earlier Brisbane to Sydney flight (minimum 2 hours not 1 hour 25 minutes). I walked straight onto the connecting bus to the International terminal and it was quick getting through immigration but security was very congested with long lines, so there was no time for any duty free shopping or dawdling to the gate (also don't forget about daylight saving if you are from Queensland). I had to walk quickly and boarding was already occurring when I got to the gate but the Business Class line for the upper level of the aircraft had hardly anyone in it. Once on board, there was a delay in pushing back and the Captain kept everyone informed of what was exactly was going on (this is welcomed instead of being vague). Being one of the first off the plane in Hong Kong was great, but there was a lengthy wait for my bag (probably not the fault of Qantas), where you start to fear that your bag never made the flight, but it eventually appeared on the baggage carousel.

The Qantas lounge in Hong Kong was superb - great ambience and had waiter-served 3-course Christmas menu. It was particularly appreciated, since I have a view of the chaos that was the boarding process at the gate downstairs. The boarding could be described, generously, as absolute shambles - disorderly and disorganised. It took at least 40 minutes for most passengers to board and 20 minutes after the gates supposed to be closed. On the flight, the service was incredibly slow, and the presence of the crew was sparse. I was seated at upper deck economy cabin, which was supposed to be quiet with ample attention from the cabin crew given the few seats. The opposite was the case on this flight. The economy cabin shares the galley with the Premium Economy cabin that is immediately in front. All trolley traffic, therefore, must first go past the economy. This proved to be very bothersome. The upper economy cabin is served by one trolley only; meal and drinks is served on one aisle, then the second aisle. If you have the misfortune of sitting on the left rear part of the cabin, too bad, you will have to wait a long time for your food even though there are only about 30 passengers in it! By the time the fellow at the left end of my row received his meal I had almost finished mine. To make matters worse, the crew was not particularly professional. It was made quite obvious to me and the rest of the passengers that the crew knew two of the passengers. One was possibly former cabin crew, and the other, possibly a very frequent flyer, whose name most of the cabin crew knew. These two passengers received extra drinks from the Premium Economy trolley, blankets and attention during the flight. These were all little gestures, and fair enough that airlines should show gratitude for loyalty. Yet, I daresay most passengers who managed to secure an upper deck seat are frequent flyers of some manner (the lady next to me was Qantas Platinum, and I had seen a few of the faces in the Qantas lounge). To have low presence and under-service the cabin while blatantly giving special treatment to passengers they knew was quite unprofessional - we also paid similar amounts for the same seats!

Good on board service level but a poor choice of flight partners (Jetstar). Poor compensation in case of delayed luggage. My flight experience was good until I was put on a Jetstar flight from Melbourne to Christchurch. One would expect that independent of the flight partner you'd be boarding with, the quality would be the same. It couldn't be less true. Poor seat comfort on this Jetstar flight (which causes the 4/5 points on seating comfort, as Qantas has 5/5). Worse was my experience after delayed luggage, which came 50hrs late, compromising my travel plans. Until 36hrs after landing I had still no clue whether I would ever see my stuff again, which was essential for my hiking trip. Qantas has so far been unwilling to provide any significant compensation for losing 2 days of my holidays (Jetstar has offered to pay for my spare tooth brush).

The first disappointment was that Qantas used an A330 with the old style business class seats which was a questionable decision since you would think for passenger comfort on an overnight 6 hour flight they would use the newer style lie flat seats. The old style seats were just bigger and had more recline. Qantas really needs to improve on the standard of the their food especially in business. I had a crumbed snapper fillet which was barely better than the supermarket crumbed fish. The salads on the side were almost inedible. The breakfast service was canceled before the captain kept on saying more turbulence is expected, although there were only a few minutes of moderate to heavy turbulence. although I guess this isn't the pilot's fault as safety was still the first priority. Overall I would recommend that it was not worth paying for business class in cash, but if it's a point upgrades I may still be worth it for you.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Boarding our flight out of Perth, we were greeting by enthusiastic, accommodating staff. The meal service was prompt and the salad was better than one I could prepare myself. It's also pleasing to have lighter options on offer instead of the usual stodge. During the meal service, my husband and I overheard an exchange between a dissatisfied customer and staff - all handled promptly and with professionalism in our opinion. The flight to Tokyo was a little bit different. Having high expectations after excellent domestic service, I was dismayed to see a dated aircraft that unfortunately was not properly cleaned from the flight before. The crew were more subdued and lacking enthusiasm and it was back to the usual stodge for the meals. Unfortunately as well, I am a bit of a nervous flyer, and I find the announcements from the pilot helpful when there is going to be turbulence. After four hours of bouncing around, the pilot finally addressed the cabin. While I know they are busy and focused, a little reassurance makes a lot of difference and looking around - I know I am not the only one.

I must admit the crew were apologetic but that's about all - my expectations about Qantas started to dive. We were served breakfast which was much better.

As reward for ""being one of Qantas ""most valued customers"" I had the misfortune of sitting next to a mother and irritable infant. Initially the CSM advised that he would move me to an alternative seat for which I was understandably grateful, only to be informed later that ""I was not going to be happy"" when he told me the passenger he thought was on a staff ticket was also a Qantas Platinum  PAX. An understatement. Just what any business traveller needs after paying for a premium ticket. It would appear that the Qantas system is so unintelligent that it is unable to recognise when its ""most valuable customers"" are seated next to mothers and infants. The premium product is rubbish in so many regards. Most Asian carriers Particularly CX and SQ are in a completely different league to QF - sad but true. Forgot to mention also that the flight was late and as a consequence, I only just made a connection to NZ. ""Use our 1st class lounge and enjoy an relaxing shower in Sydney"" is Qantas code for race through the SYD terminal when our flights are late and you've had no sleep on premium ticket from Europe and arrive at the gate with a heart rate of 180 feeling clammy and hungry!

When we pointed this out we were seated together but with bad grace. This was followed by disorganisation at the boarding gate in Melbourne where everyone was herded together with no attempt to have controlled lines. Having boarded we were advised of a delay with the reason given as refuelling being late. An attempt at humour was offered that perhaps the re-fuelers had overindulged at Christmas. Total inefficiency would have been a more accurate explanation. We arrived in LA late so transfer to New York flight was chaotic and delayed. Qantas staff at LAX gave the impression they had no idea as to how to handle the situation. To top this experience our luggage was lost and two days later has not been located. We were directed to British Airways luggage service at JFK and they have been hopeless. Luggage was not forwarded as promised that night and next morning as we were departing for Canada we went to the office again and they could not tell us where it was. The 1800 telephone number does not respond and we still do not have our luggage. We have tried to contact Qantas in Australia to be told via automated response there is a 63 minute hold time. This service from Qantas is disgraceful. An email sent to Qantas customer feedback resulted in an automated response indicated a 15 day wait. The seat in business class is fine but would be very hard without the addition of a quilt like mattress provided. The food certainly does not live up to the hype of a Neil Perry menu. The attitude of staff is perfunctory at best and the luggage staff at JFK were a disgrace.

My wife and I were literally imprisoned by the gate representative and the airlines ""medical representative."" My wife is in a wheelchair so we require special assistance to board. When we arrived at the airport, both of us were sick from catching bad colds in Tasmania on a rainy day from a cruise excursion. We had coughed and sneezed quite a bit and smelled of cough medicine. They dragged us off to a private lounge and insisted that my wife take a shower. The place was like a sauna and her cold got even worse, as did mine. They insisted that she put on some ""mickey mouse"" outfit that was so tight that it was described as a major scrape to her body by nurses who later examined her. When we returned to the gate they informed us that they had changed our seats to all the way in the back, which would make it very difficult for us to board and disembark since she really can't walk. It took forever for us to do both, which prolonged my wife's misery. Due to the shower, she coughed the entire flight back to Los Angeles. The medical staff woman ensured us that the seat change was for our benefit since I would be closer to the bathroom at the back of the plane. Hopefully she will be re-assigned to sweeping the floors. The flight itself was highlighted by the refusal of the Captain to turn on the seat belt sign in midflight until the plane was practically being violently tossed. The flight crew also needs a refresher course in disbursing and retrieving food. It was very disorderly. I had to tell the flight attendant 3 times that I didn't want to eat Barramundi, which as she explained was a fish, in case I didn't know. Disembarkation was fun with the crew making snide remarks about my wife's inability to walk and exit the plane. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

The old A330 was the same as the one I've regularly taken from Sydney to Shanghai. It's OK, but the seat-back TV screen is extremely small. That's the only problem on that plane. It was an overnight flight, and service was OK. The other problem with the flight was that Qantas ground staff in Sydney were not prepared for our arrival. We had to park in the cargo area, and wait for a stairway truck to come to us. After about 15-20 minutes, a stairway truck arrived, but without the member of staff needed to open the door. So we had to wait another 20 minutes while they found someone who knew how to open the door. It appears that the daily arrival of QF6 still comes as a surprise to Qantas' Sydney ground staff. The newly-refurbished A330 had better-padded seats and much, much bigger TV screens. It was a daytime flight, and service was OK. However, on the newly-refurbished A330, the seats reclined too far. There was a good 3-4 inches more recline than I've seen in economy on any other plane. The person in front of me decided to recline as soon as the seat-belt light was switched off. This spilled the drink on my table, and left me with the back of her seat less than five inches from my nose.  Viewing the big, new TV screen was now impossible. Accessing the seat pockets was impossible. Eating and drinking was impossible, and even moving was difficult. The woman next to me had the same problem with the person in front of her. We both had to move: it was impossible to stay in those seats for a daytime flight. Even getting out of our seats to move elsewhere was extremely difficult. Very few people had chosen to use the full recline, so this wasn't a problem for most of the other passengers, although this was pure luck. Fortunately, we did manage to find alternative seats. However, having paid an extra A$30 to select my seat (a window seat near the front), I wasn't thrilled to end up in a centre-aisle seat in the very back row. Other than this, the flight was OK. But Qantas really needs to look at a way of restricting recline to normal levels. If this can't be resolved, I'll be avoiding Qantas flights on refurbished A330s: the seats are completely unusable if the person in front uses the full recline.",Business,3.0,nan

Check in at Sydney for the Los Angeles and New York JFK sectors very quick and efficient. First leg, QF11 to LAX, departed a full hour late, due to late boarding, with no announcement. Boarding was chaotic and not streamlined by cabin and deck level. A380 interior looks tired. Sat on the upper deck bulk head just behind Premium Economy. Flight attendants were a mixed bag.

Toilets kept clean and tidy throughout the flight and the entertainment system was good. Catering not bad for Economy and plenty of snack options for the 14 hour journey. One flight attendant got us snacks from Business Class at one point. Transit at LAX to the JFK flight (on the BNE-LAX aircraft) is a mess. Long lines and poor signage. Never clear where you are to leave your luggage and you have to go back through security even though you are staying within the TBIT. No wonder the QF11 LAX-JFK flight is always late. Our flight departed a full 90 minutes behind schedule and arrived an hour late. The plane, a 747-400, was ancient and falling apart inside and out. Worn out seats, broken IFE, filthy lavatories, and dirty seat cushions. Cabin crew only interested in chit chatting with their friends and family and moving some to business class as a courtesy. Only plus of this flight is not having to change terminals. Long wait for baggage at JFK. Overall, a mediocre experience with an airline that I had high hopes for, but featured a tired product.

Premium Check in at PER with short lines and fairly fast. However I noticed that Y check-in was full self-service including tagging and dropping off luggage and I didn’t really see any QF staff to offer any assistance at the kiosks. Used the QF domestic lounge, which was spacious and comfortable; various cold food choices and fresh pizza. Alcohol and espressos served at a manned bar with nice drink choices. Boarding was uneventful. On board actual business class seats were comfortable and much better than what European airlines offer on short European flights. FA’s professional and attentive but not particularly friendly. Choice of 2 starters, 5 mains and 3 desserts were offered and I found the Chinese style steamed white fish to be quite good. Australian wines very nice with regular top ups. In-seat on-demand IFE offered with a limited but good enough choices of movies. Impressive product for a domestic flight. As for value for money, I am not so sure. I burned some miles for this flight, so value was actually good.

The cabin is old and tired, and the IFE unresponsive at the best of times, with a tiny selection of movie, and appalling resolution. It ought to have been banished to the last decade. The food was overcooked and over-salted, but the selection of Australian and international wine remained excellent. The saving grace of the flight was crew, who were warm, friendly, and used my name. I was looked after very well. I should point out that when booking on the Qantas page, there is no way of telling whether the A330 is refurbished or not - yet, the prices are the same. When there is such a massive difference in quality between the old and refurbished cabin, it is indeed very disappointing to leave this crucial piece of information.

Stark contrast in quality of service, food and cabin fitout between Emirates and Qantas. Qantas staff seemed preoccupied with getting passengers to sleep as quickly as possible above all else, including requests for a bottle to get my tollder settled (grumpy, exhausted 3 year olds aren't conducive to getting a cabin full of people to sleep!). Kids weren't allowed to change seats before take off despite ample unoccupied seats after boarding was complete. Staff did however allow an adult male to change to an empty row of 4 seats before take off. On previous Emirates flights the kids seemed to be given at least a fair chance of occupying spare seats therefore increasing the possibility that they would sleep (which benefits the entire cabin). Kids meal on Qantas was a bread-like tube filled with veges and tomato sauce and a packet of Smarties. Contrast this with Emirates: hot bowl of macaroni cheese, rolls, a dessert, a drink, and a box full of snacks like small chocolate bars, crackers, crisps, and a small toothbrush kit. Entertainment system on Qantas was measly compared to Emirates with very few family movies and a smaller screen. Noticeably less leg room (my husband is 6 foot 4). In terms of service quality - only one staff member in our section seemed happy to be on the flight and conversed with our kids beyond 'Hi mate'. Qantas should be aware that (over)use of the word 'mate' doesn't make up for a lack of genuine care in making a kid's 13 hours in a confined space surrounded by snoring adults as comfortable as possible. On Emirates I felt totally comfortable asking for extra drinks, crisps etc for the kids (to reduce their loud 'I'm hungry' complaints). On Qantas I soon realised that these requests were treated as big extra workloads by the staff. On the plus side, my husband enjoyed the snack bar at the back of the plane.",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

The positives for me were the food (best in a long time on a plane) the snack bar and the IFE had a good range, although still not to Emirates standards.

The cabin crew were more mature then a lot of other airlines and while they did not look like supermodels they exuded experienced and confidence that made an impact. They must enjoy their job otherwise why were they doing it for so long. The experience made a big difference compared to the younger crew we often get on airlines. I was expecting a bag of peanuts on such a short hop (as we had on another airline coming over) but instead they rolled out dinner. The Qantas bigger economy meals were noticeably large and I was hungry and as I was not getting home until 10.30pm I was very happy to actually have a satisfying meal - plus red wine and just when i was wishing for something sweet along came a chocolate. The Flight attendant later came and gave me a handful of extra chocolates as a sudden surprise gift. They are a little more expensive than a budget airline but there is a big difference and I would pay an extra few dollars for this kind of service. They are obviously trying hard to give a great service and I was surprised and impressed.,Business,5.0,3.0

Personally speaking the thought of eggs and sausage do not appeal but breakfast has to be served so there it is. Coffee and fruit was enough for me. Suggestions to Qantas?

The aircraft interior was refurbished and the in-flight entertainment was good and the seats were comfortable with decent leg room for an economy seat, but the service was slow and poor. The flight took off at 8pm but dinner was served very slowly. The left aisle was served about 20 min after the right aisle and the food serving was pathetic. There was no salad and no fruits, just a main course with a cold and hard brownie. Compared to other airlines (e.g. Singapore airlines and Emirates), the food didn't taste as good. A man sitting beside me was not full from the small serving and wanted more buns but the flight attendants ignored him. A flight attendant asked for my drink preference but never came back to serve me any drinks. Very disappointed with Qantas.

The Qantas experience on the way over seemed fine. The beds were good, service solid and the plane was on time. On the way back however, the old experience came back to us. The new Qantas promotion and safety video is embarrassing and even the staff cringed and smiled in sympathy. It is really bad and not sure what they were thinking.

JetStar (Qantas' discount partner) said no problem and moved our flight out 2 days at no charge. But they said we also had to arrange that with Qantas, our carrier from Sydney to Honolulu. Qantas wanted about $600 per passenger for a change fee and difference in airfare for each of us.

The other times I needed a drink, I had to ask for it. No big deal, but really? In desperation, I wandered back to economy in search of food. The 'buffet' that had been previously available in regular economy was no longer. There wasn't one in premium either. I had ordered a veggie meal and it was literally some vegetables and boiled rice, a small salad and some dried fruit that looked disgusting. I had a baby who cried for 16 hours seated in front of me. Not the airlines fault, but it just added to the bad experience. On the plus side, the seat was bigger than economy. The flight attendant who worked our cabin was very nice. The flight was on time and relatively uneventful, but for $3200 round trip, this trip was definitely not worth the extra money for premium.

They seemed more interested in getting sleeping positions at the back of the plane. At times on Qantas the attendant's attitude can be tiresome and you felt after the meal service you were really putting them out by asking for a coffee or coke. Breakfast was actually ok considering that scrambled eggs can always be hit and miss on a plane.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2016,1.0,3.0,3.0,no,MEL to HKG,1.0," |  Melbourne to Hong Kong in Economy with Qantas. It turns out Economy with Qantas is just slightly better than being put in the hold with the baggage. For an airline that charges hefty prices this was like flying no-frills, or maybe worse because their tickets are super expensive. The economy seats were the narrowest seats I have ever seen in a plane certainly for a 10 hour flight. The seats were much narrower than the seats on any of the other airlines that we took on our trip to Europe. It was extremely uncomfortable. Qantas seems to keep to the minimum number of staff possible. As a result, the service was as minimal as the seats. It took them ages to provide drinks and meals. The staff were nice enough but Economy passengers barely saw much of them. Given the high cost of our economy tickets, it was insulting to be treated like some sort of after thought. The worst food ever in so many different ways. Usually on an airline we get a tray of food containing a hot meal, a salad, perhaps some cheese and crackers, maybe another snack and a dessert. On Qantas they gave us a hot meal and a dessert. There was no tray and there was no other food. Just a small sized hot meal and a dessert. That was it. As it happened the hot meal was just awful so we only had the dessert. Even the kids received a hot meal and an apple. In contrast, when our kids flew with Cathay they received a tray of food including a hot meal, juice, fruit, cupcake, snack, cheese. Our kids didn't like the hot meal and when we asked if they had something else, after ages waiting, a staff member brought some dry biscuits and another apple. There were a lot of apples on this Qantas flight but much not of anything else. We got off our Qantas flight absolutely starving hungry. I don't mind flying no-frills but if Qantas wants to provide a no frills flight on Economy then the price should be no frills as well. Except it isn't.

We were basically left to our own devices with a £10 voucher at Heathrow and then a cheap hotel in Dubai whilst awaiting a re-booked flight via Sydney - which we had no choice in or discussion about. When boarding the re-routed flight we were treated as if it was our fault - sat separately and I wont bore you with the details about the service. On our return I wrote to Qantas and simply asked for acknowledgement of my letter addressing my concerns. This was not forthcoming. Eventually - 4 months latter I get a very limp email. Poor. So - I have since found an interesting piece of EU legislation C(2016) 3502. Basically any flight leaving from an EU airport is covered by this. I advise any Qantas passenger to be aware of their rights for compensation. Especially those caught up in the delay in February this year.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 737 and A380,Economy Class,1.0,May 2016,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,ADL to FCO via DXB,1.0," |  Qantas has deteriorated significantly in recent times, it is no longer a premium airline. Qantas now has an ageing fleet, fewer crafts, and serious staffing issues. This essentially means more cancellations, technical issues, delays, and a deteriorating service. We booked our tickets to Rome with Qantas as the flights selected had a convenient midday departure with a two-hour stopover in Sydney, and three hours in Dubai. However, problems started before we left home. 1) Qantas cancelled our first flight and rescheduled a departure time three hours earlier. The new 9.00am departure created a five-hour first stopover in Sydney 2) Qantas then delayed the Sydney departure due to 'engineering requirements' by four hours. They kept extending the delay every 30 minutes, making it impossible to modify onward journey arrangements. The stopover had extended to nine hours from two. 3) This resulted in missing our connecting flight in Dubai. We were rebooked into a flight scheduled to depart more than five hours later. 4) My wife and I were assigned separated seats, as the flight was full. Further to this, the Qantas flight service was extremely tardy. They kept forgetting to bring my wife’s meal, which she received two hours after others had finished eating. The cabin was a constant mess as the cabin staff was extremely slow in removing trays, etc. 5) We arrived eight hours late in Rome and missed our connecting Alitalia flight. The result, Alitalia forfeited our return tickets that cost $1540 to replace. If you elect or need to travel Qantas, be prepared by lowering past expectations and factor in more delays.

Why even offer the service if there is little to no possibility of usability? On the return flight the galley equipment failed. There's was no meal for the 2nd half of an 16 hour flight. Qantas promised a ""food voucher"" to compensate for the technical failure, but the voucher was not provided upon disembarking the plane.

They were allowed to sit in business class by the FA but only after the dinner service. The seats in the B737 are not as comfortable as those in Silk Air.

The awkward design of seats leads to minimal storage and areas to place personal items and refreshment items. I found the sleeping position claustrophobic with my head stuck in a cocoon shell like arrangement. The handset control was buried in an awkward position and they warn you about it, and the hazards of not returning it correctly. The overhead reading light required you to stand and switch on at the bulkhead due to a faulty handset. The news section of the entertainment system did not operate. The flight attendant was unaware of my preordered meal. Responses to attendant calls took ages. The width of the seat/flatbed is less than other airlines. My foldout table was awkward to work (and if you are overweight forget it) it was broken and was told they would report it. The attendants must have all attended different days at the table laying lessons.

Sydney to Jakarta operated by a refitted A330-200. Quite trendy and sleek. Good lunch and snack served. Excellent crew. Baggage delivery a bit slow in CGK. Again this is due to issues with CGK airport rather than fault of QF. Return sector, CGK check in fast. The contract lounge used by Qantas in Jakarta is appalling. Flight from Jakarta left late due to late arrival of incoming aircraft. Jakarta to Sydney operated by another refitted A330-200. Nice crew. Qantas is pretty stingy with dinner supper service in business class. A proper meal is needed when poor lounges are used.

Compared to Emirates the entertainment system is very limited in content. We had attempted to obtain a business class upgrade on our flights to Europe using freqent flyer points.

There was no way we could alter this online so headed to the airport early. Sadly because this was a codeshare with Emirates (flying from Glasgow to Dubai with EK) we were told there add nothing we could do in Glasgow but I could phone Qantas ourselves. This we did and after a 20 minutes on the phone to a very helpful woman we were informed that the Qantas staff were in a break but when they were available she would sorry out the seating and get back to me. 45 minutes later and less than an hours before the parents had to go through security I called Qantas again. The person answering the phone could find no record of my previous call and more annoyingly could not alter the seating allocation for the parents but did say some one would get back to me in 48hours.

We were both still hungry so asked for the cheese platter, which consisted of two small pieces of cheese, two dried apricots and two crackers. Breakfast was equally skimpy. Instead of making rubbish such as cookies, ice creams and chocolate available during the flight (not that we saw them), the airline should concentrate on giving passengers proper meals.

It was a B747 that had been pressed into service as earlier on in the week an A380 had broken down in Dubai so had a major knock on effect on the Qantas schedules. It was a refurbished B747 so had the A380 style of seating. But the venerable Queen of the Skies is showing its age. Noise, vibration, harshness etc is very elevated compared to the Airbus as you would expect from a design from the 1960's. Was dreading the flight back as the Airbus is very quiet and smooth in flight. Not as bad as I had feared and it's a good reminder of why the B747 revolutionised travel. The flight crew did a great job. We were 80 minutes late leaving due to some repair work but made some time up. The 747 is being pensioned off as the 787 kicks in. Thank you for your service in Qantas colours over the years.",Business,4.0,nan

On the five trips to the US this year it has been identical. From Dallas to NY it was on an AA codeshare. American have their act together and painless journey to La Guardia on an A321.

Seated at the window seat at the last row (28K), the degree of recline does not decrease. The flight was delayed for approximately 90 minutes. Flight attendants friendly. The Skyloft in A380-800 offers a snack bar and a place to chat with crew and passengers. The premium economy cuisine which offers remarkable alcoholic drinks from Hunter Valley and a choice of menu. The only thing that Qantas should improve for this flight is the portion of breakfast, which only consist cornflakes and fruit platters. The IFE doesnot go fullscreen when it come to the flight path, which is a bit disappointing for aviation fans like me. However, it is an outstanding product in terms of money.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

An otherwise pleasant and punctual flight on Qantas, using Business Class Upgrade so I could get some work done as Economy on Qantas' B737 is overly cramped for me. Nice wine and very good service but the let down is the meals. Qantas seems to have a fixation with cheese and cheese dishes - I believe all options on this lunch time flight had cheese somewhere in them! I wonder why Qantas (and some other airlines for that matter) don't realise that cheese and chocolate can make some people very ill. So the result was that I just had a piece of bread and butter for lunch - in Business Class. I'm dreading my next Qantas flight (which will be long haul, as you can bet most of the dishes will be centred around cheese, especially for breakfast. Oh well, sometimes I feel like I'm in a Monty Python film when flying Qantas and can remember the famous line: ""Blessed are the Cheesemakers"" - maybe this has become a Qantas slogan too.",Business,3.0,nan

To my memory there was no announcement of boarding call, which is quite odd but lucky for me I always make sure I'm at the gate on time, every time. Boarding was unorganised with the Priority lane not set up properly, and people not meeting the baggage requirement. Once onboard, the Crew were impersonal and very robotic which in my opinion is not appropriate for Qantas standards.

The onboard entertainment equipment didn't work until about thirty minutes into the flight when it was rebooted. There was rubbish jammed in my seat from a previous flight which wasn't cleaned up. The food was abysmal, obvious part of the cost savings announced. The toilets stunk, didn't flush properly. The cabin crew were tired looking embarrassed by the service they had to provide. The cabin wasn't cleared of used blankets, headphones etc prior to disembarking and we had to disembark such a large aircraft through one door at the front of the aircraft.

I was booked onto the next flight which was 6.30pm, but what frustrates me the most is that I highly think they cancelled my original flight because it wasn't fully booked. I just don't see any reason as to why they need a 6.00, 6.15, 6.30, 6.45 and 7.00 in the evening, it is so pointless. Other than that escapade, boarding was early considering how full the plane was and I managed to only get an economy seat all the way at the front at last minute.

This is one of the longest flight between the two cities I have ever had because for some reason, the plane made a u-turn during the journey and the trip took almost 1.5 hours.

Very comfortable seats bulkhead window with plenty of space. Champagne on boarding was decent champagne as opposed to sparkling wine. Unfortunate 2 hour delay due to problems in starting engines - a sign of the age of the 747's perhaps, but the captain kept us informed and the crew supplied water. Once under way service was excellent, bar service with meal quickly following. Choice of two meals, including a beef stir fry which was very good. Good wines and attentive service throughout the meal. By this time my wife was asleep and slept for over 8 hours. She woke up once and the attendant produced a very tasty snack for her. The 747 is perhaps showing signs of age and is significantly noisier than the A380, but it is still a great aircraft. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, but so much depends on the crew who were top rate. Overall the premium economy service is good, and offers a lot of advantages, not the least of which is the lack reduction in queues and hassles. Due to the delay in leaving, a lot of connections were affected, but details of changes were made known before landing.

There was a possibility of using Qantas app to watch TV or a movie onboard. The cabin crew were nice. The only negative point was that they changed my seat before boarding, without letting me know! It was disappointing. The return flight was a bad experience. It was a B737 and I had expected to be in a better aircraft. But I was so wrong. The legroom was awful and the seat was unbelievably uncomfortable. Upon landing I had a sore back. The cabin crew were disinterested. Besides, passengers had to pay for drinks.

There was no reason given for the cancellation, and the ground crew just looked clueless, which just didn't help the situation. By the time I reach the Sales Desk, a lot of flights were booked out so I opted to get the earliest morning flight and Qantas put me in a hotel for the night, a nice gesture for the inconvenience. Next morning the departure was on time plus the Cabin Crew were quite lovely during the whole flight and surprisingly one of the FA remembered me, I did feel a quite special. Breakfast was delicious and further snacks was provided before landing. Once we landed in Sydney, there was a commotion at the back of the plane, the Cabin Crew were very frantic and looked stressed out. There was a medical situation with one passenger and a medical personnel was asked to volunteer for assistance. I definitely think the situation could have been handled a lot better.

Once airborne, the inflight service began with breakfast (my second Breakfast) and to be honest it was one of the worst meals to date, as everything tasted dry and overcooked. I've started noticing that the IFE has less or more content depending on the route being served, and as a frequent flyer and a loyal customer I do think more is better.

Clearing customs at Tokyo's Haneda Airport was seamless. As a Qantas Frequent Flyer I had access to the well appointed Sakura lounge which had a good range of food and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The upper level of the lounge had comfortable lounges and massage chairs. Boarding was well organised and efficient. What made the flight, as with many Qantas flights that I take, was the quality of the crew on board. The crew was made up of very experienced flight attendants who carry out their tasks with the utmost professionalism and customer care. My daughter and I managed to obtain exit row seats in row 58 (for a modest additional cost) which made the 9 hour flight in economy much more comfortable. The crew on board made my daughter and I feel very comfortable and relaxed from the moment we boarded and we felt throughout the whole experience that we were in safe hands. Having flown on other airlines and with Jetstar in recent times I find that more often than not the younger crews inexperience in comparison is very apparent during the flight. They lack organisational skills and the care and repartee that you have with more experienced crews and I hope that this experience is valued by Qantas management as I believe it is one of the airlines greatest assets.

But in the end the person could not help because there was a small fee involved, and he could not handle financial transactions. He advised us to contact either an office or by telephone. Contacting an office Friday at 9PM in Alice Springs is certainly not evident. And telephoning not possible. So service of Qantas is zero, nothing. We solved the problem by booking a flight Alice Springs-Darwin by Virgin Australia. 2. I don’t think anybody of the Management has ever travelled in economy class. The food is bad. On our flight Dubai-Melbourne we got as breakfast (after a flight of 11 hours) a small box containing cereals and some milk. Bread? Eggs? Fruit? On the similar flight Adelaide to Dubai operated by Emirates, we even got a choice of eggs, we got fruit, we got bread. On the flight Darwin-Adelaide we got as lunch a small box containing some Asian food. Nothing else. Honestly, the smallest roadside shop sells 10 times better food than this. It was simply disgusting,Drinks have to be paid for! On the flight by Virgin Australia we got a decent lunch and free drinks. Qantas have no official site where one can make complaints, and E-mail messages are not replied to, maybe somewhere next year – who knows. All this makes me sure to nominate Qantas as the worst airline of the year.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,October 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,no,Perth to Melbourne,4.0," | QF768 from Perth to Melbourne departed 2 hours late on 30/10/2017 with no reasonable explanation from ground staff. On board the flight attendant openly displayed her annoyance when asked to explain the menu. To avoid further annoyance to her I took the meal she had in her hand which was a mixture of refrigerated rice, boiled chick peas and chicken. Truly an apology for a meal. Customer service needs to be monitored by Qantas. It would be nice to send customers an email enquiring about their experience on board Qantas. Perhaps then would we see better customer service",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

I fly this route (Manila to Brisbane via Sydney) approximately 20 times per year, and find that the service is always genuine, warm and competent. On checking in was great by the duty manager who personally welcomed me, introduced herself, thanked me for flying with them regularly and let me know if there was anything at all in needed to let her know. Decided to attempt to use the Japan Airlines lounge under oneworld sapphire status for a change of scenery but was directed the mascor lounge across the way instead, who were happy to accomodate me as Qantas are a client anyway. Similar to the Qantas Lounge (which is so-so in Manila, but the universal case with all lounges there) but better range of food and more space - so would recommend giving this a go if stuck there. Once on board staff were excellent, taking care of everyone well throughout the entire flight. Aircraft the A330-200, so not as nice (smaller ife screens) as the refurbished -300’s flying into much of Asia, but still clean and well presented. Landed ahead of schedule and transited the Qantas Club for a shower, coffee and breakfast before heading onward on an uneventful connecting flight to Brisbane.

Boeing 747,Economy Class,5.0,October 2017,3.0,4.0,1.0,no,San Francisco to Sydney,3.0," |  We flew San Francisco - Sydney - San Francisco. While we flew in the last rows of two seats, we were more comfortable than most. Our main issue is with the condition of these ancient 747s. We flew different ones outbound from return. The cabin condition of these worn out planes is beyond pathetic. On the way out we counted several fluorescent lights burned out and flickering. Some had been replaced with different color tones. Seats were threadbare at the top of the back where people hold on. On the way back both headphone plugs did not work. Two overhead fluorescent lights came on early in the flight, and could not be turned off. We counted 14 overhead lights out in our section! It looked like a third world aircraft. Qantas: Time to put these 747s out of their misery and park them in the desert. Makes one think of how they skimp on the important maintenance! Also on the return trip we were delayed several hours with mechanical issues.

Checked in on mobile but for some reason boarding pass wasn't forwarded on so when I arrived at Townsville airport I was issued with paper boarding pass, no ID asked for as they did in Brisbane. Townsville airport always very quiet, no queue when I've travelled and security quick and very friendly staff. Flight appeared full. Seat request 28c aisle. As soon as we had taken off I was immediately given my Gluten Free meal as it was a lunch time flight. It was a vegetarian burger and on the box stated all the other allergies it was free from, it was a very generous size and tasty. Also a rows brownie and drinks served.

I was impressed with the new aircraft and the comfortable seats with generous legroom and rather large screens for IFE. The service was also very friendly and accommodating. However, there were also a few downsides: I had ordered a Vegetarian special meal, and the food was inedible – easily the worst airplane food that I have had for quite a while. Furthermore, Qantas does not allow you to choose your seat at the online check-in, which is a major inconvenience if you are travelling with people who are not in the same reservation. Fortunately, the problem could be sorted out by the Qantas ground-staff once we arrived at the airport. Overall, it was a positive experience, primarily because the seats were more comfortable than with most other airlines in Economy and allowed me to get some rest.",Business,3.0,nan

Being a QFF the whole Qantas experience these days is very satisfying. Check in is through the priority channels which makes life a whole lot smoother. I'm old school and still like to be checked in by hand and not have to go through the self check in bit. Up to the business lounge and this is where Qantas needs to do some work. It was a Sunday morning flight so the place was packed with the Asia departures which all leave in the morning. The F & B were fine but Qantas should look at extending the lounge. The flight itself was uneventful. it was a refurbished A330 so the ICE was the new touchscreen. New comfortable seating and the FA's were great. Asked for a Jack Daniels and Coke and was served a quadruple which nicely put me out for a few hours.,Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A380,Economy Class,2.0,November 2017,1.0,2.0,5.0,no,Sydney to Dallas,1.0," |  I had a miserable long trip from Sydney to Dallas. I was in the back row of the top part of an A380, seat 36F. There were three ladies in that row, myself included. We put the magazines from the net pocket in the top storage as there was no leg room whatsoever. All night my knees were pushed against the seat and the temperature was like a meat cooler. When the people in the row in front of us put their seats back, we were cramped beyond belief. I was on the aisle but the lady two seats over had a wall beside her and had great difficulty getting in and out of the row with the seats in front laid back. God help her if there were an emergency. I had an extra blanket in my carry-on that I wrapped around my legs and used the blanket they gave us on my torso doubled. I wore three shirts layered and used their blanket and was still cold all night. I couldn't sleep - which is unusual as I can sleep easily on most planes. In the morning people were complaining about the cold and rubbing their hands and arms so others felt the cold. Dinner was so awful, I only ate the bun, and small square of potatoes and the chocolate pudding. The broccoli/kale was burnt and tasted awful, the chicken was chewy and jellylike. I only had one bite. I suspected it either wasn't real meat or wasn't cooked properly. I was hungry in the night but I wouldn't exactly waste away so just endured. I was offered a chili cheese dog in the night but it smelled awful. The lady beside my had the lasagna and did not eat it either. In the morning, people were choosing the yogurt/fruit option. I don't think anyone wanted more cooked options from this flight. When we got on, The couple beside us on the wall - each had a glass of wine and the couple in front of them also each had a glass of wine. Then they were served a second glass of wine and the cart moved forward. When our row was finally asked - the attendant just said ""Do you want chicken or lasagna?"" I told her chicken and then asked her if there was there a reason we were not offered a cocktail as the couples beside us were on their second"" She said ""Oh it was the lady's birthday and the other couple are newlyweds going home from their honeymoon"". Then she asked if I wanted a cocktail and I said ""Well I would have liked one twenty minutes ago when they got their second one but not now when I have my food"". The sarcasm was totally lost with her and she just said ok and moved on. We got on the flight about 3:30 pm and dinner was all done and cleaned up by about 6:00 pm. It was like the staff just wanted to get it over with and by 7:00 pm, lights went down and so did the temperature. They have a big long fancy menu but you are not offered even half of the items. In Nov. I had flown Toronto to UK, to South Africa, to Sydney, to Melbourne, back to Sydney, to Dallas and to Fort Meyers, FL, I had seen lots of economy seats and none were this close or uncomfortable or cold. The couple right beside the exit door in the two seats along the wall looked well into their seventies. It wasn't the most comforting thought that they were in charge of opening the emergency door. The staff were distant - not friendly. Maybe the plane is just too big and it becomes a chore for them but it didn't feel as if they enjoyed their job. The trip of a lifetime ended badly.",Business,2.0,nan

I was so looking forward to coming home and on a Qantas flight too! So I get on and find the smallest seat since the 70's and the seat in front goes back with a clunk. No halfway decisions here! When the meal is delivered the tray is so small that the only thing they can deliver is a roll, and main and a pudding dumped down unceremoniously. The movie I tried to watch froze at least 6 times, I asked for a reset and got nothing. I just kept restarting the movie and going back to the freeze area and trying again, so also on another movie, same. Have flown in recent years, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore and a few others, all superior to this flight. Qantas used to be so good, what happened? The cabin crew need a serious retrain.

I have been a frequent flyer and I understand this could have been managed much better. Other flights arrange for special management of this type of situation. Another 100 passengers are not required to wait if one person has to be boarded. Instead, the arrangements to bring guests this person on board and requesting the person to arrive a few minutes earlier could have saved time. There appeared to be another reason for delay of flight and it appeared that on boarding a handicapped person was just an excuse. They were still filling out fuel 15 minutes after the boarding time started. Their crew started to arrive at the gate many minutes later than the boarding time. This was frustrating.",Business,1.0,1.0

A welcome drink was served soon after I settled into my seat. The seat in premium economy was very comfortable with generous legroom and a foot rest. Country Road amenieties kit (eye mask, socks) was given to premium economy passengers, a nice touch. The IFE was superb with so much selection, but the touchscreen was less intuitive than the ones in newer planes. The crew were excellent, they moved and served really fast. The food (lunch) was a bit letdown, I had some grilled chicken and vegetables which looked very 'gourmet' ish but didn't taste super delicious, they weren't bad but I wouldn't have it again.

Not a fan of BYO tablet/phone and miss the screens built in. The seat pocket had crumbs and cellophane from a previous flight. They distributed drinks - fruit juice , water, coffee and a packet of the driest mini shortbreads ever. Ugh. The last time I took this route we got bottle of water and a muffin at least.

During the flight the Qantas staff informed us that they had made alternative arrangements for us with new flights the next morning and accommodation in Bangkok. The gentleman in charge and our steward could not have done any more to make us stress free, comfortable and valued. We cannot speak highly enough of these two gentleman. The captain of the plane even chatted to us. When we left the plane we were greeted by ground staff who directed us to collect our luggage and then escorted us to the transfer point for the hotel.

The trip started with a visit to the Lounge and on this occasion the food was delicious. The flight departed 45 minutes late due to the late arrival because of storms over Auckland, not something the airline can control though we ended up arriving on time, great job from the pilot and first officer. Flight attendants were very nice, always scene walking through the Cabin. Maybe it was my luck, but food offered on the flight was delicious also, I should have asked for seconds.

They cancelled my last flight to Broome under bad weather but only provided room for one night of two. They also lost my luggage (I'm still waiting to get it back!). I waited 1 hour to get a customer service representative when I called. They told me they had no information on my luggage which is ridiculous as I have my luggage receipt and checked it in at my first departure location. They only gave me a small amount of money for me to buy clothes in my current location but nothing for the accommodation or food that I now have to buy as I'm stuck in Broome since I cannot reach my actual destination without my luggage. I do not recommend this airline. Service on the plane is fine but if anything goes wrong they will be rude and unhelpful (especially at the service desk in Perth).,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

It is a mammoth flight, 14 + 8 hours. Check-in great, lounge ok, boarding a shambles as the plane was too hot to board. So 400 people wait at a gate with no seats surrounded by hapless ground crew. From then on, all was spot on. Nice glass of champagne, excellent Neil Perry food, I’d pre-ordered a special. Really good wines, turned down the last glass and slept 9 hours. The flat bed is excellent, pyjamas, mattress, duvet and pillow all really helped. I’m not keen on the paired layout as if your neighbour moves a lot you can feel it. But although minimalist the seat does the job very well. Entertainment system is not so good, limited choice and screen in armrest. Short stopover and reboarding directly from Emirates lounge. Delicious bowl of soup then back to sleep before a good breakfast. Arrived early. Top deck of a 380 is always a good quiet place to be. Great service and a good price.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

For the first time ever my travelling companion had a cup of tea that actually tasted like a cup of tea on a plane - it was actually hot! The flight itself was rather uneventful, with a refreshment (cheese & biscuit snack) being served. There were no IFE screens, however you were able to download the Qantas Entertainment app and stream movies and TV shows from a network on the plane. Disembarkation was also very smooth, however the bags did take a fair while to arrive at the carousel.

Boeing 737 / 747,Premium Economy,5.0,December 2017,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes,Brisbane to Johannesburg via Sydney,5.0," | Flew Brisbane to Johannesburg via Sydney. Early 4.30am check in in Brisbane, and surprised by number of passengers checking in for international connections - even more surprised by passengers checking in at 04.30 for 05.00 flights. Whereas Qantas could have taken the standpoint that passengers were too late, they actively managed the queue to ensure the late passengers made their flight. We were on a 06.30 flight so checked in for our connecting flights with no problem. Our flight left on time, and we were advised that flying time to Sydney would be only 60 minutes. Despite turbulence for the first 15 minutes, a full breakfast service was provided, with a choice of bacon and vegetable pie or a continental breakfast comprising yoghurt, banana muffin and cereal snack bar. Worth noting that the yoghurt was top quality. Boarding for the main flight was a different story. Renovations are in progress, so the departure lounge was very small, and a 30 minute delayed boarding resulted in much congestion, with no attempt to manage the situation. The lounge was packed resulting in lots of people waiting in the corridor. It was an eye opener to see the number of passengers boarding at the premier check in who considered they were exempt from queuing and were entitled to push in at the front. Boarding once started proceeded efficiently and we were soon settled with a glass of champagne, and from then on the service was superb. Qantas premium economy on the 747 is excellent. A small cabin, comfortable seats, and plenty of space. On this particular aircraft there was a bathroom within the premium economy cabin, which is a big plus. However so much depends on the service, and on this particular flight the cabin staff were top rate. This was a 14 hour flight, during which there were 2 meals plus snacks. We had the option of pre-booking meals from the advance menu, but elected to go with the on-board choices, which were very good. Overall this was an excellent trip.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

I was a little worried that business class on this 737-800 aircraft which is used mainly for domestic and regional flights would be up to scratch on this international flight but the service was impeccable. Addressed by name, I was offered a pre-departure champagne and an amenities kit. Soon after take-off drinks were served, a menu provided and my order taken. The meal was excellent, the choices were good with an excellent variety of wines. The service was professional, courteous and continuous. The only complaint was that the person in front of me reclined their seat back about 1 minute after take-off and kept it in that position for the entire flight. The flight attendant, however, did ask if I wanted the passenger to put their seat upright during the meal service (this is a problem on this type of aircraft with these non-capsule seats). Another small concern is that there is no division or curtain between business and economy other than a small screen above the rear seats in business class. In fact, these rear business seats recline into the economy cabin as there is no bulkhead (but there is plenty of room to recline). Overall, this was a magnificent flight, excellent service and I wouldn't hesitate to fly this route again and on this type of aircraft. Of course my personal preference would be to bring back the A330's for this international service.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Checking in was stressful with no real help at kiosks and then passenger chaos at Sydney Airport at Gates 26 A to G with no one helping to organise massive queues. I have been in TSA chaos at LAX but Qantas and Sydney Airport made the TSA look efficient. The crew on the actual flight were terrific. They are ill served by a complacent management hierarchy.

Overall the aircraft was very clean, modern with good entertainment system. The food was substandard, and add to that the service provided by crew (at least most members) was horrible. Some of them have no smile and are very unwelcoming. A couple of times they missed our meals and we had to go and ask them for it, no apologies. Even then ended up giving us the wrong one. A crew member pushed the trolley up the aisle hitting my hand very hard, again no apology, he just wandered up the aisle.

The business cabin is really starting to show it’s age - seats need a really good steam clean  or to be overhauled and replaced with more up to date units. Entertainment options are good. Qantas often makes a song and dance of their Rockpool inspired dining, but overall food was awful. The menu was pedestrian and did not deliver - the person across the aisle from me sent his meal back. Fillet steak was grey throughout, the prawn starter was bland, and the panna cotta was weirdly goopy and overly sweet. The dinner menu was not much better with limited options that seemed worse than the previous offerings. I get that’s its airline food, but if you’re going to do it this badly then maybe it’s time to rethink your value proposition. The option to dine when suits you is all over the website, but the staff seem constantly overwhelmed so good luck trying to get any of the extra care and attention one would expect in the business cabin. Wine selection is extensive and might have made up for some of the lack lustre food performance, but good luck getting a glass of anything with staff being unable to handle the cabin size. If you do ask for anything they seem visibly annoyed. Normally there are snacks (sandwiches, fruit, etc.) available throughout the flight, and seeing as the meal options were so awful it would have been nice to try eat something else, but this was not offered by the attendants and the idea of requesting something seemed like a bad idea as asking for a glass of wine earns one a dirty look. For an airline that builds such high expectations they failed spectacularly.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Flight left on time and arrived slightly early in Melbourne, the crew were friendly and efficient and the lunch options were delicious - a hot chicken pie or turkish sandwich with pulled pork.

Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,December 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,Perth to Singapore,2.0," |  Perth to Singapore. This flight was an Emirates code-share operated by Qantas. I tried to check in online so that I could get an aisle seat, the Emirates website directed me to the Qantas website, which as a code-share would not allow me to check in. So I fronted to the airport check-in counter (no kiosks available) 3 hours before the flight, was about the 5th passenger checked in, and was told the last available seat was a window seat (my boarding pass had sequence number 45). I had a pass to the Qantas Lounge, valid for ""Qantas flight number""; my boarding pass said ""Flight QF77"" but the staff at the lounge refused to honour the lounge pass, claiming ""your fare went to Emirates"" - a spurious argument indeed considering the lounge pass was issued by my bank! Onboard, my confirmed special meal request had not been catered - fortunately one of the standard offerings was suitable. The aircraft looked band new, seat pitch of 30"" isn't adequate for a 5+ hour international flight, but at least this was the 29-row layout (the 30-row layout must be intolerable). Thinking about it, of all the airlines operating this route only Jetstar gives less leg room. Movie system was a new touch-screen system, but the selection was pretty ordinary, and the sound kept breaking up. Departure had been delayed due to a paperwork error which the pilot 'fessed up to, but the flight arrived pretty much on time. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to use this service again, especially not as a code-share passenger.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

If you can not afford to upgrade your seats do not fly Qantas long distance. We are a family of 5. My youngest is 6 years old. The people in front of us reclined their seats the entire flight leaving us with absolutely no leg room at all. I literally had to stand and climb out of my seat to go to the bathroom. I could not move my legs an inch. I have no health problems but my feet were swollen and my knee locked up after 15 hours of being literally pinned in one spot.  The cherry on top was the family in front of us would glare and make rude comments every time we even tried to move our bodies. Qantas is out to maximize occupancy to the detriment of passengers health and sanity. As an aside they did not accommodate my sons peanut allergy so he ate nothing at all for 15 hours.

The seat (4A) was comfortable but scuff marks on the surrounding panels had not been cleaned. Crew were courteous and professional.

The entertainment system was light on quality movies. The flight was smooth but the plane did not make up time en route and arrived two hours late. Luggage was on the carousel when I arrived.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,December 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,Melbourne to Orlando via Sydney / Dallas,2.0," |  Melbourne to Orlando via Sydney / Dallas. My wife and I booked flights from Melbourne to Orlando in December 2017. During our travel to and from the final destination with Qantas and its partner airlines we were met with a disheartening and unacceptable number of delays, errors, cancellations, and general lack of respect and care from the service members we reached out to for help. Lack of time provided by Qantas for connecting flight in Dallas resulting in a high probability of missing the connecting flight. Flight from Sydney to Dallas left more than an hour late, causing us to miss our connecting flight from Dallas to Orlando. New flights were issued which which added an additional hours and an additional flight and wait times to finally arrive in Orlando.  We called and spoke to Qantas and the staff on the phone were extremely unhelpful and misinformed us and advised that there were no other options. Instead we spoke to the staff in the airport who were able to find a more convenient flight for us. Our flight from Sydney to Melbourne was changed by Qantas in error from December 2017, to March 2018. This was discovered by us, and not Qantas. We then has to contact Qantas to have this corrected. Flights home from Orlando to Los Angeles was delayed, and ground staff advised that this would not impact our flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. When we arrived in Los Angeles we found that this did in-fact impact our flight. The ground staff checked our names and rushed us to another gate as the next flight was about to leave, only to find we had not been placed on this flight. We were then sent to another gate where they advised the flight was delayed by 5 hours, leaving at 3am. After waiting, the flight was delayed further to 4am As a result of these constant delays, we missed our flight from Sydney to Melbourne, and were instead placed on a flight much later - leaving us stuck in Sydney airport for 3 more hours. In Sydney we attempted to seek support from the Qantas service desk but they were dismissive and unapologetic. Note that during this entire experience we had to contact Qantas, as no one contacted us to advise of any of the unexpected changes, delays and cancellations. While I understand that there are factors outside of your control, and occasional delays are inevitability, the errors made by Qantas and the general lack of communication, support, and disrespect from staff members is unacceptable.",Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0

A330-200,Economy Class,3.0,January 2018,1.0,4.0,2.0,no,Singapore to Melbourne,3.0," |  I flew QF38 from Singapore to Melbourne in Economy only because Emirates (which code-shares with Qantas) was full. The evening meal was so below par - a ""Calzone"" (more like a stuffed bun, about 3"" long) was served in a cardboard box! I would have done better to have purchased a sandwich from the airport to eat onboard - and this is a Full-service airline of some repute! Compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines, this meal was a real shocker! Even the meals offered by China Southern Airlines were so much better than Qantas' offering. Breakfast was at least the usual rubber omelette with bacon and sausage. It appears the wines accompanying the evening meal were very average, but at least they were Australian. But the coffee (Grinders) and tea (Dilmah) offered were quite good. On the plus side, it was a nice touch that every Economy seat had a small bottle of water (about 250ml) in the seat pocket. Actually, that saves the crew some legwork from having to repeatedly answer passenger requests for water as longer flights like these can make one quite dehydrated, The seat had very little legroom, and it was virtually impossible to find a comfortable position to sleep, especially when the passenger in front had their chair in the fully reclined position virtually all the way. Cabin service, while courteous, was almost non-existent. Unlike many of its major competitors, no refresher towels pre-takeoff and landing, no drinks offered after takeoff, only with the meal service. Despite being an overnight flight, no ""goodie"" bag containing eyeshades, toothbrush and socks were given, unlike SQ or EK. Entertainment was adequate but the screens were quite small, and not very responsive to the touch. I was quite disappointed with Qantas. Usually, I book Qantas but would always select Emirates planes (if available), which offers much more legroom, especially on their A380s. The Singapore Airlines A380 is also a bit more spacious but not as spacious as that of Emirates.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Second, it was so cold inside the plane and their blankets were thin. They keep running out of things. I dont know if it is because of my seating but i never received enough drinks or complete food as they kept running out when they got to my row.

This leaves at 6.25 pm as QF17 and gets in at 1.30pm on the same day. A superb time to arrive as QF11 (which I prefer as its the A380) gets in at 6 am and just a pain unless you have booked a hotel room for the night before also. It was a light load and so plenty of space. Usual QF standards of food ie satisfactory. The FA's were professional and friendly. The B747 was/is a great aircraft but its showing its age. The A380 style seating does lift it a bit although the seats themselves look a bit smaller than on the Airbus. The washrooms are well used! One notices the noise levels the most compared to the Airbus but it is a plane designed in the 60's.

Amenities include a water bottle, pillow, blanket and earphones. No fixed headrest onboard. Cabin crew announcements were clear. They are fairly attentive and friendly. The inflight meal choices are chicken salad, vegetarian eggplant masala with rice and naan, beef brisket withg polenta. All meals come with warm and soft garlic bread. I chose the beef brisket. The vegetables were overcooked but the polenta was delicious. The beef brisket is cooked to perfection, soft, tender and almost divine, if you pair it with a bottle of shiraz or merlot!

Cabin Crew were attentive before and after takeoff, and during the meal service, constantly keeping an eye to see if anyone needed further assistance. The Customer Service Manager genuinely welcomed me, along with other passengers during the flight. Definitely a step up from some of my previous Business Class experience.

They charged me more than $10000 for a return flight for two people from San Francisco to Sydney. At that rate you would expect that they would do everything possible to ensure that you are comfortable throughout your flight. Instead, they forced my partner and I to move from the pre-assigned seats we had checked into 9hours before the flight was due. They did not give us a choice nor did they give us an adequate explanation. The seats we were moved to were cramped and the entertainment system did not work. Moving seats prior to a long flight when you had completely settled in and are about to fall asleep an hour after checking in is not only rude and frustrating but had completely ruined the end to my holiday. When I called to give feedback they requested a feedback form and informed that they would return my call within 3 days. 2 weeks later I had not received a call and when I called the staff member was dismissive and unhelpful to say the least. She was unable to provide any explanation for why I was moved. Not only that, she offered an insincerely apology and 10000 frequent flyer points. If you are charging a premium then provide a premium service, not a disorganised and unprofessional attitude. Nothing about this airline was acceptable or satisfactory. ",Business,1.0,nan

I fly this route regularly throughout the year, but have noticed every time it’s serviced by the A330 there is an issue. Qantas really needs to keep up punctuality standards if they are using a wide Body jet for domestic routes. Delays happen, but you need to be able to control them and if using the A330 for such short domestic flights becomes a problem it’s best to stick with a B737.

The A330-200s flown between Singapore and Australia were fitted with Qantas' latest-generation seat and inflight entertainment (IFE) system, while the B737-800s offered a different seat with a similar IFE system (slightly smaller selection of content). The seat pitch was more than sufficient for me (at more than 180 cm in height), particularly onboard the A330, the depth of recline was acceptable, with the moving seat pan serving to minimise the inconvenience caused to and by other passengers. I found features such as the adjustable headrests and USB ports useful, the fact that these were present onboard the B737s as well makes them all the more impressive. The service onboard was sincere, with all requests attended to promptly and courteously. The cabin crew were attentive and conducted regular refreshment and rubbish collection runs through the cabin. Only minor touches such as newspapers and amenity kits were absent. The quality of the meals served (lacto-ovo vegetarian) ranged from good (breakfast on the flights to and from Christchurch) to excellent (all other meals), with the staggered delivery of courses (i.e. rather than on a single tray) and inclusion of snacks in the meal service allowing for some flexibility. A larger selection of mid-flight snacks would have been appreciated, though, given the rather small portions. The connections at Brisbane and Sydney were seamless, when the already-short connection at Brisbane was exacerbated by a delay in the flight from Singapore, airline employees were deployed at frequent intervals along the route between the two gates to guide passengers and expedite the transit process. In summary, for the roundtrip price of SGD 1354.50 paid, Qantas offered good value for money.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Qantas is often bagged as a national sport here in Australia but on the strength of these flights they have won my ongoing loyalty and then some. Very impressed all round.

When I came to ask if there was any chance I could get another coffee, the air hosts made a pot just to give me a cup, and then also gave me extra left-over banana bread, with more to hand to the people around me. The host looking after my section, was incredibly sweet and thoughtful, and even brought me another dessert to have with the coffee, when I hadn't even asked for it.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,5.0,nan,no,Sydney to Wellcamp,3.0," |  Sydney to Wellcamp. Dash 8-400 Turboprop Flight about two thirds full. Two male cabin crew one very efficient and friendly, the ""supervising"" male extremely rude and unpleasant. I would like to seek clarification on a few statements and expectations made by the head of the cabin crew on our flight on the 17th January from Sydney to Wellcamp Toowoomba. Three of us had travelled to and from Perth on business. With only 20 minutes to transfer from one flight to the other, I had purchased three steamed dim sums from the Sydney terminal café precinct. I carried them onto the plane and our team shared them mid-flight when the cheese and biscuits had been distributed by the cabin crew. I had placed the plastic container and the wrappings from the snacks supplied by the crew in a small plastic bag (the one I had carried the three dim sums onto the flight in). When the rubbish was being collected by the cabin crew after all on the flight had finished eating, the cabin team leader said “I will not be collecting the garbage you have brought onto the flight. We have limited space, you will have to keep it on your lap and take it off the flight with you. If there is any room in our trash once I have finished cleaning the cabin, then and only then, will I remove it.” He then walked off leaving the rubbish with me. I was left dumbfounded, wondering what I had done to offend the man. The flight was two thirds full. I was seated in seat 8B beside a large gentleman and, as I am 105 Kg myself, mid-flight I changed seats to the third row from the front where the whole row was empty. Five minutes later the same cabin crew member asked me to return to my original seat. I explained I was cramped with two large men in the one row and that the 8 or so seats around me were vacant so what harm could it cause? The cabin crew member said in a stern voice. “I’m instructing you to move back to your assigned seat.” I said “I have been using QANTAS for 30 years and had never been told that I could not move seats after take-off especially when so many were vacant.” he responded, “The flight needs to be balanced” I said, “when I checked in online there were numerous seats all over the plane that were vacant, I could have picked any one of them, how did you determine who weighs what and then decide where they should sit?” he said, “Return to your assigned seat immediately!” and walked off abruptly. Again I was left shaking my head in disbelief and so were the other passengers on the plane. A number of whom urged me to make a complaint about the cabin crew members rudeness. I now find myself writing my first ever letter of complaint. Can you tell me the QANTAS policy on bringing food and by association, the wrappings onto a flight? Can you clarify the QANTAS policy on moving seats when a cramped situation can be overcome by the relocation of a passenger? I found the whole experience humiliating. ",Business,3.0,nan

We were told the luggage was put on a later flight, arriving after midnight (it was 7:00 p.m. when this happened) and that arrangements would be made to deliver our luggage the next day. Everyone had to stand in line to file a report - took about 20 minutes per person/group so you can imagine how long it took. We unfortunately had an early morning pick-up for an activity and had no clothes or toiletries. Didn't hear a word the next day so had to repeatedly call because almost impossible to get anyone on the phone. Checked tracking and it said they were still looking for our luggage. Bottom line is we received our luggage about 10:00 p.m. the next day. No apology from Qantas. Oh, and another other couple on our tour was still waiting for luggage that Qantas lost two days prior - different flight. Our tour driver said it happens all the time; she hears this from customers and it's always Qantas. Heard this from our hotel as well. Terrible customer service.

Some of my people working on a job at Crown Perth had to get over there on Tuesday 20 March. They were at the Melbourne airport at 6.00 am ready to go. That plane had air condition problems and they had to fly a plane from Sydney for them to change to so they were about 5 hours late. I flew to Perth on another airline no probs at all and arrived early. Some of my workers were coming back to Melbourne on the 1.30 pm flight and it was delayed for 45 min. Myself and one of my workers were booked on the 3.00 pm flight to arrive back in Melbourne. There was a message that the plane cabin temperature was too hot so we could not board until it was cool - how does that happen. Then about to board and one of the crew members came off sick and we all had to sit down again until they found a replacement crew member. (Not sure why all that happened after the air conditioning issue. Then we finally boarded and everyone was on and they sat us there in a very hot plane for about another 20 min and the ipad movie pods were not working. Plane finally got off the ground at 4.30 pm. It is the flow on that they do not see. It meant my workers had done too many hours so I had to give them today (Following day) off. So the project we were supposed to be finishing today has to be re scheduled for next week. People on the plane did not seem to mind so much but as I knew there had been 3 bad planes in two days that all affected me and my work I had to say something.

After dinner the lights went out and the curtain came across the galley, not once during the 9.5 hour trip were we asked if we wanted water or anything - we are the type that does not like using the call button - breakfast was very basic, a squashed up ham and cheese croissant or cereal and fruit, no hot breakfast - most economy flight breakfasts are better , the B747 is showing it's age with noisy airconditioning and tired toilets, flight was on time but service should have been much better, I will stick to economy in future - especially as I pay for the flights myself.",Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0

Seat pitch tight and toilets like vertical coffins. The only meal choice was vegetable green curry at 10.30am. Or an apple. The other choice appeared to run out about half way down the cabin. Not surprising with green curry that early. One hour before landing given a frozen fruit juice ice block labelled ""made in China"". From an airline that rests on Aussiecentric marketing. At descent, offered a chocolate of a brand known to taste like soap. So nothing appealing to eat in over 4.5 hours. No seat back entertainment. Overhead screens glarey and barely visible, showing some superhero movie. Why is it you can fly Sydney - Melbourne and get unnecessary seat back entertainment often but never on a 4.5 plus hour flight to DRW.

Qantas are very consistent with the mainline service. Check in at Sydney was fine albeit they are moving to an automated self check in service. Now being a QFF gold and likely platinum soon, it is nice for FF to have a check in agent to do the work and as a small reward for the money spent with the airline. But technology waits for no man. The Sydney Qantas lounge is in need of more space and a good spruce up. Flight was fine and on time arrival. Had a long layover as was waiting for QF9 and a colleague travelling from Melbourne so made the most of the excellent lounge. QF9 to London was fine albeit late arriving and departing to LHR so a 12.40pm arrival was an hour late. Now as for LHR - nightmare.

The outbound to Brisbane was very routine from easy check in, relaxing lounge, friendly crew and great punctuality.

Once the flight was airborne for Sydney, he decided to offer me, along with the passenger beside me a bottle of water and welcomed us back and said ""if there is anything I can do to make your journey more comfortable, please let myself or the crew know"".

The plane was further delayed again due to aircon malfunctioning inside the main cabin. It was extremely warm. I am offered an exit row so plenty of leg room and the seat is comfortable. No fixed headrest which makes long flights on the single aisle jet a little difficult. Dinner was served and there was 3 options.

What dingbat in Qantas thought up the idea of having seat back screens with games installed so that the person behind me could punch the screen for 2 hours without stop as he played his game all the way from Melbourne to Brisbane. I noticed the guy sitting in the aisle seat across from me doing the same thing. The end result is being punched in the back of the head non-stop making it impossible for me to rest my head back at all. This is terrible!

I took Emirates A380 in 2017 for the same route so good opportunity to compare Qantas and Emirates level of service. Since the flight ticket was more expensive I was expecting something nice. First deceptions came as soon as I sat in my seat: reduced room for legs, no USB plug to recharge my phone, small screen with very few interesting movies, meal rests and hairs on my tablet, and no glass holder on the back seat so you are compelled to have the tablet on your knees to put the glass on it. The boarding started an hour earlier than expected which explains why the plane was looking so dirty inside, they probably did not clean it at all despite the plane staying at least 3 hours on the Dubai tarmac. As a result, the boarding was finished one hour earlier than departure time, so we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited, three hours in the plane before takeoff. No green light given by the control tower apparently. As soon as the ascent was done the staff started to get the meals ready and it took them 1 hour for them to get ready with the meals. I somehow had the impression that it was the first flight for the entire cabin crew. Another hour and a half before finally receiving a meal to eat which was OKish but the portion size and meal quality were below Emirates standards. I enquired with the staff about the next time a meal would be served in order to know when I could sleep he said ""I dunno, but you'll get some snacks in a couple of hours"". Yeah, nobody saw any snacks coming during the entire flight, then all cabin staff just disappeared, I have not seen a single one of them during 9 hours. Probably all went to sleep at the same time (very smart move in case there is an emergency). At some point during the flight the sound of the TV stopped functioning for my neighbors and me. The crew came to check and quickly left by saying ""sometimes things just go bad"". Great. I then took the opportunity to look at the entire cabin configuration and it actually looked pretty depressing. Black seats, non-led lightning, damaged trolleys. Emirates does a much better job here with night sky rooftops and dimmed led lighting. After more than 9 hours without eating anything I started to feel pretty bad so I was happy to see the crew preparing the second meal of the flight (note: there were 3 meals on Emirates + 2 snacks) but again they were completely disorganized and it took them ages to get ready and serve everybody. My meal was almost cold when I received it, again it was OKish but I just needed to eat something otherwise I would have fainted so I ate it, and the portion size was still bigger than if I would have taken the alternative: an apple.

Table setting was minimal, no salt or pepper, my fish with rice was terrible salty, the sauce on my salad was wrong - I asked for palm sugar dressing and got balsamic instead! 2 choices of bread slices. What happened to 3 choices of bread rolls and garlic bread? No offer of ginger ale top up or any other drinks during my meal and what happened to trolley servicing in First Class when there is a full flight? Is it that troublesome to go an extra mile for paying customers? In-flight Entertainment - I watched ""Wonder"" and ""Wonder Woman"" but the movies kept pausing and lagging, it felt like Qantas had downloaded these movies from a pirated site hence the bad quality! Apparently my husband had the same problem too. What a terrible experience for First Class passengers. An hour before we land, I asked for another Evian bottle of water (500ml size) and was told that each passenger has one only and if I wanted more water then she has to bring my empty bottle to the galley to be topped up with bottled water. Are you telling me that all the money and points we paid for the flight, Qantas cannot afford to give their First Class passengers more than 1 bottle of Evian water? And how confident am I to believe that it was topped up with ""bottled water"" - not! This whole episode makes me feel like Qantas is seriously cutting costs so much that they must be in financial trouble, what else is Qantas cutting cost on I wonder. Some of the crew walked up and down the aisle like elephants. Its a night flight. Passengers are trying to sleep. Be gentler and quieter. Can't imagine the noise level if I was seated near the galley. Smiles from the crew at boarding and disembarking does not make the terrible experience during the flight any better!

Boeing 737-800,Business Class,4.0,April 2018,2.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Singapore to Perth,3.0," | I flew QF72 from Singapore to Perth and the flight was extremely full (possibly due to the school holidays). Business class passengers were asked to board first (after families with young children) and this is probably not a good idea as passengers in economy have to file past and queue through the front cabin in this single aisle B737-800. It really is not a suitable aircraft for this very popular international route. After all passengers were seated we were offered a pre-departure drink, an amenities kit but no newspapers or cold/hot towels. Soon after take-off, drink and dinner orders were taken but the menu choices for business class took me by surprise - three seafood choices (fish dumpling soup, salmon salad or a prawn roll) with only one meat choice (pork) for main course. Entree was a choice of soup or chicken salad - I elected to have the chicken salad and it was very nice. Not being terribly keen on seafood, I chose the pork for main course, however, it had already run out (as was the case for another passenger) so I eventually chose the prawn and celery roll. It was served cold and possibly the worst airline meal I have ever eaten. Basically it was a hot-dog roll with a few chopped prawns scattered over the top - totally tasteless and inedible. Drinks were topped up from time to time during the meal service, however, more attention was given to passengers after the the meal service was completed which is totally understandable. As there is no division/curtain between business and economy there seems to be quite a lot of traffic through the forward cabin so there is little chance of taking a rest in these domestic style seats. Fortunately the passenger in front of me did not fully recline his seat as was the case on the Perth - Singapore sector earlier in the year. Overall, the crew did their very best to take care of passengers, however, as mentioned before, this small aircraft doesn't really seem appropriate for this very competitive and busy international sector. I sincerely hope Qantas considers the reinstatement of their A330's sometime in the future. In the meantime, the business class menu choices need to be urgently reviewed (as does a division/curtain between cabins).",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Every hour thereafter, we were advised that the flight was further delayed. Eventually it departed around 2.30 pm - over 4 hours late. To compensate, we were given a meal voucher each for $15. I am not necessarily basing my review score on the delayed flight, as I know delays can sometimes happen. After boarding, I noticed each passenger had a pillow and blanket on their seat, however, on closer look at the pillow I noticed that it had been used previously - pillow slip was crumpled and was a little dirty and also, several long black hairs were attached. For me, this is simply unacceptable from an airline who believes it is a first class airline, a rung above most. The flight itself was fine. Drinks/meal service was acceptable. A snack (ice cream) was handed out during the flight. In flight entertained worked well, good selection of programs and a good size screen. For a tall man, the amount of leg space is very limited, but I knew this when I booked this economy seat.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

We sat near the end of the plane and the staff that took care of us were extremely friendly, kind, and accommodating. My request for a gluten-free, vegan meal was missed, but the staff gave me options based on what they had available and even advised that I call the airline a few days before my next flight to ensure my request was confirmed for my trip home.  Unfortunately, one of our luggages got lost (we weren't the only ones from the flight and apparently the same happened with my brother), but Qantas was great at handling it  - they provided us with two personal kits (pjs and some toiletries) and a pre-paid credit card to purchase some new clothes in the meantime.

I asked staff three times to rectify the problem but all my requests were ignored. Ground staff at Sydney we’re dreadful - one of my co passengers had to que whilst carrying her three month old baby! No offer of early boarding for the elderly, disabled or families with small children were made. The menus were very limited and the standard of the food well below that offered by other airlines I have recently travelled with. In flight entertainment was poor with limited choice (when the systems were working). To make matters worse my scheduled flight from Singapore to London of 11.45 has been delayed by four hours; I have been notified by email (two hours before departing for the airport) with a local telephone number to call if I have any queries. Needless to say the number which I have called repeatedly, is not answered! My experience of Qantas in a nutshell is that it is uncaring, shoddy and unreliable; I would certainly not recommend it  - what might look like a cheap deal may end up costing you more in inconvenience as indeed it has me!

Checked in at self serve counter, it was easy but a helpful ground staff  assisted me, then she led me to the baggage counter. The check in was quick and without any dramas. The boarding wasn't as friendly, a younger crew member didnt even bother to say hello or welcome the passengers. Through out the flight she was hostile. The senior crew members were very friendly and courteous. My seat came with a pillow, blanket and headsets. No hot towels or snacks were given. The seat pitch was below average and I felt very cramped towards the end of the flight. IFE was good. The food and service was a disaster, it was slow and disorganized. 2 hours take off, I hadn't received any drinks and when the food trolley reached us, they had only fish with steamed potatoes and broccoli. It was served with a bottle of a water and bread roll. The food looked and tasted bad, more like what you get on low cost or regional airlines. Finally the drinks trolley arrived when people had almost finished their dinner. The crew member was lovely though, I had a James Boag, I was offered another beer later and she remembered what I was drinking. Then came the Weis Mango & Cream bar along with KitKat which was some consolation even though they cost only about $1.50 in supermarket. The cockpit crew was very professional, the announcements were probably the best I have heard from a captain. They updated us even on the maneuvers they were going to make and landed the plane smoothly despite heavy turbulence. The flight arrived on time and checked in luggage came out quickly without any damage. Overall the flight was disappointing.

Once the inflight dinner service started I was approached by flight attendant who rudely asked ""do you want dinner?"" I responded ""yes please, what are the options?"" And her answer was ""read your menu!"" even though I had no idea a menu was stuck in my seat pocket. She then went on to put my food in front of me as well as the lovely couple sitting next to me. During the whole flight every time she served us she was impolite, impatient and almost aggressive. Not once did she smile or even tried to be remotely interested in our comfort. I have never felt so uncomfortable during a flight. I had planned on putting in a complaint with QANTAS once I arrived home but luckily I ran into a customer service manager whilst purchasing duty free items in Sydney. I explained the situation and he was apologetic and advised he would personally see to it that someone from head office contact me to discuss the issue. To date I've not had any communication from QANTAS and am not holding my breath. On another note, the food served during the flight was disgusting. Very disappointed to see QANTAS has completely lost the quality and service they once had. I will never fly with them again after this experience. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Upon getting to the airport I printed my ticket and went to check my luggage. However before doing so I asked the Qantas staff at check in to check my ticket and to tell me if there would be individual entertainment (TVs) on this flight. They said there were. I told them that I had asked this question to the Qantas personnel in Sydney two weeks earlier and they had told me the same thing on a five hour flight from Sydney to Perth and they had been wrong. I specifically asked that they be sure as I would check my computer if that was the case. They told me that they were sure there would be individual TVs for all passengers on this flight. Needless to say there were not. The second flight in a row, with Qantas, within two weeks of each other, to or from Perth where they had specifically told me that there would be individual entertainment for passengers and there was not. Perth is a very isolated city. Every flight to or from Perth to the other major Australian cities takes a minimum of three hours. It is not unreasonable to believe that in asking, specifically, about in-flight entertainment one should be told up-front and accurately what type of flight they should expect.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,March 2018,2.0,1.0,4.0,no,Cairns to Los Angeles via Brisbane,2.0," |  I booked a ticket via American Airlines for Qantas flights for a trip. I was flying from Cairns through Brisbane and Los Angeles to my final destination, San Diego. The flights were OK, nothing to rave about. The seats seemed smaller and more cramped other international flights I had taken. The food was too salty and lacked texture, but otherwise was fine. The attendants were kind and polite but a bit too strict when I asked for a drink (""Sir, you cannot have two drinks at the same time"" when I had about 1 or 2 sips in the bottom of the dinky cup, which I effortlessly finished on the spot). However, my main qualm with Qantas is with their ""Customer Care"" and agents and representatives. While I was in the air from Cairns to Brisbane, Qantas cancelled my flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles, and I received a notification when we touched down. Naturally, I was confused and annoyed - why did they cancel my long-haul flight and why didn't they tell me before I took off from Cairns? I called Qantas who said it was cancelled for ""operational requirements"" but I could take a flight the day after (wouldn't work with my schedule) or connect me through Sydney at a painfully early hour in the morning. However, I had to call American Airlines to actually book the seat. Since Qantas and American Airlines had literally zero communication and little to no knowledge of what was going on with my original flight (Qantas said they could not notify American Airlines and I had to call them), I had to spend about 4 phone calls and 2 hours on the phone trying to fix the issue. I eventually booked new flights that added about 12 hours of additional travel time. When I tried to speak to a representative on the ground at the Brisbane airport, he was incredibly unhelpful and curt (I'll cut him some slack - it was 4:30 am). He could not tell me why the flight was cancelled, could not file my complaints, and could not provide any information except ""Qantas has a process and the process works."" Well, I can tell you first hand that the process is extremely convoluted and difficult and does not actually work. I spent several weeks trying to reach Qantas ""Customer Care"" before I heard back. No resolution has been reached for a flight two months ago. Tip: skip the mess and reach out via Twitter. Or just fly with a different airline.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

We explained this extremely clearly and he said that, because Alaska are a Qantas partner, Qantas would take care of this for us in-air. Of course, this was false. We arrived in LAX with no connection information. Alaska was merciful and didn't charge us a re-booking fee, but that was their decision, not Qantas.

I had to have hard talk before they changed their mind and finally we were sent via Qantas. After reaching Sydney, we waited almost 1 hour with many other passengers and our baggage never arrived? We had to go and question Qantas staff and they said to lodge an entry with baggage services and we did it accordingly.

She stopped, looked at me then moved to another man who was supposed to sit next to me but decided he wanted to move to an empty row for the space and went to him.  Maybe I don’t look like a frequent flyer which is ok too. Then the manager comes through acknowledges the man in front, stops by me and kept moving.

A330 200,Economy Class,4.0,May 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Melbourne to Auckland,4.0," |  Melbourne to Auckland. Excellent flight, on time departure out of Melbourne. I quite like the new look of the cabin, black quilted pattern seats which were reasonably comfortable. The crew were very friendly and pleasant. This was the first time I'd ordered a vegan meal due to a change in my dietary requirements, I was very surprised how good the meal was, ratatouille with couscous accompanied by a nice glass of Ozzy red. It was a great touch when the crew came through with ice cream which of course I took and gave it to my daughter. I managed to take in two movies from the entertainment options. We got into Auckland 20 minutes early, a good end to a great flight. ",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Sydney to Melbourne,4.0," |  I enjoyed the flight from Sydney to Melbourne. It departed and arrived on time. The staff were very cheerful and efficient. The dinner served was not large (roast chicken), but fine for a short flight. The wine was excellent. There was no seat back video screens but that did not matter for such a short flight.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Melbourne to Sydney,3.0, |  Unfortunately the trip from Melbourne to Sydney was delayed by over 30 minutes. Apart from that it was a very enjoyable flight. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The dinner (salad) was very tasty and it's always nice to have free drinks. Seat back screens were a pleasant surprise as well.,Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 737,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,4.0,4.0,nan,yes,Sydney to Brisbane,4.0," | It was hard to fault this short haul flight with Qantas. The terminal at SYD is spacious with easy self-service bag drop and helpful staff if anything goes wrong. There are many shops, cafes and facilities right up to the gates. Boarding was efficient and on-time both on our outbound and return flights. The real gem of these flights were the polite and friendly to a fault crews who greeted each passenger with warmth and by name on arrival. During the flight despite it being only a short 1 hour trip, the crew were professional and delivered a snack and drinks service which was very tasty and very much appreciated. The whole process went smoothly from beginning to end and you can't really ask for much more. Qantas' short haul domestic product is certainly worth it over cheaper rivals, especially if you have checked luggage which is included in the ticket price. A great experience.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 737,Business Class,5.0,June 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Brisbane to Sydney,5.0," | So impressed with Qantas. Could not fault them. Not only is their safety clearly the best in the world, their service was incredible. The pilots took the time to say farewell to the passengers. That’s never happened on Virgin that my employer used to book me on. Will be flying Qantas from now on.",Business,5.0,5.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,July 2018,1.0,4.0,3.0,no,Los Angeles to Melbourne,3.0," |  Los Angeles to Melbourne. We were a little unsatisfied with our recent trip from Melbourne to Los Angeles. The seats and entertainment were okay but the food served was very unpleasant. For example, they served a snack in the middle of the flight that was a samosa with gooey cheese and ham. Unsatisfactory food on a 15 hour flight made the trip unpleasant.",Family Leisure,4.0,3.0
Boeing 747-400,Business Class,1.0,June 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,no,Johannesburg to Sydney,2.0," |  Johannesburg to Sydney. Having paid $4500 for business class, I was expecting the best service and food. Instead firstly, no wet towels when you board or when you wake up. Side by side seating, so you had climb over the neighbour's legs. Old, noisy as hell 747 jumbo. Small TV screen. The menu was on a piece of A4 paper with copying marks on it. No choice of wines. Red or white, Sir! Salad was four tiny pieces of lettuce leaf and a dressing. Main meal Ok but not outstanding. I asked for cheese and I was expecting a presentation board. Instead I got one small piece of cheddar, one small piece of Brie, three small crackers and three grapes! I had to ask for drinks. The staff were bored with their jobs and not willing to keep checking on you.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A330-200,Economy Class,3.0,June 2018,1.0,5.0,3.0,no,Singapore to Melbourne,3.0," |  Singapore to Melbourne. After a long flight, Rome-IST-SIN, on Turkish Airlines which was very good and especially the food and inflight service, to then embark on OF 0038 for Melbourne and was offered a ""Calzone"" which was a small bun filled with nothing like a Calzone, and an ice-cream on a stick, during flight only a banana and then for breakfast a small selection of fruit or a terrible Omelette, not even a bread roll, bad weak coffee, just disgusting. Qantas inflight service has improved a little but not compared to other International Companies. Shameful. Then because of fog in Melbourne, we were unable to land, diverted to Sydney and finally back to Melbourne 5 hours late, not the fault of Qantas but all we were offered was a shortbread biscuit, dry cracker with dip and a small bottle of water. Terrible, Once again I will try to steer clear of Qantas flights in the future.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Check-In and security was smooth, afterwards I headed off to the Qantas Club to relax before departure. I was well greeted during boarding and was very impressed with the customer service. IFE was a bit limited, though the new content was a plus.Overall, the flight was very smooth sailing from take off, refreshment service and touch down.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,March 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,Johannesburg to Sydney,2.0," |  Johannesburg to Sydney. Qantas has a huge problem staffing their call centres, desks, help-chat lines, and website. First be aware, that if you are using a browser that is not Internet explorer it does not work. Firefox does not work. If you try to access their online chat, it comes back they are too busy. There is no wait line. If you try to call it is a good 30 minute wait, at least. To save money the airline has clearly cut back on essential website design, and staffing needed to help customers. In fact there is no phone number even listed on their website that I could locate. Folks we are talking about a seriously deficient airline, unable and unwilling to assist customers. They do this, even though they charge extra for helping! So even making money charging for help, they cant be bothered. Pathetic beyond belief.",Business,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,no,Auckland to Melbourne,1.0," |  Auckland to Melbourne. Rung up customer services prior to my trip to find out if my plane came with movies at the back of the seat or if I had to provide my own tablet as it was not very clear on their website. This was a simple quick question that wasn't a security risk, however the customer service person grilled me with many questions firstly my eticket, name, age, address, phone number, where I was going to, day etc. All she needed was my eticket number to check on that particular aircraft. All I wanted was to know if I needed to carry my tablet by hand and download the app. It was getting thoroughly annoying with all the questions that were not relevant so I asked for a supervisor. She would not put me through to someone unless I answered all questions. This really put my attitude towards Qantas at a 1/10 even before the flight. After over 10 minutes on the phone, I was finally told that I had movies. After all that, a positive outcome. Now the actual flight: Staff on the flight were very friendly and obliging.  The seats were terrible, the tiniest I have come across. The seat in front of me was pretty much at my knees and I'm only 5.7"". Now the trays for food, you couldn't even lay these flat, they are situated too low on the backs of the seats. So the meal was very uncomfortable. The food was very nice and a good size. However, even though a few good points, seat comfort is the most important and the attitude of the staff member prior to my flight has put me off every travelling Qantas again. I only took this flight (one way Auckland to Melbourne) as it was the earliest in the morning other than Virgin alliance with Air NZ and I didn't want to fly Virgin due to no meals and no entertainment. However the alliance between Virgin and Air NZ is about to end, so I look forward to flying both ways on Air NZ in the future.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,1.0,2.0,3.0,no,Sydney to Bangkok,3.0," |  Sydney to Bangkok 14 June. Having flown with the domestic arm of Qantas 36 hours before on what could only be laughable such was the pathetic organization, an urgent need to fly to Bangkok  which meant the first available flight ex Syd and given I had domestic connections, Qantas was the only choice. Flight departure delayed and no information forthcoming as to why. Eventually informed we would be boarding late due to the 'late arrival'. Aircraft departs gate , Capt. advises technical problem and we return to gate only. Pax sat there waiting, waiting. Finally departed 2 hours late adding more stress to our already stressed circumstances. We were in Row 45 and whilst seated there observing the young female cabin crew member seated at the exit adjacent to us, having a wonderful conversation to 2 passengers also in row 45 seats A & B - only to hear the cabin crew member offer as soon as the seat belt sign went off, a drink (alcoholic) in real glasses - not the plastic served to other members in cattle class - whilst we looked on and waited (remembering we already had departed / waited 2 hours late) for what appears to be Qantas' mandatory 2 hours waiting time before they start serving drinks / meals after take off. This is a shambolic airline and given the circumstances behind the reason for travel, left us with a very sour taste in our mouth.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Business Class,4.0,June 2018,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,Las Vegas to Sydney via San Francisco,4.0," | I had a flight delayed and was re-routed through San Francisco (this is a very common occurrence - almost an art form in that first world country with a third world airlines known as the USA). The airline refused to provide boarding passes for the connecting flight as they are contracted to do. As such you cannot get through that pasenger - friendly organisation known as the TSA to get a boarding pass because Qantas deserts the check-in early. So I stood there for 45 min watching my international connection board and depart. This is the second time Qantas has done this to me. No offer of a hotel, no attempt to address this serial problem. So if you want to get out of the USA use one carrier. OneWorld is a con - its all talk but doesn't happen, Qantas is so full they don't care.",Business,2.0,nan
