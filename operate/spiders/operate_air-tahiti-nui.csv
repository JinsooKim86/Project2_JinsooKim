nan,Economy Class,2.0,January 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Los Angeles to Auckland,2.0," |  On January 17th, 2017 me and my husband travelled from Los Angeles to Auckland, New Zealand. Our flight with Air Tahiti Nui delayed almost 7 hrs because of mechanical issues with the plain in Los Angeles. When we informed the representative about our travel destination is Melbourne, she promised no problem, we will taken care of you and rebook you to other flight to make sure you reach your destination. Of course that was not the case. Because of the flight delay we missed our connecting flight in Auckland to Melbourne. Not Air Tahiti and not Air New Zealand helped us in any way when we ask help in the airport too. Both airlines pointed their finger to each other. The bottom line is we had to purchase 2 one way tickets for next day to Melbourne; cost us $800 dollars and we had to sleep in the airport in Auckland. I filed a complaint with both Airlines and I never heard back from Air Tahiti ever. I sent the e-mail to them 4 times without any acknowledgment or anything. Also, I tried to call them for a follow up, but the person on the phone told me I can reach their customer service only by e-mail. Their customer service is terrible. If you have any other airlines you can use, use other carrier.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A340,Economy Class,5.0,April 2016,3.0,2.0,3.0,no,Los Angeles to Paris,2.0," | When booking my flight from Los Angeles to Paris, I was thinking about Air France. I came across Air Tahiti Nui as a quick and cheap departure option on Expedia. I wasn't too sure about this airline. When we got to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), we stood in the check-in line. The lady checking in our luggage was very nice and professional. As she was checking our passports and wrapping the badges on our luggage, she warned us about frequent delays on this particular flight. As she anticipated, we were delayed for about an hour or more. This was imperative because we had a shuttle service in Paris who had our initial arrival time and had to wait for us. Anyway, we boarded the aircraft and noticed that our economy seats were very small and tight. For an 11 hour flight, these seats were terribly tiny and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment was very limited. The movie selection was limited and there wasn't a variety of genres. The positive aspect of this airline was the service. The attendants aboard the flight were efficient, responsive, cooperative, and professional. I can't think of anything else to say about the staff. The food onboard the flight was just like your generic airline food. It was cold, slimy, and disgusting. I recommend purchasing food and snacks prior your flight in the terminal. Overall, staff was great but accommodations and passenger convenience weren't well.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

The original plane we were to take had mechanical problems so we waited for 3 hours for another plane. It appeared that there was quite a bit of confusion with this and whilst waiting we noticed the very slow boarding and taking off process of other planes. When it came our turn, whilst all were on board it still took over a half an hour to count and recount passengers. The food on both flights to and from Papeete was substandard and in two cases inedible. The cabin staff appeared only moderately trained and made me wonder how they would perform if there was a problem. Tahiti and the surrounding islands and its people are wonderful. On a return trip I would select another airline. On arrival at Auckland airport, it took three hours to organise our accomodation due to missed connections.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

No online check in was possible, no seats were available by calling 72 hours before, but by miracle they were available at check in after getting the check in manager to assist.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Papeete to Los Angeles,1.0," |  Los Angeles to Papeete (Tahiti) return. Both flights left over one hour late. While we were waiting for the plane to leave the terminal at LAX, the captain announced that we would be delayed for an hour to wait on 25 late passengers. After waiting for more than an hour and seeing a few passengers board, we finally left. This must have been the plane that was not updated as is mentioned in so many negative reviews. The tv screen in front of my seat had so many lines in it was not worth watching. What was so disappointing was the service on this flight which was practically non existent. Cups of water were served in the same size cups used in a water cooler and two would not equal one measuring cup. I received two before the crew retired for most of the flight. Drinks were served to the middle rows and when I asked for one, I was told she would come back but never did. When I pressed the call button, it was answered 5 minutes later by a male steward who said ""what do you want""? He returned with my drink order which was wrong. During most of the flight, the stewardess would walk by so fast that if you said something to get their attention, they were already 4 rows behind you. Never once did I see one walking down the aisles looking at the passengers faces to see if they needed anything. The return flight also left over one hour late. The breakfast served included a sausage that I believe was bad. No cruise is worth the 8 hours I had to spend on each flight. I ended up bringing my own snacks and water to make sure I would have some on the return flight.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2016,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,PPT to LAX,2.0," |  I would recommend avoiding Air Tahiti Nui. Our outbound flight from the US was uneventful. The plane, however, was in poor shape, with threadbare carpet, outdated seatback entertainment (some flights don't even have screens), sagging seatback pockets and below average food and service. The flight was on-time, though, and we were headed to paradise, so we could overlook these minor issues, even though the flight cost, even for an economy ticket, was at a premium price point. On our return trip is where we ran into serious issues. There was a mechanical delay on our flight, which postponed our departure for 24 hours. We waited in line for 3 hours before we had the delay and rebooking information, however, and were told that there was no possibility of being moved to one of the three other PPT-LAX flights that Air Tahiti Nui had before our rescheduled flight left. They put us up in a nice hotel overnight, so we weren't too upset at spending another day in Papeete. We had booked all of our ongoing flights out of LAX on our own due to my wife and I parting ways after the trip and her complicated international travel. Upon getting to the hotel, I began the process of rebooking all of those flights, as we were given the new departure information the following night. After breakfast the following morning, we were feeling pretty good about everything, when I just happened to check the Air Tahiti Nui website to see if our flight was still on time. Nope, we were delayed another 9 hours, which then caused us to miss all of our rebooked connections from LAX. We did not receive any notification from the airline about this additional delay. At this point, Air Tahiti Nui really let us down. They did not rebook us on any of the other departing flights for LAX. They had no consideration for connecting flights. In order for my wife to make her destination in time, we had to reroute her on another Air Tahiti Nui flight to Tokyo-Narita. They would not apply any of the funds we used for the PPT-LAX flight, nor would they simply book her on that flight at no cost due to the mechanical issue. When we spoke to customer service, we had to find all of our own solutions due to their incompetence and lack of understanding. To top it all off, they were completely indifferent and unapologetic. To this day, almost one month later, we have not been engaged by their customer service department for reparations after repeated emails and phone calls. Based on our experience, I would recommend a few things: There are other carriers that fly to/from Tahiti (Air France, Hawaiian Air, etc). Look into them and see if they are an option for you. Take a vacation somewhere else. There are a lot of nice spots in the world, and while Tahiti is exotic and amazing, our poor air travel and all that followed totally clouded our experience. If you still decide to go, and to go with Air Tahiti Nui, try to book all of your air travel through them on one ticket. Or, if you are booking your own connections, be sure to have some flexibility on your US arrival (a day or two in LA on the back end).",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Firstly the customer service is terrible and they can't change seats on a near empty flight because they are ""not allowed to"". Once on the plane I realised how uncomfortable the seats were, hard and no leg room. The service is terrible as they barely speak english and don't seem to care about customers. They served drinks once on the flight and would not get a coke for me so they just gave the terrible orange juice that was served with breakfast. The food was horrible. Entertainment barely works and is outdated. The headphones they give you are terrible and you can't hear anything with them. No space for items so I say you put your items in the overhead because you can barely fit an iPhone into the seat back pocket.

However arrived in LAX and they had lost my luggage. Waited 3 hours at the baggage carousel because attendents were disorganized kept walking away and not returning and they had no counter (or system it seems) to handle lost baggage. I was told unclaimed bags were just thrown on the carousel for the next flight coming in and that I should wait around to see if my bags arrived on another flight. Took 5 days to receive my bags. Air Tahiti Nui baggage line never answered my calls went to an answering machine and I left several messages. I only received a call 3 days later saying they had found my bags and they would arrive at my door the next day - which they did not. Wasted 2 days waiting at home for bags that didn't arrive. Finally received my luggage and called to claim my $65 compensation. I couldn't get this either and was told conflicting advice about having to fax someone or having to wait until I got back to Auckland. I was also told that my 2 hour layover was not enough time for the airport in Tahiti to transfer bags to a new plane. Since I had the same layover on the way back I called reservations to see what could be done so I didn't have the same problem on the way back to Auckland - flight change pay for an upgrade mark my bags as priority (I would have been happy with any advice they could give). During this conversation I was talked at instead of listened to treated rudely and the end result was that I was told there was nothing they could do and I shouldn't be so negative. I was told I shouldn't call them anymore. Apparently one phone call is considered harassment. All in all very bad flight and awful service. Even if this flight is a bit cheaper I will gladly pay more and fly Qantas or Air NZ in future. Would not recommend this airline at all.,nan,1.0,nan

Hot brunch was not the best I've had on Air Tahiti Nui with meal overcooked/overheated.

This is not First Class Service I was used to with Air Tahiti Nui previously. The boarding process is nerve racking. I resent having to go boxed in the buses that transport you to the aircraft.

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LAX-PPT-AKL-LAX Economy return. The flight from LAX to PPT was cancelled. I was notified about two weeks before the flight was supposed to leave. I was a bit peeved as the flight from LAX was a connecting flight and the cancellation meant that I had to overnight in LA and take the next flight the following morning. I explained my situation to Air Tahiti Nui and they put me up in a hotel (Four Points by Sheraton)and gave me dinner and breakfast vouchers! The flights were all on time plane modern plenty of room for economy. I'm 5'11 and was comfortable for the entire trip. The inflight entertainment is not as modern as it could be its not on demand but the movie selection is good and there is a nice selection of recent releases. One note of caution try to avoid any stopovers in Tahiti that will be longer than two hours - the airport is old and boring and there is nothing to do while you wait not even a TV to watch. The food was superb for economy and inflight service by the attendants was friendly polite and professional. Topping all of this off is the fact they were $700-$1000USD cheaper than ANZ Qantas or United.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"AKL-LAX-AKL (via PPT) First Class. The service onboard is outstanding and pretty difficult to fault. The crew could not have been more professional or pleasant. Food AKL-PPT and PPT-LAX would have been at home in 5 star restaurant (less good on the return but still acceptable). Seats although first generation lie flat were comfortable and all features worked. There is no screen between passengers but I did not feel an invasion of personal space. Boarding on all legs was efficient and every leg left early . The negatives? Ground crew at all three airports. At the initial check in Auckland I did not get the aisle seat I had requested and had been confirmed with the airline 7 months earlier - and had to kick up quite a fuss - miraculously one opened up. The same thing happened PPT-LAX. On arrival at LAX no bags. They were off-loaded at PPT and could not be traced. They did turn up on the next flight: that isn't good enough on economy but it is completely unacceptable in First. The response of the LAX agents could not havee dismissive. Arriving back in Auckland bags (which had first and priority labels) were the last to appear (perhaps I should be grateful that they appeared at all!). So inflight this is a rival to any airline and competitively priced on the Transpacific route; it certainly would have been a ""10"".

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,The flight attendants told passengers those in-transit to Auckland need not complete the Tahitian immigration forms and we should proceed to the transit lounge. This is what we had expected and made sense. Once off the aircraft though those of us who entered the lane marked transit lounge and walked the short distance to the transit lounge found it locked. No one could tell us why it was locked how to enter the lounge or what to do. We asked the cabin crew as they came off the aircraft and they shrugged their shoulders and walked on. Eventually we realized the only option was to complete Tahitian immigration forms and go into the baggage claim area as it appeared we might be able to enter the transit lounge from there. This however proved not to be true. Again no one seemed to know what we should do even though we kept asking how to enter the transit lounge. I speak passable French so this was not a language problem. Eventually we picked up our luggage and cleared Customs. When we entered the airport terminal I found an Air Tahiti Nui staff and she told us that the transit lounge was not open and we would have to go to a hotel for the night. She seemed unconcerned and disinterested. I then found the security office but they couldn't tell me anything. I returned to the Air Tahiti Nui staff who told me that everyone knows that Tahiti won't let passengers use the transit lounge and we should have known it. We weren't about to spend over $100 to stay in a hotel room for a few hours so along with two dozen other passengers we spent the time in the hot dirty smoky airport terminal. The ATN check-in desks finally opened at about 4-30 a.m. and we were able to get our boarding passes but as Security didn't open for another hour or so we were still forced to wait in the terminal. Once allowed into the departure lounge we found that it was shabby dirty and unpleasant. A small coffee bar sold food but didn't accept credit cards and we weren't about to go back out through Security to find an ATM to get cash in a currency we didn?t need just to buy a cup of coffee. You may wonder why we didn't just go directly to the departure lounge and wait there. Well the ATN staff in LAX refused to give us the boarding passes from Papeete to Auckland. They said that they issue boarding passes no more than three hours in advance. When we arrived in Papeete the check-in counters were closed. Thus we couldn't get boarding passes and couldn't get into the departure area. Three weeks later when departing Auckland I asked an ATN supervisor why they don't let transit passengers use the transit lounge. She said that in their view a layover of that length does not constitute in-transit and that they are unwilling to allow people to use the transit lounge. As ridiculous as this is the worst part is that they don't bother to warn you about it before you travel so you can take this into account when making your travel plans. Upon arrival back in Papeete with only an hour layover we again found the transit lounge locked even though flight attendants assured us we would be allowed to wait in the transit lounge. Instead they simply diverted transit passengers directly into the departure lounge even though most hadn't been issued a boarding pass in Auckland (we had one but only because I went back to the check-in counter and insisted upon it). Obviously they could have done exactly the same thing on the Papeete- Auckland overnight layover had they wanted to do so. I suspect the whole thing is a means of trying to force passengers to spend some money in Tahiti. Whatever the reason it is a shabby way to treat passengers.,nan,nan,nan

Pretty cramped leg room. Once on the French Polynesian islands I was not able to change my return flight to Auckland with my standard Y fare which I don't understand. Overall the booking system and ground service are a bit outdated (still need to reconfirm flights) but in the aircraft you will have a small Tiare flower behind your ear and a smile on your face because this is an airline that flies to a very exotic location.,nan,4.0,nan

The entertainment controls on the armrest are worn-out yet still functional. Adjustment of seats: they lack sufficient recline. Controls are placed at hip level inside the chair so poorly accessible. Putting 2 pillows under your feet to raise them makes it better but raising the feet with a pillow will put your toes up against the back of the reclined seat in front of you. I deliberately chose a middle section seat this allows you to always exit without climbing over or being climbed over. The seat rows are that close together that undisturbed passing is impossible. The lumber supports do not work on this flight. Flight entertainment system is Archaic. You don't have the option of starting your movie on demand. The quality of the LCD screen is best described as a snowy CRT up close. The movies continue during PA announcements and since all are continuously playing there is no chance of rewinding. There are no air vents above the seat only general air conditioning. No power output in business class. This is consistent with the age of the seats. Sufficiently equipped courtesy pouch with toothbrush and paste eye covers ear plugs and socks. Headphones supplied are comfortable for the first couple of hours. There was simply no noise cancellation. Service is attentive and correct although the personal touch was missing the second flight. Timely serving and offering of drinks.,nan,2.0,nan

Several uniform changes during the 8.5 hour flight. Our flight left LAX on time. As previously noted - business class seats do not fully recline and when you do recline - it protrudes in to the space of the person sitting behind you. Not the best lay out - but certainly adequate.

Boarding went well as our seats were in Row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at LAX. Once again pleasant and efficient crew. In summary our flights were good the only warning I would make is that in Economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all.,nan,3.0,nan

They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast.

With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over.

We just made the flight otherwise would have spent the night in LA. Although our bags didn't make it they were delivered the next day to our hotel.

The A349 was impeccable. We were in coach but the seats were roomy the flight staff was extremely friendly and we had brand new inflight entertainment systems (I think the entire cabin had recently been redone). The experience got our first trip to French Polynesia off to a great start. Yeah it's still tough to sleep in coach seats but the great experience made it bearable.

There was no apology from the airline. The return flight was four hours delayed and the waiting time in Papeete airport was hell. We had to pay for very expensive airport food. WIFI connection did not work and informing relatives about late arrival was impossible. There was little to no information on the reason and what the measures would be and no help from the ground staff. It almost appeared like a cover up. We missed our connecting flights and had later been booked to other flights.

Leg room seemed adequate for economy however as others have said previously the seat designer should be sacked! The head rest is not ergonomic at all and causes discomfort. The is also no lumbar support. I packed the seat back out with pillows to help. The crew were young friendly and worked the cabin non stop. Food on all flights was edible if not slightly odd - the seat designer must have had input in the menu as well.

This aircraft was also retrofitted with the new interior however it felt older. tired and there was a noticeable decrease in leg room despite us being in the same seat number on both flights.

A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea.

What the TV screen tells one what will be served was not even close to it and was not edible. Also if you hold an American Airlines loyalty card the only way you will get mileage credit is to book this codeshare flight through American Airlines as Air Tahiti will not post the miles to your American account.

nan,Business Class,5.0,January 2016,5.0,3.0,nan,yes,LAX to PPT,4.0,Los Angeles to Papeete with Air Tahiti Nui. The plane was clean and very comfortable. I agree with a previous reviewer that when extended the seats were somewhat awkward to sleep. But I managed. The dinner they served at midnight was perfect as it was a cold chicken salad and light. The rolls were warm which was very nice. By this time all seemed ready to quickly eat and then sleep. Cabin attendants could not have been nicer trying to make us more comfortable. We fly home in two weeks and will see if we are still so happy with the plane and service but at this point would very much recommend.,Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A340-300,Business Class,4.0,December 2015,4.0,4.0,nan,yes,PPT to LAX,4.0,"The A340 was Nuku Hiva, the youngest of the Air Tahiti Nui fleet from 2005. Left at 11:30pm, the last flight out of Tahiti in 2015. The cabin crew had made the effort to dress up and decorate the aircraft to celebrate New Year which was approximately half an hour after take-off. Served champagne before take off and after the pilot announced New Year; nice touch. The seats are comfortable and have a foot rest, but, found that the angle when extended for sleep (ever hopeful) was a wee bit awkward to find a good position - not a huge problem though and I am a bit short. There is a lot of leg room which makes it easy when seats are upright to move about. As we needed to try to sleep, we did not use the inflight entertainment. The cabin was fresh and clean, slightly better than our outward aircraft on 16 December, although that one was fine too (Moorea). These were both night flights and therefore we didn't have much contact with the cabin crew, but they were pleasant, polite and efficient although perhaps not quite so at ease with passengers as we have found on bigger international airlines. The breakfasts on both flights offered hot food and continental. It was very acceptable and included fruit and yoghurt. No complaints, the airline did its job and we were comfortable.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,December 2015,nan,1.0,nan,no,LAX to AKL via PPT,nan,"Los Angeles to Auckland via Papeete. On Dec 21 noticed that Air Tahiti Nui published possible strike action by Pilots. On reading this I called Air Tahiti and was assured our flight would not be affected and we should go to checkin at LAX on Dec 22 with a scheduled departure at 11:30pm. The customer service rep then  asked if I wanted to cancel. I should have taken the opportunity. On arriving (Myself, wife plus 2 infants) we were informed the flight was cancelled and we were rescheduled onto Air New Zealand. There were 7 to 8 check in staff all congregating and joking among themselves. We were told there was an issue and we'd be scheduled onto another airline. 1 hour later we were told that we were booked on American Airlines via Sydney but had to run to another Terminal in order to make the flight. We did that, arrived at the American Airlines counter who told us that we needed a transit visa for Sydney and Air Tahiti should have known this. Also told us there were no seats and we had missed the flight. We ran back to the Air Tahiti counter in the previous terminal. Again staff just joking around, had no knowledge of transit visas. Spent next 30 minutes trying to get us on another airline. Qantas this time. We ran to that counter with one helpful staff member, checked in and Qantas sorted our visas. Stroller was lost in transit. Flight they placed us on meant a 9 hour wait in Sydney before our final journey to NZ. On check-in we were charged for our on lap infant but told that Air Tahiti would reimburse. On calling Air Tahiti I was basicially told to go away. Worst customer service in 30 years of flying.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,September 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Lax to Paris,3.0,"I was concerned about this airline after reading many terrible reviews. My Air Tahiti Nui experience was the opposite and crew was friendly and very helpful. The leg room was better than most for economy. The food was ok. On each seat a blanket and pillow, plus a bag with socks, eye mask, ear plugs, ear phones which was a nice touch. They provided 2 meals and also offered food in the galley (sandwiches, drinks, soup and ice cream) nice selection of movies to watch also. ",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
A340,Economy Class,2.0,October 2015,2.0,2.0,2.0,no,Los Angeles to Auckland via PPT,2.0,"Budget is a word that comes to mind for Air Tahiti Nui. The ""Bora Bora"" A340 plane is in need of an update asap. On board entertainment unit was small and quite a few were very fuzzy. Choice is okay but not like bigger players provide and the interface unit is via Wii style hand held unit. It is not an on demand service so when the movies start you need to be read.y Because of this it takes some of the gloss flying with them. Take a tablet, Mac, Laptop when flying Air Tahiti Nui to avoid disappointment. Also have a device that can last 9 hours as there are no charging ports. The other plane we flew in their fleet had a larger tablet screen and usb port for charging. The crew did what they needed to do but nothing more, unless you buzzed them or fly business class. Seat comfort in economy was more domestic than international quality and at 3 hour mark it becomes noticeable. The armrests don't fold right up out of the way either. Food - fussy eaters and kids take snacks as meals make par but that's it, and bread rolls need a chainsaw to cut them open.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan
A340,Economy Class,1.0,September 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Los Angeles to Papeete,1.0,"Air Tahiti Nui is the worst airline I have flown, starting from the reservation process. The Air Tahiti Nui website is the most outdated and the customer unfriendly of any airline. My credit card was charged twice for the same transaction. The reservation agents are the most condescending I have ever experienced. They are unwilling to do their jobs and try to get you to acquiesce to their attitude rather than follow industry standard customer service. Onboard experience was just as bad. The hardware showed neglected maintenance plus obvious signs of wear and tear with dirty seat cover and tray table. The flight attendants were subpar in their service. I would never fly this airline again.",Business,1.0,nan

Inflight customer service in business class was horrible. The cabin staff looking after us was unprofessional and rude. She didn't offer us any drink unless she needed to. Wasn't friendly. Staff generally were rude and not very welcoming. Food was very poor quality and we were wondering how bad it must be in economy. Overall it wasn't a good experience. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,September 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,Paris to Auckland via Los Angeles,2.0,"Just arrived off an awful Air Tahiti Nui plane from Los Angeles to Auckland via Tahiti. The main issue was that the inflight entertainment is outdated - it is draconian. If you must fly Air Tahiti Nui, try and avoid the ""Borabora"" plane - unless you don't wish to watch a movie or play a game. The other planes are better, but they have poor seats that force your head forward. Very awkward. Every flight also boarded late. Not good enough.  My worst international flight.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan
