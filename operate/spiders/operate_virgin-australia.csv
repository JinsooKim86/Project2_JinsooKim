My bag is brought to the airport at 12.40 by Taxi drivers wife After lodging a complaint with Virgin upon returning to Sydney all they have to say is that shit happens and they will pass on complaint to Darwin!

I was about to start my semester abroad in Brisbane (I am from Europe) and had my final flight with VA from Sydney to Brisbane, and the one hour flight was already delayed 30 minutes, when we arrived, 75% of the luggage did not. We immediately contacted the Baggage Service and gave our details in order for them to bring the luggage to the accommodation. They said it will not take longer than one day - fine. However, my luggage has not arrived the second day - I tried to call the baggage service hotline multiple times, but no one ever picks up the phone. I left a message, I sent two emails and one complaint, no one answers. I called the Customer Service Hotline - had an hour call and got told to call the baggage service and write a complaint (which I already did)... they do not work together internally or where able to check any information, which is a joke as such a big company! As I just arrived in this country and do not own anything besides my carry on, I had to buy clothes and everything I need for the everyday life which is pretty expensive in Australia. After four days, suddenly my bags arrived at the door, but there was no apology besides a ridiculous paper tag 'SORRY'. Ever since, they have not replied to my emails, not called back or done anything. Its been 13 days by now - I sent them another complaint with my expenses and receipts - no sign of any customer service at all. I am more than upset, disappointed and annoyed - its not my fault, that my baggage is lost, I had ridiculous expenses (as a student especially hard to deal with) and I have spent so much time on trying to get in contact with this poorly managed airline.

We were finally pulled through the crowd to check in 5 people to be told we were 7 kilos overweight on 2 bags. Move things around, as we went to try, we were told quite rudely to pay $250 or lose our flights as we were out of time. I paid the money and hurried through the airport as our plane was boarding, this delay was not our fault. It was freezing on the plane and I asked to buy the blanket packages for the 5 of us to get told sorry sold out. And we are not turning the air down. Really cramped and uncomfortable flight due to cold. We landed in Sydney to a show of the baggage staff throwing our bags from the plane to the trolleys and quite hard.  This airline has the most disgusting Customer service experienced in my life. We fly every 6-8 months and will never fly virgin again even in an emergency. Stay well away from this airline.

The onward flight was more than 1 hour delay and the return flight was 3.5 hours delay. Flightstat has showed more than 1/3 of extreme long delay on both sectors. It is a shocking statistics and is the worse for direct flight of the sector. The food is of a budget airline standard and the entertainment option is limited compared with the other airline of the same route. Cabin service is quite good and I do understand the pressure they have to take to handle constant long delay flight. The fare is in the cheapest for direct flight normally about $200-$300 cheaper for direct flight.  If you are a budget traveller and have plenty of time this flight can be a good option. If timing is a vital part of your journey, it is better to avoid the flight at all cost. Unfortunately, I am the latter one even I have put in 2 hours as a safeguard. There is one thing I don't understand, The flights for this sector is either on-time of seriously delay but not in the middle - small delay.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

The staff from check-in at LAX all the way to the domestic flight were with one or two exceptions distant and unfriendly. Smiles were few and far between and they seemed to do the absolute minimum required. Annoyingly they are chatty and bubbly when talking among themselves but that disposition is not wasted on customers. Aside from that the legroom is fantastic the best I've had on a long- haul flight. Food was pretty mediocre (a salad without dressing cold bun bland chicken) and there were almost no water or juice runs through the cabin (on a 13-hour flight!). Inflight entertainment was also sub-standard compared to Delta and Qantas. The domestic flight was uneventful and on-time.,nan,3.0,nan

Check in and boarding went quite smoothly but one we got onto the plane we realised that the three of us traveling had to sit in different seats. I had to sit at the back of the plane while the rest of my family were right at the front. The seats were also a bit cramped. But other than that the aircraft was new and very clean the crew were very friendly and promptly brought anything that you requested. They even asked me if I needed water halfway through the flight.

The biggest drawback is that there are only two toilets at the rear of the aircraft and there seemed to be a permanent queue of people waiting to use them which must have been annoying for anyone seated at the rear of the plane.

The food was very good ex SYD however on the return journey ex LAX it was not so enjoyable. I have travelled this route before many times in the past with Qantas but felt that the service on VA was superior in every way and so much more personalised.

As a result and $70 later to have a 2kg fishing rod deemed a ""piece"" of extra luggage left me flabbergasted.

nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,Flow DPS to MEL in Business considering the price paid I would like to say that this was a very uncomfortable flight. The seats only recline a bit this might be ok for short flights but for flights 6 hours plus it becomes quite uncomfortable hard to sleep they also wake you up about one hour before landing. The breakfast is cereal coffee and juice. The service is acceptable but on a night flight you just want to sleep. Conclusion is the price charged is far to high for the features and benefits you are getting. Tip pay a lot less and fly another airline on A330 in a flatbed. That will be my choice the next time.

Adding to the delay was the fact some of the self check in terminals were out of order and there was a gap in staffing due to what appeared to be a shift rotation with ground staff who were running late. Plane was messy with biscuit crumbs greeting me on my entire row of seats. I had a window seat but it seemed very tight particularly where my leg was closest to the wall and likewise the seating pitch was a lot narrower than a smaller A320 from Jetstar.

Boarding was well managed and timely food was fairly good staff were friendly and attentive. The seats were comfortable and the entertainment was great. On the return leg the flight wasn't very full and the cabin crew encouraged people to spread out and find a row for themselves once airborne (we had to stay in our allocated seats for take off due to weight distribution). Long haul is what you make of it and I figured I had 14 hours to relax watch movies read books have a few wines and a snooze. Something most of us cannot find time for in real life.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,4.0,Flew Sydney-Brisbane on a busy Sunday. On my occasional previous flights with Virgin I'd noticed that they're inferior to Qantas in every way but not by much. Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times). Given the price difference is usually small I'll avoid Virgin at peak times.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Business Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,2.0,VA160 Brisbane to Auckland. I was keen to try out Virgin's new trans-Tasman business class experience but it was a truly underwhelming experience. It starts with check-in where the VA staff member couldn't find me on the flight as she was typing my surname incorrectly. Much anxiety later I make it to the Air NZ lounge which is far inferior to the QF lounge at BNE International and far inferior to what you would expect for a leading airline's lounge at a key international experience. Not VA's fault. Boarding was not polished. An announcement was made that boarding would commence in the next 10-15 minutes however the incoming aircraft hadn't even arrived! Premium boarding didn't really work either as the economy queue was served at the same time and moved faster than the Premium queue. Not a huge problem but normally premium customers are given the opportunity to board before normal boarding commences. On board is where VA are really let down. No champagne prior to departure - in fact VA do not offer champagne at all on trans-Tasman flights! Only white and red wine which is a real shame. CSM was polite and sweet - but there was no wow factor. She wasn't aware of what cheeses were being offered nor which fruits were on the fruit plate. Offered me Crown lager which was actually a Crown Pale Ale and she didn't know the difference. Didn't know whether the Peroni was a light or heavy beer. Hence asked for a Bloody Mary which is my fall back flying drink and VA do not have Bloody Mary mix or spices. These are really small things but not what you expect in international business class. The meal was served on a tray all together - no place mat nor hot towels were offered.. The main course was only just hot so didn't allow time to have salad first and then dessert was served in a box! The IFE is good. I used the Samsung tablet provided although an announcement was made to say that VA hadn't loaded them in economy for the full fare passengers. I wouldn't want to travel on a VA 737 on a long sector - I really missed having a foot rest or extendable section of the chair to support your lower legs. My message to passengers would be to save your money and points and fly economy across the Tasman. The VA experience is nothing more than a Domestic Business service if that and below that of competitors flying the same route often for cheaper.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,I'm a VA Gold FF and recently booked a return flight with virgin Australia from Port Hedland to Bali for mid Feb. 2 weeks before we were due to fly out I noticed a comment regarding changes to the Bali flights on a local social media page. People were informing other passengers that were booked the twice weekly VOA flight from PHE-DEN that the schedule had changed. I then logged on to my FF page to see that VA had automatically put me on a flight out 3 hours prior to originally booked and a return flight back to Port Hedland 25 hours earlier than what was originally booked. I had no phone calls or emails to inform me of the change and had subsequently already booked accommodation for these nights in Bali. I called their customer service on the Monday and was told that they decided to cull one of the weekly return flights from PHE-DEN that its their discretion to make schedule changes when they please. They coldly informed me that my only other option aside from flying out 25 hours early was offer me a different return flight on the original day I was booked to return to Oz however that return flight would take 19 hours and 3 different stops to come back to Hedland instead of 2 hours direct.

No ownership of the problem by VA even though whole trip purchased through VA. No attempt to hold the flight for 10 or 12 pax who were 15-30 minutes late no access to luggage and no help with accommodation for the 24 hour wait until the next flight. This all in the middle of the night. VA ground staff literally said that it wasn't their problem and that we needed to talk to Delta. 3 trips back and forth between terminals in the middle of the night and finally found out that VA had our bags (but couldn't give them to us because the guy with the key had gone home until 4pm the next day) and Delta gave us a hotel voucher good until mid-day the next day. I extended the hotel at my own expense so that I wasn't sitting at the airport for another 8 hours in dirty clothes bought myself some food and paid for an internet connection to contact home and make arrangements for someone to look after my kids. VA made no attempt to help and coldly refused to help when asked. I've travelled extensively over many years and delays happen. But I've never seen an airline treat its customers with such contempt and disinterest. They turned a minor annoyance into an ordeal through poor ground crew and poorer linkages with codeshare partners. Aside from that the lounge at LAX (Star Alliance) is excellent the flight crew are friendly and attentive and the onboard food and beverage is good.

At first they said it will only take 15 minutes to fix about 1400 hours we were still at the airport at 1420 hours we finally boarded the aircraft then we had to wait another 20 minutes because they realised the aircraft needed refuelling. Because of all that I missed my connecting flight to Hobart which was the only flight left of the day so no one knew if I had to stay overnight in Sydney until I arrive there so they found a flight to Hobart via Melbourne.

Nice apple muffin served and water, juice tea or coffee offered and due to Platinum status seating in row 3 a bonus. The other thing about VA is their turn-around time which is pretty quick. Often seated at Departure gate and watch passengers disembarking and in what seems no time at all you are being boarded for your flight. Staff are always friendly and helpful.

Pros: The staff were generally friendly. The planes appeared to be fairly new and comfortable. Negatives: There is no inflight entertainment. I do not have an Ipod so I could not linkup to the planes internal computer system, which is what you have to do. No food of any description was provided. Coffee, tea and water was the only thing - not good enough for a 6 hour flight. Food was available for sale. Only one type of sandwich which had nuts, a vegetarian wrap, a meat pie - basically inedible - $10. Juice/cold drinks - I can't remember how much as I didn't buy one due to the outrageous prices. What topped the whole experience off was us having to pay an extra $150 at Samoa airport to get each of our surf boards back. When we left Sydney Virgin accepted our luggage as per our agreement/ticket. That being 1 x carry on luggage, 1 x bag and 1 x sporting equipment. In our case the sporting equipment were surfboards. We were on a surf holiday so I suppose it only makes sense to have surf boards. On our return when we booked in at Samoa airport we were told we had to pay approximately $150 extra to get each board back. We challenged that and was told there had been a change in procedure.

The VA ground staff were friendly and very professional tending to our needs and looking after us thoroughly in ensuring that all passengers arrived safely at the replacement gate prior to boarding. The actual MEL-SYD flight was smooth and enjoyable and even though it was a late night flight the FAs offered us complimentary beer and wine to compensate for the delay. VA866 also used a recently-repainted B738 which was very well maintained - the flight departed SYD on time and arrived in MEL early.

The only room for improvement I can say for Virgin Australia would be to become a fully serviced airline. Upon saying that I can't but give them enough praise. I would recommend flying with Virgin Australia and will fly with them again. I can say I am definitely a Virgin Australia convert.,nan,4.0,nan

Entertainment is available by downloading the Virgin Airline app and using your own devise. My only criticism is that the seats are very very cramped and it is rather claustrophobic.

Initially we were to fly via Sydney and arrive in Townsville early enough to catch a daytime ferry to Magnetic Island. Virgin Australia changed our itinerary early this year to go via Brisbane and arrive at similar time in Townsville. When we arrived at Auckland airport at 4.30am on 2 May our intended 6.30am flight from Auckland to Brisbane had been cancelled. We were put on an Air NZ flight that departed at approx. 8.30 am that would not reach Brisbane in time to connect with our flight to Townsville. We then waited for 5 hours at Brisbane for the next flight to Townsville. On that flight the seats were too small and the person in front of me reclined their seat making it a most uncomfortable experience. We arrived in Townsville at night. Our flight was the last one into Townsville that night and the ground staff were not there to allow rear exit from the plane. We were stuffed right down the back and by the time we finally got to the baggage claim there was no sign of our single bag. We checked all remaining bags on the conveyor and even consulted the baggage handler who ensured us that all the bags had been placed on the conveyor. We had to get on the shuttle bus to the Magnetic Island Ferry. The reception at our accommodation closed at 5.00pm. If all had gone to plane we would have been there at 3.30pm in daylight. We got to Magnetic Island in the dark at 9.45pm with no suitcase. The next morning we caught the ferry back to Townsville then a taxi to and from the airport and then the ferry back to Magnetic Island - a very expensive and time consuming exercise.,nan,1.0,nan

The flight seemed to take quite a while to load passengers, it was certainly after the boarding time scheduled, but they made up time with a quick taxi/reduced flight time. Apparently the Australian government requires a second bag check within the departure lounge for liquids etc, which slows the entire process down and looks quite inefficient. Announcements from captain and air crew ok, however no menu handed out so another member of cabin staff struggled through menu with many mispronounced words, seemed unprofessional. Food otherwise ok, I was expecting a little more, particularly after recent Emirates and Qantas flights. Overall, I had the impression that this product is from yesteryear, nothing has really changed since they bought these planes back in 2009, as V Australia. IFE seems slow and outdated, cabin cleanliness was ok. Service was fun and cheerful. Compared to a Virgin A330 I took Perth to Sydney in 2014, this service felt like a regular domestic flight.

The first leg from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was operated by Virgin Australia. I have flown overseas multiple times with other airlines, a couple of times to Germany too. All of them gave me the option to increase my baggage limit by paying extra before the flight (you get charged a lot more per kg on the day at the airport otherwise). Virgin Australia tells me that I do not have the option to do that. Even budget airlines gave me the option increase baggage limit up to 50kg. In the light of Virgin's rather positive reputation, I think this is highly unsatisfactory and they certainly do not live up to their reputation. (For goodness sake, I was even willing to pay extra to increase the limit; I was not asking for a freebie. They are hopeless.) I was also disgusted by Virgin and AirBerlin trying to ""pass the ball"" between themselves for an eternity, not taking any responsibility or care. It is just poor customer service, poor work ethics.

I dont think the bathrooms got a clean throughout the flight and the impact on cleanliness was severe.

When I arrived at the airport in Sydney yet more flights (to Melbourne) were cancelled and my own flight disappeared from the departure board! There was no explanation for this or for the cancelations during the day. Or rather, talking to many frustrated passengers, it seems that Virgin had given no fewer than 5 different explanations ranging from 'bad weather' (not true as we checked most of the Australian cities), mechanical problems, change of equipment (but again no explanation provided), 'just don't know' (statement made by reservation staff to several passengers) and so on. We understand that problems occur at all airlines from time to time but the real test of a good airlines is its commitment to keep customers informed and on a regular basis, whenever problems arise. On this occasion, Virgin's performance was abysmally poor. My flight eventually left Sydney 45 minutes late.

The cabin on both flights was unbearably hot with no ability to control your own air vents so expect a warm and sweaty flight. The staff are very friendly but not at all attentive and disappear for most of the flight leaving passengers to ""self serve"" chips and water from the snack bar. This is fine if you are in an aisle seat but useless for anyone else unless you want to keep waking up the passengers seated next to you. The cost cutting is most apparent in the food. I am pretty forgiving of airline food generally but Virgin Australia long haul is not generous with food and drink service and when meals are served they consist of mismatched menu items (like a chicken salad starter for a beef main) and other oddities like a dry microwaved omelette in a sealed cardboard box that simply cannot be described as edible or even as food. Not only that but on the SYD-LAX leg the dry omelette was served twice! Hungry is the word I would most associate with these flights.

One problem was the wifi, which, despite getting the password from reception, I couldn't get to work on either of my devices. At the gate, priority boarding had me stuck in a queue for 5 mins, before I could get to my seat (1d). Plenty of leg room, comfortable, older-style leather seat. No drink before take-off. Cabin crew very friendly. The supervisor was looking after business class, and did a very good job. Drinks, including a choice of wine and beers were served. There was no choice of meal (a very short flight and only 8 business class passengers), and it was asian prawn noodle salad or just economy-style snacks. The salad was tasty, but a nightmare to try and eat without getting it all over myself! Shredded salad and soft noodles do tend to fall all over the place! My wine was a very pleasant tempranillo blend and it hit the spot from my point of view. Entertainment is basically bring your own or make sure you've downloaded their app before you get on board, because you can't download it when you're on the plane. No other entertainment provided. Being at the front did give me priority deplaning on arrival. Was it all worth the extra AUD 170? Yes, but could do better.

All United flights on this route allowed us each one free check-in baggage. That seemed to be the norm as did the size and weight of an acceptable carry on, except with Virgin Australia. They charged us $87USD to check in one bag and sent us back to repack our carry on items since their acceptable weight was a lot lower than the other airlines. We had to awake at 2am to make a 6am flight and were told agents would arrive three hours earlier and we needed to be there to get seat assignments. We arrived a half hour early but the first agent started a half hour late and other agents arrived about an hour after that. The seat we were assigned was awfully small and at the last row of the plane where a constant line of people awaited toilet use.

We had just arrived in Melbourne after a lengthy trans-Pacific flight on United. Our flight was late in arriving due to a cyclone which caused us to vary our route in order to fly around it. We arrived about 1 hour and 20 minutes before our departing flight - a short domestic flight to Hobart, Tasmania. We arrived at Virgin check-in exactly 1/2 hour before our flight departed. The area was very crowded and there was no one other than the staff at the desks. We tried to check in at the kiosk but it said we were too late and to find a representative. When I finally found one, it was 25 minutes to flight time. She said she thought we'd be ok but our bags might have to come later and she started leading us toward a desk. When she asked what flight we arrived on and I answered United, everything changed. United is not a partner with Virgin and we were now out of luck. She sent us to another desk where we were told our fares were forfeited and we would have to buy new tickets which they would sell us for $1,200. After a lot of pleading and searching, we were put on a late flight (it was morning when we arrived so our entire day was lost) at a reduced cost of only $700! We were completely left out in the cold (due to circumstances beyond our control). That has never happened to me on a US airline, even when I've been at fault and I've seen American provide a Delta ticket and United provide a competitor's ticket. I wrote Virgin and they sent me what basically amounts to a ""standard"" letter about bookings which are not made together. The way I see it there are probably rules and reasons that permit airlines to do things that would disappoint almost every passenger on the plane. But, good airlines don't do those kinds of things and they do not adhere to the rule book when a customer is not at fault. It's bad business and an indicator of the value they place on you, the flier. For that reason, I would avoid them at all costs. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

nan,Economy Class,5.0,April 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,MEL to ADL,4.0," |  Melbourne to Adelaide. I had a previous bad experience with Virgin Australia and it still continues. I made a purchase of two tickets, one ticket had an additional bag so the assumption is 69 kilos accross three bags. Last time I travelled with Virgin Australia I had to transfer weight from a 4th bag into three bags, there was no mention of weight allowances. I assumed 69kg meant 69kg. This customer service agent said that max weight per bag is 23 kilos no matter what. We were 4 kilos over on two bags, but in total we were well and truly under 69kg. They wanted to charge me $140 which was a joke. I asked for a manager, it would be 15 minutes as their manager was in a meeting. There was basically no supervisor on the floor, the one who was assisting with another complaint is not normally a supervisor. I was carrying an injury so the more I was standing the more my foot was in agony, the customer service agent was still firm stating that all baggage must be under 23kg or I would have to pay additional fees regardless of what happened in Adelaide. We managed to repack and change check in bags and transfer weight to be under 23kg on each bag. The customer service agent proceeded to tell me that they will allow my bags onboard on this occasion as it was not a full flight. I had a backpack which basically has my laptop, and I had a shoulder bag. Rules state that a laptop and laptop bag is not included as carry on, except agents tried to tell me my bag was a back pack and not a laptop bag. I showed them the laptop and the compartment, she still said there is stuff in there besides the laptop. I asked what is the policy, she said the bag is not necessarily a carry on, but it could be a carry on so no exact answer. Seems it depends on the mood of the agent, or if they have revenue targets to reach by charging additional baggage. Personally this is one time too many now, if I have international travel I would never ever travel Virgin Australia again. Domestic is not an issue because generally you are flying the one flight so you can handle 23kg easy. International flights have different allowances and always rounded to the last 10 digit, whereas Virgin is rounded to 3. I feel sorry for the flight crew because their customer service is top notch, ground staff are the only ones who stuffed this up. Also the combination of International check in and Domestic check in makes it confusing also which line to line up on.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

We thought oh well things happen and so forth, however this year Virgin Australia is doing the same thing. They not only changed our flight, they changed the flight route! When we inquired about it they stated the operational reasons. What a nonsense! How is possible for any organisation to know in June that they will have 'operational reasons', that will forced them to change flight, in December? It is obviously a commercial reason of not having enough passengers for the direct flight to Melbourne. How come that they only have those ""operational reasons"" an a week day but hardly ever on Saturdays and Sundays?  The international flight, that is more expensive to run and that we paid for, finishes now in Brisbane and the passengers need to go collect their luggage, go through customs, take a bus, queue up to be checked into a domestic flight, that is subsequently also cheaper to run.

Thankfully my family member travels a lot more than I do for work so he invited me to join him at the Lounge. It made the trip a lot more pleasant. The aircraft itself was a 10 year old B737-800 that appeared to be in fair condition. I sat in row 3 where there is sufficient legroom for a tall bloke like me, which was comfortable. The seats a little skinny but cannot fault the legroom. It was a nice smooth unremarkable flight where the cabin crew were friendly and hospitable and offered me a coffee and a muesli bar. We had already filled up on pancakes in the lounge. IFE worked great on my tablet without lag and had excellent map of flight. Really enjoyed watching that.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

Ticketing for this airport should inform customer prior to ticket purchase that they will not be able to access business class lounge,  as the airport does not open at all until 2 hours before flights.

On the plane, staff were standoffish and appeared disinterested. Cabin staff used to be the highlight of flying Virgin for me. One male flight attendant made a habit of thumping my shoulder any time he had a question to ask me. Food was an absolute joke. Likening it to fast food would be rich.

I booked a points redemption to visit my family in Perth. The flight over was delayed twice after I arrived at the airport (announcement said it was due to cascading delays much earlier that day but with no pre-advice before going to the airport). Then the flight was cancelled. I waited at Kingsford Smith airport almost 7 hrs. My daughter in-law died unexpectedly the next day and her funeral was set for the day I was to return to Sydney. I called Virgin (waiting 30 mins to speak to a person) and I was told their were no seats available on flights late that day or on the next day. I explained the situation and also mentioned the delay coming over but they were unaccommodating. I looked on line and Virgin were selling economy class seats on later flights for that day. I called back with another long wait to speak to a person but again was told they could do nothing. They told me that they had cancelled my return flight. I had not explicitly asked them to do this but I had said that I would have to try Qantas or Jetstar when they said they could not change my flight. The call centre staff I spoke to had good English but they were English as a second language speakers and that could be why they interpreted my comment as a cancellation but even so that was another point of extremely poor customer service. I will not fly Virgin again. I booked my flight home with Qantas even though Virgin had seats available.,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

After a bad experience with Qantas (treated myself by booking a Business Class flat bed, got an old ex-Jetstar seat and no warning, apology or compensation), I chose Virgin on a recent trip to Melbourne. Ground staff were fine, I was a little surprised not to be asked for ID on either flight though. Cabin crew were friendly and professional. Cabin interior was acceptable, but could have been cleaner. Seats have the same pitch as Qantas, but somehow feel more like Jetstar (black leather included). Apparently they're going to be flying to Abu Dhabi in these aircraft, I hope they have a refit because while the seats are OK for 4 hours, I wouldn't like to spend 11 hours in them. IFE works well - can be used from gate to gate, and there's a much wider range of programs than are listed in the magazine. There was enough choice to sustain interest, but it definitely feels like it's not the A-list. Supplied headphones were awful, they sell ""premium"" earphones in the food menu, but I just used my own (bring a 2-pin adapter). I didn't notice any under-seat metal boxes housing the IFE equipment, that's definitely a positive. On flights to and from Perth they provide a hot meal. You can't choose ahead of time, but kudos for providing a vegetarian option. Sadly though it's not very good, a small box of pasta with not enough sauce and a tiny tub of (admittedly tasty) mousse. I used to lament the decline in Qantas's meal offering, but this is several steps down. At least the Grant Burge wine was good. Both flights arrived pretty much on time, ex-Melbourne it took a long time to leave the gate and get airborne. My verdict on Economy class: staff are good, the rest of the product could be better.

A330,Economy Class,2.0,November 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,PER to MEL,1.0," |  It is crystal clear from my experience flying Perth to Melbourne with Virgin Australia, that this is an airline in full cost cutting mode, and is now just nothing more than Tigerair with lipstick on. Myself and a friend had booked and paid for extra legroom tickets for our journey over 5 months in advance. At 2am before and early morning flight I received a text message which barely made any sense to state that I was no longer booked on the flight and re-booked to a later flight that will travel via Sydney. The only explanation for this was “engineering troubles” meant the plane for the route was downgraded to a 737. Anyone with basic knowledge of the industry knows this is just a standard ploy by airlines to cut costs. If the larger plane is not booked to capacity, bring in a smaller plane in its place and boot the remainder of booked passengers off the flight. This saves overheads and fuel, especially for cross-country flights such as this. Of course customer service staff didn’t seem fussed that we were put out in total travel time by 5 hours and had lost our extra legroom seats. Not only could we not get refunded for these seats at the time, myself and my friend were not even seated together for the flights from Perth to Sydney and Sydney to Melbourne. And of course it is incumbent upon the passenger to call up customer service and be placed on hold for long periods if you wish to even get a partial refund for what the airline blatantly failed to provide you with. Then the kicker on the flight back for any early Monday morning departure was this. We attempted to perform an online check-in on the morning of our flight but were not allowed to do so due to having an outstanding payment that I owed on the fare. This was not the case at all and in fact I was owed a refund at the time! There was traffic chaos that morning on the way to Tullamarine and we only arrived at the terminal 35 minutes prior to departure. We were immediately told the flight was closed and herded to a massive “customer service” queue that was staffed by one person and not moving at all. Seemed obvious Virgin’s intention is to do everything in their power to prevent paying passengers from boarding their flights. It seems this is a business directive from higher up to cut further costs. The check-in and baggage drop queues that morning came to a standstill twice as they are clearly not employing the requisite number of baggage handlers and customer service staff to service the amount of passengers travelling at peak times (there were 4 staff on the front desk of the Velocity Lounge painting their nails though). The paying passenger gets treated like livestock on a boat and is forced to pay more money to get a seat on another flight because of this. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

The ""complimentary snack"" is deplorable, regardless of the time of day. (You aren't fooling anyone.) The premium frequent flyer enhancements are rarely available (fly forward / premium exit etc.) The move away from in air Foxtel to byod seemed plausible at the time but there is such limited content and no USB or AC for charging across the fleet.

I wish they'd make them stand aside as the reason is efficiency in boarding. The pilot told us the conditions would be turbulent leaving Canberra and we'd be delayed into Melbourne due to winds and the fact they only had one runway open. The seat itself was tight, there was an empty muesli bar wrapper in my husbands seat pocket. It felt very budget, basic. We were offered tea / coffee / juice. Juice was a tiny pot. Plus we got a small pack of odd chick pea salt and vinegar rings. Yuk. Didn't matter for the short hop though. The staff were quite pleasant.

IF the new CEO wants to drag V group into a full service carrier then the Business Class service training must be improved. The cabin is fine seats pretty good but bit narrow food actually reasonable too (unlike other reviewers I thought it compared OK). But the cabin crew are treating the Business cabin as an extension of Economy. We had to press the call button 3 times on one occasion. Very little close attention to passenger wishes or pre-empting them we felt the crew were controlling the cabin to suit their work flow rather than serve us.

nan,Premium Economy,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Sydney-Paris with Sydney-Abu Dhabi in Premium Economy and Etihad from Abu Dhabi-Paris. London-Sydney with Abu Dhabi-Sydney in PE. V Australia seats are new and feel roomier than Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy. It is 38 inch pitch and even when the person in front fully reclines there is still enough leg room. The PE cabin has dedicated staff and cabin and 2 bathrooms for 40 passengers no queue! Compared to 7 toilets for 288 passengers in Economy. The food was good but it is an Economy main course with different entree and dessert. However you are served first so there is no chance of running out of your preferred choice and your meal tray is collected as soon as you finish your meal whereas in Economy you have to wait. I really loved the staff both flights they were enthusiastic lovely and friendly and they came through the cabin through the flight I lost count how many times they came through with water or other drinks snacks more snacks. Very attentive staff! Could not fault them. If you were not too lazy to get out of your seat there was also the self service bar which was full stocked and was restocked throughout the 14hr flight with roast beef/chicken sandwiches soft drinks alcohol potato chips nuts etc. The entertainment was good because you can start watching TV shows or movies as soon as you sit down you don't need to wait until the plane is at cruising altitude. I would fly them again!,nan,4.0,nan

Leg room was reasonable seat width was very good but the seat bottom was hard which caused a lot of 'pins n needles'. Cabin crew did a fantastic job with constant smiles and they did not stop working hard the whole flight. I travel often to LAX but as I cant select my seat paying a sale fare I will not travel with them again. This is very important to me. Food could also be better with 2 small meals on a 15 hour flight and the snack bar that's advertised only has 1 type of snack (when they bothered to fill it).,nan,4.0,nan

My seat would not recline and when I asked for assistance I was told ""there is nothing I can do about it at 30 thousand feet."" A simple sorry would have been fine. Anytime I asked an attendant something I was spoken to like I was a naughty child annoying his parent. Not being able to choose your seat because you paid the sale fare is totally stupid. If you choose to fly Economy of course you will pay the cheapest fare. Why would you pay hundreds of dollars more for the same class. This totally undid any of the good things about the airline.

I was going to fly from LAX-MLB but 3 weeks before the flight a V Australia representative called my home and told me they had to make flight changes which did not suit my schedule. Customer service does not offer any leeway even if it is not your fault. They are in fact unhelpful and rude and will not connect you to a supervisor if there are problems with your flight. I would only recommend V Australia if you know for certain that no changes will occur in your schedule or that the time of your arrival is not important and can be changed last minute.,nan,4.0,nan

When I called the airline to ask for help in getting them out of LA I was simply told they would have to pay the one way regular fare to get on the plane. At this time one way was anywhere between $1600 - $2100 each - I said they don't have that kind of money the agent just simply said 'well then I guess they should borrow it from someone""! His mother had had enough of this nonsense and used her business points to book them out of LA on QANTAS as I'm sure they would still be stranded in LA.

However I was quite happy to watch and play with the RED entertainment system which was magic - loads of new films doco's games and music. Flight back much better leave midnight quick food service and off to sleep for a few hours at least. Seats on the 777-300 seemed quite wide compared to other planes I have flown internationally. We chose middle section (3 across) so we wouldn't need to climb over strangers to get to the loo. Seat cushions were a little solid to sit on and I used a cushion to alleviate the (literal) pain in the bum. Food both ways was OK at best nothing special. The highly promoted snack bar was a poor joke. A few packs of chips cans of Pepsi and a bottle or two of water. It actually took me a few trips around the galley area to work out where it was. Service from crew was efficient-ish without being overly friendly or even mildly attentive. They seemed to be around when needed - meal times landing seat belts on time etc but disappeared outside those times. Getting a coffee on the return leg was one challenge too far... All in all I would fly V again if the price was right. Pros - new planes entertainment system seat width. Cons - food attention to detail by staff and seat base comfort.,nan,4.0,nan

Food was average – I couldn't see any difference in an Economy meal to what was served to us so I'm doubting the value for money if you cannot get a decent quality feed in this cabin. Bar service was a bit confusing about whether spirits were self serve and it's difficult to get to the bar if you're not sitting in an aisle seat.

Virgin staff seemed unable to cope when something goes wrong and communication with passengers was almost non existent. After quire a few hours we cancelled our accommodation and booked in at Christchurch also had to contact rental company. All in all a very bad experience and cost us plenty. Perhaps Virgin could look at the checking in system at Christchurch where you book in and print your own boarding pass. Excellent and fast.

No information provided as to what was going on or how long the delay was going to be. People trying to leave the boarding lounge to buy water were prevented by Security Staff. Felt like we were being held almost captive within the boarding lounge and it was only when a few passengers started getting very angry that finally after 4 hours we were given transit cards and allowed out into the main terminal for a drink. I cannot understand why water cannot be made available in the boarding lounge particularly under circumstances such as this. In my experience Denpasar Airport is the only place where water is not made available in boarding lounges even for sale and of course the tap water in the bathroom is not drinkable. The pilot was most apologetic but he was nowhere to be seen during our waiting time on the ground.

Unlike in LA the check-in process at MEL was rushed and the customer service agent I worked with was well below average. She had to reprint me baggage tags because she never asked what my final destination was and grumbled when asked to do so. Otherwise another good flight with excellent customer service (one flight attendant was downright rude but this was outweighed by others who were pleasant professional and attentive).

She tried to tell us that there were numerous announcements for passengers flying to Townsville to approach one of the end counters.

Unfortunately both flights were delayed due to the floods in FNQ but this was not VA's fault. The airline kept us up to date throughout both delays.

Arrived at the airport at 4 am and was told that the aircraft had broken down as was going to Christchurch to be fixed - advised to wait until the afternoon flight. We didn't get on the afternoon flight and left the following day no apology nothing. Tried to leave Denpasar 27/1/2013 VA 4196 - waited 2 hours in the queue where the computer crashed time and again. The only time that those waiting knew something was when a passenger went onto the Virgin website and discovered that the flight was delayed 6 hours. Ground staff had no idea what was going on and our baggage has never been seen again. Virgin advised they would supply lunch and dinner and it was the same food for both a sandwich rice or noodles. As a result booked into a transit lounge to get away from the hard seats and the hoards of disgruntled passengers.

nan,Premium Economy,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,Premium economy on 02/16/2013 and returned on 03/06/2013. LAX to Brisbane outbound and coming back from Sydney to LAX on board 777. Pros: Newer fleet of planes and onboard entertainment system has a good amount of selection. Ambient lighting inside cabin in nice. Planes are clean. Noise cancelling head phones are effective. Cons: The seat cushions in premium economy even after their recent redesign a few months ago are terrible. My traveling partner and I could not find a comfortable position as the bottom seat cushion have padding that is very hard that does not have any give. I could not sleep inbound or outbound on these overnight flights. On our return flight we purchased some air filled cushions at the airport to try and help the situation but the design on the seat is so poor they helped very little. Food service is the same as economy. Food quality was poor. Inconsistent on-board bag policy. We knew about weight restrictions for checked baggage and followed accordingly. However on our return flight we were asked to placed our on-board luggage on the scale. I have never had another airline weigh our overhead carry-on bags. Service is mediocre. One round of drinks a meal flight attendants walk down the aisles for a glass of wine snack then another meal. No other drinks offered by the flight attendants besides port/brandy at night. The snack bar is just filled with a couple bottles of white/red wine no premium liquors and chips/cookie/popcorn/pretzel bags.,nan,3.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,SYD-NAN return late February/early March. Outgoing flight was operated by a reasonably new 737-800 and was less than half full. The seats were quite comfortable with adjustable headrests. Travelled on a flexi fare which meant that entertainment and food was included. The IFE was ok - the choice of movies was limited but what was available was pretty good (probably worth the $15 if you travel on saver). The food though on both routes was absolutely disgraceful. On the way over I was served with a Luke Mangan egg lettuce and mayonnaise wrap. It tasted disgusting and the label said that it was 5 days old. On the way back it was an egg lettuce and mayo sandwich which I refused to eat. The meal was finished with a cookie and a pack of M&M's. Do not purchase a Flexi Fare! Return flight was operated by an old 737-800 with old and uncomfortable seats. The crew on the flight back were pretty inefficient and rude. Some of them even had a nap in the back row - seemed a bit much for a four and a half hour flight. Virgin Australia is really just a low cost airline and I would only recommend it for one or two hour flights. Based on the quality of the food I definitely would not fly VA to LAX.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Brisbane-Denpasar. I used to fly with Virgin quite often just because it was the only direct flight to Bali from Brisbane and it used to be affordable. But the prices have raised and the quality is still the same. Their flights are often delayed and there is never any compensation. Food on the plane is expensive and disgusting. The worst is the staff. They come around with drinks once or twice during a 6hrs flight and the rest of the time they are asleep or watching movies. There is no entertainment on the plane. They charge the surfboard (5kg) as a 23kg bag (it has been changed recently after many complaints). Before they were at least cheap. Now the flight to Bali is quite similar in price to Singapore airlines. So never again.,nan,1.0,nan

Use of Koru lounge in Sydney good offerings friendly staff although lounge is really starting to show its age. Boarding was fast and organised. Aircraft was painted in Pacific Blue colours but was refitted inside with the new Virgin Australia scheme. Premium Economy seating was roomy. The cabin supervisor greeted me by name and sat down and explained services and catering I was very impressed and chose what I wanted and at what times.

Flights times kept changing until we started boarding 45 minutes after scheduled time. Boarding slow and painful due to the lack of staff and the process in which they board the plane. I thought the staff were nice. Business class is separated from economy by a sheet of tinted glass. Real business class service such as Qantas would have curtains and solid wall to separate business class which I much prefer. Since I am over 6ft tall I won't complain about the leg room. Food served quickly after take off. Food is expensive on Virgin and I just went for the free coffee. Unlike the new 737-800s this old aircraft still have television screens on the back of seats. Some channels are still available to watch and it kept me occupied until we got to Melbourne. When we landed we walked out the back and went into the terminal to get our luggage.

Food was only available to purchase on these flights but if I was travelling from Sydney to Canberra or within WA some snacks are complimentary. My return flight departed on a Tuesday at 5pm and beer and wine are offered complimentary between 4pm and 7pm - but only between mainland capitol cities.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Melbourne-Hobart-Melbourne in Economy. Had only carry-on bags and checked in online so we were able to bypass the horrendous queues at Melbourne Airport. Flights were 45 and 30 minutes late departing Melbourne and Hobart respectively and there weren't any updates - either to the departure gate display boards or by way of public announcements - to waiting passengers at either airport resulting in many people approaching the departure desks to query staff. During both flights flight crew apologised for the late departure which was said to be due to 'delays with incoming aircraft'. Apart from those aspects the flights were satisfactory; very clean aircraft comfortable seating and friendly and competent cabin staff. There isn't a great range of snacks on these mid-morning flights but what is available is likely to be sufficient for most passengers given there's only about an hour's flying time in each direction.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,I have flown with them a lot since they launched. Lately however I have noticed a distinct downward spiral in their service levels. I flew SYD–DPS return last week. The flight over is ok as its during the day. Take a book or your own entertainment as they have removed the seat back TVs. There are no ipads available either so its staring at the back of a seat for 6 hours. They do now serve a free meal however it is tiny and looked pretty bad. I opted not to take the meal. The main problem I had was my return flight. It departs at 10.10pm from DPS arriving at 6.10am SYD. Being an overnight flight you would hope that there is a blanket and pillow for you. There wasn't and the flight was freezing. Again no ipads available. Staff were nowhere to be seen and when they were seen were irritable. Service levels need to improve. One last issue was the pilots didn't address the plane at all. Its a small free service which would make a big difference!,nan,2.0,nan

Onboard snack was either a warm tart with salad or smoked salmon with fresh fruit. Coffee and tea also offered and water runs wre regular.

On the way there 15min delay was assured by flight attendants that I'd have time to make it to the gate - wrong I sprinted from one terminal to the other and they told me the gate had shut. Young lady at the gate got me a flight first thing the next morning and arranged accommodation. On the way back there was a 5min delay and the only reason I made my connecting flight was that the gate was the next one down.

All flights were pretty much on time planes were quite clean and cabin staff pleasant. Drinks and snacks were well served. We booked extra legroom on all these flights and being by the wing exits these also had the advantage of no recline intrusion from the seats in front.

The difference between the Etihad flights and the VA flight is immense! Upon boarding the staff are cheery relaxed and friendly. All of your amenities a blanket and a bottle of water are waiting at your seat and they immediately walk through the cabin before take off asking if anyone needed anything else. The plane was comfortable nicely lit temperature was fine food was delicious and the staff passed through the cabin regularly with drinks. There was a small snacks section at the rear of the cabin with plentiful snacks drinks and a water tap. The entertainment system wasn't as vast as Etihad's in terms of choice but everything else about the flight was so pleasant that it really didn't matter. Highly recommend Virgin Australia and the only shame is that they have partnered with Etihad and I will absolutely not fly with Etihad again.,nan,4.0,nan

I went to the service desk and the friendly gentleman there was happy to switch my seats back with no hassle. The boarding process was smooth and organized and the flight departed on time. Complimentary drinks were provided and the FAs were generous in offering refills to passengers. No personal screens or IFE but I didn't mind since it was a short flight.

Ended up paying $40 for very poor snacks and drinks for two. If you are going to operate as the lowest of the low-cost airlines then please at least be low-cost!

Crew were polite but service seemed very slow. Crew seemed very busy and it took almost three hours for our lunch to be cleared away. Entertainment system is easy to use but the variety of tv shows and movies is very poor. I noticed one or two French passengers around me were complaining that they did not have French movies or subtitles. The crew were nice but you could tell they were very busy. There was a group of Italian passengers on the flight and none could speak English and there were no crew who spoke Italian any other languages so was a struggle for them.,nan,4.0,nan

As a 77 year old woman travelling alone I bought Premium Economy for the longer Virgin flights. The seats were wider and a bit further apart than Etihad Economy but not really worth the extra money. The worst part of the trip was the queue for boarding passes at Abu Dhabi on the return journey on 1 June. I was given passes for both outward legs in Sydney. On the return trip my Virgin pass wasn't available at the Heathrow Etihad check-in so I had to join a queue of about 200 Virgin passengers in Abu Dhabi being serviced by one man at one computer. After standing for 45 minutes I felt quite unwell and had to ask for assistance and a seat. Other passengers were standing for over an hour.

However when this failed to happen I felt it only reasonable that I spread myself around and with my 3 pillows and blanket lay down and get a nice nap for about 9 hours. Return flight had an aisle seat with a spare beside me and was able to get some sleep which I usually don't do well whilst in an upright seat laid back. Economy seats on VA 777's are one of the better seats around. However there is always room for improvement on any airline seat. Flight attendants were very attentive and ready to give you a smile.

I sat in Row 3 (which is a bulkhead seat) and had more than enough legroom. Virgin Australia's major failing is the lack of In-Flight Entertainment onboard their 737s. The lack of In-Flight entertainment wouldn't matter on a short flight (Canberra- Sydney) but on a 2 hour flight it is a bit ridiculous. I would recommend bringing an iPad or Laptop with movies on if you want to watch movies. We were offered a sandwich and a biscuit for lunch which was very very plain. The seat was comfortable though it did appear that the bottom cushion had completely separated from the back portion of the seat. The head rest was very comfortable and the leather was a nice touch.

Not only did the flight have no entertainment it was like a cool room in the cabin no pillows or blankets and the food that was served was tiny!

Mixed feelings about this flight - while the food and IFE was excellent the service from the flight attendants was horrible to say the least. On a number of occasions they would shout at customers and other times not respond to requests (like a glass of water). Virgin Australia seriously needs to manage their staff better because they are sure to lose a lot of passengers if they continue at this rate.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,Flew Sydney to Denpasar July 1. After flying Jetstar last time we found Virgin far superior. Particularly appreciated the free meal and free alcohol which is new policy. Being 737 did mean only toilets at the rear of plane which meant you had to pick your times. The crew were polite and helpful. Can't comment on inflight entertainment because we took our own and didn't notice any other. Would definitely fly Virgin again.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,Flew to Bali (Denpasar) on DJ4197 from Brisbane (return) in mid June 2013. Airplane was a Boeing 737-800 quite new and consisted of economy seats and a handful of Premium Economy seats (separated by a tinted half-wall and rope). Flight left on time. Good points were the service and friendliness of staff and the food was actually quite good. Ticket didn't include any pre-paid meals but everyone on board got complimentary hot lunch which was appreciated. No bottles of water were served but staff were happy to provide re-fills or sealed 100ml tubs. Flight time was supposed to be 6.5 hours but we were forced to circle Bali airport for another hour due to traffic congestion. In Flight Entertainment wasn't available. I thought this was very poor. No blankets available either. Virgin is using a domestic plane (B737-800) which is designed for short 2-3 hour flights for an international flight. Plane was very cramped and hardly any leg room for someone of my height (1.8 m). The layout was 3 seats each side with two toilets at the back for economy which is not enough when the plane was full. Our seats were in Row 10 which was fine. At least Virgin's flights to Bali are direct which is why we chose them. Overall 5/10 I wouldn't be in a rush to fly with VA again to Bali.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,MEL to Bali. Plane flight and cabin crew all good. Entertainment was zero - no movies no screens no radio. Luckily had an ipads ready pre-loaded. Biggest Issue - Food and drinks. Or lack thereof. Whole family starving so whilst waiting for main meal we wanted to order from the Virgin inflight menu which was poor but we were hungry and happy to pay for the limited morsels on the menu. However there was no food to be ordered. After a long wait the main finally arrived which was fine. The price of the flight was not cheap and it's a 6 hour flight so I think Virgin are skating on thin ice here and should at least warn customers of what to expect.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,On 6 August 2013 Virgin Australia experienced their second major system malfunction in four weeks. I was flying for work and had two flights cancelled meaning I hung around at the airport about 4 hours eventually having to take a flight the next morning. Being stuck overnight away from home Virgin Australia refused to book me a hotel or give me vouchers for a taxi to get to a place to stay. They told me to my face 'you are not a highly valued customer'. When I asked if I did not matter at all the member of ground staff told me that she didn't know how to explain their policy. The loss of about 6 hours of my time should have been avoidable. The booking system had gone down surely a major airline should have an efficient backup - but no they don't. They really don't seem to care about their customers at all. Avoid if possible.,nan,1.0,nan

Did not realise that unlike domestic fare structure is different. Saver means just that. 7kg carry-on. No food on the haul across the Tasman. We were offered tea/coffee. We were told there was no food to purchase. My husband is a diabetic and it was fortunate that we had pre-purchased a sandwich at the airport due to delay in embarking. Left home 9am for flight 12.30. Lift-off was late and arrival a little late. 9 hours with just a pre-purchased sandwich between us. To put it bluntly this did not leave a good taste in our mouths. During the previous 3 months we had travelled extensively with Emirates and British Airways and were always fed and watered whether a couple of hours in the air or longer. There was always food to purchase. Come on Virgin - you can do better than that across the Tasman.,nan,3.0,nan

Staff were very focused on the few business class passengers but we got stilted dis-interested service.

From Perth to Phuket may as well have gone with an upgraded economy seat on Air Asia and saved money. Seats are small no business area just a rod across the seats. Service ok food average. Return was the same with exception that the flight was cancelled with little notice and no help whatsoever to find accommodation or rebook anything. On the way home small plane to Perth then big one so Sydney 9 passengers and ran out of entrees no inflight TV screens worked in business class. Overall wasted money in this class.,nan,3.0,nan

MEL-BNE delayed slightly due late arrival of aircraft from Brisbane but they turned it around very quickly and we left around 20 mins late. Was assigned seat 3A with plenty of leg-room. Was on a felxi-fare so was offered a sandwich and water. For return flight used one of my upgrades as was assigned seat 1A. Service was outstanding with excellent food and seating. Cabin crew were on the ball for the whole flight. 2 areas which do need addressing. The Virgin lounge in Brisbane was full to overflowing but the dress standards of some of the people leave a lot to be desired. At times I felt I was in a portable building at a building site!! And the silly earpieces which are provided with the Samsung tablet are virtually useless they need better earpieces of noise-cancelling headsets. Next time I will bring my own.

The check in procedure was fantastic and the flight left on time. We were served a round of refreshments and soon after that dinner. The two choices were both tasty and filling. We asked for a child's meal for my son and even though we had not pre-ordered it were given one. While it didn't look very appetizing (and my son is very fussy) he ate it all without complaint. The in-flight entertainment was fantastic and kept us all occupied. The seats were adequate and we were content. Despite our itinerary showing only dinner served on the flight we were served snacks (chicken/egg wraps) midway through the trip and they were delicious. The snack bar was well stocked with soft drinks and chips for those wishing for a nibble en route. 2 hours before landing we were served with breakfast which was again tasty and filling. The cabin crew were extremely helpful all the way through and helped make the flight a real pleasure. The flight arrived early and we were totally satisfied with our experience.

Melbourne - departure lounge in some kind of garage at end of airport down 2 floors doors open straight onto tarmac. freezing cold windy room then buses to plane. In Bali similar everyone milling around on tarmac unsupervised with small children everywhere no footpath signage trucks moving around whilst we all waiting for bus to plane. No inflight entertainment. I didn't mind but the number of kids on board could have really used it. No online check-in available so couldn't choose seats return flight meant crammed down back amongst the screaming children on a night flight amongst the long queue of people trying to use the bathrooms Crowded flight - small plane with only one central aisle not enough staff. Drinks service took over 2 hours in the aisle. Over 2 hours to get a water. Seats barely reclined and no footrests. Small food a veg pasta was drowned in thick creamy sauce. A veg curry was very tasteless. The last security check at Bali meant that a bottle of water could not be purchased in the airport as no shops past last security so the really long waits to get a (small) cup of water made the flight even more uncomfortable. Staff seemed pressured. For the prices you get basic cut price services.,nan,1.0,nan

Cabin manager is assigned to business class only (4 passengers) and was attentive upon boarding hanging my jacket and offering beverages with a choice of water or a mocktail there was no champagne or sparkling to be seen. After take off we were offered beverages and our meal orders were taken. The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way. After waiting 15 minutes for them to disburse I stepped through the curtain only to be told that I couldn't be up there and to return to my seat. A few minutes later I was approached by the cabin manager to explain that the first officer was coming out of the cockpit and that is why I was told to return to my seat. I wasn't happy with how they handled the situation. The amenities kit was good however it was not handed out until half way through the flight.

(I had a non refundable non changeable ticket) I had left glasses on the previous flight and they were prepared to change back if that was what I needed to recover the glasses free of charge. The flight left on time and landed about 10 minutes early. I had seat 3A so had plenty of legroom. They managed to serve a basic snack and for such a short flight there was no inflight entertainment (this was as expected). The seat was comfortable and passengers were disembarked quickly.

Return flight was delayed due late arrival of aircraft from Melbourne and the staff kept us well informed as to the new departure time. Sydney can be chaotic and we actually took off 1 hour behind schedule after sitting on the taxi- way for a good 20 mins however flight crew kept us informed as to where we were in the queue for take-off.

Thinking at this stage we would refuel (as the pilot said fuel was low) and attempt landing later as we were informed that planes were landing only 1 hour after. Virgin put the passengers on what was like a school bus for 7 hours and drove to Queenstown. Conditions were poor as weather was not any better. The bus was cold no food was offered we had 1 stop and could only get small amounts of food. Which was at our expense also a taxi to our apartment at our expense.

If you run out of arrival cards make another announcement that you made a mistake and didn't collect enough of them when you left Brisbane.

Lines to the toilets went half way up the cabin as there is only two toilets on the aircraft which is a disaster if your traveling with little kids and unsympathetic and rude cabin crew. You do get a meal on board which is good but if your a vegetarian it's first in best dressed. I'd say take your own water food and entertainment on board.

My experiences with them say they are always looking for ways to improve. The food choice is not as good bland sandwiches however the pies are only served on certain flights. AUD and NZD currency are both used and credit/visa card facilities are available. Beverages such as tea coffee and water are free. I'd recommend paying for food in advance as they have choices for you and they would serve you first before others who would purchase their food onboard. I don't find the food expensive but that's my opinion others opinions may differ. Entertainment is always good during my flights. Their movies and shows etc are always updated however no entertainment between BNE-POM. I find boarding flights in NZ takes so long however boarding flights from BNE-POM are always quicker and vice versa. I once cause the flight from POM-BNE to delay 20mins and as a result my connecting flight was delayed as well. I was then escorted to my next gate by ground staff. VA has lovely friendly and attentive staff. I find the planes between NZ- AUST are older and planes between AUST-PNG are nicer and newer. You can pretty much change seats during flights if you want to. The airline is very informative and take-off and landing have always been excellent!

On the return - access to Premier Lounge this is barely adequate with minimal food and beverages very basic and shared by a combination of carriers. I also believe that the outside world can pay for access. To top it off they call us out of the lounge and to the holding area 1 hour before the plane had even arrived at DPS. So we sat in the holding area for nearly 2 hours before boarding. They knew where we were why make us leave the lounge and sit for 2 hours in a holding area. Business Class should be the last to be sent to the gate for immediate boarding first not really up to Business Class standards. The meal and beverage service on the return was adequate but sparse. There were only 8 people in business class on a 737 so if someone wants the cheese plate its not a good look to forget to bring it out. Disappointing compared to the outbound and against recent trips with Garuda Business Class on the same route. Upgrade the plane with a better IFE system  the Ipads are inadequate and the selection is very limited. When there are only 8 people to look after don't forget the cheese plate.

Awful staff delayed check-in delayed on tarmac for an hour no water offered absolutely shocking food the worst airline I've flown with. I was expecting much better from Virgin! I've never had a reason to write an airline review but I sure felt the need after the experience we had. There is so much more to tell but I've emailed Virgin direct regarding the situation of a drunk passenger in the Exit Row who was obviously unfit to sit there but who staff did nothing about but to tell us we were unfit to sit in the Exit row because of our concerns about this passenger. It was a joke the whole experience. Never will I fly with Virgin again.,nan,1.0,nan

Virgin Australia leaves a great first impression for me as this is the first time I have flown them as VA instead of their low-cost forerunner DJ (Virgin Blue). Flight departed on-time and arrived at the destination 30-40 minutes early. Customer service manager made in-flight announcements with passion and clarity. Cabin crews were also friendly. The IFE had an extensive catalogue of music but not so with movies. Furthermore a 3.5mm jack in-ear headphones was provided instead of the usual ones with two jacks. The sound only came from one side of the headphones. This coast to coast flight offered a complimentary hot meal and it was a choice between chicken casserole or Thai green curry. Overall the flight was very pleasant and I would fly with VA again.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,"Melbourne-Bali return in September. Probably won't use them again internationally. Flight leaving Melbourne was very delayed boarding. The flight was then delayed in departing by an hour - we sat on the tarmac for that time in a hot stuffy aircraft because 6 people had to have their luggage removed. Whilst the pilot was apologetic about this we were not offered any refreshments while we waited and the crew seemed to care less about passengers irritation at the delay. Check in itself at Melbourne airport was an exercise in inefficiency. 4 check in staff allocated to economy class passengers but with 4 international flights being checked in all at the same time the wait to check in was well over one hour. Very poor. The lady who checked me in appeared to be unsure about procedures and had to refer to her supervisor standing behind her. No ability to check in online either so check in was time consuming. I received a txt from Virgin before the flight saying that the wireless inflight entertainment would be available on my flight so I downloaded the app in anticipation - but the IFE did not work on the plane - the stewardess told me so when I asked. No apology from the captain or the head stewardess. It was a long boring flight up to Bali with no entertainment options and hungry passengers who expected to be able to purchase some snacks or food on board but there was nothing available for purchase. The meal was not served until 1pm (4 hours after the flight was scheduled to depart) - with nothing provided earlier in the flight other than a drink and with only 2 meal options one of which they ran out of early on. Why not have snacks available for purchase on flights of this length. Coming back on the redeye at 10.10pm was slightly better as the meal was served promptly departure was relatively on time and the IFE worked. Check in at Denpasar airport in Bali was a shambles. Virgin insist on your arriving at the airports to check in at least 3 hours' prior to departure time they do not have ground crew available to check you in until 2 hrs 50 mins prior to your flight. Long queues eventuated as a result. Check in was slightly quicker than in Melbourne however. Seats on the planes were comfortable but Virgin should be ashamed of using such small planes on these flights. There were only 2 toilets available at the rear of the plane to economy class passengers (there was one at the front but the crew refused to allow even ""desperate"" passengers to use this saying it was for business class passengers. There were ridiculous queues for the toilets as a result. The crew on both flights were generally not particularly friendly or helpful.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Travelled from Sydney to Cairns aboard a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. I was in seat 30A which is probably the worst seat in the cabin. It's the last row of seating in front of the toilets and offers no recline whatsoever. Three hours is a long time to be seated upright in a very narrow seat. But what I couldn't believe was that for whatever reason there was absolutely no in-flight entertainment. There is an app that you download to your smartphone so presumably one can watch TV programs or movies. But that was not available for some reason. The only reason I booked Virgin to Cairns was because my last Virgin flight on this sector I watched a movie on an individual seat back TV screen which Qantas did not have at the time as they still used a mainline cabin screen where everybody watched the one film at the same time. So stuck in a cramped seat with no recline no inflight entertainment a poor choice of food that I had to pay an exorbitant amount for ($10 for a revolting chicken and mayo sandwich) and cabin service that was more about keeping the herd in order rather than delivering something resembling customer service. I refuse to be spoken to so rudely by a girl half my age just because she's wearing a uniform.

During the 5 hours we were on the plane I must congratulate the young cabin crew particularly the young lady who tried to keep us all informed as the delays continued.

However on returning to economy I went past my seat to the toilets located further down in the economy section. As I was about to close the toilet door behind me a steward who I had passed in premium economy on my way back to economy appeared and informed that I was not supposed to enter another class of seating. Moral of the story - bring your own food on international flights or risk starving as food is not even available at a price in economy.

I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crèche. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later.

Virgin got us there on time and safely and the seat was comfortable enough for the 1 hour flight. When choosing your seat do not go for seat 9 a b or c in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft - these do not have windows. The cabin crew did their job efficiently but they weren't very warm. The aircraft we flew on had seatback TV which we didn't use but it's nice that it was there. I have flown in business on Virgin and there are no TV's there they just give you a portable DVD. For economy passengers - it's buy on board we didn't buy anything but prices were reasonable. Things I do not like about Virgin Australia is that when pre-selecting your seat when you make your booking the only seats that are available are the seats in the rear section of the aircraft. If you get one of these you may be lucky enough to change to a seat at the front of the aircraft when you do the web check in. I feel that Virgin Australia do treat saver fare passengers like second class citizens by only allowing seats at the rear of the aircraft when they make their booking. At major airports the jetbridge is used for business class full fare passengers and passengers lucky enough to get seats up to row 16. The rest of the passengers have to walk down the stairs outside and up the stairs at the rear of the aircraft.

Return left slightly late but again crew were fantastic with the lights turned down for take-off and as we were not landing until late in Melbourne the view from the 737-800 was fantastic.

The flight was sitting on the ground for over an hour we were moved to different parts of the runway and 55 minutes after the scheduled departure time we had wheels up. What was so disappointing with this flight was that the crew never switched on the A/C whilst on the ground so we sweltered in 30* heat no updates as to what was happening and then when I asked for a sandwich I was given an egg sandwich which I asked if there was anything else! She promptly said no. Also Virgin Australia never leave on time.,nan,1.0,nan

A beautiful new 737-800 with a small business class (2 rows of 2-2). Upon boarding I was greeted and shown to seat. Samsung tablet earphones pillow blanket and amenities kit already placed on seat and in seat pocket. Offered pre-departure drinks (no champagne on board) and soon after take-off beverages of choice. Passengers were offered the meal service at any time throughout the 6 hour 15 minute flight and a cheese and fruit platter at any time after that. Nice not to be rushed for once. Drinks were continually topped up and cabin crew checked on passengers needs constantly throughout the flight. The crew were attentive friendly and professional and must be complimented on the superb level of service they gave to all passengers in this business class cabin.,nan,5.0,nan

That is when the problem began at check in at Port Macquarie. As one company was paying for my CBR-SYD sector and the other was paid by another company I was on two different itineraries. I was told that they could not check me through to Canberra and that I would have to re-check at Sydney. Doing the right thing checking my cabin bag as it was over the prescribed weight. That day the weather was diabolical in Sydney closing the airport for some hours which caused chaos. Arrived late into Sydney and held on the ground engines running for about 2 hours I was assured that I would make the connecting flight. In short I missed my connection to Canberra as the check in was so over loaded and too few staff to handle it. I was then told I would have to stay at the airport all night (not likely) as there were no hotels left in Sydney.

Flight left and departed on time. Plane was an Embraer 190 - so comfortable with 2x2 seating rather than 3x3 in a 737. Food and drinks have to be purchased but this is not unreasonable given the cost of the ticket. Service was helpful and professional. One strange thing - Virgin sent me an email inviting me to bid an amount to upgrade to Business Class. When I clicked on the request I was advised this was not possible for this flight.

VA check-in counter not listed on flight departure boards when we found it the check-in staff member was polite but cold - maybe it was too early in the morning. Departure on-time. The aircraft was tired. Staff were indifferent. There was no IFE other than BYO with the VA App. Since the code sharing with NZ started you can get a better fare via VA and if you choose the NZ flights for the trans tasman sector you get a much better product (which on our outbound had included the NZ Works package). VA need to lift their game on their short haul internationals - the experience was lousy in comparison to their BNE/SYD/MEL - PER domestic and not as good as that of their NZ code share counterparts. Reading the reviews I get the impression that all the VA short haul internationals need some work (e.g. SYD-DPS) with attention to aircraft staff and product offering.

I would say out of 50 flights 45 were good if not great. I would say only 5 caused problems - I had one cancelled (but put on the next flight) and a few staff members over the year that perhaps shouldn't have a job. The vast majority of staff are very good - friendly professional and seem to enjoy their jobs.

The upside they checked my bags all the way to Yangon thank goodness. The downside there was a technical fault with the seatbelts causing a delay by 1.5 hours. Why were they not checked earlier? I did make it to Melb in time to catch my international flight (plus immigration had put on extra staff in Melb which helped enormously) however there were others who had international connections that were delayed by 24 hours. I found a staff member in Hobart to be quite curt but the other Virgin representative was very nice and managed the customers very well.

Another a woman stationed at a counter nearby making one or two announcements including one for passengers in the rear of the aircraft to board. No one listened of course. The queue shortened and a final boarding call was made. I approached the guy checking boarding passes. In front was a man and woman with multiple pieces of carry on luggage without a boarding pass. I was frustrated and said could I go ahead and get on. The Virgin staff member accused me of not waiting my turn. On the way to my seat there was an argument between passengers over seat allocation with crew standing and looking on.

Catering average but forgivable for a short 80 minute flight. Good range of drinks available. In the end the whole experience comes down to the crew. Outbound we had a fabulous FA who couldn't do enough for you. Inbound the FA was fairly disinterested and did the bare minimum.

I was served 2 main meals and 2 snacks on the international flight and received them earlier than other passengers because of dietary restrictions. Food not flash but edible enough. Cabin crew could not be more helpful and attentive. The pilot on return from LAX kept us updated on the extreme turbulence we experienced for the majority of the trip which was calming. Excellent array of in flight entertainment. International flights weren't sold out which meant I could lie down across 2 seats. Check in and arrival was smooth. No delays.

The bus took us to Terminal 3 were we had to wait in a line for 30 minutes on a concrete ramp with no were to sit down. Then we went in the thing that takes you onto the plane. The crew was very friendly the set quality good and free in-flight entertainment. They served dinner very soon but I didn't have any. They had a self service snack bar with water soda and chips. Then they dimmed the lights so everyone could sleep which lasted until breakfast time. I didn't have the hot breakfast but I saw it looked terrible. It was some cakey thing with baked beans.

Once again food fine and sufficient along with beer/wine. Significantly less legroom on this aircraft. Check-in for both flights was OK despite being busy days but check-in staff could show some enthusiasm for the job or find another one. The biggest disappointment was the lack of even a casual smile from any of the cabin crew except when first entering each aircraft. After that it was glum faces for the entire flight. The odd smile makes the journey go so much better for both passengers and crew. I normally fly QF but gave VA a go this time based not only on price/schedule but also looking for an alternative to QF for regular travel needs.

Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice. The best bit would have to be the service. From the FA's to the pilots keeping us up to date on delays could not have asked for better - the staff are definitely what make flying Virgin Australia a happy experience!

Contacted Virgin via the customer relations number only to be told that our fight was leaving at 3.30 pm and that we wouldn't be able to check our bags until 90 minutes before the flight. Customer relations were no help. When staff finally returned at 12pm they were rude and refused to deal with any of the issues.

The afternoon before our planned flight Virgin sent a TEXT message stating our flight was changed with no further details provided. When I called Virgin I discovered they had placed us on a much much later flight meaning we would miss our flight to Bangkok by several hours. Virgin made no attempt to rectify this issue. I then had to drive 8 hours to Brisbane and was initially told I would not receive a refund! After over 2 weeks the airline finally contacted me back and told me I was lucky to receive a refund and it would take up to 12 weeks to process this.

To be fair the flight was not so bad but I have to agree with other passengers that Virgin should really consider using a larger aircraft for this popular route as the whole journey took 6hours or so. Otherwise it was not bad at all. The seat felt big despite the standard 737 3x3 configuration. There was no inflight entertainment but most passengers had iPad/iPhone/Laptop etc to keep themselves occupied. The inflight magazine was actually quite a good read.

My flight was code share with Etihad how can their be such a difference. The best advice I can give is make sure your flight is not a code share.

Melbourne to LAX left on time. The service in business class is very good and the staff are wonderful but the seats are not the most comfortable when compared to other airlines in that class. The seats aren't much wider than economy seats and are a little hard on a 14+ hour flight. I was in a window seat and was trapped when the person on the outside went to sleep. They squeeze a third seat into the middle group which I'd never seen on other international business class flights. Your pay more for business class to get comfort and privacy and unfortunately the seat configuration doesn't give you this. The inflight entertainment system could do with a revamp as there aren't many choices.

We arrived at Melbourne to begin our journey to Fiji VA185 on the 4th August this year. At check in the staff member told us that a staff member had failed to turn up and they were short of crew - under aviation regulations the flight could not carry all customers. I asked for further details to which came none other than we were moved off the flight and it was flying with only a half load of passengers. Many thanks to the Virgin check-in staff for this enlightening explanation - we were impressed he could even be bothered raising his finger and pointing to the domestic queue which was a mile long and had to join as we were being re-routed to Sydney. We had an hour and 20 minutes once in Sydney to find Fiji Airways which Virgin had now booked us on. Most of the Virgin Staff that we spoke to seemed to be of the opinion we would struggle to make it from the domestic to international terminal in Sydney in time to get the Fiji Airways flight. Once we arrived in Sydney it turned out that the journey time between the Domestic and International Airports was a third of the time the Virgin staff had told us in Melbourne - with 10 minutes to spare before closing the flight. Apparently their flight was fully booked courtesy of the missing staff member so they offered us Business Class at an upgrade cost of $370. We took the upgrade - what's an extra $740 stacked on to our holiday expenses anyway. So we boarded Fiji Airways - business class brand new plane - friendly staff interested in our well being.,nan,1.0,nan

We arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure and were waiting in the departure lounge when we found out that the flight had been delayed because of weather in Perth. Apparently the Captain had decided that there may be a chance of fog and that waiting two hours was the better option. We ended up boarding about 1am in the morning onto a 737-800. It had a little pretend business class up the front which I think had about seating for 12. The business class seats looked very poor for business but my seat of torture was further down the aisle. A wing exit seat no entertainment no recline on the seat and how skinny can they make a seat? We were extremely lucky to have the pleasure of the stewardess tell us of our responsibilities of sitting in an exit seat and yes I know this is a requirement of sitting here but the attitude of the stewardess was appalling. Not friendly and helpful but bossy bordering on rude she appeared to enjoy listening to herself assert her authority. Once we took off it was the usual farce of roping off the business class section and restricting the rest of the entire passenger list to 2 toilets at the rear of the plane. As we approached Perth the flight attendants came down the aisle with the rubbish bags and proceeded to tell everyone to clean up any rubbish under our seat and any from the back of the seats. The complete disregard for customer comfort connecting flights and delays was breathtaking.

Not only was this flight delayed 2 hours - the message Virgin sent did not specify the delay time - but the premium economy seats on the B737-800 were actually economy seats with a drop down table in the centre seat. What a difference to flight VA175 5 days earlier where the seats were proper premium economy seats with a delineation between this section and the economy section slightly more leg room and the crew were much better organised. Why use these old planes with inferior seating when one is paying quite a premium for the supposed premium economy seat. This is certainly not satisfactory. In addition something has to be done about the toilet situation as there was a constant queue of people during the entire flight for the toilet situated in the front of the aircraft. Obviously this needs addressing. The crew on VA176 were frazzled and the service not up to the usual Virgin standard. It is not the passenger's problem that the flight is delayed and I think all passengers were well behaved despite the long delay. Virgin are doing themselves a disservice by using these old planes and I for one will not use them again for this leg.

The service and experience cannot be described as business class. You have to hang your own jacket behind the seat. The seat only has limited recline and no foot rest. The front seat reclines right into your space so you can barely get the table out. There is only limited galaxy tablets available so I missed out. No seat power to charge your phone. There was no choice of meal as not enough where loaded and did not receive main meal until 2 and half hours into the trip. There was only one cabin crew to serve and was nowhere to be seen for most of the flight. No tea or coffee service.

The cabin was nice and spacious mood lighting adding to the comfort. Cabin crew were fantastic on both legs - all had huge smiles very helpful and cheery and genuinely looked like they cared. In this respect they're better than Qantas. Where they fall down is in the food and IFE. Dinner was nothing spectacular and breakfast options were limited. IFE was worst I've experienced on any long haul airline. There were probably only around 40 or so movies many of which were either kids or foreign language.

I asked for a food ingredient list as Virgin Australia don't do domestic special meals and was told there wasn't one and it was ""too bad"" so nothing to eat for me as well. The only consolation was I saw the crew member who was roughly treating meals dropped several meals in the galley from the oven so only one person got their choice in any case.

For example because I was travelling on the flexi-fare I was given a bread roll which the person next to me had to buy - not sure the bread roll was worth an extra $700. Available refreshments were basic - would have thought that for a 4 hour flight something more substantial would have been available. For IFE you needed your own tablet just as well I had a good book. Plane was on time was full (as expected) but no delays with luggage in Sydney. In flight service was friendly and quick. In exit row a bit tight on the shoulders even though the gent next to me was not that large but the seat was comfortable enough. Overall a slightly underwhelming experience probably not quite enough to tempt me to leave Qantas but a reasonable alternative if no Qantas flight is available.,nan,1.0,nan

Gate waiting area was spotless however all of the complimentary newspapers appeared long gone. Seat onboard 737-800 was pretty good by the window with several inches legroom in front although the seat was still a bit too narrow. Virgins inflight entertainment app was not available for the flight so I was left to read the inflight magazine which was already worn out despite it only been used for 9 days. Cabin overall needed some cleaning - there were crumbs on my seat from previous flights that could have easily been removed prior to mine and there was a faint smell of vomit hanging in the air throughout the flight. One of the air con vents was missing. Cabin crew was friendly enough but definitely not as well- presented or delivered as an international flight. Complimentary snack was questionable being a tiny capsicum and cheese sandwich which looked to have been made with only 1 slice of bread. Was pleased that the flight arrived in Melbourne ahead of time but waiting for my checked in luggage was almost half the actual flight time.,nan,4.0,nan

Virgins inflight entertainment app was available but the signal was either very weak or too busy because I was unable to connect with my iphone several times and eventually gave up. Cabin was filthy and there was extensive mould and spillage on the seat and particularly the metal joints and was likely made worse by the fact only 1 passenger requested the air conditioning be turned down which made the cabin warmer and more damp. Cabin crew was very gruff and seemed too large to pass down the aisle.,nan,4.0,nan

The trip was pleasant enough however if VA are trying to be ""Australia's favourite airline"" by 2017 they need to try a little harder. The attendants were less than enthusiastic (this was the last flight of the day I suppose). Whilst they do a ""pre-dinner drink"" in Economy and a drink with the meal service Qantas has it all over them in the drinks department. When Virgin collect the trays from dinner they bring only the ""garbage trolley"" - and no other top up drinks Qantas brings drinks with the ""collection"" trolley and that keeps the natives quiet.

Further boarding calls were not made with flight number or destination so had to go by the flight status board at the gate - which had a VA flight to Melb at 10am and a Delta flight to Adelaide at 10am needless to say the Delta flight was a glitch. Cabin crew warm and friendly. No issues in having water as well as juice/tea/coffee and a second complimentary snack. Both flights on time.

However Virgin had now completed a seat swap from row 2 window (without asking) and I now found myself in the aisle in the very back row.

There was no in-flight entertainment and even if it had been available no headsets were provided. Our American traveling companions who are used to poor service rated this trip as having the worst service they had ever experienced.

Practically moments after taking my seat I was offered a glass of fresh orange juice or spring water. Followed by a samsung tablet for entertainment which can now be used from gate to gate.

In my view there is an issue about using a 737 with only 8 business seats for 5-6 hour international flight. My seat was wide but had restricted recline. As this was an evening flight I found it acceptable but would not have wanted to be in it for an overnight flight. The service was personal polite and attentive throughout. However I was surprised not to be offered an amenity kit. I asked for one half way through the flight. The first FA I asked did not initially seem to know about it but one was eventually found for me. I was offered a beef main course for dinner but was surprised that the only choice was between that and the economy vegetarian meal. However the meal and wine turned out to be excellent given the size of aircraft. Overall a very pleasant flight.,nan,3.0,nan

So I read a book Flight was on time with complimentary drink and snack with an option to purchase other food items. Return journey similar. Adelaide-Melbourne return was an award flight (using Singapore Airlines points) so only payment was for airport taxes so only cost $A84 for 2 tickets for wife and self. Flight similar to Adelaide -Sydney above only shorter duration. Once again checked in at desk both ends and check in staff ere helpful and friendly. Adelaide- Melbourne one way on January 5th as 1st stage of Adelaide-Melbourne-Beijing flight with Singapore Airlines. Friendly check in lady was able to check my bag all the way through to Beijing and issue Boarding passes for all flights. All in all 5 very good flights with VA albeit short domestic hops.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,I flew from BNE to ZQN with Virgin Australia. At $355 Australian Dollars it was already a relative expensive ticket for a flight that's only a little over 3 hours long (and booked over 6 months in advance). I even got the lowest fare Economy Lite which meant I had to pay an outrageous fee of $120 at the airport to check in ONE bag! And there was no way to pay it online in advance and BNE airport had no self-service machines to ease the check- in (i.e. long lines). Once on the flight despite it being a 3+ hour international journey there was no complimentary food service. I had to pay about $12 for a sandwich. Another annoyance with Virgin is Velocity their frequent flyer programme. You can sign up for it but not complete the mandatory fields if you live overseas! So you have an inactive useless membership that you can't complete because you can't enter a non- Australian or NZ address. Why is a frequent flyer programme for such a major airline not open to everyone? Especially when they have many international flights. Oh and if you want to use their entertainment system on board the aircraft you have to download an app which is impossible to do without an internet connection. And the Wi-Fi on board doesn't provide internet unless you have the app! So you have to somehow know about this before boarding and download the app beforehand. Completely idiotic. Seats on board were okay and the flight got to the destination on time which is the only positive thing.,nan,1.0,nan

Lack of cleaning - the back of the seats in front of us had spills / food deposits. There was no inflight entertainment unless you had your own tablet or wanted to pay extra on board. The inflight magazine (some seats missing even this) was well tattered. We had no announcements about the weather / temperature on landing would be or that time adjustments would occur.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,Sydney to Los Angeles and back during December 2014 in economy class. This was my first flight with Virgin Australia and overall I was quite impressed. The flight to Los Angeles ran very smoothly check-in was easy ground and inflight staff were attentive and friendly. The toilets were kept immaculately clean throughout the entire flight. There were three food services - dinner a snack and breakfast - which were all delicious. I found that even in economy there was sufficient legroom and I didn't feel cramped in this aircraft. I really appreciated the little package that we were given with a pen and eye mask inside a clear ziplock bag as I had not brought either of those items with me on the plane. On my return flight to Sydney I really appreciated the early check-in (3pm) that was available at LAX for our 9.50pm flight. As we had arrived at LAX at midday from New York we were able to get lunch check in our baggage and then take a taxi from the airport to do some final sight-seeing and shopping in LA before our flight home. The only issue I had with Virgin Australia was the gate number on our boarding passes was not the actual gate the flight was departing from. This caused some stress and we were in the last group of passengers to board. Luckily we had checked the signage in the airport and were able to get to the actual gate. Apart from this unfortunate mix-up I had no other issues with the flight back to Sydney and would definitely recommend Virgin Australia to anyone travelling this route.,nan,5.0,nan

It's been two years since my last flight and whilst VA seems to have got its branding and product consistency together the overall feel leaves a lot to be desired. On both flights I felt the service from cabin crew was basic and lacking warmth. This is in stark contrast to their advertising. Free snack/beverage for the flight was welcome but again I felt that they could offer more than a meagre cheese/crackers combination at lunch if they are trying to compete with Qantas for customers. Overall the flights were on time and got me from A to B and back but I feel that the VA experience is still sub-standard and lacks the personality which they seem to want to hang their hat on.,nan,4.0,nan

It was a full fare booked through Etihad so I expected a full fare flight experience. Upon arrival, we had no gate and had to use connecting buses. The staircase had to be delivered 3 times because the first 2 were broken. The staff on the flight was unfriendly and one of them did not show a single smile throughout the 14 hour flight. I asked for a snack mid flight and was told to wait 15 minutes, it turned out to be a 30 minute wait. Water and beverages were also sparsely given out during the flight. This whole experience was not deserving of the price I paid, especially when being compared to the level of service provided by Etihad in the first leg of the flight.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Served 1 very small biscuit in a packet, along with coffee, which was complementary. Alcoholic drinks are now A$8.00 Cabin staff were not pleasant and it was obviously an effort to do their job.

Though you do check in at terminal three and then have to go outside to TBIT to go through security. You get use of the Etihad lounge when you fly business which is great. Meals onboard were ok but not a stand out. Seats are very comfortable as is the bed. No wifi offered on board and they should probably look into this. I'd flown with Etihad, Icelandair, Air Berlin and American and it was offered on all flights. We were late leaving and late landing and then sat on the tarmac for half an hour and missed our connection. Bags were off pretty quickly so we got to the transfer desk before it got really busy. We were due to fly business to Melbourne but the flights were full for three hours so elected to fly economy rather than wait and will get refunded. Transfer to domestic unlike Qantas is via the road rather than air side so you need to go through security again. Would be nicer if you could just get dropped airside at domestic. The cabin crew are what make the difference and having just flown with American Airlines the difference was marked.",Couple Leisure,4.0,1.0

Our flight was cancelled due to poor weather, there was no communication to passengers till after the time that the flight was due to take off. The ground crew did not offer any support or information. Not one staff member could tell us what was happening, we were just instructed to collect our bags and wait. Lack of communication, rude staff and no service at all - I advised one of the ground crew that I was tired and just wanted to find out what was going on and her response was - ""I'm tired too"".

Now, the flight operated by Virgin Australia was extremely comfortable. Their B777-300ER has recently been ""renovated,"" and the economy cabin features very comfortable seats that recline with ease, and quite far back. Virgin Australia have put in a lot of effort as to customer experience. As it was a long haul flight, a little travel pack was provided. Where many other airlines don't provide this, or when they do, it's in a cheap feeling plastic bag, Virgin provided a nicely made zip-lock bag, which I feel is better, as it can be used for more things, and lasts longer. The actual items in the bag were of a higher quality too - the eye mask was very good, and blocked out all of the light, and fit my face quite snugly. The earplugs were also very good, and blocked out the majority of the noise in the cabin. As for the flight experience, it was an overnight, and sleep quality was surprisingly good for economy class. The seats recline quite far back, and the cabin also has ambient lighting to enhance sleep. As for the meals, I ordered the gluten free meal as I suffer from coeliac disease, and it was of good quality. As for the codeshare, I cannot say the same thing. There is a discrepancy with the code share when ordering special meals that mean that all non Virgin flights operated flights don't have the special meal on board (meaning I was not given food for 24 hours from London to Sydney, or from Abu Dhabi to London, as they were all operated by Etihad). However, I can safely say that the Virgin flight was possible the best flight I've done from Sydney to London (I fly that route quite a lot)",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 777-300R,Economy Class,4.0,November 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes,SYD to LAX,3.0," |  Sydney to Los Angeles, connecting to New York JFK with Delta. When I checked in the Virgin staff told me that there was a new product available for purchase that delivered extra legroom but as my flight wasn’t at capacity she could allocate me one of these seats gratis. She then took a card with a map of LAX and drew the route I would need to take to make my transfer to Delta at LAX. This was an excellent example of customer service strategy. The inflight service was up to standard, food excellent with vegetarian options and vegan/gluten free meals available on request prior to the flight. The inflight entertainment offers a decent amount of TV shows, movies and albums, however no news channels is upheld here. It’s bizarre to me that they can’t provide one news program, even if it is slightly out of date. Current affairs programming would also be very welcome. There was an issue with the headphone jack disengaging on a frequent basis and I needed to jiggle it to find the sweet spot to permit the sound to flow through, but this was minor.  The Delta transfer at was a different story. The food consisted of crackers, nuts and not a piece of fruit but rather a slice of fruit. The Delta plane was in a dishevelled state, with wet toilet paper and paper towel on the floor and sink of the rest room. Codeshares are complex deals and I’m sure both carriers benefit from this partnership, but from a service continuity perspective the alliance with Delta is detrimental to Virgin Australia. It’s the only major flaw in what is otherwise an outstanding product. I need to make mention of the Virgin Australia twitter team who attend to all my enquiries within an hour of me tweeting. This makes life so much easier when you’re on the go and don’t have time to make a call or a formal online enquiry. ",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I can understand keeping to schedule with task and routine but please be more lively. I know the flight is only just over an hour but in regards to the food being offered, you might as well not serve anything at all because the portion is so small. Compare to Qantas, Virgin needs to do some homework in this department. Lastly, the aircraft is looking very dated and really needs a refurbishment, they could possibly do with brand new aircrafts. Seats don't even have entertainment screen, it's really a must these days considering how much people travel on the east coast of Australia. They do offer the option of downloading their app to view entertainment via your own device but honestly that's not good enough.

Before that we were told not to go to the gate before 5 pm. We came to the airport 2:30.

Virgin Australia promotes itself as an alternative to Qantas but there are too many instances of these sorts of mishaps for any real support for that claim (see other reviews, for example).

There are no screens for passengers to access the entertainment system and passengers need to download an app to stream movie, music over onboard WiFi. I hesitated to do it because I do not want to drain the battery on my iPad and iPhone. For breakfast there was only one option which is scrambled eggs with hashbrown, mango yoghurt and choice of beverages. I am fine with vegetarian option for breakfast but I would appreciate having the option to choose. The crew went around for 2 rounds of drinks throughout the flight. Generally the crew is friendly and helpful. Seats are comfortable. I was seated on the first row of economy class with extra leg room.

I had a short notice business trip Melbourne to Sydney booked just the day before, so ended up in a middle seat on the 7 am. In the lounge I asked if an aisle seat had opened up. The friendly agent responded it's a very busy flight, but my fare qualified for an upgrade with one of my platinum vouchers. I would normally not use them on a short flight, but I really dislike middle seats, and she had such a nice smile at 6.10 am, so I took it. Perfect trip, very attentive FAs, surprisingly good coffee.

It does cause neck pain after a while looking down all the time, I do miss the back of seat entertainment a lot. The biggest negative was the ""snack"", the same on both legs. A 29g chocolate bar and drink. Almost an insult. They had a price list in the seat pocket of food to purchase but I guess it didn't apply to either flights.

On arrival to Canberra Airport, via Melbourne from Adelaide, I waited at the baggage carousel for 45 minutes until a passenger saw me still standing there alone and came to inform me that the luggage belonging to 6 passengers, including myself was in Melbourne. I was thankful that a van later delivered it to my lodgings 5 hours later, however annoyed that Virgin Australia had not informed any of the passengers themselves earlier. On my return flight, there were other issues with what looked like a very outdated plane which has communication problems causing us to have to disembark before take off and re enter the terminal before embarking another plane. I also noticed the young air hostesses did not look very happy as people in that role usually do which did not help to ease the tension, unlike the amazing airline staff from Sydney to Adelaide who seemed to have an excellent camaraderie amongst them.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

All schedule change needs to be communicated, no matter how small. Luckily the flight was just over an hour long, considering economy class in their planes can be quite unbearable.

Check in at Brisbane was a breeze with the kiosks and drop off. My only criticism is that with the bag drop there wasn't a staff member actually allocated there to assist passengers. They kind of roam around between different areas. Therefore when I had an issue I had to signal for one to come and help. Also when that was done they didn't volunteer information about what lounge I am entitled to use. I believe there is a business class check in counter, but I didn't see this as wasn't looking. So just a bit more of a personal touch point would be nice. Seat - So much room, felt like a nice comfy chair and couldn't complain about this at all. Having flown Air NZ and QF, I believe VA do have the superior product. But just a bit over NZ and hugely over QF. Food service was good and quality was enjoyable. I would have appreciated being offered another bread roll with dinner before that was taken away. One thing that was odd is that the blankets were not on the seats. You had to ask for them. Thought that this could have been on the seat ready for you like the other carriers do.

There is no TV screen on board so passengers need to download the app prior to boarding and they can stream movies, music across the WiFi on board. Voyeur magazine is packed with interesting travel stories and articles which is worthwhile reading to kill some time with music on your iPod. For dinner we were offered a choice of nasi goreng or beef rogan with passengers' choice of beverage and dessert. I must say I am disappointed with the food.

I have enjoyed Virgin Australia flights over more then 10 years from New Zealand and Australia to Samoa and vice versa.

Nor have I been talked down to like a child by cabin crew. On this flight one of the cabin crew was great and empathized with my obvious difficulty. The other two couldn't care less. One berated me with the company policy on seating for take off and forced me to sit with my legs off the floor, jammed into the seat in front of me as this was the only way I could get my legs in. After take off the other cabin crew rammed my left leg with the food trolley and acted oblivious to my pain. I found this demeaning and totally unacceptable.

I purchased the flight several week in advance directly on Virgin website. Closer to the flight I was emailed the itinerary and I realised the flight was going to be provided by Air New Zealand rather than Virgin. I no problem with that, but when I tried to proceed with online check in I wasn’t able to complete it because I had a Virgin booking number and not a AirNZ one. This meant not being able to check luggage allowance and seats. At the airport we were surprisingly charged with $140 luggage excess for trying and check in 10kg when Virgin allows 24 kg in international flights in economy class. Not having a chiuse we paid AirNZ and were redirected to Virgin to pre purchase a luggage for the return flight. Virgin refused to allow prepurchase forcing us to pay $140 excess on the way back. I would have never taken $10kg to check in for $280. I could have easily fit everything in the carry on like I usually do. After a massive argument Virgin went from ‘there nothing we can do’ to ‘we can charge you $25 for the luggage on the return flight’. It’s a shame it coasted me $140 + $25 and ruined the mood for the rest of the day. Very poor service. The e-ticket should have been clear and I should have been allowed to online check in. On top of it I couldn’t choose my seats upfront and even asking for a sole seat I got given a middle seat.

As we boarded the aircraft the friendly and efficient crew informed us about the delay. The seats were quite comfortable for a short nap, food was served quickly after take off and the drinks were served throughout the flight. There was a drunken passenger on board in business class, no problem for the crew, they handled the incident professionally: The passenger got his Coke and ""Jim Beam with Coke"" more and more in big quantities of Coke without J.B.

The plane was old and is in dire need of a refresh. A sickly sweet rocky road Byron Bay cookie was handed out that I was not able to stomach. I purchased a sandwich which was $9 alone even though they are $5 in 7/11 and very dry. To top it all off one of the flight attendants spilt someone's remaining water down my back as they were clearing the row behind me. They had a good giggle over it, said they were just trying to cool me down and moved on.

We just want to check in with the same person so we can all seat near each others. Certainly upset the staff at the counter and the whole service after that was a rough one. Our combined bags were way under, we even have one checkin bags weight 3 kg for 23 kg allowance. Only one bag 26 kg and to get it in we need to pay $70 extra.

A330-200,Economy Class,2.0,November 2017,2.0,1.0,nan,no,Melbourne to Hong Kong,2.0," |  I am extremely disappointed in Virgin Australia. The check in service was extremely disappointing and the main issue of this complaint and cause of why I am unlikely to fly Virgin Australia in the future and do not recommend Virgin Australia. When checking in, I was asked about the contents of my luggage. I disclosed that I was taking some frozen food (meat and fish) from MEL to HKG which I regularly have been for years on other airlines. The food was vacuum sealed, frozen and packed into a freezer satchel. I fly between HKG and MEL usually twice per month or more and have had no issue with doing so. I was told that the check in representative needed to check about my baggage which was a surprise. After some time, I was told that I could not take the frozen goods to HKG. I had driven to the airport and park in the Long Term car park so there was not someone at the airport with me whom would be able to take them back for me. It was suggested that I leave it in my car (for 10 days while I travelled). The expensive contents (costing a significant portion of the flight cost) would perish in that time. There was little concern for my goods nor my situation. I was offered to be removed from the flight and travel the next day, which was not an option as I need to be in HKG that evening for an event. I had chosen the VA87 flight as the arrival time suited me and enable me to attend the event. Second, I was upset about the situation and then was further annoyed when I was told that I should have read all of the terms of carriage. I have since checked the information provided on baggage and have not found information readily available relating to not being able to check in frozen goods to take from MEL to HKG. There is one section under the ""Conditions of Carriage"" page that I had to dig to find that referred to seafood, however this was in references to the ""Limitation of Liability"" of Virgin (refer clause 19.5(a)(iv)). This does not relate to preventing or prohibiting the checking in of frozen goods. I think that it was unreasonable for my baggage to be refused. Third, then separately, when waiting at the gate to board, an announcement was made (well after the scheduled boarding time) that the boarding time (originally 10:15 am) and departure time (originally 11:00 am) would be delayed. The passengers were loaded onto the plane and then while on the plane, further delays were announced leading to the passengers being requested to disembark after 12:00 noon. We were told that the delays were due to engineering requirements, however we were later advised the original delay was due to the delay of the income plane. The further delays were due to engineering attending to something on the plane. The staff on the plane were very good about managing the passengers and the delay. We eventually arrived into very late HKG to which I missed the event I needed to attend. Post flight, the Virgin Australia Customer Service, an automated impersonal email based mechanism has been atrocious. Do not fly Virgin Australia overseas.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

We handed up arriving after 5 pm and not being able to collect the Campervans we had prepaid for. Today, from Auckland to Sydney, the flight was delayed by 45 minutes. But once on the plane, we experience technical issues once again. After our of wait, they made us offload the plane and going back to the gate. At the gate no one gave us instructions on what to expect next. After a couple of hours and lots of waiting around, we manage to find out which flight and gate we had to go to. We arrived in Sydney with several hours of delay, no apologies, no compensation not even a voucher for buying some food in the whole day we spent at the airport waiting around. They wasted 2 of the 6 days of our holidays, making it not worthwhile having the break. They should be held accountable and offer a compensation.

Flight was on one of the more modern Boeing 737-800's of the fleet. A snack and beverages were provided on this flight, and overall, it was a good flight. The next leg, VA555 to PER was exceptional in every way! The A330 is certainly the only way to do a transcontinental flight, with unsurpassed comfort in economy and seatback entertainment screens. A full hot meal was served on this flight, and the flight attendants were all fantastic. The following evening, it was VA696 from Perth to Melbourne, the scheduled 22:35 service. To my surprise, the crew (once again warm, friendly and attentive) served us a hot supper before dimming the lights, ahead of a 5am landing in Melbourne. Finally, VA444 on November 28, the scheduled 20:15 service from Sydney to Adelaide. Once again, the crew were flawless on this flight, and a light snack was served along with drinks.

Furthermore then made it as difficult as they could - I had to firstly seek out a JP (who said that the form they wanted signing by the JP wasn't even in a valid format and was purely to deter people from making a claim).

I fly regularly and hold platinum status with other airlines. Each time I fly Virgin I am reminded why they're my last choice in travel (My most recent Virgin flight before this one also included a 3.5 hour delay).

As I complained via email I was told twice : Please be advised, you did not book a paid seat i.e. economy X seat or exit row seat. As mentioned in my previous email, Virgin Australia do not guarantee seating due to multiple reasons. So I basically ended up paying more to be sure to come back on the same flight and sit close to each other, to end up alone. ",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

They could not have messed our travel up more if they had tried in both directions. They had cancelled our outbound flight without our knowledge and it was not until we were doing our online check-in did we notice that they changed our flight from 9:00PM to 9:00AM the next morning. They literally wanted us to fly into LA only to sleep on the floor of an airport without our knowledge, which was not possible as my spouse had recently had back surgery. We were also meeting someone in Sydney who would have had to wait it out there for 12+ hours. Were able to get them to book us on another flight out earlier the same evening as our original flight, however, we could no longer use the upgraded seats that we had paid for and they had a difficult time getting our boarding passes cleared for the international flight from LA to Melbourne. It took them 50+ minutes on the phone with their own customer service and luckily someone at the gate that understood booking to work it out. We had to add an additional leg by flying into Melbourne and the connection they gave us was much too tight and we missed that flight as well. Fortunately we could catch the next flight out not long after. Our return trip was the most arduous journey we have ever had to endure! We were to fly home via their partner airline, Delta. With our boarding passes in hand, enduring the suffering of getting thru security and waiting hours to board, we were not allowed on the airplane at the very last minute because Virgin refused to give control of our ticket to Delta. So the plane left with our seats empty that we had purchased 7 months prior to this trip! They escorted us out and told us there was nothing either airline could do and that we would have to purchase new tickets to get home! So at an additional cost of $4600.00 for new tickets from a third airline with the lovely SSSS code attached to them due to the purchase being so close to the flight, having to go thru security again, we were now treated like criminals while enduring escalated security!

I took a cab to the airport at my own expense as I was not willing to sleep at such unsafe standards especially while I was traveling alone. At the airport finally after waiting for another half hour (thanks to one compassionate aircrew) got to speak to a ground staff and was assigned to a different hotel which I must say was acceptable.  My thoughts- if a frequent traveller like myself was treated with such indifference (loyalty BTW is not a virtue that’s rewarded but one that’s exploited) what was the plight of a naive traveler? Why the double standards? Why are some people given standard accommodation while others were given sub standard ones? I understand if the business class passenger was put up in a five star hotel but why the double standard between passengers in economy class (mind you not premium) ... if trying to justify the cost of the ticket- I can assure you that I had bought the most priciest one in economy class. If it was not the loyalty or the price of the ticket, then what was the deciding factor?",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,April 2018,4.0,3.0,nan,yes,Sydney to Brisbane,4.0," | VA901 from Sydney to Brisbane, flight was good, however check-in and bag drop was a bit disorganised on Friday 13th April. It was not clear which line was for full check-in, and which one was for bag drop only. I spent about 10 minutes in a queue I didn't need to be in because I had already used a self-serve kiosk. After realising the bag drop only queue, the crowd control person called people on my flight forward, but then on seeing me said ""Not too many people, get back in line"" after I lost my spot in the line, I of course was rather annoyed by that. But when I did finally get to drop my bag it only took 15 seconds as expected. I had friends travelling later that day, who said it took them 45 minutes just to drop a bag. I can see from other reviews that other people find the check-in and bag drop counters disorganised. If they understandably want to encourage more people to use self-serve check-in like I do because it is more efficient, then they must be clear on which lines are for bag drop only, and which line is for full check-in where it could take upwards of 10 minutes for one staff member to check in a group of about 6. In Sydney on Friday 13th April, you had at least one staff member who was serving/alternating two lines of customers. However on the return leg, I flew VA954 Brisbane to Sydney, the check-in bag drop counters were excellent at Brisbane Airport, it was quite clear which counters were for full check-in and which counters were for bag drop only.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes,Sydney to Brisbane,2.0," |  Sydney to Brisbane on April 19, 2018. I was even offered an Economy X seat for the mid day flight! A fairly large pax (lots of passengers in economy), which meant snack service was even more efficient. Wonderful staff, and a wonderful flight with Virgin Australia. I would definitely recommend this airline to all of my colleagues and friends!",Business,3.0,2.0
Boeing 777,Economy Class,2.0,April 2018,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,Melbourne to Los Angeles,2.0," |  Melbourne to Los Angeles. Unimpressed and irritated by VA customer service. First boarding was a disaster, disorganized, and very lengthy. There's zones on the boarding pass for a reason. No wifi on either flight. 2 meals were provided and both times the attendant notifies us that our selection of meals is gone. No beverages offered other than the bottle of water at boarding. So disappointed. I've never felt like third class traveler more than on this trip. I'll never recommend the airline to anyone.",Business,2.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,March 2018,nan,4.0,nan,no,Sydney to Queenstown,3.0," |  Sydney to Queenstown. I was shocked when I was checking my baggage at the counter and told that I need to pay extra AUD 120 per baggage. I did not see any online baggage purchase option when I was trying do online check-in the night before. Staff service was good, but it did not help, the service did not worth the money.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 737,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,4.0,2.0,nan,yes,Melbourne to Hobart,3.0," |  Melbourne to Hobart. Compared with Qantas the check-in process during peak hour in Melbourne was cumbersome. After printing off a bag tag (and not all the machines did this) we had to wait in a long and slow-moving bag drop queue -- no quick self bag drop here! The flight was smooth and uneventful, with a drink and small snack served by the friendly crew. We arrived on time and the baggage was available soon after.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
