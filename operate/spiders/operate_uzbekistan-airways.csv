Very old, tatty and worn out Boeing 757 with very uncomfortable seat for a night flight and limited leg-room. Cabin crew were friendly but with limited English. Food was tasty. First time flying with Uzbekistan Airways and wouldn't do it again if there were any other direct flights available.

Check in at T2 in Beijing was easy and staff where giving priority to business classs passsengers. Lounge was okay even so I would not be happy if I was hungry. Boarding and flight were almost on time whichbin Beijing is almost like a miracle. Flight attendants were not over the top but decent and friendly. Food was not my taste but I guess this is a matter of what you prefer. Transit experience was nice for the lounge but transit staff at Taschkent were not so helpful and for some reason kept me waiting in a corner and could not tell me what for only to tell me then I could walk on now.  Lounge run out of beer and food were snacks at best which you have to heat up by yourself. Internet was not working for me. On the leg to Frankfurt last minute change to Boeing 757 rather 767. Plenty of upgrades as a result as economy overbooked. The plane was old not very comfy for sleeping. The 767 before was much better and even so not a full flat seat it was alright to sleep. So seats are dependent on aircraft used. B767 is okay B757 is not. Guess 787 would be okay as well. Things are kept clean, IFE is utterly useless. Transfer in TAS easy if they do or tell you to wait for no good reason. Staff is average, which means like they seem to do their job alright but there was no pleasant surprises in service concept at all. Well considering they were cheap I would say I recommend to fly if all you are really after is a cheap seat with extra legroom. If you want a full business class experience I would avoid them.",Business,5.0,nan
Boeing 747-400,Business Class,5.0,October 2016,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes,LHR to TAS,5.0,"My wife and I flew Business Class out and return because of poor reviews. We were part of a group of holidaymakers. The Skyteam Lounge at Heathrow can not be faulted. We found the aircraft to be like many others, with the odd fault - my wife's inflight entertainment selector wasn't working on the return journey but she sleeps so it wasn't a problem. We had very attentive and pleasant staff with a choice of meals and drinks. Alcoholic drinks are available on request. The seats were very comfortable and reclined not too far from flat. On the return journey the Lounge at Tashkent had limited snacks available and alcoholic drinks had to be purchased. Boarding was swift and efficient. TIp - the Duty Free shop on landing is much cheaper than the Duty Free in Departures. We have absolutely no complaints about Uzbekistan Airways. Our fellow travellers in Economy were pleased with their journeys except that they had no choice of food. On the outward and return journeys there were not many Economy passengers. As a result they were able to sleep across three seats. Business Class was full. We read dire reviews of Uzbekistan Hotels too that were completely unfounded. The City Palace Hotel in Tashkent was excellent by any standards. The Asia Hotel in Fargana was another excellent hotel in rooms away from the noisy road. Don't believe everything that you read about Uzbekistan transport or hotels. I hesitate to label previous contributors as 'moaners', but that passes through my mind. Hotels tend not to supply plugs for basins and baths - take your own. Uzbekistan is a developing country and making a good job of it. They do need to make a good push to improve the quality and cleanliness of public toilets, which in some cases can only be described as dreadful. The i.pad has films but even if you choose English language, you get Russian.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A320,Business Class,1.0,October 2016,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,TAS to DEL,1.0," |  This was my 9th trip on Uzbekistan Airways on the route Delhi to Tashkent return. I read many adverse review about this airline, but my experience was generally good. All this, however, changed on my last trip TAS-DEL on 26 October 2016. After taking my seat in the business class, I plugged my mobile phone's charger into the power socket on the seat panel. When charging was completed, I pulled out my charger, but, along with it, the plastic front of the socket too came off. One of the stewardesses straightaway told me that I damaged it because it cannot come off on its own, and that I was not careful. This behavior of a stewardess amazed me.   This apart, it is unusual that business class passengers would be told something like this. I checked the Uzbekistan Airways web page for a feedback page, but, there was none. They have phone numbers, but no email address for contacting them. No web page like Contact us. As far as I am concerned, they lost me as a passenger.",Business,4.0,nan

This was a night flight of 7.5 hours and we wanted to sleep but it was not to be! This was an ancient plane whose business class seats reclined only a few degrees, it was 2x2 seating, did not taste the food as wanted to sleep. Tablets with pre loaded entertainment was offered. I don't understand why such ancient planes are used on such a route, they have Boeing 787 but these are not thought to be worthy of this route. The washrooms were sparsely equipped.

The check in at Tashkent is a dedicated business class area and security clearance. The flight was on schedule. The aircraft was clean with comfortable seats with reasonable recline. The best IFE was the flying map! The wash room was sparsely equipped, with only Air freshener. The food was average. FA spoke reasonably good English.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

I asked the check-in desk staff about buying an upgrade to business class - they claimed that cannot be done, told me I’d need to buy a whole new ticket. The staff is so incompetent the company actually loses money. Trying to get assistance any from either Air Baltic or Uzbekistan Air both tell you to call the other and claim they cannot help. This is my first and last time choosing Uzbekistan Airways, I blame myself for believing some of these Eastern country airlines would compare to the western airlines. There was no power / USB outlet, no personal tv, and they give you about 6-8oz of water for the 8 hour flight. You have to harass the staff to get more tiny glasses of water.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

I travel frequently between Singapore and KL, and I can say that it was my worst flight experience on this route. The boarding process was chaotic, I queued for at least 15 mins before boarding. The seat was very cramped and the cabin crew were unfriendly. The cabin was very stuffy before the takeoff. During the flight, there was no refreshment at all, apart from the welcome drink which was served before takeoff. There were PTVs available at every seat but it took me ages even to switch the language to English. I'm very disappointed at this airline, I paid SGD141 for this one way ticket (which is three times the price for AirAsia) and get this kind of horrible service. I will avoid this airline at all times.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I experienced Frankfurt-Tashkent-Frankfurt Tashkent-Chiva-Tashkent and Tashkent-Bukhara- Tashkent. Airplanes on international flights are mainly Boeings 757 quite new ones national manly Tupolevs 155M probably from 80´s. Space in planes is comparable to any other airlines service is quite pure. Local people do not look for right seats very carefully so the staff ask you to sit anywhere at the end of boarding. You also have to know that there are two separate buildings at the airport – national and international. The business lounge at Tashkent airport has improved a lot – if you travel in business or with gold cards look for business check-in counter which is located in the corridor next to main hall.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Took two flights with this outfit a return TAS-ALA-TAS. The outbound flight went well booked it online via Opodo and was given an E-ticket. The aircraft was a Boeing 757. The return was a different matter and it all went wrong from here! I was not able to get the return flight I wanted but was advised to go to the airport in Almaty before the flight as they usually hold a couple of seats for every plane. My girlfriend is Russian and spoke to the staff on our behalf. We were informed that we could have two seats - but we would have to pay a bribe on top on the standard seat charges! I took exception at first but then worked out that it would be cheaper than paying an additional day for accommodation. However it then transpired that the staff were in-fact refusing seats to another couple telling them that check-in had closed for them when in reality there was 30 minutes left for check-in. Clearly they were being denied boarding so that the airline staff could collect my bribe! I felt terrible but did not have to cancel my deal with the staff as the couple being denied boarding work out that they would need to bribe the staff too! They did so and where allowed to proceed to check-in my girlfriend was then told the seats were not available after-all! She also informed me that they ground staff were really very rude indeed to this couple having threatened them with “trouble” if they complained about the flight being closed early! We went to a travel agent and book a normal ticket on a later flight without any bribes! That flight to Tashkent was then not on a nice 757 but on a Russian Tupolev 155 aircraft. While it is quite special in a way to have the full Soviet Union flying experience it is not comfortable quite or smooth! With no turbulence this thing rockets up and down like a fighter jet; the noise is such that you may as well be sitting on the wing! While we took off on-time we were met with fog in Tashkent and diverted to Sarmankand only landing in Tashkent some hours late. As such I missed my Aeroflot connection to Moscow and spent hours killing time in the airport. The funny thing was the only bar in the departure lounge does not take the national currency – just Russian Rubles and dollars! The cherry on the cake was again the ground staff coming back for bribes! I was well overweight for my Moscow connecting Aeroflot flight but $50.00 was exchanged and the matter resolved! In London the extra weight had cost me $300 which Aeroflot lost on my return thanks to the Uzbek business culture. Corruption has two sides it can be very disruptive and also very convenient but on the whole I can do without it in future.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,TAS-FRA surprisingly was on time. Old A-310 was put for this flight with old seats and poor entertainment. Entertainment always a lack of Uzbekistan Service.

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Tashkent-Urgench-Tashkent. Staff try to get your money for everything even if most of them knows me personally after 5 years of same destination - extra baggage better seat etc. When you want to reserve a seat mostly you'll get a negative answer first. They will tell you that flight is full. What they do is reserve some seats for artificial names. That way the flight seems full when you attempt a reservation. If you pay an under-the-counter fee she will change the name on the reservation on your name and you got your seat. Same during check-in : they will ask you to put your hand bag/computer/whatever on to the scale. If you are somehow +20 they will start to make faces and convince you that it will be too expensive if you pay official fee. They will ask you to pay half of the money that you'll pay officially directly to check in staff. I don't do that now as the official fee is also is not that much. I simply ask them to write the extra weight which I check each time and go to pay to the counter. The officer in the counter is also surprised as this is not very common. If you'll ask for a specific seat they will make you understand that it is available against a small tip (2-3 USD). Don't as usually no one sits in accordance with the assigned seats and it is almost impossible to convince the person who have sit to your place to move. In the past you might also tip (20-50 USD) in the cabin and ask for a Business Class seat but I do not know if this is still possible.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I have flown Uzbek air extensively including international regional and domestic flights. They are not a great airline by world standards but are great by regional standards. That said if you want to fly to Uzbekistan or fly within Uzbekistan you probably won’t have much of a choice but to fly Uzbek Air. If Uzbekistan is not a destination then they are probably overpriced for the service and I would use another carrier unless your schedule requires a transit though Tashkent. For international I would give them a 3 star overall and a 2 star for domestic flights.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,ATH-TAS return. Both flights on time. The personnel were friendly enough and eager to help you. The food was good only food presentation and trays were standard. There were two servings of drinks on each flight. The only complaint - inflight entertainment system was outdated (overhead screens with two outdated movies and some channels with music). The planes were old but clean. Overall a good experience with no troubles.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LHR-TAS. My experience with this airline has been OK. They seem to keep to the flight times reasonably well at least out of Tashkent. There are some problems with the cabin crew - using mobile phones during take off being one example. A real issue I have with them is the chaotic check in at LHR. The last two times at LHR the queue has filled one end of terminal 2 and takes 2-3 hours to get through. The flight is typically delayed by an hour because of this.,nan,nan,nan

Old style reclining sprung seats in 767 - reasonable room but not lie flat. No power at seat so laptop ran out of battery which is a shame because in flight entertainment is a couple of poor films on overhead screen. Flight staff excellent even encouraging a visit to Uzbekhistan and showing the best tourist sites. Plenty of food and drinks on tap. Everything to time. Rather bizarrely the only delay was at Terminal Four when had to wait on the air-bridge for 30 minutes until someone opened the door!

Seemed to be patched up on the outside no one seems to acknowledge seat allocation and I think I caused an onboard fight by making this woman move from my seat who yelled at me and then the woman in her seat who took it out on the person in her seat and so on. But they did move. Wasn't that cheap considering the plane we were in. Couldn't relax until we arrived. Had some peanuts and flavoured water served to us. Seats folded down forwards when we got off the plane. Security guards in the baggage collection area checking our tickets when we collected our bags.

They do an excellent job friendly and quite service minded despite the dated equipment. Lahore - Tashkent food is - well that is the question. Supposedly chicken but it could have been anything. Tea was served in a plastic cup with broken ear. But with a smile. Some sort of business-class package given with slippers and sleeping mask. Tashkent - Frankfurt service fine only overhead IFE. I managed to fold down my chair to almost lie-flat - before realising it was because it was broken. My fellow passenger behind me protested with a moan (I would have been louder actually). Planes are old. They were nice 18 years ago when UA started their service. Nowadays it's not so good. But they get the job done.

However if you book your flight outside of Uzbekistan the flight prices are ridiculous. I regularly fly LHR-TAS-LHR. If I have my ticket booked in Tashkent it costs approx $350 return - if booked in London costs me about £550 from the airline. I take great issue with the check in at Heathrow. There are 3 check in desks to check in about 300 people. Many of those 300 speak little or no English which makes the process more prolonged and agonising. There is a screen that says ""Tashkent- Business class check in"". This isn't used for Business class only and even those paying a premium price can expect to wait up to 2 hours to check in. Boarding is as expected - everyone pushes but my experience has been that everyone sits in their allocated seats. Inflight entertainment is poor seats are comfortable and cleanliness is acceptable.

After wasting the day at the airport turned up at my hotel again and eventually found the city office for the airline on Tuesday - an obscure office tucked away in a dark and dingy building. They photocopied my ticket and said it would be sent to Tashkent for ""investigation."" How much of an investigation is there for a ticket printed for a flight that does not exist? Phoned them back yesterday (Friday) as they had not called me back as promised! I can indeed fly - but for a fee of 25 Euro! In their view it was my error not to turn up to their office on Monday given that I arrived ""late"" on the Tuesday. I had not contacted them ""immediately"". Never mind that nobody was at their airport desk and that airport information tried hard to reach them. Worse the flight that I should have been on - has my ticket been printed correctly- has been cancelled anyway. So either way I would have been inconvenienced!

Some people confirmed such unscheduled stopovers were quite commonplace. I was not impressed. Inflight service is pretty bad. So bad that when you call the stewardess they do not turn up. Even when they turn up they are so unhappy to be serving you so rude it is quite unbelievable. I did not eat the food that was served so can not comment on that.

We also took smaller flights inside of Uzbekistan and they all left on time were clean the stewardesses were friendly and overall the experience was very good.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,LHR-TAS-LHR seat 3J (a window seat) in both directions. A good experience all-round and with a Business Class fare at a little over a thousand Pounds excellent value for money. My flight was operated by HY's latest 767s which come with comfy seats AVOD iPads loaded with films and games attentive service and excellent food. The cabin is decorated tastefully with a blue and cream theme. The eastbound flight is an overnight operation so I slept most of the way. The seats recline but do not go fully flat not even to angled lie-flat. Nevertheless they are comfortable enough and I achieved about six hours sleep so on arrival I was ready to dive straight in to activities on the ground. Breakfast was a choice of sushi and antipasti which were both of high quality. The westbound flight was operated in daylight hours and I enjoyed it a great deal. The stewardess was extremely attentive and the food including traditional Uzbek plov was excellent. Note that seats in row 1 do not offer stowage for slippers glasses books and so on whilst rows 2 and 3 do. Also note that the airline does not provide a toothbrush kit or other amenities so be sure to pick these up from the Skyteam lounge at LHR T4 ahead of departure.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,3.0,Tashkent-Urgench September 2014. Very positive experience especially compared to experience on long haul services. Plane almost new with great legroom; departure on time; pleasant crew. This route probably prioritised to impress tourists but hopefully the airline will upgrade the rest of its fleet to the same standard and ensure all staff this well trained and pleasant to passengers. This means I could recommend HY for domestic services which use new Airbus aircraft.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,LHR-TAS-LHR September 2014. Step back in time with Uzbekistan Airways. Plus points - on-time in both directions reasonable ground experience felt safe some staff efficient and multilingual and completes London-Tashkent in half the time of the alternatives e.g. Aeroflot. Negative points - old 757 in both directions with fairly uncomfortable seats and limited legroom highly limited entertainment on small drop-down screens (e.g.dated film dubbed into Russian) and juddering audio channels food in generous quantities but mediocre tepid and tasteless tea some cabin crew rude and sighed heavily at minor requests from passengers or barked one word instructions random/unfair means of allocating front row seats once on board. One highlight is the bizarre video (played three times to cover Uzbek Russian and English) illustrating that passengers are prohibited from drinking duty free spirits fighting smoking playing with safety equipment or stealing airline property! In summary the airline does OK given their ageing fleet and the country's limited exposure to non-CIS countries. I would not actively choose this airline - especially for any connecting route on to India/Korea - but it was an acceptable means of getting to and from Tashkent.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,This airline is what most people say: it takes you from A to B. Don't expect anything more. I traveled from SHJ to TAS first class as there was no available seat in economy. Seats are old fashioned not flatbed but comfortable. Flight was 3.5 hours. Food was good and service was also good. Return was TAS to DXB economy. Seats were good typical for economy. Ticket is expensive (around 1100 US$ economy return) considering fight duration but I guess because it is the only airliner which operates direct flight from UAE to Uzbekistan.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,I travelled from New Delhi to London via Tashkent on 23 Aug 2013. An untrained person was issuing boarding passes on check-in counter at IGIA taking ages for a routine task and asking his colleague for each and everything he was supposed to do. Flight from New Delhi to Tashkent (HY 422) was satisfactory. Extremely slow (waited for almost 2 hours in queue) check-in at Tashkent Airport. Check-in staff were talking on mobile phone while people were waiting in queue. In flight from Tashkent to LHR (HY 201 duration 8 hours) no vegetarian food was available. Food quality was very bad. Only cola and water was served in the second food serving. No TV no juice. Crew members don't say sorry or thank you.,nan,4.0,nan
