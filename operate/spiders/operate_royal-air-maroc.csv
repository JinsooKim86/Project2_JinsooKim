Again, desk agents were incredibly rude, ignoring people begging for help. I am 300+ pounds out of pocket paying for their mistakes. They refuse to get in touch with me via email or any other means.

Once we were all checked in we went to the gate only to be told that there would be a 30 minute delay. This 30 minute delay turned into 90 minutes, with the airline finally cancelling the flight. The transportation from the airport to the hotel was a shamble.  So people like us opted just to take a cab to the suggested hotel. Once there we discover after waiting for an hour that they did not have enough rooms for everyone. So we took a second cab to the next suggested hotel. We got a room there. The following day evening was picked up by coach and we were told that our flight would be at 6pm. Again, all checked in, went to the gate and they repeated the same as the night before, cancelled our flight. Why bring everyone to the airport only to cancel their flight again. Everyone was clearly and justifiably annoyed. They had hardly any staff and no sense of direction. When asked if we would be refunded our money if we book with another airline we could not get a clear answer from them. The second nights hotel was awful, some nasty place in town. We still have no idea if we will be flying today or not. This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. RAM does not have a office, a desk or even any representatives in Rio. So if you get stuck then you are pretty much on your own. Also, there website for handling claims is an absolute joke. If we pay for our own tickets back to London it will cost £1200 each with no guarantee of us ever seeing a penny of that again. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

When we finally arrived in Marrakesh around midnight, we were waiting for our luggage to arrive. Unfortunately it didn't, meaning another one hour wait at the lost and found desk with several other passengers. That means we had to book a hotel and try to collect our luggage and car the next day. This didn't work either, no traces of our luggage until someone in Germany helped us, by calling several airports (luggage was then found in Paris).

The problem - there was simply no plane available to bring us to our destination although it was a normal scheduled flight.

Then on the way back we checked in one bag and yes they lost that one too. For our boarding on the way back they called for general boarding and everyone hoarded around the door in one big general mass. So then they decided to let families on board first - it was chaos because everyone was already jammed together. People were trying to squeeze through babies being squashed children crying. One couple complained profusely that it doesn't make any sense to call for general boarding and then limit it to only families.

This meant we had 10 minutes to get to the departure gate for boarding meaning we could not even stop to get refreshments before our flight. When we connected in Casablanca we boarded the plane and were left sitting on the runway in sweltering heat for over an hour without any explanation from cabin crew. On the return flight to England we arrived at Agadir airport at 3.50am to catch a flight to Casablanca at 6.30am where we would connect for London Gatwick. On arrival at the airport we realised that our flight was not on the departures board. We sat and waited for over an hour in a deserted airport with no members of staff or representatives to be seen. When finally a RAM representative did appear he simply shrugged his shoulders and told us that the flight had been cancelled giving us no explanation or apology for this having happened. We tried to patiently negotiate another route but the representative was utterly nonchalant and uncaring about the inconvenience. He worked out a route for us to catch a flight at 9.30am to Casablanca from which we could then connect at 1.40pm to London Heathrow. Although we explained that we had initially booked to go to Gatwick again he simply shrugged and told us that this was our only option and ""take it or leave it"".

No apology made and still negotiating with them regarding payment for the taxi to the original airport. Complete lack of customer care - the representatives appear to deliberately absent themselves so that they do not have to deal with queries and shoulder shrugging seems to be their preferred response.

Both flights on-time planes were fine food good - for economy class food it was better than some airlines I have previously flown including Qantas and Icelandair. We had no problems with service. Our only problem was the stopover in Casablanca on the outward flight as the transit lounge facilities are very poor insufficient seating and availability of food and drink was very limited. There are improvements being made at present but in the meantime we would avoid the route via Casablanca and book direct flights both ways. The staff were are all time polite and available.

We were then trapped in the duty free airport zone no rep in sight most of the time people at the customer service desk (no English poor French) RAM staff treated us like dirt arrogantly refusing to give information.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"Awful airline and only getting worse. Due to budget cuts flights are often cancelled at the last minute and passengers are rerouted from direct flights to itineraries that consist of up to 3 extra flights. The airline will list several flights available but then combine all the passengers for that day on one flight. This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase. The suitcase had a huge yellow tag on it that said ""RUSH"" and yet it was 8 hours after it had arrived and no one could confirm it was in Casablance.

I usually fly Economy LHR to CMN but as I have had a problem with my legs recently I have switched to Business class. In both classes RAM has been totally satisfactory. I have never had a flight cancelled or changed before the day of departure I have only once had a more-than 3 hr delay and in this case cans of drinks were immediately provided and 40 mins later all passengers were taken to a restaurant in the airport. Cabin staff with the odd exception are friendly and helpful especially when they realise I speak some Arabic. The air miles programme is extremely generous. The planes are modern and clean. Even the older planes which I occasionally take on internal flights are satisfactory. One time my baggage went on to Marrakech and was not offloaded at Casa. It arrived back at Casa at 7am the next morning and I was given 300 dirhams compensation for the taxi to and from the airport. This was several years ago and I imagine the compensation will have increased to cater for higher taxi fares.,nan,4.0,nan

They offered no solution other than a flight 8 days later else I should send a complaint to their email address.

I was flying from London-Tangier and one man decided to smoke in the toilets the staff took this as a serious problem and treated him fairly and when we landed in Tangier he was arrested it's good to see action taken. They served lunch which I always love I had the chicken with rice and potatoes very tasty.

I knew this ahead of time the Delta flight was a morning flight and the Royal Air Maroc flight was at 6:32 PM. Once it was time to board the line was ridiculous. Once on board the Boeing 767 I sat down and the seats were comfortable and reclined reasonably far. About 1hr into the flight they served dinner. There was a menu and all the meals were hot.

Upon take off 3 or 4 overhead bins popped open. The passengers around me kept looking for an attendant to rush to assist since no one seemed to notice we were all scared luggage would fall on us. The attendants weren't rude just indifferent. While the aisles filled with trash and the bathrooms became filthy during the 8 hour flights the attendants did each others make up and played with their phones. Little to no leg room. The technology was laughable. Old TV's spaced too far apart and the picture quality was laughable.

It appeared around that time the flight was cancelled and that another plane might take us. We had been waiting for hours without any form of information.

Royal Air Maroc staff were overall dismissive and generally begrudgingly helpful except for the fellow who got us to our bus: he worked hard against all odds to get us to Marrakech. Worse to come on return - Marrakech to Casablanca flight sort of left on time but again delayed in Casablanca for 1.5 hours with no help from RAM staff other than to be coldly told to 'go sit and wait for 45 minutes. 1.5 hours later we departed.

If you are lucky you will get an upgraded aircraft with nice seats and seatback screens. The older cabins are well worn may not have a movie seats are soiled and can have an order. Since the planes are usually full expect the toilets to be a mess after a few hours. Plane departs and arrives on time unless JFK is having problems. When boarding try to get to the head of the line. I usually don't care since everyone gets on board but many Moroccan travelers have a lot of carry on and the compartments fill up fast. No baggage fee for two bags but 50 lb limit each is enforced. Overage is costly. Food is fine and plentiful but I have lived overseas a long time and not fussy. If you are picky carry something on. Casablanca: terminal is fine. Arrival is easy. Departure check in 90 min early because delay at counter with people re-packing bags because of weight and of all the check points. Airport police and immigration officials are efficient and rarely discourteous. Go to gate area and relax. There is a restaurant. If you keep your expectations low you will be fine.

We were first to check in as we were unable to do online check-in in Montreal - no big deal if no one could then I was happy we were all in the same boat. Our agent was fantastic and have us options as the flight was basically empty but wanted to ensure my friend and I (both 6ft) would have ample leg room for the 6hr flight. Boarding was efficient and our ticketing agent was doing the boarding procedures at the gate. As we boarded the plane I was horrified to find no head rest entertainment system - but I was prepared with a charged tablet and phone. Needless to say our flight was a 2200 - I did plan to sleep a bit. Little disappointed the seats didn't recline - but again it wasn't just mine it was everyone and took comfort in knowing that those without the exit row weren't going to have their knees crushed by the person in front of them. The meal was better than any bought sandwich I've had on Air Canada would say for economy class this was above standard. The attendant told me I could take a row of seats to myself. Woke up a few hours later with an hour and a half till touch down changed my seat so I could look out of the window. A female flight attendant came by and said if I wanted breakfast I would have to go back to my original seat and then disappeared. The original steward who showed us the empty section told me he couldn't stop me from going to the back of the plane with my breakfast handed me my tray in the galley and promptly asked if I w anted coffee with a smile. Breakfast was bland pastries and juice and applesauce.

Dirty seats carpets galley and toilets. The galley area is trashed after the first meal and the crew treats it like their clubhouse.

I had ordered a vegetarian meal and on the outbound flight it was inedible. The food on the return flight wasn't very good but at least was edible. Drinks were supplied and wine was also on offer. As the flight is only 3h15m I see the food as an added bonus rather than a deal breaker especially as the alternative is to with EasyJet or Ryanair who don't supply any free food or drinks.

No changes in flight hours where shown. When arriving in Brussels airport, 3 hours in advance, they only could check us in for the flight to Casablanca. The personel of RAM told us this was normal procedure and once we would arrive in Casablanca, we would receive our next boarding pass for the plane to Nairobi. Once arrived in Casablanca (on time, still had more than an hour to get on the other plane), the personel of RAM showed us where to obtain our other boarding passes. At this desk they suddenly told us 'that plane left more than an hour early!'. So, as our first plane was landing, the other one was already taking off! Nobody notified us, not online, no e-mail, message. We were speechless and desperate. Together with an American couple (who also booked a direct ticket from Brussels to Nairobi), the personel told us it was no problem, they would refund our flight and that we would have to take the next flight, 2 days later! This was not an option for us, because we already booked a safari with driver and airport pick up, all planned from the moment we would arrive in Nairobi. After 3 hours, they told us to come fast, because there was a flight to Cameroon we should be on. Then, from Cameroon, we would have to take a flight to Nairobi. Instead of arriving at 2am, we would arrive at 8 pm (losing an entire day of safari and hotel, but still less worse than losing 2). They told us it was safe to transfer at Douala. Once arrived in Douala (after a night flight with stopover in Yaoundé), at 4am, the border control would not let us enter (because we had no ticket and visa), they called the police, who took our pasports and we had to sleep outside the police departement at the airport! At 8am the office of Kenya Airways opened (where we had to check in for the flight). But RAM had put us 2 on wrong seats! The others could board, but not the two of us. After 2 hoffiric hours their personel managed to get us on a flight to Nairobi. Late in the evening we arrived in Nairobi, lost the money of our hotel, lost the money of our safari. The return flight from Nairobi to Paris was a disaster as well! In Nairobi, the personel told us we would have to take our luggage in Casablanca (since we were booked to spend one day at a hotel in Casablanca). In Casablance they told us they could not obtain our luggage. We had no spare clothes, toothbrush, shampoo. Next day, arriving in Paris, one of our bags was missing.

All others were already allocated to other passengers before the web check-in even opened. My wife and I could not sit together. I called Royal Air Maroc but they confirmed this was not possible to be allocated a seat before the web check-in. Sure. At the airport check-in counter, I asked to sit together. The staff member asked her colleague to release seats with an ""R"" for us. Her reply: no. At the gate, we asked it again and promptly Royal Air Maroc gave us seats next to each other. On board the 737 we noticed about 20-30 seats empty. Very strange. We asked ourselves if there is any link between the departments of reservation and operation. The flight went well and the service was good. Amadeus informed us in time that our return flight would depart 1 hour earlier, due to the temporary Ramadan time zone shift. Royal Air Maroc did sent an email message, when we were in mid-flight. The flight was on time, the service was good and the meals tasted nice. Conclusion: in the last 60 years, Royal Air Maroc has learned to fly aircrafts very well.

Always London - Abidjan - London and always with a stopover in Casablanca. They are consistently the keenest pricing on this route and with RAM each time you make a booking it is like rolling the dice. The experience on the European facing routes is consistently good and the aircraft modern. On the African side the experience tends to be less good but still OK. Where the element of chance comes in is that if anything goes wrong with your connection in Casablanca then these guys just melt away - like snow in the Sahara - and you will be left without information, help, or any sense that there is any coherent policy for sorting things out. I had one horrendous experience when Heathrow was fogbound and the lack of information meant that when the flight eventually too off it did so without about 20 passengers. To their credit they did eventually get us to Heathrow later the same day to be reunited with our luggage which had gone on without us.

Missed corresponding flight in Casablanca. Only 3 people to help hundreds of stranded passengers to check for other flights or solutions. One person available to help for accomodation (a basic right when stranded for the night) for hundreds of passengers. This person is then clearly stalling the whole time and telling people: ""All of the hotels nearby are full. It's not worth it to book a hotel in town if you have a flight in 7 hours, etc"". Finally we give up. We stay the night in a cold airport. Next morning: finally the connecting flight.

Finally,  when checking in for the flight back home we were told that our booking for the flight got automatically cancelled because there were problems with one or more previous flights. Nobody at the airport to help us, so we had to call the helpdesk and try and explain this whole thing. Told on the phone that somebody would call back with a solution. When they finally called back after more than an hour, ensuring us that we could now get on the plane, we were told in the airport that it was too late: boarding had closed.

I recommend you take a bottle of water each yourself, but that's a recommendation I would make for any long flight. The amazing part about RAM is that changing the flight generally costs only around 60 euros or so and they don't keep changing their prices. So, if you want a flight that's flexible, go with Royal Air Maroc. We ended up changing our flights twice! Comfort level etc. is okay on the flight, not great but you get the value for your money. Casablanca airport isn't great so try not to choose Royal Air Maroc if you have 12+ hours of stop there (we didn't, and I wouldn't wish that for anybody).",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

We were greeted by a friendly, smiling staff (somewhat less in Casablanca). The aircraft (Boeing 787-8 is new) was very clean and provided a perfect entertainment service, and I, 1m 85, had plenty of space for the legs. The meal with wine (bottle and not in a plastic glass) was hot and tasty. Our flight to go was more enjoyable. As regards to the return, it is regrettable that RAM does not take into account the link between two passengers. It sells tickets and seats in alphabetical order, so that people do not sit together. In our case, on return, this gave rise to a situation where travellers already on board began to negotiate with other passengers of the changes of places to be seated together. There were people who marched in the aisles to their new seats at cross-purpose of those who where boarding with their carry-on baggage. General confusion! I sincerely hope that RAM will solve this problem. Whatever the case, I strongly recommend Royal Air Maroc, a company that seems to be greatly improved.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 787,Economy Class,2.0,October 2015,2.0,3.0,3.0,no,Casablanca to JFK,4.0,"Absolute Nightmare. the Royal Air Maroc flight from JFK to Casablanca was OK. Flight from Casablanca to JFK was supposed to be at 2:55 pm Saturday. A morning check of website and email showed that flight was cancelled and we were rebooked for a flight at 12:30 am. Sunday. Shortly later received an email that it was rescheduled for 4:00 .m. No further emails and website still showed 12:30 am. Got to airport for 4:00 am. flight and found out that it had been rescheduled for 7:00 am. Luckily our tour guide was still with us and he got them to give us a hotel room for a few hours. Boarded on time but then sat in the plane for an hour waiting for every connecting flight to arrive in Casablanca. Then 20 minutes more while they found and removed the luggage of two people who did not arrive (no complaint about that - welcome safety measure). Finally left at 8:20 am. 17+ hours late. During the whole time on the ground and for the first hour or so of the flight there were 5 or 6 children screaming constantly at the top of their lungs. The parents apparently didn't feel any need to try to quiet them. The screaming combined with the nice Moroccan music played while on the ground it made it impossible to read, sleep, or listen to an audiobook. To top it off, US Customs forms were only provided in French so returning US citizens who couldn't read French had to find another passenger who could translate the form for them. In general, this airline is not up to the standards of other airlines. Boarding is just rushing to get near the front of the scrum so as not to be last to board. At JFK this got you onto the jetway but in Casablanca you then had to carry your heavy carry-on down a long flight of stairs, board a bus, and then carry the heavy carry-on up the shaky stairs to the plane (probably an airport not airline issue). JFK to Casablanca, flight attendants did nothing to ensure efficient use of overheads. No announcement about a 45 minute gate hold at JFK. Announcement in Casablanca that plane was being held for connecting passengers was not made right away. Food was skimpy. Nothing on tray to drink. Served coffee and tea after a while but water wasn't brought until after food was eaten. They didn't come around with water during flight but if you knew about it you could go back to the galley and help yourself to water. No beverage service on Casablanca to JFK flight until just before arrival after the dinner trays were given out. By the way, don't buy water at the Casablanca airport to take on the plane. They have security people at the gate go through your luggage to take it away or force you to drink the whole thing right there. There are three security checks: one to get into the airport, one to get into the passenger only gate section, and one at the gate. Don't get rid of your water until the last one. We got rid of the water that we had with us at the second security check then paid $3 for a 50 cent bottle of water to take on the plane but had to give it up or drink it up at the last security check. I had to drink the whole thing there in order to have the empty bottle.

On the shorter flight food was a bit better but still poorly presented. Staff was a lot more professional. My ticket was not cheap at all.

Food and beverage selection was ok considering that only breakfast was served with nothing being offered on the Accra to Monrovia route. The fun started on arrival in Monrovia as one suitcase was missing. The necessary lost luggage form was filled in and submitted. After a week's interaction with RAM Monrovia office, the lost suitcase has neither been traced, found or delivered. A RAM employee confirmed that because RAM flights are very full, not all check-in luggage is loaded onto the aircraft which leads to inevitable delays and great frustration at the destination. In fact, the city office of Royal Air Maroc in Monrovia has turned into a heap of lost luggage and irate passengers have to daily go and search for their own luggage as RAM never returns any calls not appears to follow up on any enquiries. This is really shameful and my advice would be to avoid flying Royal Air Maroc at all costs. ",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 767-300,Economy Class,4.0,September 2016,5.0,3.0,3.0,yes,GIG to LGW via CMN,5.0," |  Rio de Janeiro to London Gatwick via Casablanca. Had a really good experience flying to/from Brazil for the Paralympic Games on Royal Air Maroc. The Boeing 737-800's used on the legs between LGW and CMN are very clean and modern, incorporating the Boeing sky interior. Boeing 767-300's on the long haul sectors are showing their age but still very comfortable for a 9 hour journey. All aircraft had extremely generous legroom and the food on board was of a high standard, including alcoholic drinks. The cabin crews were all very professional and courteous. The only slight complaint onboard was that the IFE system on the B767's was rather temperamental and prone to resetting quite often, which made it impossible to watch movies. RAM accommodate transit passengers free of charge in a central Casablanca hotel if you have a long layover, which is fine and a nice touch, but can end up being rather fraught and stressful by the time you have travelled to/from the hotel and had to deal with the nightmare of negotiating the semi-organised chaos at CMN airport. Overall though, my impressions were positive and would certainly travel with RAM again.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,5.0,November 2016,4.0,4.0,1.0,yes,TUN to DKR via CMN,4.0," | One-way flight Tunis to Dakar via Casablanca on November 29 on Royal Air Maroc B737-800s. Check-in at Tunis airport was quick and agent gave me window seats all the way to Dakar. Plane boarded with some organization with Business class and families first, then coach class. Not too disorderly so enjoyed that. Flight attendants were great and welcoming. Took off early and 2 1/2 hour flight to Casablanca. Delicious Moroccan chicken dinner was served with 2 drink runs. No sound available so they showed Bugs Bunny cartoons on the screens with no sound - sort-of strange. Why bother showing them at all? Just show the moving map - which they didn't have either. Landed on-time and bussed to the main terminal where the transit security line was insane. Be prepared for these kind of lines in western Africa and for disorder as passengers push and shove to get to the front. Dakar flight boarded with confusion as many carry-on's were too large for the overhead bins. So we were stuck on the jet-bridge as every passengers carry-on was evaluated. On-board it was a crazy free-for-all with people just sitting anywhere they wanted. Then when the passenger assigned to that seat came they either made the person move (as I did to the guy in my seat) to just grabbing an open seat - which then made the passenger in that seat make them move or look around. It was chaos but funny - the flight attendant saw me laughing and joined in - was just crazy. Ended up with a seat next to me open which was really great! Again take-off on time and served a delicious meal. Charlie Chaplin silent film shown which was perfect as again there is no sound on the airplane. And this time they also showed the moving map which was good. Landed on-time and bused to terminal where bags came out last but was just glad to get it. Overall I liked RAM a lot and would fly them again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0

I had a great lunch on board with a choice of beef or chicken as well as a veg option. Staff were good, came to your attention straight away and were kind and spoke good English. With a short stop over in Casablanca Airport I went on board the Boeing 787 and  was amazed, completely different from the Boeing 737 on earlier flight.

The aircraft, service and the food was all very average. Flights left on time, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say. The planes seemed very old. Service was perfunctory and disinterested. Food was poor - real old-school airplane food meals; stale bread, tasteless mains.

The airline provided a snack on the 2h 40m flight but orange juice was the worst I have tasted. The main complaint is a lack of airport safety. Before the domestic flight, the Airport security staff did not check my luggage. They ran my bag through x-ray without me taking out the notebook, camera, 5 small bottles of liquid and a 0.5-liter bottle of water attached to the side of my bag. On the domestic flight, they also have travelers who have already passed clearance on the border with others. Everybody has to go through passport control on arrival.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Boeing 787,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Nice to Washington via Casablanca,3.0," |  Nice to Washington via Casablanca. Flight staff and airport not worthy of Boeing 787. Returning from 3 weeks in France we chose to fly from Nice to Casablanca and on to Washington DC on Royal Air Maroc because the second leg was on the Boeing 787. Boarding in Casablanca was confused, disorganized and perilous. As has become customary for international passengers flying to the U.S. we had a second security check at the gate where we were fully patted down and carry-on inspected. While the males were whisked through by two males, there were no female security guards. All the females had to wait nearly an hour before a female started their pat down and a similar delay until the entire line was cleared. Meanwhile the men and boys did not directly board the plane from our main terminal gate. No! We, and subsequently the women and female children had to descend three flights of dirty ill lit stairs, get on a bus and go to the old original terminal, climb three full flights of stairs to the gate and then board the plane. At check-in I had asked for my pre-ordered wheelchair as I've very limited eyesight (legally blind) and Vertigo and was told a wheelchair was not available. Stairs are a real challenge especially without my wife alongside and dependent on filthy banisters and just my cane. Our aisle seats on Boeing’s newest aircraft were comfortable, the coach class seat pitch was the usual 30” we find on most airlines. We had expected Moroccan style cuisine we experienced on an earlier trip to Morocco, but we received the same food Air Maroc served on the first leg from Nice. The cabin service was erratic and staff not at all customer-friendly. Midway through the flight we found that the rest rooms had no toilet paper, no towels, no Kleenex, and the refuse bin was overflowing. A few minutes later the captain came up the aisle going to the galley so I buttonholed him, described the conditions and stated that the cabin crew were disrespecting a new aircraft. The captain took a peek then stormed off. Shortly two male stewards rushed up with their arms loaded with paper products. They seem satisfied with their mediocrity and deficiencies and there's slim chances of improving. Never again on Air Maroc or a transit stop in Casablanca!",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Same with my return journey. I do not know if I was just lucky person (4 times in one trip) but honestly I say I would chose them million times more over Ryanair.

I thought Royal air Maroc had improved its services but from my recent experience, RAM unfortunately has not. We had about 2 hours delay on outward flight, while RAM on return flight decided to cancel one of its route from Canarias. We were informed of this cancellation while we were already at the airport (so 3 hours before departure) : although we bought a Las Palmas - Casablanca direct flight ticket, we had now to wait for the Tenerife plane to come to Las Palmas. I was with my family : my wife, 6 years old child and a 1 year old baby. While we were waiting our turn, the agent at check in decided to call some identified persons (that were behind us in the queue) to give them priority in registration. These people were persons in transit (their end destination was not Casablanca). After that the agent informed us that the plane was now full and that we had to wait for the day after to fly back home. I tried in vain to get someone from RAM Company to come and find solution. No one came and at the end we had to accept the situation. I think that these practices should be condemned.",Business,1.0,nan

Check in / boarding in Agadir was fine and bag was checked all they way through to Madrid - I had to book business class as I needed a fully changeable ticket, crew seemed nice enough when boarding - but that's about as much as I saw of them. I was surprised that for the fare involved on the Agadir - Casablanca sector there was not even the offer of a glass of water, the curtain to the galley was across the whole time with the smell of food wafting through (crew meals obviously) disappointing service to be honest. The transfer at Casablanca was fine / the crew on the Casablanca - Madrid sector were very pleasant, the cabin lay-out was proper ""first class"" style seating plenty of leg room, magazines offered before take-off with pre-flight water or juice. As the flight was only 1 hour and 15, I was given a meal tray which had a hot beef shawarma with fruit salad and Mango mousse cake. It was delicious to be honest and a hot towel service after. The only thing I found really odd on this sector was there were no announcements made in English at all only French and Arabic (the safety demo was a video in English and Arabic) there were a few USA passengers on board also and we had to ask the crew what the announcements were about which I found odd. On the previous sector Agadir / Casablanca all the announcements were made in French / Arabic / English so I'm unsure as to what they were up to as the majority of passengers on the Casablanca / Madrid were Spanish or English speaking.

Boeing 737-800 /  ATR72,Economy Class,4.0,December 2017,5.0,4.0,nan,yes,Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca,5.0," |  Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca. I must say that this airline is very nice, and I have no hesitations using it in the future. Online service is a bit weird, because it is literally impossible to select your seats properly, the system selects them for you, and there seems to be no logic behind the selection. Moscow to Casablanca (5 hours 30 minutes, on-time) Check-in was a breeze. The flight was operated by a B737-800 with a nice modern interior and mood lighting, and we were randomly assigned emergency exit seats - which has tons of legroom and very comfortable old-fashioned thick seat profile. Pillows and blankets were waiting on every seat - a rare sight! The flight was half-empty, so there was lots of room to spread out for everyone. The staff were polite and quite friendly, but it took them almost an hour and a half to start the service - which is awfully long for a daytime flight. The meals - full trays with salads, desserts, bread and a hot main dish - were delicious, especially the pre-ordered seafood meal, even if the presentation was a bit lacking. They also had complimentary Moroccan wine in small glass bottles, which was very classy, as well as great in taste. Surprisingly, they served one more meal around an hour before landing, which consisted of two large sandwiches for each passenger. This is the first time I felt so full after the economy class flight, and that's a very rare thing nowadays. The plane had no personal entertainment or power ports, so consider bringing your own. Marrakech-Casablanca (40 minutes, on-time). Check-in was very fast once again, but surprisingly not even the airport employee could not change the assigned seats, since she apparently did not have access to the system, and I have been assigned a seat in different row that of my travel companion. The flight on an ATR72 was almost empty, with only 11 passengers, and the ATR72 was the most comfortable plane of its category I ever took. A lot of legroom once again. This flight features zero service, not even drinks, which I found surprising - they could have at least provided water. Not a big deal, considering it's just a short hop. Casablanca airport is not a great place for transit, but not the worst one I've been to (Rome Fiumicino, I'm looking at you). Long lines and a sense of chaos everywhere, but the waiting times were actually very small. Casablanca-Moscow (5 hours 40 minutes). The flight to Moscow was operated by a similar B737-800 and was jam-packed with transit passengers from Nigeria, and the boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganized, with the staff checking almost everyone for explosives right before boarding. Once onboard, I tried to ask a flight attendant for a seat change, but he told us to wait until after take-off. I asked another one, and this time the attendant was extremely nice and helpful, and even arranged for me to reseat in another regular economy row to me more comfortable. Then we switched seats with some fellow passengers, that have also been separated by the weird Royal Air Maroc seat assignment system, and ended up in the bulkhead row. The service was similar to the first flight, but this time they even provided amenity kits - with eye masks and socks, and the quality of the kit itself was better than that of Singapore Airlines, for example.
