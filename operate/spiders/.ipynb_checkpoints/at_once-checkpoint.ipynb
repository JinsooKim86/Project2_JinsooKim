       "'   bad service and attitude all round. my fiasco was when my flight from london was cancelled due to failure of their systems. ba refused to rebook us at the airport instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to milan via madrid a day later. ba are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel food and refreshment costs.  we were stranded at the airport no help to find a hotel zero customer care or empathy. premium prices for a ryanair style service.     flew a now ageing b777 flight ba 0053 to seattle. pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. ok choice of wine  beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded. comfortable seat but its the old bug bear  8 across with over the legs access to the aisle. fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this cant come soon enough  and 8 abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances is it absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system  although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system blurry old screens awful audio take your own noise reducing headphones and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... fas great welcoming and gave good service. but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that having paid for a premium service we then have to pay handsomely again to prereserve our seats up to 105 per seat per journey.  not what i expect from a flag carrier airline. we refuse to pay this extortionate sum  our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. so although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld  we can still reserve our seats for free with them.    london to amsterdam. bas service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years but tonights experience really takes the biscuit. i should now be in amsterdam  however i am still writing this from london despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. we boarded just about on time around 1930 only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. shortly after we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut and no planes were taking off. about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. one more hour in we were told airspace was shut again. after 3 hours good news  or so we thought  we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived so our flight wad cancelled. we taxied back to the gate where we waited a further 1015 minutes for ground staff to become available. i must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good. the crew gave us the inflight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered. this is the full extent of my praise though. little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come. bas ground handling was attrocious. we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. however ba had cancelled around 7 flights and the queues were very lengthy. vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because all the rooms were full. i have never heard anything like it. this is beyond unbelievable. no assistance for children elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers as is the norm in this situation. further the promised rebooking staff had all gone home  i was told to consult the ba app the following morning. bas app has rebooked my flights  two days later when my trip was for three days total. the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken. i guess ill be trying out their call centre in the morning. this is all simply appalling. we all understand that adverse weather happens. but to keep us on a plane for 4 hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. moreover ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to 24hour airports i do not know. and as for the ground handling i have never had an experience this bad. ba staff themselves were thin on the ground  they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we dont work for ba excuse. ive had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely couldnt have handled it better. by contrast i dont see how ba could have handled this worse. they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days save for the good lounges if you fly business.    aberdeen to abu dhabi via london. despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british airways these days and now ive reminded myself why. flight crew dont afford old fashioned courtesy or service. im not saying they are rude just that they dont provide a decent level of customer service. you get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention. they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact. no bags at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with however the way they deal with it is appalling. couldnt care less i feel. 3hr delay on return flights. seems ba is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender.    prague to denver via london. i almost missed my flight because at checkin i had to complete some really important papers that took 40 minutes   later no one asked me for those papers. flight to heathrow was average what you expect from a 2 hour flight. at heathrow the security lasted me  30 minutes. when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it was less than the flight before.  the flight then was pretty much okay the food was delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks the flight staff was kind and helpful. but the plane had no paid wifi no outlets or usb ports the screens were low quality.    seville to gatwick. if it wasnt for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award tickets within europe i would never fly ba given the current product. the cabin was old cramped and dirty. the cabin crew were abrupt and surly. the buyonboard is still a massive bugbear  we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary.     london to amsterdam. a delayed ba flight by 55 mins. old airplane unhelpful staff. delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays. another terrible show from british airways.     london to dubai. good crew everything else terrible. caught up in the shambles of ba it system collapse on 27th may so very lucky to get tickets on flight next day. ba staff hung out to dry by appalling senior management. flight itself next day crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty ife. food ok seat comfy but had seen better days and needed reupholstering. was told luggage would be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of heathrow from the day before luggage finally turned up wednesday  4 days late. compensation claim into ba rather a lot  hopefully all gets paid. ba have had a number of it failures past 12 months simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers emirates on this route for a couple of years until i know ba has resolved its reliability problems and the product offering is more competitive. shame really ba used to stand for something and its now gone to the dogs.    london heathrow to vancouver. i am very disappointed by bas gradual decline. today i flew in the upper deck of the a380. bas business class seats once the best in the industry are almost the worst. the pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. this is an unpleasant aircraft with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. in business class i think thats a poor ratio. the flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly though i noticed no acknowledgement for being a gold card holder but their interest waned as the flight progressed. it took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. the beef was cold as were the vegetables. it was actually inedible. i suspect it had just been left out. after dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and i was never offered another drink. i gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. british airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines i have flown recently. this is a great shame. the cabin is bad the food is awful the flight attendants unpleasant and ife ok. \\r\\r\\n    i took a long daytime flight from tokyo to london about 12 hours. the boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean and the premium economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight with good recline although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space. the catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting lunch was a small portion of very tough beef accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen there was then nothing for nine hours no snacks available anymore until a second hot meal of a small chicken curry was served shortly before landing. a choice of drinks was offered only once shortly after takeoff during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice but nothing else was offered the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else i asked for more water but the crew said they didnt have any. by the time we landed i was hungry and thirsty and i would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. the crew were invisible for most of the flight. the ife system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines. overall not recommended.   british airways were truly awful on this flight from heathrow to miami. very old tired aircraft. these old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit. seat back screens unbelievably small. what shocked me most is just how much ba have cut back on their food service. no bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore. dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option. the chicken breast i received was laughable. i have seen bigger chicken nuggets. this came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. the only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for afternoon tea with a miniscule scone. my advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry. staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley. unfortunately ba have now become a long haul ryanair scrimping on every little thing. not good.   british airways seems to be going from bad to worse. on my london heathrow to lisbon flight the card machine didnt accept american credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldnt pay for his drink. the length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people werent offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing. the flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for ba. return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline. they are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices.    booked gatwick to lima return. out world traveller premium economy which was not too bad. return club world was appalling seats and surround grubby. equipment maintenance poor. service was appalling. staff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wanted. expected us to know how to operate equipment. food thrust at us not served everything rushed. no politeness in service. drink choice not outlined just what do you want. if it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of money. it is so sad that ba is going to the dogs a business is nothing without customers and ba are doing a great job at alienating them. i will not fly ba long haul again.\\r\\r\\n    london to johannesburg. after getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend it fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by ba i approached my flight back to the uk with some trepidation. my fears were not unfounded. as the aircraft had been sitting at jnb for most of the day there were no delays and boarding started very early. i was seat 83a top deck double seat and the leg room was no better than you would find on a ryanair flight to dublin. indeed due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat it was a little more cramped. the service on ba flights really is terrible. i along with many other passengers was treated like an inconvenience and i felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we werent there. i was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due in part to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff. i will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future.    edinburgh to rome via heathrow. i have been either ba gold or silver for many years  the last 2 years i was in texas but ensured my return to uk that flights were always ba and the same for my family who visited. in july 2016 i returned to uk for business and had to stay until jul 12th i was 3 points off retaining get gold if i had flown back on 11 july i would have retained gold. i had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem however i was duly downgraded to silver. i then booked a holiday in rome for my wife and myself and i was amazed that ba have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea  if ba wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine. they have in the past left me stranded in moscow for 5 days when snow closed heathrow yet bmi were still flying into heathrow i have encountered rude staff on check in long queues even for executive members. they are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status i will in future fly brussels airlines and lufthansa or internal uk easyjet. they are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let get poor reviews. if ba wish to be a budget airline then start charging like one    gatwick to antigua. a frequent flyer with ba for over 15 years silver exec club i have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past 18 months  alex cruz take over. my partner and i fly regularly in ecoprem and club depending on prices so have seen the decline across all classes. recent trip to antigua from lgw was awful. a pretty empty cabin filthy isnt the word awful in flight entertainment rockwell that hasnt changed in 10 years easily. food choice is no longer a choice its a meat dish or veg. alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin lgw for both legs so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously. 3 hours into flight there was no spirits left  bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service 1.5 hours in to the flight. ba state in their motto to fly to serve. yes they certainly are flying but most certainly not serving. the cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done. they have cheapened the brand of the national carrier but havent cheapened their prices. easyjet and ryanair offer superior and on long haul its got to the point i will now fly virgin and others again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight. stop trying to make ba budget we want it back to how it used to be all i can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major it glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in british airways.   london city to milan. the price of the ticket about 500 for a 2 hour flight  had no relationship to the ultraeconomy service on this flight. the aircraft was very dirty  i wonder whether ba pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines dont seem to have filthy aircraft. in business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for there is no place to power devices and forget wifi or overhead screens. in business the food was an awful english breakfast. no better than economy. the embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to takeaway to try and make up for the nofrills service. it feels chronic under investment for years has left this a barebones airline milking shortterm profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year.    flown economy premium bostonlondon heathrowgeneva. again as too often with british airways nowadays flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem. as a consequence our connecting flight in lhr was missed had to wait for 5 hours at lhr although there were earlier flights. since our late arrival was known by ba at least 5 hours in advance why didnt they at least prebook our connecting flight from lhr. long queues at rebooking desk very little care of customers. then again flight from lhr left late breakfast on board long haul miserable. service on board short haul now equals those of charter flights. although i have been travelling with ba for 25 years with silver and gold status i will avoid flying with ba again and for sure let know around me that this airline is even not a shadow of what it used to be.    london to boston return in premium economy. another very disappointing flight experience with ba. overall a low cost experience at a premium price. baggage drop in t5 is now self service unless you fly business or first which feels like easyjet. lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited.  the plane was a 23 year old b747 which seemed to be in its original or close to original configuration. the screen in the seat in front of my was the size of my iphone and the choice of movies was very limited. the cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditions. food was not edible i tried the beef option but could not eat it. what i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy. cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at ba. they have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon  polyester material and only one instead of two straps on back. i am taking my business elsewhere and only use ba to spent the avios.    istanbul to london on a reasonably priced airfare. checkin experience was quite good with friendly staff member at istanbul airport who took my portable phone charger from me. departure lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop ban and checking each passengers bag manually. on board was average to say the least in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on british airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink nice products but very overpriced. also there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferent. the seats on the a320 were also quite hard and uncomfortable. the whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route who have wifi on many flights food and drink ife. the experience was more like a low cost carrier. i dont think ill bother to fly them again unless i have to.    london to mumbai. terrible customer service. i have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days and they keep blaming the travel agent even through the ticket was issued by ba after the meltdown on the 27th. if you get through to their india call center you might as welll hang up the phone as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the third party will inturpt you when you are trying to speak just awful service. agree british airways is going downhill. been a silver member for many years need to look for another provider. just awful customer service which ba wont care to look into.    i am a frequent flyer with british airways having held silver membership for years. on this instance i flew bas shorthaul business class. while youre essentially in the same cabin as everyone else you should get a meal onboard something i had counted on and the seat next to you should be left empty. i fly this route around once every other week but have been ba to longhaul destinations hong kong beijing nyc d.c. and san francisco several times a year my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights i have taken this year on the same and other routes. the aircraft came in late which is a common occurrence with ba these days. except for me nobody in business class had an empty seat next to them. we were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered although we might be able to obtain food vouchers once we get to lcy. in short the product was exactly the same as economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket. this was complemented by slow and unfriendly checkin staff an old aircraft and a good hour i had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested ba customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through. on the whole a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that ba is very much going in the wrong direction. they might be cheap but cant and shouldnt compete with lowcost carriers or indeed asian airlines that have lower overhead costs.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    my wife and i were very disappointed with our british airways flights from sydney to london return flying premium economy. the food quality cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as air new zealand and qantas that we have used. there are no toilets allocated for the cabin and are located at the middle of the economy cabin quite a long walk and at times a very long line of other passengers waiting to use them. the seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones. ba dont offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines. we would not fly with ba premium economy again it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by mixed fleet. easy checkin at toronto pearson the ba ground staff are always great in toronto with fast track meant i was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited average wine list. still too few bathrooms the seats are tatty and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. easy boarding and the first of a few improvements  prosecco now served to london. used to be only ex london. fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. an ok chicken curry was served but i still dont see it as biz class food. a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. that is where the improvements ended. the morning offering of a cereal bar and t&cs  juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience. the crew on this flight were great. young junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi but appeared in glass without asking as soon as the crew were released  classy and well remembered the return flight was less good. drinks served promptly after take off and my prebooked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. crew members first flight since qualifying it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray. the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and t&c. customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back really as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate. service reduced  yes price reduced  no the 777s in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp the ife screens are tiny. mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. however the male crew were more aloof lacked attention to detail and officious. what these newer crews miss was the more informal  laid back service of long haul crew  i hope they relax into the role soon at least the cuts have stopped not much left to cut i admit and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened. however the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us  canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world  it really depends on what ba do next  to either value me as a customer and offer a quality service or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline at which point  im off.    i arrived at london heathrow in transit with a british airways flight on to another ba flight. the aircraft was there still boarding my bag was checkedin for my final destination but i wasnt they forgot to check me in for my full journey at departure. they didnt let me board and made me stay overnight. i have never seen such level of stupidity bad management and poor service.   the crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from johannesburg to london were very young unprofessional and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the british airways crews special and outstanding. they were basically on both flights rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service. on both flights there was no water offered during the night which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium. the meals were overcooked and on both flights the knives could not cut through the best of british beef. given that the hot meals are the same than in club according to bas marketing i would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in business class. a perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when i got up after dinner and went to the galley as nobody cared to answer the bell and asked for a baileys the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a baileys was and the answer came sorry sir we dont have that kind of wine. would you like some white i am missing the good old ba and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future even if it means paying a few hundreds more.    flew valencia to london gatwick with british airways. check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay. security was a bit slow no fast track. business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor note this is not a ba lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. boarding was a disaster we were called to board but then waited on the airbridge for over 20 minutes. the airbridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no ac or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out. eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy. there was no communication from the ground staff which although not ba staff reflects badly on the airline. once we were finally onboard the flight was trouble free. good service. hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant. plane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay. priority baggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control. would have been a nice trip back bar the problems in valencia airport.    london heathrow to edinburgh return possibly my last ba flights. i used economy or maybe should be re named economy minus outbound and returned in club europe checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at t5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. security quick im a baoneworld sapphire member so used the north lounge which was okay. flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. a320 seat 11a an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. return check in quick as was security the ba lounge in edi has been the same for a few years now. its at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. club europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. actually it replaced what was ba economy class. a cynical ploy by the ba board to extract more money out of its loyal customers the aircraft was pretty full so some people like ba although i suspect many passengers were transferring at lhr. service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. arrival at t5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. i fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90 on long haul flights. i have supported ba in the past although ive not used them long haul for about 17 months. basically they are not good enough. cut backs and poor service is evident. i expect security comfort and some service when paying 2500 for a business class ticket. qatar cathay and even srilankan offer better service. on reflection i fly business class on most flights so i dont actually need any frequent flyer status. the cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. i might fly ba in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles ive earned. but my loyalty will be my wallet in future. bye ba.    london heathrow to madrid. an absolute third world experience once i got on the plane. checkin and lounge experience were great but once i got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. there were seats with missing backs and do not occupy covers in front and beside them random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead and grimy yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. you have to worry about whats going on the important bits like the engines if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. the crew spent as much time as they could in the galley and interacted with passengers as little as possible. the breakfast service was a saltinfused hot cooked offering and just one run of drinks. anything else you wanted you had to use the call button. the one and only reason i booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing id bought.    flew british airways from corfu to london heathrow. food service a joke. i have never written a review on anything in my life but how can an airline like british airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes unbelievable if the company has become so badly managed how many quangos to come up with this decision that common sense is lost in corporate nonsense. apart from that flight great but sorry ba please admit your mistake and put this right.     heathrow to santorini. we were at the gate when ba cancelled our flight. we could not get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage. it took them 4 days to return it. ba will not reimburse us the cost of the flights at 1200 or the cost of the hotel at 2000. this is a total disgrace. how can they be allowed to do that book with another airline to ensure you actually arrive. never experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money is outrageous.    bangkok to luxembourg via london. premium economy on british airways is disappointing. the bangkok to london route is served by b777 aircraft that look like theyve seen better days. boarding was chaotic on both outward and return flights. seats are old and worn not very wide and with little recline. the ife is poor in terms of choice the screens are the smallest ive ever seen and the sound quality is very bad. the food served is ok. service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline. the short haul flights between london and luxembourg in economy were good. its time for british airways to pull up its socks if it wants to compete with the leading asian middle eastern airlines or even the better european ones.    london heathrow to paris orly. i have been a gold member of ba over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year we have been through ash clouds strikes it breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. i didnt think it could get worse but it did. arrived at the airport and my app said on time screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay. in the first class lounge i was told short delay. knowing how inaccurate ba can be i asked to speak to special services. one hour later i asked again. i got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty take it up with alex cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. unimportant is how i felt after 25 years of gold guest list. she then told me the flight was cancelled and said i would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for charles de gaulle no alternative was offered. i had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg ba for a refund which they tried to sidestep. the moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at ba it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the ceo. the other interesting fact is i did look at choices before booking including easy jet 100 pounds air france 500 pounds and foolishly i felt loyalty meant something. not at this airlin . the salt in the wound is that easyjet and af got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in france. it is incredible that one airline who carrys the british flag is such a disgrace. i am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak. what has happened to ba and we wont fly them again.    flew new york jfk to copenhagen via heathrow. have flown premium economy pe on cathay singapore lufthansa and air france. by far british airways is the worst world traveler plus just means plus  everything else is downhill. seats were cramped recline only a few millimeters food awful sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was served. amenities practically nonexistent and wrapped in cellophane tube of toothpaste if only the cap would open could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth no covers for the headphones. totally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word premium economy. before i forget the boarding service was confusing calling colors gold silver sapphire etc. people just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice screaming for order. why not just call the way you sell  first biz premium economy. trying too hard to be fancy.    flew london to hamburg. i cannot believe that an airline like british airways have to compete with the likes of ryanair and easyjet and stopped complimentary cabin services  no drinks no snacks. they should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines.  i am now cofused why i should ever fly british airways vs low cost airlines. i was recently also flying on club world. my luggage was tagged priority. but waited on arrival for over 30mins  non priority bags came out mixed with priority  british airways policies and operations are clearly confused and its losing its edge as a world reknowned airline.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    british airways charges a big premium for premium economy. i sat on the top floor of the a380 after being upgraded from world traveller at the gate and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from singapore to london heathrow. there were two dinner options chicken tikka or beef fillet but as i dozed off i missed out. so no food until 1 hour before landing 11 hours later unless i wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. i kindly asked for some water got some orange juice too  didnt want to push it even though i saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley  not worth the risk of a bad reaction. i cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge. the staff mean well  however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an singapore airlines qatar cathay etc. its not cultural its just indifference. will continue to book ba for cheap economy productservice offers almost no difference and enjoy upgrades where given.    singapore to london. i have started to take british airways as its a corporate requirement. the business class club world is more like premium economy. the seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window  you are basically trapped inside and youd have to disturb the other passenger to get out. furthermore the bed does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift fold down stool  if you apply too much pressure on that stool it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch  its just flimsy the food is very low quality and tatstes bland  i have already tried the regular meal and special meals  dont bother. the service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers. overall i am very disappointed.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    frankfurt to london heathrow. three bags belonging to self and colleague checked 26 june at frankfurt on the 1720 flight to london 2.5 hrs before flight. flight arrived in london 40 mins late and 1 of 3 bags appeared on carousel a business flight with virtually no checked baggage on it. courteous customer service personnel in baggage hall took details  noted that baggage had not been loaded. promised that bags would be sent on first flight the next day and should be delivered to our office by 12.00 noon. nothing and still waiting for delivery at 1510 three days later. how and why 1 out of 3 delivered and why 48 hours for delivery   british airways business class heathrow to accra as the bbc reported the most delayafflicted route. 85 out of 122  or 70  of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer. as a regular on this route i can verify these unacceptable delays. indeed my flight the delay was as usual over an hour. the club world product is now very tired and worn  no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers. the ba crew were fine but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. usual chaotic boarding process for this flight  the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. it will never work on this routing. when will ba learn the seating in the usual ba format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines  including one world members like qatar american or royal jordanian. the constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service. the comfort is now more akin to ethiopian airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of ba. the lhracclhr route is a money maker for ba  they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth. air france and klm probably offer a better business class service on this route. a great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard.    london heathrow to seattle. i havent even taken this flight yet and i am totally disillusioned. i have flown with british airways 3 times out of manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my long haul connecting flight. on this occasion i have decided to drive down to london heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike i telephoned ba customer service today to ask about the laptop situation after pressing many buttons i was informed all the lines are busy and cut off. i will never book a flight with ba again even if this means i have a long layover or connection time. this airline is a national disgrace and the british flag should be removed from the livery. if i get on the flight i will let you know how it is    on the 13th june 2017 i travelled from mykonos to london heathrow on ba 651. if british airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally. we were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase. all we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits. this flight left around lunchtime and i would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. to add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. if there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. i have today received a telephone call from ba following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. it was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesnt help me. a service which was very good before the cost cutting.  we fly to serve i somehow dont think so anymore. easy jet ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles. i cannot imagine flying with ba again.    i was flying back from zurich to heathrow after a visit to see my son. we arrived in time at the airport. check in was quick and friendly. but once we got through security the trauma of ba began. a 2 hour delay on the screen. why didnt they tell us at checkin yes they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of bas old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet. no welcome. the seats were hard and uncomfortable. before taking off the captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door. the door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty. a strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying when the food service came i was asleep but my said they ignored her. when we did arrive at heathrow t5 we ended up at the c gates so adding another 20 minutes or so. based on this i will no longer pick ba as a preference. the brand once the favourite airline is no longer.     rome to heathrow flight on the 23rd june delayed take off over 6 hours due to technical fault. minimal information and absolutely no customer service or support. no refreshments provided. the only information we received was when the captain came of the aircraft to tell us what was happening he was the only one who cared. ba support and service in rome was non existent. after take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably i had to pay 2.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided. ba is now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus actually thats unfair to budget airlines who provide much better service. ba has lost the plot.    chennai to london. what a mistake i selected this route for a two reasons i wanted to try the new british airways 787 in club class and the timing. but i have nothing good to say about the whole thing. the lounge at chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what i think should be standard in business class there is no direct aisle access for the window seats and if youre in the aisle seat youll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat the layout is quite crazy. the seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how ba have crammed them all in thats the issue. i had the window seat and initially i found it ok but as it was a very long all daytime flight i had to dim the window and thats the point you can only dim them down there is no blind the sun still shines through ok i accept its like looking through very dark sun glasses but its not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. i understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by boeing. it was my second flight on a 787 both were 11 hour plus flights the earlier one i made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. ive not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft i find myself just as tired after a flight as i would be on any other aircraft. im a long term supporter of ba and im so upset that ba are going backwards focusing on profits and ripping off the customer. sorry ba but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money because it wont last people like me will move on.    flew london gatwick to genoa with british airways. fast check in at the smart new premium area at gatwick. brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food drink and magazines access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal i realize that nothing can be done about that. the gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators. on board our club europe seats that we had paid extra to choose something that no other airline that i know of does with a full business class fare was behind the curtain. overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 club europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance. an engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3. my special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. leg room was atrocious for business class and seats are the same as economy. because the curtain could not be drawn the business class toilet was used by economy class passengers and at times business passengers had to queue behind them. given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at genoa airport. in all this was not a business class quality flight we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price.    \\r\\r\\nflew british airways from beijing to london heathrow. the cabin crew did their best but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. cut backs are evident everywhere from the small and very cheap hot towels offered only once during the ten hours flight and the nuts presented in a packet other than with other airlines on china and warm  this might seem a small niggle but it is indication of ba saves costs  by annoying their premium cabin customer. the amenity kits presented in a shoe bag is a joke really. to be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other one world members royal jordanian and qatar for example. flight left and arrived on time  but the airline should be more than that. the offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. was presented at the second meal serice with frozen pawns on bread returned and a defrosted plate came by return. unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea  but no effect as yet. part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight i covered it up with a spare blanket. despite there being enough toilets for club world passengers there was often a line of people waiting from world traveller plus  snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. no control of passengers from world traveller plus coming in to the club world cabin. toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew  twice they were in a bit of state so i ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. lovely. shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels.    london heathrow to barcelona. i thought it would be better than a low cost airline but it is not. in fact it is quite worse so if you have a cheaper option do not hesitate to go with them. the flight is full and they say you can only take on board a backpack to put under your seat but not the bag trolley. rude people and ridiculous rules a company living in the past century.    dubrovnik to gatwick. poor ground service chaotic boarding via airport bus. no greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staff. the shoddy service which has become the ba norm. forced to fly ba by tour operator would other wise have chosen a alternative airline. most food choices for purchase were not available. tea was lukewarm and not pleasant. cabin staff rude and unhelpful a most unpleasant flight.    stockholm to london heathrow. shabby third party lounge in stockholm. very tired 767 aircraft. buy on board service took ages. crew were funny raising an eyebrow at bas new low cost carrier concept in europe with the expensive buy a sandwich onboard. ba are one rung about ryanair and on par with easyjet when it comes to customer service and delivery. such a shame whats happened to them. convenient flight times and lhr departure is as good at it gets im afraid.    london to dubrovnik. interesting that ba have dropped the to fly to serve advert boarding was the usual unorganised shambles. selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads. no less than three couples came on with oversized bags. in one instance it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers. when complaints were made to cabin crew the response was they are entitled to bring hand luggage the trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time. most of the choices were unavailable. cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system.. would strongly recommend taking own food on ba short haul flights.    flew accra to london heathrow. all was going well which in accra means an orderly boarding got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load i assume more loaded than was on the manifest. the takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job. this then took an hour to sort out with cargo being removed  no drinks offered this was business class i reminded myself. once off the flight was the standard british airways club world product. nothing special or memorable but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen. tired business class product old and tired plane i wish ba would at least try and not show the interior is patched together with masking tape and something that looks like grouter that you would use in a bathroom. the crew dont really have much to offer now in terms of product although they were professional if not friendly. must be terrible working for ba now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers. the inflight entertainment is dire  for regular travellers only the addition of one or two new films with the rest of the chose the same month after month. the memento of this night flight has not changed for years  it is surely due a refresh.    london heathrow to stockholm. newish aircraft nice leather seats but very cramped nice leather seats. had emergency exit which was fine but others were very tight. ba is now akin to a low cost carrier in europe. dont expect much and you wont be disappointed. really is no different to flying easyjet these days.    london to zagreb. british airways lost my luggage on the 20th june and here i am on the 30th still trying to get some information. we came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the 21st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we werent providing the correct information. when we asked him what information was incorrect he would not proceed with our call. on the 6th day when we were back at the airport to fly out we were told that the bag was delivered to our temporary address the day before what a mess we were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they would call us when we arrived at heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because there is no such thing as a place to follow up missing luggage if you make a claim you need to just wait for a phone call. i never heard from anyone. we are back home now in australia and i have just called to follow up the bag to which i was advised that the claim has been closed. now i need to wait for the claim to be reopened and wait another 72hrs to get an update. not once have we received a call from anyone our phone bill is over 800aus due to the amount of calls we had to make. i suggest british airways take a good hard look at how you treat your customers who spend a hell of a lot of money to fly with your airline and take in to some consideration how you would feel being on the other side of the world with no luggage for 10 days. absolutely disgraceful.    manchester to philadelphia. i booked my flights through british airways but the flights were american airlines. i booked a gluten free meal both ways using the field in the booking form that ba had provided. when the meals came round i was told that ba had not passed on my dietary requirements and all they could offer me was a small salad half a tomato and some lettuce. when i landed i emailed british airways to complain and ask them to ensure i had a gluten free meal on my return. i received no reply and again there was no food for me on the flight. after countless emails i finally received a message telling me that even though british airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements i should have contacted american airlines to request it. british airways apparently pick and choose which information they send to the carrier airlines. i told them that they shouldnt ask for information that they dont intent to pass on but was met with the same you should have requested it better line. they are truly incompetent at one point they started talking about my child  which i dont have. 010 for customer service.    london to montreal. i have also flown their economy plus montreal to london and business class  londontokyo londonrome return. ba economy is on a par with ryanair. business is okay. economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food. regardless of class of travel the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition. the following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller. i started watching a movie on the flight from montreal to london but the last 15 min of the movie were missing. it looked like the recording consisted of only the first 105 min out of 121 min total of the movie. in the next few days i tried to see the last part of the movie on other two ba flights business and economy plus and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing. in addition to this minor problem all ba flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise once again the same problem applied to all flights.    gatwick to mauritius. very disappointed to see the decline in quality from ba since i last flew with them. for a flight of 11.5 hours to mauritius i was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that ba seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. possibly the least comfortable airline seat ive ever had with every lump and bump imaginable and the infuriating headrest which doesnt stay up slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. the seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. legroom also very poor albeit i am above average height but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. the food was also poor. no snacks offered and the meals were slop. i have flown air nz virgin emirates and ba in the last two years and ba was the poorest in terms of food and comfort. good points the cabin crew were reasonably good toilets were clean and the inflight entertainment worked fine with a good selection but that wasnt enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience.    boston to barcelona via london. i am a silver ba card holder and reserved two flights myself and my wife from boston to london heathrow in premium economy and heathrow to barcelona in economy class. i paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. on check in at boston we were given different seats for the heathrow to barcelona sector than i had reserved in the exit row due to a change of aircraft configuration. although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. in early june i applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number. to date there has been no communication or refund from ba in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. we will not be flying transatlantic with ba in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year. in an article about british airways in the financial times on 2nd june it said that their customers are less and less happy but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy. eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important.    london heathrow to larnaca. british airways was once the flagship airline of the uk you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest. now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches  they even charge for water and if you dont have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they dont take cash. i did not mind paying that bit extra for ba flights but now better off with easyjet.    london to hong kong in premium economy. i have been flying ba on my many trips over the last six years and i have seen such a shocking decline in their services that i feel compelled to write this review. of my six flights this year three were seriously delayed. one was from oslo to london on 9th june when the captain decided to wait  for some business class passengers who hadnt made their way out of the lounge in time for takeoff. my worst experience however was going to hong kong on 30th may when there was a technical fault with the plane. the captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time who then sat on the plane for almost three hours without being offered any water or other refreshments and with little information and apologies before an 11hour flight. i was in premium economy but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort. i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets which meant that i got no rest during the night. how can premium economy seats be next to the toilet the inflight service was poor as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. i am still wondering why anybody would pay for premium economy as it is just a lousy offer seats are only marginally more spacious than in economy but dont recline as they would in economy the food is the same which means rather bad and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. predictably the plane landed in hong kong just in time below three hours delay for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th june but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for premium economy passengers. although this time the flight was on time this gave me such a bad feeling about ba their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. i will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with ba.    belfast to munich via heathrow. today 4th july i found i needed to change a travel date from 7th july to 6th july.  i attempted to do this on bas manage my booking for about 2 hours and although i selected 4 different flight times each time i thought my booking change was completed at an extra cost of 156199  seat costs i was told that my changed flights were fully booked even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available quite a few. so. i contacted bas customer services by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who after saying hello and providing his name promptly lost me. so another 20 minutes later i spoke to another very caring and helpful ba agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost 500 onto my 218 ticket i could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less i am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by ba when all the work is by me and online and ba can resell my friday flight the time i spent going around in circles online to end up with nothing and having to phone customer services and  the time it takes to get though to customer services who clearly are insufficiently staffed overworked and with limited capacity to really help. ba  you are in serious need of a makeover and selfexamination to have customers such as i consider using you again and not tell everyone to avoid you and write reviews such as this.    dubai to london. didnt have high expectations but surprised how bland and uninteresting this journey was. started in an uninspiring visit to the ba lounge with a poor food choice and poky. plane was just about clean but rather poor for business class. the menu was poor and entertainment the worst i have seen. afternoon tea was an afterthought and the forty minute wait for a gate at lhr really summed up the state of ba today. bland uninspiring and lacking the passion to serve. not a patch on qatar airways or emirates and makes you feel quite inadequate as a brit    london heathrow to sofia. flight was on time and ground service was smooth. however our seats were changed due to aircraft configuration change which is normal to happen but no any choice or apology was offered for silver member. no complimentary service onboard provided. crew even had problem with the payment machine. luckily ive got some water and treats from the airport shops. cramped cabins and uncomfortable seats  now ba is just a budget airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other budget airlines\\xa0 ive abandoned my silver status and considering using other airlines. im still using ba as well in cases when the fare is competitive on the route.     new york jfk  london heathrow. the british airways lounge at jfk is truly terrible. it seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds. not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other. i wasnt allowed into the first class lounge despite being a ba gold list member. so much for loyalty. was instructed at check in that this was a sleeper service and i should eat in the lounge. not an advisory but an instruction. the club world food on offer in the lounge for the dining experience was overcooked and of very poor quality. usual cub world service on ba which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle poor food they did offer food poor inflight entertainment putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up ba train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again to serve food and drinks. the crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly. the product and offer from ba is so mediocre i even saw club class passengers taking their own food on for example the other carriers must be laughing as they take over ba in terms of service and quality of aircraft. shameful.    flew last week london to frankfurt. no light refreshments complimentary crew busy operating card terminals etc makes less time to be nice to passengers. then asking what was complimentary informed tap water and it came no ice or offer.  on the return i was given a mid seat asking if there was a free aisle i was told no. waiting till all boarded i sat in a free aisle. the airline continues to pretend to have high standards but it slips further and further into the depths of i will book with ba if no other airlines available.    venice to gatwick. i am done with british airways. it has the worst service and incredibly rude staff. we were supposed to fly back from venice at 11.55 p.m on 10th july. the flight was delayed by an hour and a half. ba policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours. fair enough. however what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport. the only cafe at the vce airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 11.30pm. when i went to buy some water the guy at the counter refused outright.  another lady had been there since 11 am her flight earlier that day was delayed and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher. the guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude. my partner tweeted about this to ba and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someones pics at the same time. we finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too. there was not one person from british airways this whole time till 1am in the morning.  as if this wasnt enough when boarding started and we were showing our tickets we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us. we were the tenthtwelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us. there was no sign or announcement separating the two queues. instead of politely mentioning that this member of ba staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line. by then the socalled priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone. when i mentioned this she told me that i was cutting the queue and wasting her time. we just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did. i am definitely never going to choose ba again.     we did a return trip from heathrow to jfk and there were only two good things about flying british airways you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked terminal five at heathrow. the rest was disappointing. the outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule. there was no apology. the return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain. there was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an 18g chocolate bar. it felt like being in school. cabin crew werent overly friendly on either journey. inflight entertainment was fine lots of films both new and old to watch. we would usually fly emirates or virgin but decided to fly ba to give it a go. if you have similar thoughts dont do it. we wont be flying with ba again they are not worth it. it is very british  elitist and inefficient.    new york jfk to manchester via heathrow. budget airline trying to retain a big name brand. flight was cancelled then booked then delayed. aircraft was diverted to liverpool whereby the passengers were subsequently abandondoned. poor quality no aftercare and ba customer service extremely poor in responding to complaints when they eventually did the shrugged it off as not their problem. disappointing and wont be flying ba again.    london heathrow to berlin return. will be taking anything but ba flights from now on. arriving at berlin check in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite that it contained fragile items. another of my party did want to check in her hand baggage and was told no. both times the ground staff were inconsitant rude and uncooperative .i was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat. the new seat configuration is so narrow now i could not get into the allocated seat as i have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get to the seat. fortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat. i put a small plastic bag with fragile items in the overhead locker the steward without telling me or consulting me moved it. when i queried this i was told madam  i know what i am doing i have done this before. i am 71 years old and i refuse to be so patronised so i was ready for a stand up row by this time. fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation. no food left at the back of the plane as usual. why on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service if i want a budget flight i will use easyjet anytime.    barcelona to boston via london. mixed review we had to rebook suddenly for nextday business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently. ba cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. the good flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful food was surprisingly good wheelchair attendants at lhr were wonderful. the bad a321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable but a seat in the middle of the 4seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest lhr connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer ba representative said 1 hr would be adequate  even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus. also a nasty surprise no wifi on a 7hr transatlantic flight.    naples to gatwick. i used to admire and love ba. i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe. my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years have complained and received some avios in compensation but this time the cup overfloweth unfortunately not with blessings. we had once again  been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wifes preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other – but why does ba have to keep doing this the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks food and magazines. when time came for boarding and amongst others club europe passengers were invited to board first there was no check made at all which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. once boarded we were – unlike the other club europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but worst of all and unforgivable found food debris and other dirt in between our seats so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished. when i opened my meal tray it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it. we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle it means one gets only a smallish glassful so has to ask for a refill something not everybody likes to do. this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a costcutting exercise. on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary to bas website at the time – we were told at all these airports ‘ ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access so this time my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples. she was told no but at least we knew beforehand – or so we thought but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge though not exclusively for ba use that they had been able to access and enjoy why could the checkin staff not have told us the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some. however when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side. club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called so that did not look too bad. know what we showed our boarding pass then had to stand no seats available in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened. in other words we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers.    london to madrid a weekend flight. heathrow check in was fairly chaotic for early morning check in and security but once through was okay. full flight and gate staff being quite keen to check passenger hand luggage but managed to get through with my 2 pieces. flight deck very informative about slight delay. cabin crew struggled to get through the buy onboard service and i managed to get a single coffee after very very long wait. it is quite a short flight and the fare was low so cannot complain too much but ba is now no different to easyjet flybe etc.    toronto to london heathrow. i am a ba exec silver member and paid over 2500 return for business flight as had work straight after flying both journeys.  originally was a boeing 787 but they changed planes to an old boeing 777 on both journeys. the flat business seat on yyzlhr was broken and cabin service director couldnt fix it. the bench part was 5 inches different level to main seat. extremely uncomfortable and didnt sleep a wink. no extra pillows available in either business or first. food inedible on both journeys. outbound fillet of british beef was as tough as old rope. they should be ashamed of the business breakfast on the yyzlhr as ive had better in a greasy joes cafe. also the wine printed on the menu not available on both legs. a case of overpromising and underdelivering again. simply miles behind the competition. the csd completed a complaint for me and i also wrote to alex cruz. their customer services team offered me 50 in vouchers. what planet is he on now they have a very angry and dissatisfied customer. it is not the money it is the principle.     london heathrow to brussels return. through work i have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a ba flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed even in the premium cabins. if your timing is right the prices reflect this that is before the addons. so be prepared to get on last be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. that way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up its a win. any flights longer than a couple of hours i strenuously avoid ba if i can  a shame because in some ways i grew up with ba back in the days of boac and bea. having said that the flights to and from brussels were ok in a full aircraft either way.    london heathrow to accra. flight left nearly two hours late  bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. this is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. chaos in economy class. on this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. when will ba realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board  it is the most delayed flight out of heathrow because of this poor management. fact. the ground staff did nothing to control the crowds  simple and polite requests would have helped. the grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers  on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers. once on board the crew were friendly and professional. very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment poor food and very poor quality seats. the coldsalad options are far better than the hot offering in bas club class. still no wifi on ba even discount carriers like norwegian have this now let along the flag carriers like emirates and qatar airways.    krakow to london. got us there fine. my main issue is the food service. i was sat in row 21 probably 34 of the way back. it was an evening weekday flightso everyone tired & hungry. their new m&s service was a disaster. the flight was just over 2 hours. it took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. by the time it arrived all that was available was a kitkat and some other sweets they had already run out of sandwiches  hot food. it took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card  and the machine seemed to keep on having problems. also the variety on the new m&s menu  whilst generally a good thing  meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish clearly still not enough stored. have to say this services is no better than easyjet & i will think twice about travelling with ba. if it wasnt paid for by work i would not have travelled with them. the service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier.    london heathrow to paris orly. terminal 5 busy. lounge was ok but kids area t5 north limited we had to take our youngest downstairs. aircraft was ok but could have been cleaner. lunch was ok for this short sector. in summary all was ok. however we really do expect more in the premium cabins. it is with regret that i have to admit that i have booked our next longhaul business class flight with another provider. ba will not retain their premium clients if they continue with their current model i am sure that those who use point etc will remain loyal. however those of us who pay their hard earned cash for club world will begin to take their business elsewhere. its not this particular flight thats at fault more a general trend downwards.    toulouse to london heathrow. this airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier it has to be said no expense is spared on its branding while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management. i have bronze status with ba executive club have flown a dozen times over the past year both in business and in economy and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline. i was caught up in the it meltdown in may flying from rhodes to london and i was one of the lucky ones who doesnt remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days. i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled along with hundreds of other ba flights in may this incidentally ghastly tui replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my prepaid hotel booking at the airport which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim. the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight along with eu compensation after i sent a second email a month after my first claim as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me according to the customer agent. their customer service is beyond atrocious. i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings all you get is bear with us were trying really hard lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability. i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast and after two calls to their contact center based in india with a poor connection and amateur communication overall still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document. the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers which in turn run contrary to the almost nonexistent information provided on their website. on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot having waited for delayed passengers would they admit this was their fault nope it was all air traffic controls fault been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my club seat no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival. as i mentioned i have been one of their luckier passengers.   the london heathrow to accra flight is regularly late leaving lhr by 1 2 hours as a regular on this route for 18 years i have spent many hours delayed at lhr. started well with ba at last choosing a gate where they can process excess hand luggage prior to the final gate check gate 27  rather than the far gates at t3  hand luggage is a problem on this sector. all looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for first gold business etc to come forward. it is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a ba premium passenger. one first class passenger told the gate assistant to take control back of the gate. she blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff. it was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into accra a little early. a first for me in 18 years on the route once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly. a shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with  poor food poor seats in a layout that defies any sense lousy cheap amenity kit and finally an inflight entertainment package that does not change month after month. catch up with the others ba.    london city to dusseldorf return flights operated on behalf of ba by eastern airways. the cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. cabin crew must of been members of the basil fawlty school of catering. the outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. the young stewardess took our orders then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. the meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. the arrivals boards in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c. our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met. the return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airports. check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to lcy and 2 hours before the flight to lhr. i can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at dusseldorf. as the flight to lcy may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. which looked totally out of place in uniform. the flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called ham & chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has wizz and ryanair in fact they have better staff than eastern airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process.  i was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. on arrival at lcy it become apparent that the ground handling agents at dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. the handling agents at lcy could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. i did phone on monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. this morning i spoke to a member of senior management at dussledorf airport. about 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport. they will be put on the late flight tonight which means i will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed. it is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have to let negative results be posted.    gatwick to orlando return. possibly the worst pre and post flight experience i can remember. 4 hrs late on the way out almost three hours late on the return journey. bas use of old aircraft is to blame. a failed ife that couldnt be repaired took two hours to try and remedy. after this failed a replacement plane was required. by the time this arrived ba realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours. this led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew. this was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by ba. no refreshments provided no accurate information just endless waiting. they didnt board the children first and it was a total mess. the plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to tampa due to low fuel. whilst this seems fair enough the plane was actually 1hr late leaving gatwick in the first place so had it left on time it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did.  a terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called british as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as i can see. i will not be using ba again.    nice to london heathrow. i had to fly to nice and back for work. booked through the company travel agency. extra bag added both ways. i wanted to fly back to lhr earlier so my travel agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 gbp. when i arrived at nce the ground staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag saying that it was for the earlier flight. i stood my ground but the head of check in told me if i wanted to fly i had to pay 75 eur which i did under duress. i had prebooked my seat as silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which i loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. i asked for my bags to be offloaded and i would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  the trend for ba in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource check in staff who have no comprehension of the ba system combined with an arrogant ignorance that means i will not be choosing this airline again. i have one more flight with them next week and thats it. i paid almost 1100 pounds to get to nice and back today in economy i was greeted with disdain by ground staff the crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who despite the high prices have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic. aircraft are tired and worn. toilets stink. please do yourself a favour and book someone else.    what is happening to british airways flew vancouver to london. the a380 has to be my favorite long haul aircraft but ba is definitely not. cabin crew were friendly and professional despite not being a full complement of crew. several dishes were crossed off the menu apparently due to ongoing dispute why food was inedible the worst i have ever been served on a business flight. the seat configuration is outdated blankets threadbare and pancake thin pillows. the constant cost cutting by their management is now laid bare for all to see they need to spend some time on a singapore airlines aircraft to see what business class really is bas golden years are well and truly over it will take a miracle to bring them back    san diego to london heathrow. the worst business class i have flown in i flew on the 777 so whilst its not the newest plane in the fleet i still expected some level of comfort. the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. im a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed but does not line up with the rest of the seat. so your feet are raised. the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. every time the person next to you moves your chair moves too. the hydraulics must be connected. it was very annoying. the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest it sloped down and so drinksmeal tray did not stay put. it was not secure and basically was flimsy and unusable. i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. i was in seat 14a which was a rear facing window seat. there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you which is a forward facing aisle seat. the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. so for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. very awkward the tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldnt stay put. it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle. the food. well. the fillet streak was tough and dry. i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with american airlines and they did a much better job. the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. service if you want good service dont get a window seat. you are cut off from the aisle and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger the cabin crew forget you are even there. i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round both with dinner and breakfast. the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head not ideal with some turbulence. there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such. apparently the boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. in short ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. the layout is impractical seats are narrow there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. the 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly the tvs stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal. i for one will not be flying ba business again.    london to doha. my flight got cancelled due to cabin crew strikes i had no choice but to fly on this day due to work commitment. the class i had booked was not available on the alternative qatar airways flight and british airways refused to upgrade me so they could only downgrade to economy.  i would rate british airways way below the normal standard of customer satisfaction    tokyo haneda to london heathrow. this was the return leg of a code share flight with jal. i flew jal on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious. on my return i felt embarrassed that ba is our national airline mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality. white fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of fish surrounded by a brown fatty unidentifiable flavourless mass. the tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush. service was efficient bordering on perfunctory. luckily we brought some other food on board. please ba either do away with long haul meals altogether as mooted and declare your budget airline status or serve more appetising less embarrassing fare. you cant stay stuck in the middle for long    paris cdg to london. it is difficult to find anything positive to write about ba. flight delayed not their fault but for nearly an hour the staff didnt communicate or interact with the cabin. they had a good old chat at the front one even deciding it was time to snooze. for a 700 dollar 45 minute flight we should get better. we just seem to be an inconvenience as passengers and no one cares that an extra 1 hour on the ground in a unclean aircraft. terrible and not worth the money.    absolutely appalling airline. would definetly not recommend. flew rome to london heathrow. compared to the likes of qatar emirates and qantas they do not come close. i will never travel with british airways again. flights delayed from london to rome by over 1hr between 2 captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditions. the food is shocking and over priced. the planes are out dated. there stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff.    flew oslo to philadelphia via london. was extremely disappointed with business class on british airways. the flat beds were very narrow and im only 411 and weigh 100 lbs. and therefore not very comfortable. the lunch served beef entree was inedible except for the tomatomozzerella starter the cheese and the dessert. i had wanted shrimp salad but was told it was unavailable. afternoon tea was better but certainly not stellar. the socalled warm scone was stone cold and the sandwiches were still very cold from being refrigerated. i had asked for both a diet coke and an apple and the steward forgot both requests.    the flight from budapest to london was delayed by 22 hours during which time british airways offered nothing no help with hotel reservations despite limited hotel availability due to the world swimming championships no food no transport to and from the airport. in fact ba doesnt even have a representative in budapest having outsourced it to a hungarian agent who did their best in the absence of any input from ba. even the customer service desk i phoned was answered from india also outsourced. when the flight finally took off we could not even buy food on the plane. we were told that a ba representative would meet us at our heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers but he  she wisely didnt show up because i for one was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which i wont get back rather than some airport food vouchers. i have flown several times a month for the last 40 years with many airlines and have never been treated as badly. i will be flying abba anything but ba from now on.    gatwick to paphos. chaos at check in as another system failure. leg room was shocking for a 4 hour flight. definately a low cost airline now. no food drink ife and paying for luggage. long haul ba has barely maintained its standards but short haul british airways has become a disgrace.    london to warsaw. i have not flown with ba within the eu for a while and decided to take this chance to fly with them on a trip to poland. i had paid more than gbp 260 for a return ticket and had no free food services whatsoever. you need to pay for your food on board. if you decide to go on a cheap marketing promotion please lower your ticket fares down more in line with easyjet or ryanair.    british airways cancelled my flight and put me on a eva air flight which had a different baggage allowance and i had to pay a 140 excess. i thought that because my booking was with ba they should pay the excess which they refused to do. after months of refusing to acknowledge any responsibility i had to issue a court summons on which they admitted they were at fault. i have flown over 20 different airlines and never had a company behave this way when they are obviously in the wrong.     unimpressed service very indifferent impression that its only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight. perfunctory service at best guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. british airways calls their economy world traveller i wonder if those at the top making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the much superior service most other airlines offer even in economy ba take a page from qantas to see what economy service looks like. my understanding is ba recently lost a star and are now only 3 stars. quite understandable from what was offered on this flight food awful dinner of chicken rice and peas. breakfast over ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars awful even a recent united flight from syd to sfo served better meals no return of crew to offer more beverages. and no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. the wine offering was the best part a reasonably good spanish pinot gris there are alternatives to the uk from canada air canada air transat westjet. on westjet you purchase your food but im sure it has to be superior to bas offering my last flight to britain on air canada was much superior. air france last october to paris was excellent qantas to australia is always brilliant the only redeeming factor on this flight was the airbus 380 still the smoothest and quietest plane flying apparently british airways ceo is an accountant and the bean counting shows in the service and food quality offered service on my flight was budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to britains flag carrier    flew zurich to london heathrow. i have flown 14 times with british airways in the last 5 months. ive seen a noticeable degradation of service. flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down. they were once smart and full of energy. sadly they seem to have lost their pride. a huge shame.   athens to london with british airways. to call this business class is some sort of mean spirited joke. to start with british airways lounge is provided by skyways which as jammed with both people and a bad assortment of food. the actual seat 3d had no power plugs and no tv at the front of the seat what you find in economy in canada. the seat width was narrow and the pitch was pathetic. flying premium economy on cathay pacific is dramatically superior. the flight from heathrow to athens was on a very beat up b767 on aug 4 2017. the food on this flight was both minuscule and horrid. it is amazing that they can attempt to call this level of service business. very disappointing.    singapore to newcastle via london heathrow. terrible airline. avoid at all costs. was affected by the global it outage during the bank holiday weekend. had to wait in line two hours to get a new ticket. they were terribly slow. after the whole episode i wrote an email requesting compensation for the flight delay & my misplaced baggage. its now july 2017 and i still have not gotten back my monies. extremely poor customer service. wrote emails twice chasing them for the refunds. they said they will check. that was more than a week ago and havent heard from them yet. as for the flight experience poor. they have become so budget that they do not even provide necessary toiletries like toothbrush for long haul flights. inflight entertainment was also poor very limited selection of movies.    british aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world well known for outstanding inflight service decent food comfortable seats good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines. how times have changed under recent ceos most notably the current holder the post alex cruz ba has declined to the level of a budget airline. in fact ive had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. flying from vancouver to london on the a380 was superb its a wonderful aircraft. beyond that  atrocious. dinner was a tough piece of chicken over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. breakfast was a farce a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. hardly suitable breakfast fare. the entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. no snacks no water offering between meals nothing on the same route air canada is superior in every way. its very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a ceo whos strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airlines.    new york to cape town via london heathrow. a huge disappointment. even worse when you put it in context of what british airways used to be. we decided to fly first  because i cant stand club world backward seats forward facing seats almost on the aisle  claustrophic poor overhead storage on some planes. seats were  narrow poor seat controls unable to independently control the different seat axes foot rest had to be set manually american airlines and cathay pacific new business class products are far better than ba first class. avod great on one leg with the new pansonic system dreadful on the 2nd leg with the old system.  food was mediocre at best. breakfast jfk to lhr was passable dinner lhr to cpt passible  wifes fish was okay my hamburger was inedible. meal service slow. cabin crew from jfk was excellent to cape town was passable. changing planes in heathrow t5t3 a nightmar.. i am oneworld emerald never again    cairo to montreal via london. 7 days im waiting my baggage. absolutely no information from british airways. customer services in india and they cut off conversation often. no contact with british airways you paid full price for a low cost service. absolutely no customer consideration. heathrow is a nightmare for baggage.    bergen to london heathrow. i was a gold executive member for years and raved about ba. sadly that has hugely changed. this year i flew from london to frankfurt with my daughter and we had to buy food on board. i found this highly irregular especially for a mainstream airline. today i flew from bergen to london and again experience ended this this is disgusting ba charge way higher prices than others and very much more than the cheapie lines and now also charge for food in economy.  the entire executive team should be fired. and ba have lost another client    british airways is quickly becoming a low quality low cost services but premium priced airline. apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with marks & spencer buyonboard menu on that particular flight they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay. it was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion next time well just fly another airline that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices. this came only a month after the major it failure that grounded all ba flights for a weekend. the only thing they have left is safety  if they lose that then its over.    managed to get upper deck which is rare flying from london to philadelphia. cabin was unclean with earbuds and paper on floor from previous flight. no hello for gold status. it became clear british airways are some sort of work to rule. one stewardess for all upstairs. three hours to serve dinner which was bland and tasteless. cabin service director never appeared once despite my tv screen refusing to stay in open position. never ever again will i pay thousands of pounds for bland insulting service.    london to chicago. i am a ba gold member and reserved three ba business class tickets to chicago returning from denver. i selected contiguous seats so that my young daughters and myself would sit together. a week before departure i received a message from ba informing me that our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day. on the departure date we checked smoothly at the business class counter at lhr. the fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problem. the lounge attendant however curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes. i checked and it was true but i had not suspected it at all till that point since i had paid for business class believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at checkin. the customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasnt him who downgraded the ticket i spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights but they were all full. he could not confirm if ba had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade he had no explanation for why ba did not give us any other option with business seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance nor did he acknowledge that ba had made any mistake in this ordeal. however he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation. we ended up traveling in economy class. to add insult to injury the airline was unable to place us next to each other so the family was split seven rows apart. however the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first. they almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff.     catania to gatwick. about 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight. it took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 our row there was no food left not even a kitkat we had the last can of coca cola and a bottle of water. several factors contributed to this silly situation  ba trying to become a low cost airline i did not realise that it had sunk so low when i booked. the fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay.  the blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling. ba trying to keep the front toilet for business class passengers. totally inadequate  supply of food on board the aircraft this meant the sales person had to go through what was left with every sale in the hope of finding something that the passenger would accept.     flew from london heathrow to sofia. i have been flying british airways for over 40 years and they are truly awful now. i see no difference now with easyjet or ryanair. the main difference with ba now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff i encountered. everything in t5 is now self service including bag drop. paid food etc. \\r\\r\\n    venice to gatwick. problems encountered on 24th july at venice marco polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight ba2581 back to gatwick. from various conversations that took place it would appear that there were no british airways staff at venice marco polo airport everything is handled by the local service agents. obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents they need to be made aware and retrained if necessary as no doubt ba are paying them money to carry out their duties.  announcements were unclear especially in the lounge the departure board information did not help. after arriving at 1300 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away arriving at 2400. the following day on the replacement flight we were taxiing out and a flightdeck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed. i am all for safe flying but ba need to improve their standards.    salzburg to gatwick. awful experience. flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and ba handling in salzburg did apologise for the delay. once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members 2 to serve club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers. usual fight for bag space. i was desperate for some water and asked the crew can i buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin. i am in seat 23c right at the back. i am told no i have to wait for the trolley. i wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20. the 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments and tell row 20 that the service is now closed and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. all this as the csd stands chatting in the club galley with the other crew member. 14 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight. no smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. not even a flight map to help pass time. terrible airline. a national disgrace worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service.  i am only rating this as 210 as they got me from a to b safely.    on a flight from bangkok to london and youll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of thailand in their meal choices. first meal service has thai green curry veg and the second thai red curry chicken. really no one could come up with two thai dishes that were a little bit more different so the meal service begins and i was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  i said i dont want the prawns for starter as im having the prawn main meal. i should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  ok so prawns for starter and ill have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce mashed potatoes mushroom spinach and tomato. well im not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point i wasnt eating them. the chicken breast was dry and i got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. mushrooms were very meh tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. the bread roll didnt win any prizes either. i just gave up and refused to eat it. now when this was served id been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the fa was off too quickly. no problem press the call bell. which is reset before anyone comes. press it again and think id better get on with eating my food. eventually some one arrives and notices im not eating my main course and after i tell them it is disgusting i ask why no one has answered my call button. obviously im just asked what did i want and i say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and ill have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. this does not appear for fifteen minutes. during that time i am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isnt going work for me. so a couple of hours later im a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where i find some quite pleasant snacks. back at my seat i think i need a g&t with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin. there is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger cw cabin. i do find one in the second galley. i ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times ive tried to use it and been ignored. bad service. now on to the second meal service. strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu. i ask the fa about this but am just told everyone is having the same no explanation. the starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing. the dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine. now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now i have to choose again. ok main meal im give a choice of smoked salmon again or red thai curry so no choice really and i decide to give up and go to a restaurant when i disembark. just not recommended at all.    bucharest to london which takes 3 hours. this is my second bad experience with ba. if you want to eat something then you have to pay for it. they did not offer me a glass of water. my first experience was when i flew from miami to london on june 10th and that flight was delayed for 3 hours. the ground transportation from one terminal to another is awful also at heathrow airport.     nice to london heathrow. you must downgrade your rating of british airways if you truly reflect how bad things have become. flight delayed that happens i accept but the ba ground staff handling was awful  to the point of zero in reality. once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space pilot did give a polite and nice apology but the cabin staff service that has always been their stronger point was terrible. aside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads most unpleasant in a confined space their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude. they seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us and that is just not acceptable. sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness. ba management should be fired or at least the ceo mr cruz who is destroying our national airline. im not a grumpy old man just a customer with over 50 years experience of flying british airways and boac and bea and a direct witness to the demise of what was a great airline.    flew rome to london gatwick. big disappointment i paid 180 to fly with british airways just for one way and the plane was delayed two hours and 41 minutes because of late arrival of another aircraft. instead of arriving at 21.30 we landed almost at midnight. no refreshments were offered nothing. the customs queue was massive i got home at 3.00 in the morning. i decided to pay extra for ba instead of flying ryanair and it was a huge mistake. even the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not work. ba is not worth the extra money. staff did not speak a word of italian.    athens to newcastle via london. another miserable experience. woken at 7am by text to say 13.30 flight to heathrow cancelled for operational reasons  phone numbers listed to rearrange. one not open till 9am gmt the greek one no longer in use. website also useless we are experiencing technical difficulties  try again later. 2 stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights  but downgraded on both sectors. still not happy that i was involuntarily downgraded on my last ba flight at easter athens used to have a great ba lounge. now its provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grim. partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight. flights adequate but no different really to service of any budget airline. crew apologetic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in bas direction. athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people  albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain  claim. ba are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew  without them id have already deserted. still waiting for any response from airline re eu compensation  downgrade almost 2 weeks after submitting forms  emails. this could surely be automatic managed by most us airlines and contrasts with a recent air france experience of far more trivial nature where within 24 hours id received a voucher and a personal apology.    having flown first class from london to cape town and club back from johannesburg i have really noticed a significant downgrade in ba service and standards compared to premium flights i have taken in previous years. the seats in first had crumbs on them on arrival in club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which hadnt been cleaned. on the return club flight in particular the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower on 3 occasions i had to ask for a g&t eventually i only received it by going to the galley. it was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation. food in club was average. first lounge in t3 not great sole elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from 18401940 leaving a scribbled paper sign saying back in an hour which wasnt helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at 9pm. when i tried to book an appointment on her return she told me she was busy and full whilst checking facebook on her iphone. in terms of hard product the club seat just doesnt compare with rivals any more its way too narrow and storage space is dire. these flights were miles burn i wont be accruing more avios with ba.    dubai to london. i am a regular ba flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a tier 2 airline. the journey started in the concorde lounge dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours i was there was not refreshed. onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. amazingly when the menu came it contained only an arabic snack with no options. they say this is to allow maximum sleep. no other airline has done this. breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. it is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you cant even get a meal. the airline is clearly failing fast and i wish now i had flown the luxury of emirates at half the price. very disappointing and they dont care.    london heathrow to bucharest. a full flight both ways to bucharest using a a321. boarding in london was efficient and orderly. the boarding in bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum any sense of control by ba went out of the window. the plane was clean but the interior was tired and the seating rough around the edges. there was no usb ports or entertainment which makes for a long 3 hours. the m&s meal service worked well flying out of london but less so returning. food inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold out. leaving a selection of drinks and crisps also the ba cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently which slows the process down too.    london gatwick to funchal. in my opinion british airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. for travellers in economy ba are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. they have failed to understand what their true market is all about. generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of ryanair or easyjet. the ba brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides but sadly not any more. the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but its expensive. frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. and that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. on our flights to and from funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink maybe thats in the next part of the ba master plan british airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier simply lost somewhere in the middle. as a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. dont ba management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for free food and drink sadly i think we know the answer. all we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.    london heathrow to bologna. i have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from a to b for a competitive price. the planes were clean and modern. however like many i do feel sad that the service on ba has been downgraded so drastically. the buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landing. its hard to say it is so slow other airlines are much more efficient. the crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight. i thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in italian. to be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those i have taken with easyjet so now will make my decision purely based on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline.    larnaca to london heathrow. despite being an executive member and booking seats 9 months before on most flights my last 3 flights i have had my seats changed. last time my family split up despite booking row 10 last september. had this have been a one off then i wouldnt mind so much but this is the third time in 6 months. i have called ba and even emailed social media team even at the airport i tried to rectify the situation but no one interested or even prepared to tell me why. the service and attitude of ba now is shocking. since alex cruz came in the airline has gone downhill so fast its hard to believe.    london to keflavik. british airways lost one of my bags on our way to iceland for a week long vacation. this is understandable bags get delayed all the time. however when i attempted to contact british airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room i was disconnected multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers. the delayed bag contained our sleeping bags and tent for a one week camping trip. not knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels in iceland cost upwards of 200 a night we were forced to sleep in our rental car until the next day when we were able to rent a tent. since making my claim for reimbursement british airways has done everything in their power to avoid reimbursement. i have been told my partner who purchased the tickets must fax written permission for me to handle the claim even though the baggage was under my name paid for by me and all costs for tent rental and toiletry items were paid with my credit card. it is shameful that a company can operate this way and treat people so poorly. i urge you to avoid at all costs flight from heathrow to toronto. booked emergency exit seat for night flight home. cost 55 but worth it. overall was ok both ways except for awful breakfast prior to landing at heathrow. a freezing muffin in a piece of plastic and a polystyrene cup of coffee. not a cheap flight  better value with air transat club which costs about the same and is better in every way. business lhr to bkk. 747400. first try back with ba in about 5 years during which i have flown many other airlines and been impressed with most. the only things that impress me with ba are the staff and their ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay ba so much money to be treated like cattle. the food is without doubt some of the worst i have had in business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible. the avod looks like it was installed 10 years ago and then wasnt the top of the range screen size is terrible viewing angles and resolution poor. the seats work well as a lie flat configuration. thats the highlight. i cant help feel that if ba senior managers occasionally used their own money to fly with rivals then we would see real change from our national flag carrier. regretting my already booked return flight and my 550000 ba air miles.    i had a return flight to istanbul in club europe. staff were usual ba quality however flight experience was awful. club europe section with no leg space. there was no inflight entertainment. lounge in istanbul probably one of the worst i have been to. drinks some cakes and pastry  nothing else. i am sorry to see that british airways become a budget airline.  london citynew york jfk via shannon on a318 but had really nice seats and professional crew. meal served was very tasty and fresh. overall a very good flight would use this airline again. sinlhr ba12 b747436 first class. old aircraft 1998 with seats that are not that private but there are only a few of us in the cabin so ok. a bit tatty but i think the planes are being replaced by a380s soon. seat itself is comfortable enough. inflight entertainment awful fuzzy screen low resolution lcd screen way passed its sellby date with limited options. inconveniently has to be pulled around to be seen and put away for toff and landing. seat comfortable enough for sleeping. food and service quintessentially english which is the only real reason to fly ba nowadays  the product just doesnt match other airlines. toilet cramped and awful but it has a window las vegaslgw 777 3 class. business. the unique forward facingrear facing seat configuration fits in more seats than other leading airlines. try to get a windowaisle seat if you are travelling as a couple but you will be lucky unless you are prepared to pay 60 to choose your seat. otherwise you will be allocated a seat 24 hours before the flight and there are limited choices to change your seat allocation on a busy flight. in the middle 4 seats you will be either facing someone during service take off and landing or sat next to someone with a small partition between you. in all seats the foot rest is part of the bed and blocks access so you will either have to step over or be stepped over to leave your seat. the seats were comfortable in all positions. dinner was average but less elegant than meals on other leading airlines. breakfast was a disaster hardly any of the choices on the menu were available but no explanation or apology were offered which was typical of the functional unsmiling flight attendants. we got a good price in a ba sale but the overall experience was disappointing. lhrjfklaxlhr. check in was ok apart from being snapped at for being too early to check in come back in 5 minutes. got through security quickly. terminal 5 has very good facilities. we boarded the aircraft and sat in our seats realising we had a long haul flight in short haul seat pitch with a very small seat width designed for a below averaged size person. this wasnt at all helped by the passenger in front reclining their seat immediately after the seatbelt sign went off. food was basic small meal return flight included a breakfast consisting of a small bread roll with a bitesize cereal bar. both legs went at least 4hrs without any fooddrink service. ife was quite good have to watch 5 minutes of adverts before the programme starts. family near us had a child with no working ife for return flight. what annoyed us most was on the return leg we were told by the flight attendant do you mind moving forward so the couple behind you can eat. we did presuming it was policy whilst finding it strange it never happened on the outbound flight. no one else was asked to move the seat forward so we felt angered that we were the only ones asked. it is 100 not surprising ba has fallen behind other airlines in recent years as middle eastern airlines such as qatar provide a much better service for a similar price. just got back from bridgetown barbados flying with british airways and frankly couldnt wait to get off. i was so disappointed. i have travelled regularly with ba but the flights going over and coming back left a lot to be desired. the plane was in need of repair. i had water dripping from the ceiling where i was sitting and when i told the stewardess was told that was usual due to condensation and proceeded to stuff a tissue to stop the dripping. the toilets were so old that bits of the cladding were coming away. the food was awful and inedible. the staff were unapproachable and looked fed up. ba get your act together or youll be losing flyers by the hundreds. flight from heathrow to toronto. booked emergency exit seat for night flight home. cost 55 but worth it. overall was ok both ways except for awful breakfast prior to landing at heathrow. a freezing muffin in a piece of plastic and a polystyrene cup of coffee. not a cheap flight  better value with air transat club which costs about the same and is better in every way. i flew singapore to sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. at the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. the plane was an old and tired 747400 which had the dirtiest cabin i have seen. there was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. the seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. the inflight entertainment was a joke. the video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. the food was some strange fried rice which was bland. the crew were unfriendly they didnt serve drinks once throughout the flight. the worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. overall i will never fly british airways again unless i dont have any choice. lanzarote to gatwick on 13th april. flight itself was okay but on arrival we were parked a long way from the baggage reclaim area for which the captain apologised. after a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. ba have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from start to finish but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. cant recommend ba because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. not planning to use ba again because of this. 6 may 2014 las vegas to gatwick. boeing 777. back on ba again thanks to avios companion coupon. cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. ive flown af tap swiss klm long haul in the past year and by far ba catering in economy is the poorest in content. yesterdays offering for breakfast was almost an insult. ba 059 london to cape town april 29 2014 economy. its been a while since i flew ba world traveller and it will be even longer until i use them again. clapped out 747 terrible uncomfortable seats awful back of seat video system.  my partners failed. the crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more interested in getting the service note the quotes over with asap. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip. perfunctory drinks service  when asking for a whisky and soda i was offered whisky and tonic. paper cups for coffee at breakfast. meals are better at a little chef. the amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush. never again. wake up ba there are major competitors out there and next time it emirates via dubai. i have just been reviewing all the reviews on this website and it seems every evident to me that if you are booked in first class you will more than lightly have a great flight economy or premium is touch and go if you want to take the risk i travel ba to tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and i always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well i complained myself and the man seated next to me kept up the complaining and 15 mins later the steward comes up with two beef dishes. the crew had kept these meals for themselves. so be aware that if you are seated in aisle 14 bring your own food because you will not get a decent meal. flew from san francisco to heathrow london. flight was delayed 3.5 hours the food particularly the breakfast was the worst ive had on an airline. the sets were very uncomfortable. i feel ba have a long way to catch up to the quality to other airlines such as emirates and qatar. when we booked our holiday to barbados i was really pleased to see we were flying with british airways as they have a good reputation. sadly our experiences put a lie to this. as part of the service they offer ba allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. i tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. after a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator whose grasp of english wasnt great was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than keep trying. i rang the complaints line still premium rate and other than a better grasp of english was still unable to assist in any way. both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the airport. so in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. we entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we werent sat together or even on the same row. by now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears we then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually were allocated 2 seats together. as they were free i dont know why these werent given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they dont like using them i have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. sadly british airways dont appear to follow this doctrine. the legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat i had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. as my tv screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. i managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so i was forced to stop. i would love to see what regulations ba have to follow regarding vdu viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. the final disappointment came when the food was distributed. i had the thai chicken which was overcooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. she didnt eat hers. i ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. all in all this was an experience i do not want to repeat and i shall certainly not fly british airways by choice in the future we didnt have these problems with sri lanka airlines. travelling as a family of 4 2 adults and 2 young children from london to boston i hoped there wouldnt be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. i had not paid to reserve my seat as i had never had to pay extra before while flying with emirates singapore or cathay pacific. the seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left abc. my wife sat with the kids while i had to sit in the row behind. the seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. it seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. i warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. i had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. on the return flight i reluctantly paid extra 23 x 4 to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. the journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldnt recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs he should have paid and extra 23 and reserved a seat with more leg room. my wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. in conclusion i found staff were generally friendly but didnt exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didnt have any games and the screen kept freezing. it seems the flight services to usa are not up to the same standard as flying to the middle east or the far east as british airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier  my last experience to the usa was with american airlines and that was worse than ba. the main disappointing issue with ba is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. if you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra 200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of ryanair flew to vegas on 8th may and dismayed at the standard. filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did around row 31 as it normally happened. the worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude. i should be in a nice hotel in romania instead 9 hours after i arrived in heathrow courtesy of british airways i am still in heathrow heading back to glasgow the 7am flight went well 1010 for getting me from glasgow to london. the connecting flight to bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant i wouldnt get my connecting flight to timisoara. i duly went to customer services waited 50 mins who offered to get me to timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9514 was fully booked. they offered to put me up in a hotel in bucharest but were not able to book one. having waited 50 mins at a ba desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in bucharest i was not filled with confidence. since i was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting i decided to go back to glasgow. i was booked on the 15.50 to glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. told my boarding pass was sorted. they hadnt sorted it and i got a lecture about what i needed to do in future. there was no way i was getting on the flight told that i should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again san diego return business class the seat was more comfortable than the first class one. as usual plane was fine service was ok but not attentive i.e just about ok. food was terrible i have flown ba in economy business and first  and never had good or adequate quality food. if they upped their game on this they would be unbeatable. entertainment pretty dire  at least first had a few good box sets of tv programmes. my wife was back in economy  her comment was that the world traveller plus seat gave her backache  the economy seat was better. her food was inedible. recently returned from mauritius to gatwick in club world and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. left on time. the cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. breakfast was disgusting and served soon after takeoff. a little round casserole dish of british breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. awful insipid coffee. after that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted i rang for a drink and nobody came. the galley kitchensnack bar was almost bare and had two manky stale smokedsalmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. on asking for a glass there were none for wine i was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. throughout the flight i felt guilty asking for a g&t or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. lunch was just about ok and very good wine. after that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing  no tea no cakes no nothing. the seating configuration was 242 boeing 777 and packed in like sardines  claustrophobic for some. to access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. we were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eyetoeye contact with a stranger. the ife was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. the whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. not once were you made to feel special or pampered in any way. if there is an alternative in future to ba ill take it and compared with some middleeast airlines the club world product is embarrassingly mediocre. ba needs to refresh review and update quickly. sorry ba  youve lost me for the foreseeable future recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a ba promo to fly in to singapore and then to hong kong via cathay pacific and back to uk. our flight out to singapore was easy and relaxed because i think it was not a busy flight. we did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. the canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. we understand ba has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. our flight on cathay pacific to hong kong was great we were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. on our way back to london we were excited as we knew we were flying the a380. sq and emirates have a380 we have flown. this turned out to be a mistake from the start. when we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. when we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the ba a380 were in comparison to sq or even emirates. next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. the staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. the ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. by the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. no apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles i was quite upset by now as i had to ask the stewardess what was being served. i have never felt more humiliated. with ba it was just silence. miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who cant seem to care less with their customers. no smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched our overall flying experience with ba has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable with delicious meals. it had just served as a reminder why i have not chosen ba the last 10 years and perhaps the next 10 to come. lgwantigua on 29 april and antigualgw on 13 may boeing 777. it started off badly when i went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 february. the system rejected both my credit and debit cards. on checking the state of my account with ba online i found that the final payment had been credited to my account and i now owed the initial deposit. i sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. first call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of english. another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. i was told it had been sorted out and received e ticket email with my state of account showing i owed nothing. two weeks later i received another e ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. next credit card statement did not show money taken out. not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. two weeks before flight i got a phone call from ba stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. i then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. about 22 hours before flight i went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. arrived at lgw to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. we then had to queue to drop off baggage. other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. flight left and arrived on time. however the inflight main meal was the worst i have ever experienced on an aircraft. there was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. the inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to singapore in 1962 was better. on return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. check in at antigua was one of the quickest check ins i have ever done. left antigua on time and arrived lgw on time. food was worse than going out. no choice. starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. white wine was just about drinkable. coffee served as we started main course. asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. no turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty. at least with ryanair you know what you get for your money. travelled back from tampa to gatwick friday 30th may. this flight proved that it is the crew that make a good or bad flight. this one was really bad. i was booked in club normally the plane is a three class 777. on friday it was a four class that was flying and i was lucky enough to be seated in the first class cabin. although it was not classed as an upgrade to first because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words i heard as being offered a drink was  cant wait for this flight to be over. this was from one of the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same amongst all the crew serving the cabin. i hope ba read this forum as the service really was appalling. my husband was in the bathroom when breakfast was served he was ignored. a request of a cup of coffee was met with we will be landing in 40 minutes. so what should have been a real treat turned out to be the most disappointed i have ever been with ba. will no longer recommend. my husband and i travelled to san diego from heathrow and back via jfk five weeks later. service is appalling. stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours the flight to san diego is 12 hours without access to water or beverages. dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. the journey from jfk was worse. same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. we paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. dinner was pretty awful and the next meal breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. the problem is staff. there needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in cattle class incognito  then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain. i found ba to be the worst airline i have used. flew lhr to boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. also leg room appalling with trim falling of the seat in front of me. it had the interior of an old knackered plane. i have flown singapore airlines who run rings around this bunch. i could have flown with virgin instead for the same money and would have had a vastly superior less drab experience. flew yvr to muc via lhr. i had high expectations for this airline but was pretty disappointed. we were flying with twin 15 month olds so its great with ba that you can preselect the bassinet spots when booking. crew did bare minimum seemed as though asking for anything was a huge inconvenience. audio on ife was awful couldnt hear any movies. flight landed 10 minutes late in london and we were denied boarding on the muc flight due to being late. if they allow a connection of 1h10 and youre 10 minutes late and cant get on their system is flawed. when are any lhr flights not 10 mins late they rebooked us 2.5 hours later but after complaining put us on a lufthansa flight 1 hour later. i never thought i would say this but will use air canada on this route from now on if the price is equal. heathrow  johannesburg a380. my first flight on a380. after half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started. first thing i noticed was how tiny the seats were. second thing to notice is that the plane was not properly cleaned. there were grease stains and empty cans left behind. at this point i noticed some toilet paper between the panels above my head. when asked the cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation problem from the air conditioning. anyhow time for lift off. i turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at the tail of the plane. after looking for 5 minutes i couldnt find it anywhere. later i found out there is no such option on ba a380s. so no tail cam fine lets listen to some music. wrong the headphones are not working. cabin crew assures me they will bring me some more. one hour later suffice it to say cabin crew did not bring anything. ive managed to grab a pair of unused headphones from one empty seat just to find out they were not working either. probably it was some problem with the jack in the seat rendering the whole inflight entertainment system pointless. and if that was not enough it was time for dinner. by the time it was my turn ba had run out of chicken so my dinner was asparagus with rice or something like that. you dont even have to look at it to understand why everyone else was choosing the chicken. so no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. pretty much spent the rest of the journey counting the minutes until i could get off this plane. the worst part is i have a return trip with ba which ill be looking to switch to another airline if possible. ba heathrow to madrid club euro. disappointing service perfunctory at best with cabin crew spending much of the flight hiding behind their curtain. full cabin but it has to be questioned why we continue to pay extra when the service is so disappointing. flight itself was fine cabin itself not as tatty as some ba short haul. good experience at t5 lounge at heathrow. the afternoon tea product continues to underwhelm and underfeed  they really should change this. travelled back from tampa to gatwick friday 30th may. this flight proved that it is the crew that make a good or bad flight. this one was really bad. i was booked in club normally the plane is a three class 777. on friday it was a four class that was flying and i was lucky enough to be seated in the first class cabin. although it was not classed as an upgrade to first because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words i heard as being offered a drink was  cant wait for this flight to be over. this was from one of the

breakfast was served he was ignored. a request of a cup of coffee was met with we will be landing in 40 minutes. so what should have been a real treat turned out to be the most disappointed i have ever been with ba. will no longer recommend. dublin to sydney via heathrow and singapore. club europe from dublin to london and club world to sydney. flight to heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. upon arrival in heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. by this time it was about 10pm. obviously missed the connecting flight to sydney so tried to find a ba contact in terminal 4. was then advised to go to terminal 1. no ba reps around and no 24 hr phone number. then transferred to terminal 5. by this time it was midnight and still no ba contacts. finally went to baggage services and saw a ba rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by ba they provided us with the option of flying back to sydney on ba or could see if they could get us on a china southern flight we had originally booked china southern. we took the ba option as it was easiest and needed to come home. next day arrived at airport and boarded through gate c in terminal 5 hate heathrow airport. lounge in heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. upon boarding the ba business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. we had the two middle seats e and f which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. flight left on time and arrived in singapore on time. there was a delay of an hour in singapore but again that couldnt be helped. they were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage  luckily it arrived two days later. good luck if youre expecting to sleep on the flight. seats were small and very uncomfortable. the amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. the hit towels were anything but hot. food was below average. overall i wouldnt recommend british airways club europeworld. the best ive experienced so far from sydney to europe would have to be on china southern. considering they are 23 grand cheaper than british airways and they offer a better business class product and a more seamless transfer process. i really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight too and from vegas was with ba however i can categorically state i will never fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive a superior option as an airline. highlights of my journey include severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. no beer 1 hr in to flight  after the 90 minute delay. uninterested and incompetent staff. lost luggage. 1 case has so far turned up. space reduced to less than a foot head to back of seat once person in front inevitably reclines. i could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when i say that i am an easy customer to please. if you have virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please take my word for it and go with them they are a class apart. ba operate as a poor budget airline posing as something else. very poor journey shocking experience. flew in club world for the first time on the new ba a380s. big disappointment. the two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. the dinner service on the lhrjnb flight was chronically slow about three hours from beginning to end. the staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys rather than from a trolley and to plate all the meals. all this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. the cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers. a pity as the planes are quieter than previous generation aircraft and the flight was very smooth. lhrsin in business on b747. hard to find much good to say about this experience. everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. heathrow t5 a complete overcrowded mess. flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldnt get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it shouldve to resolve. and to make it all worse ba had a global baggage it systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to singapore despite checking in several hours before the flight. the flight itself was average at best. upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired ife limited food appalling. the only positive thing i can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. cant imagine how ba can compete with sq on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. they have no idea where my bag is or when i will get it and you cant contact ba in singapore on the weekend as they are closed. one just gets the impression they couldnt care less. would not recommend. lhrathath june 2014. both flights 1.5 hours late which always seems to be the case largely due to the old plane 767 used on this particular flight. food average cabin crew variableaverage overall. no apologies for lateness of flights which unacceptableba still seem to think that they are doing you a favour for letting you fly with them. poor overall and am even considering using easyjet as gatwick closer to my home. the outward trip manchester  heathrow  milan was fine with even a guide to take us to our connection at lhr terminal 5. the return trip munich  heathrow  manchester was not so good. the system would not let me checkin online and despite being the first in the queue at airport checkin we had already been allocated seats right at the back we discovered on boarding  no plan or explanation given on checkin with no recline. both planes were late and at heathrow especially the communication was poor at one point the board said please wait then there was a last call even though the gate had not yet opened the staff seemed unconcerned at the delay no explanation or apology were offered unless they were in the inaudible announcement but i doubt it as it was quite short. having arrived at munich to check in at 1.30pm we eventually got to manchester at 9pm not too late as the pilot made up some of the lost time all excellent pilots by the way. but during this time the only refreshments were a small packet of crisps and a drink twice. not impressive although the staff on board were friendly and polite. travelling from venice to london gatwick with british airways on what should have been a painless short flight 2hrs. how wrong i was. held in boarding queue for about 20 minutes with no explanation. then got onto flight to find no crew to help passengers in economy with onboarding stowing luggage etc. i was sat in very last row and became apparent that the crew were sat at the back having a laugh. a large number of the passengers on this flight were elderly requiring help putting their hand baggage in the overhead lockers. did the crew bother to look or help no. they were sat up the back in the galley having a right old laugh. only when we started taxiing could they be bothered to finish their chat and do a lacklustre safety demonstration. which i couldnt see as the crew member demonstrating was right at the front of the plane. i couldnt hear the pilot announcement as the audio was faulty. no idea what he said or what flight conditions were. for a nervous passenger this is not great. took off and then the crew started for service. the food i couldnt eat as allergic to one of the ingredients and told there was no other option. fair enough. was offered a drink about 20 mins before landing. just as well i had my own water i guess. finally crew member opened locker above my head on approach and her shoe fell out on my head. wasnt painful per say but didnt get apology from crew member at all. she looked at me like it was my fault i fly ba quite a bit and usually never much of an issue. i found the service on this flight incredible really. im still pinching myself to think it was actually ba. i left the flight feeling angry and slightly depressed if this is now the standard product from ba. the plane was old no map torn seats broken arm rests and rubbish in flight service. i really will now try to find other airlines for both uk and international flights from now on whereever possible. lhrvie on an a319. online checkin didnt start working until about 15 hours before the flight. selected 13f on a very full flight. selected collect at the airport option. suddenly 8e a middle seat. no aircraft swap no explanation no apology. boarding pass failed to work at security an error somewhere in the system told security that pass had already been used allegedly before i even got to the airport. boarding not great with a packed bus getting a tour of t3. flight 15 mins late due to congestion at lhr. service efficient but not overly friendly. much prefer austrian on this route and will return to them for my next trip. a shame as ba should be a world beater  id not flown with them for about a year and it bought back memories as to why i choose others. we just flew round trip on the new a380 from lax to lhr and then on to rome. the a380 business class area was nice and the food was decent. however the layout of the seats wasnt great you have to jump over the person next to you when they have their seat in a flat position. also avoid the aisle seats as you feel like youre out in the open and people are constantly bustling by. as well the seats on the aisle have zero storage space so you are constantly getting up to get things out of the storage bin above you or losing them under your seat. the ba lounge in lax was ok nothing great although the food was decent and their south lounge in lhr terminal 5 was just ok  very busy and crammed with people. nowhere to relax and enjoy some downtime. the food was the worst weve ever experienced in a lounge only things available were horrible little sandwiches a few cookies and drinks. since lhr is the hub for ba we expected way more. however our biggest issue was with the staff on board the flights. they were highly erratic in quality. some were very friendly and helpful others were beyond rude. i had read that british air now has a new system where the same staff does not do the same routes on a consistent basis. there are apparently a lot of floaters who come and go and work different flights by choice. to me this seems like a big mistake and most likely causes the huge discrepancy in service. our flight home was an hour late ba seems to be late a lot based on the many reviews. they also managed to lose all of our luggage. we travel a lot and will no longer choose british airways as its too much of a russian roulette as to whether your service will be good or not. we travelled club europe from gatwick to paphos as we were going out to get married. the extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. as it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly 1000 extra on club europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didnt really benefit from that. the lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didnt get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. we were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the club europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment i had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. the seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was extra room it wasnt what id have expected. our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. i dont know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid i think we were entitled to have higher expectations. not an ideal way to start our wedding experience. wed never travel club europe again it was a complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on the rest of the holiday london lhr to houston iah to london lhr. t5 in heathrow is crazy we been up and down the lifts and get train to other gates. we got boarding first then people comes in the plane. when the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land. the seat was uncomfortable old and tired. the cabin crew were so miserable. osllhr june 8th. two days after arriving i departed still less my checkin bag from june 6th. flight delayed this is more often than not on most ba flights i have been on. food offered in economy same chicken tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. i would rather have the option to buy something i might want to eat. cabin crew brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but its the only reason they have any customers. club europe  supposedly premium  had the misfortune of seat 1f  normally a great seat in club europe  but for a 4 hour flight lgw to ace  cramped not quite as bad as the rest of ce with new  not advertised  30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch  no window just a wall. add to this limited luggage space think its easyjet with middle seat free for 600 more. is it worth it  no thinking avoid ba ce offering  shame ive a few flights to suffer yet. purser  this is it now  get used to it  service downhill too. we travelled to and from europe in business class for a two week mediterranean cruise. we upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. my first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. the seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. the food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about take advantage of the scones and clotted cream  their only saving grace. upon our return we awaited in london heathrow terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. it finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite c  it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. she did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. well i am here to tell all  dont pay the money. there is little to no difference in first class. the seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and i still felt like a second class citizen. this time i think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selectionchoice. to tell you the truth if i had paid for this upgrade i would have been upset as i dont believe this is up to par. we also did a connector flight from venice to london on the saturday. the airport was a disaster 3 cruise ships all flying out the same time no organization from the agents and very little help. when we got on the other side of the check in the multimillion dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. when we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. the last part is not fully bas fault they dont design the airports or determine airspace closure however their agents did nothing to make it better either by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates. all in all i dont believe i will ever fly ba again  this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard  now they are barely sweeping up the floor wish they had  at least it may have been cleaner. paphos  lgw 11th june. we had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from ba to confirm this. we arrived at paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. ba had 3 check in counters open one of which was for club europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. we had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. i then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasnt one. after 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. the food options were ok but again not a great choice for veggies. the flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. we were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. overall just an ok flight but bas premier european product is somewhat underwhelming. i flew lhryvr outwards 20th may 2014 on 747. the cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th june 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. the whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the tv set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do ba sell these seats. i would be unlikely to book 1st class again with ba unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin. lgw  paphos 4th june. check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. as we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. the lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. the food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. my wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. having been told when we checked in that the flight was bang on time the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. after a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. no pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. the crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane 737400 should not have been used on this route. my wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed fa said she could have hers. it was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. i was told that there was only one option left for me and i could have kedgeree or kedgeree so thats what i had. it was ok but not particularly hot. arrived at paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. overall the flight was just ok although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. my wife did receive an email from ba within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough. business class from shanghai to london. it was the worst business class. staff give the impression that they are above service and i did not feel that they were courteous or polite. on one occasion i asked for a glass of champagne and never got one on another occasion when i dropped my fork for the meal and buzzed for another one no one came when i tried to grab the attention of the staff member walking past he said sorry sir ill be right with you and never came. eventually i just went to the back and grabbed one. i would never fly ba again for the money you pay you can get much better business class and value from other airlines. i flew from edinburgh to heathrow and then on to jfk and returned from las vegas. the flights in the uk were fine but the flight to jfk and from vegas to heathrow were terrible the seats were narrow and the food was disgusting both ways. we travelled cancun to lgw in business class. to the point i didnt think the experience was as good as virgin and emirates who i normally use. airport staff were helpful although i was surprised there was no lounge access at all  we got 2x usd 22 vouchers for the restaurants in the airport. cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. dinner and winedrinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner. seat and space was ok although functionality on seat not as good as emirates or cathay. my friend had no direct access to aisle and had to jump over another passengers legs. breakfast was sub standard. i was excited to fly on the new a380 with the new seating. we sat in 14j and 14k. when we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. i sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and i inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. the power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. we had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. i not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. this is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger. i was told i would be contacted by a representative but that did not happen. world traveller plus from beijing to london lhr. old and tired 747400 these planes really should be pensioned off now. the cabin was freezing with everyone wrapped in blankets for the whole flight. complaints to the cabin crew just got a sorry we have no control over the air temperature response. veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so i had to have fish. video screen is tiny on these planes  not that it mattered as the system wasnt working properly so i couldnt watch any films. pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight. sound system for communicating with passengers was very distorted so it was impossible to understand any announcements from flight deck or cabin crew apart from a little bit of extra leg room ive no idea what extra money for world travel plus is supposed to be for. we travelled to and from europe in business class for a two week mediterranean cruise. we upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. my first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. the seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. the food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about take advantage of the scones and clotted cream  their only saving grace. upon our return we awaited in london heathrow terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. it finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it

closure however their agents did nothing to make it better either by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates. all in all i dont believe i will ever fly ba again  this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard  now they are barely sweeping up the floor wish they had  at least it may have been cleaner. flew lhrcptlhr as british airways is only carrier flying direct london to cape town. outward flight due to leave 21.30 delayed by nearly 3 hours and the communication at the departure lounge was abysmal lots of unhappy passengers at the lack of information being given out. fell asleep when finally got on board only to be woken an hour later to be given my special meal which i hadnt requested. told stewardess it was not for me and she rather huffily took it away. when the trolley came round with the regular meals i was not offered one  this suited me as i dont relish eating at 1 oclock in the morning but thought it rather petty of them to ignore me. return flight was on time but had passenger from hell next to me who was too large for the very narrow economy seats so i spent the night sitting at an angle as it was impossible to sit straight with mrs large spilling over onto my seat. well done to the stewardess who put up with her obnoxious behaviour with a long suffering smile. london lhr to hong kong on 27 may. was really looking forward to flying in the new a380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a b777. flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into hk. on boarding i agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. having ordered a vegetarian meal i let one of the cabin crew know that id swapped seats. when the meal was served i got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them  even though i had. before i could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. food was ok. cabin crew smiles were forced. serve the meal turn out the lights and disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the order of the day. no way was world traveller plus worth the extra money. flew lhr to larnaca and return 22nd april and 29th april in club europe. i had high hopes for business class albeit shortish haul but was somewhat disappointed. legroom not quite what i expect from business class 34 inches is hardly room to stretch out. the service was good but the choice of food was limited and again not what i expect from a business class experience. as for inflight entertainment oh dear. on a 4.5 hour flight i expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. if you didnt like the film tough. all in all i will not rush to pay the extra. lhrsea in first class. the experience was really a step back in time. having arrived in london on jal after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class i had high expectations of my premiere flight in ba first. suffice to say i wont be back. whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats its crowded ugly and lacks privacy. the whole cabin  and this is new first i might add  feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. the seat itself is narrow and displeasing. crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. that sums it up really  ba is simply not offering a worldclass product. i cant imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no highprofile asian or middle eastern alternative available and even then id probably go out of my way to avoid them. i suggest that ba product managers might want to go on a world tour via abu dhabi tokyo hong kong and singapore and try out the competition because its plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just dont care. there is apparently a new new first class planned for the 7879 when it enters service with ba and i sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded first class. london  bkk premium economy 19614. i always travel eva air business but this time i had to get into bkk early having been told by many that ba business is at best rubbish i decided to save some cash and go peconomy seat no 14a remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and i was left with some sort of pasta dish  totally inedible. i must admit i didnt put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes  cold dry and hard. i was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. drinks g&t were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least i did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish  again poor. the only redeeming factors were i didnt go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 242 configuration unlike eva 121 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early. lhr to vie ba 704 23 june 2014. the meal service in euro traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the new mixed fleet crew the food offering was inedible a choice of flat bread with chicken tikka or a salad. do british airways not understand that not everyone likes curry or spicy food. at least do an offering of meat or cheese sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. as for the cabin crew this new mixed fleet with their thunderbird hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. at least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. this crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. i would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the duty free. i fly british airways every week and this is the worst crew i have known. i think the mixed fleet crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on ba start to bring back the high standards again the new mixed fleet crew are letting you down very badly. travelled from oz to watch start of tdf in leeds. ba cancelled 7.20am flight 1340 57 the day before due to staff issues and changed me to a 13.50 flight and then expected me to get on the 15.30 same day return to london. very poor and lame excuse. to make matters worse will not refund return flight of same day as on separate booking. amazed such a big airline cant manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to leeds to see the start of the 2014 tdf. what a disaster. london lhr to hong kong on 27 may. was really looking forward to flying in the new a380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a b777. flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into hk. on boarding i agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. having ordered a vegetarian meal i let one of the cabin crew know that id swapped seats.

inflight entertainment oh dear. on a 4.5 hour flight i expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. if you didnt like the film tough. all in all i will not rush to pay the extra. lhryvrlhr. flew in in first on very shabby 744 which was nothing like first was displayed on the bbc documentary about ba. squeezing so many passengers into the nose of a 744 is a joke. the staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail. ob were the old contract crew and ib was a standby mixed fleet crew not normal on this route. food from lhr was palatable and from yvr was awful. on the return leg the ife was faulty. the fast track ob was a free for all as we were bus fed to the aircraft on return how it should be. i feel the bbc has hurt ba with first passengers having their expectations raised to abnormal levels only to be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not as shown on tv. we were generally happy due to the fact that i used avios and an amex voucher for the flight if we would have paid for the flights then it would have been disappointing and would have chosen air canada. ba really do need to sort out their dated equipment sooner rather than later before more premium clients opt for other carriers especially on the middle eastern and far eastern routes. we will continue to use ba due to the avios rewards which demands loyalty for financial reasons i could not recommend for passengers having to pay for either cw or first. i flew glasgowgatwickvegasgatwickglasgow. i have flown this way before as i get to put my baggage on at glasgow and forget about it. glasgowgatwick no real comment other than cabin crew dont do much more than the minimum. flew premium economy on a 777200 flight was full. premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable. return flight of the same standard they kept trying to say i was booked back to edinburgh took them an age to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have found when flying ba that its best to carry snacks as they dont over feed you. of course when i got back to gatwick i ran into the french atc control strike no announcement made. after having to hang around gatwick all day i finally got a flight to glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to ba there. when i made a comment to ba customer service i was told by them that my flights had been cancelled due to aircraft unserviceability when i queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft us could offer no explanation as to why i was told different. i would like to complement ba but virgin totally beat them hands down. travelled from oz to watch start of tdf in leeds. ba cancelled 7.20am flight 1340 57 the day before due to staff issues and changed me to a 13.50 flight and then expected me to get on the 15.30 same day return to london. very poor and lame excuse. to make matters worse will not refund return flight of same day as on separate booking. amazed such a big airline cant manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to leeds to see the start of the 2014 tdf. what a disaster. lgwbgilgw club world rt. old careworn b777200. airplane was not clean both sectors. food outbound from gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. inbound airplane toilets reeked. at least food on return was slightly improved. cabin crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed  robotic. the club world seats are narrow and uncomfortable. the inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. screens poor and tiny selection of movies. bas so called business class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. i am amazed that british airways standards are so low and they get away with it. this is mere a to b transport. what is missing from their business class is class. flew lhr to mumbai return with my husband  very disappointing. the galleries lounge at terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by ba. the food was below average. unable to avail ourselves of the spa facilities as they were fully booked. not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue we had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of 240. when we boarded the aircraft boeing 747400 the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. the yin and yang seat configuration didnt work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. the seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. my ife did not work on the return flight. the inflight food was above average but not outstanding. checkin at mumbai for the return flight was very slow. we were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. the business class lounge at mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. no facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. the whole experience of bas club world was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again. very disappointed with my flight back from munich although its only 2 hours all that was offered was a small basket consisting of a packet of nuts or shortbread. the flight over to munich was considerably better being offered chicken curry wrap etc. we were told when booking this return in munich that there was only one seat left however once in the aircraft there were still seats left including one next to me however its really the snack offered thats my main bone of contention as we chose british airway in preference to the cheap budget airlines but we now find theres little difference in the on flight catering. i flew with british airways with my mother from paphos to manchester. she had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. i was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 ablebodied men i think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. i will never fly with ba again. roundtrip with family from jfk to hyd via lhr. onward flight was delayed at jfk by 2 hrs. was stressful with 10 month old and a 4 yr old. inflight service was good. transit at lhr was a nightmare mile long walk after alighting to central point in terminal 5. no gate information anywhere. had to checkin again they had to scan each and every food item for the baby though departing flight was from same terminal 5 had to now walk 3040 yards go down a level walk again to train get off second stop go up escalator again and walk another 50 yards to last gate  c63. now here the gate agent wouldnt let our carry on through. said it was too big. so had to remove all baby food and items for the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carryon. return flight again was delayed. had checked in at 3.30am for 6.40am flight but flight took off at 9.15am. transit at lhr was thankfully better this time. but the aircraft to jfk was an old 747  falling apart. no bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate us on another full flight. old seats kept reclining on its own. ac was blowing hot and cold until takeoff. had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old  no luck. never going to fly british again or pass through lhr again mad to lcy business. great lounge at madrid flight boarding very good food awful service poor arrival at lcy good however baggage awful all bags through but mine priority last off we flew to rome from newcastle via heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home i received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in heathrow was awful. we were left for 1 hour for someone to take us from the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take us to our flight connection so i had to push wheelchair myself. upgraded to business class on return flight from verona. absolute disgrace. flight left around 11.30pm but lounge closed at 9.20pm. lounge was awful dirty and very little in the way of business class facilities. flight was cattle class and i have seen more organisation and courtesy on an easyjet flight. boarding was like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent 20 minutes on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot conditions. flight had run out of food. worst flight in memory and absolute shocking customer service. absolute joke and how they have the audacity to claim it was business class they should be accountable n the trade descriptions act. lhrcphlhr business class. this is a joke. scruffy aircraft with ripped upholstery dirty cabin and chaoticslow service. i know its a short flight 90 mins but it shouldnt take over an hour to get one cup of cold stewed tea. flight attendants including their manager didnt seem to have a clue what they were doing. seats are actually narrow economy 3x3 configuration with the middle one kept vacant. inflight entertainment easy there isnt any. for the price i paid this was an absolute disgrace. i seriously think id have a better experience with easyjet. 122013. lhrlax. a380. aircraft was clean. seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the ife computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. there were no eye shades and ear plugs. food both ways the same selection tikka masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. fas lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. there was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. ifesystem is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences. this experience with british airways is not compatible to other flag carriers due to the lack in service and the restricted seating. ba206 from miami to lhr on upper deck dinner took over 3 hours to complete. 2 staff obviously not sufficient. very old 747 tv screens going from colour to b&w frustrating as had more than enough time to watch a couple of movies while dinner was not served. i have used ba over the past 20 years as i chose to move my airmiles to their plan regretted it ever since and will use them up as soon as possible. even when flying on a paid flight i find the staff snooty they have a bad customer attitude. at the moment i am trying to check in on a flight only chosen because it was the best option for my multiple stops and the on line check in does not work. told by staff member never mind just do it at the airport not much point in reporting it because they wont do anything for 24 hours. that is good customer service as you can only check in 24 hours before hand. i have had lost luggage twice on the same trip had my seat changed for no reason someone else was able to use my original choice so not a seat problem flights changed but was able to change them back to the original booking. i have travelled economy and premium economy and flown 10 hours with no inflight entertainment. travelled lhryyz ba97 on 9 july returning ba96 28july. checkin at lhr an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. galleries lounge at the south end of t5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. outbound aircraft was gbnlg surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. on boarding all the window shades were down 10.20 departure and stayed down for the entire flight including takeoff and landing most peculiar. the head cabin service person said it was to keep the sun out  i have questioned if this is a new ba policy for daytime flights. departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international business class elsewhere. immigration and baggage delivery in yyz very swift. for the return again the departure formalities were quick and painless  the lounge at pearson is ok but nothing special. aircraft this time was gbgyc the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with bas club world seating there is little stowage space and the whole backwardsforwards concept is something i personally dislike. food almost nonexistent on this 2310 departure and most people slept this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. unfortunately it was no better than going to mcdonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin  just awful. also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. is this service policy poor seat design or lazy crew flight on time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. all in all the experience was what i expect from ba these days average at best. 06.40 flight 4 august glasgow to london city cancelled with no explanation. typical ba service nobody about to assist with alternative arrangements or any concept of customer care. so much for the worlds favourite airline. third rate which is what i have come to expect from them. upgraded to business class on return flight from verona. absolute disgrace. flight left around 11.30pm but lounge closed at 9.20pm. lounge was awful dirty and very little in the way of business class facilities. flight was cattle class and i have seen more organisation and courtesy on an easyjet flight. boarding was like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent 20 minutes on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot conditions. flight had run out of food. worst flight in memory and absolute shocking customer service. absolute joke and how they have the audacity to claim it was business class they should be accountable n the trade descriptions act. ba 56 jnblhr 15 august 2014 business class a380 upper deck. the flight did not live up to expectations. too many seats makes business class cabin look crowded narrow seats with each row facing in opposite direction no problem with this but this impedes free movement for some of the seats specially the ones in the middle and window side also not much space for storage of personal items like specs etc. the window blinds of this section in upper deck were kept lowered through the entire 11 hr flight with no cue of any outside light whatsoever until we landed at heathrow and parked to the stand felt like sitting in a light proof box with artificial illumination. i thought you need to keep the blinds open for landing and take off the 747 business class is more comfortable than a380. we paid 2500 to upgrade to world traveller plus when we got to departure lounge we were upgraded to business class which was brilliant but air hostess made a point of letting us known plus other people that we had a free upgrade. on the return journey in world traveller plus not happy table broken and air steward very sarcastic food very bad plus stewards seemed as if they were doing you a favour. paid a lot of money to fly to maldives have no choice to fly ba to go direct stewards male or female need to remember that we are customers paying a lot of money for a service. on 28th july flew from edinburgh to gatwick. flight was delayed 3 hours as it had been hit by lightening on the flight this we accepted but what happened afterwards means i will never use them again. 1 information or details of what was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2 at no time was any refreshment offered. 3 the flight was further delayed to allow people to transfer back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight rather than wait to see what was happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4 no breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5 although they stated we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service was provided this consisted of 4 fluid oz cup of water between 7.00am and 2.30pm. 6 they then proceeded to leave our luggage at edinburgh while we travelled to gatwick. 7 after giving us the run around for an hour and a half they then decided to tell us they could not track our bags. 8 it then took them two days to locate them and send them from edinburgh to gatwick. would i use again or recommend  never in a month of sundays. i flew london to beijing in club world on ba039 on aug 7. the cabin was a disgrace. i sat in the upper deck seat 62a and what worried me was the filthy window the metallic looking tape on the emergency exit door and the foam strip that was hanging down. in addition the carpet and lockers were filthy inside. food and service were excellent but i will vote with my wallet and boycott ba from now on wherever possible. 18 august 2014 gatwick to orlando flight details and departure went well. however when the food was served on the flight there was limited choice chicken or sausages which was fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was pasta which my father in law doesnt eat so he ended up with 2 bread rolls as his lunchdinner. this was served within the first hour of our over 8 hour flight and then 7 hours later we were served a snack which only had one option coronation chicken chicken again which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. again my father in law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. pretty poor show british airways as we travelled with virgin to mexico in june this year economy class and they offered a menu with three choices for lunchdinner with enough for everyone again when the snack was served option were given and enough for all. virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films tv and games which was something you need on a long journey again ba was not able to provide. ba your competitors are definitely offering more value for our money i wouldnt not fly ba again as i dont like to limit my choices however i would definitely prefer to fly virgin in future. in my opinion all flights should have enough food for all of their passengers and look at what they are offering as coronation chicken didnt go down well with a large number of passengers whats happened to good old ham or cheese we flew the a380 from laxlhrjnblhrlax in august 2014 in business class. this plane was designed by someone who never flew it. the seats are so close together with no room on the window side to get out when the seats are flat. a person has to put up the foot rest for a place to stand and then step over the person next to them to get out into the aisle. in addition the person on the window seat gets all the food handed to them in front of the face of the person on the aisle. they have put so many people in each row that the seats are very narrow. there is virtually no place  a small drawer at the seat for personal items to be used during the flight without getting out of the seat to get something from the overhead. sad to say ba missed a big opportunity when their new 787 and a380 entered service. same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. compared to many airlines the ba premium service is poor and i dont know how they keep a 4 star rating. the cabin crew were excellent though i will concede. food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease laughingly referred to as jus which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess. the 787 was good and ba have improved their ife system but screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike those in economy and premium. pay more get less. i was on ba 835 from dublin to lhr on 25th july 2014 which left dublin at 13.05 and my travel plans were such that i had sufficient time to connect with my flight from lhr to hong kong. on leaving dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly on reaching lhr we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to gatwick and were running out of fuel. in summary we sat on the tarmac at gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for lhr and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. on reaching lhr ba staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a sorry and shrug of the shoulders and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. i was lucky as i managed to get on my flight to hong kong with cathay pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. whilst i understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that ba appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in bas absence in the top 10 airline ratings. could do a lot better booked a british airways holiday so thats flight and hotel from london city airport to florence peretola airport. either it came up from the ba rep. or my husband asked about an upgrade to business class and was told that would be an extra 300 for the return trip. as it was for a significant birthday he thought why not. reasons why noone should bother with this upgrade for this particular flight. 1 no separate ba lounge at either london city or peretola airports. 2 faster boarding entirely pointless when you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at florence. 3 bigger seats and more leg room they are small planes so the same throughout. 4 luggage off first no point when it takes over an hour to get through customs at florence. 5 better meal yes choice of meat or fish. very nice but worth 75 each the ba rep should have told us about the lack of facilities and suggest a hotel upgrade instead. it was a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday was great but we paid an extra 300 for no reason whatsoever. ba15 lhr to sin b777300er first class nice a four months old but a few signs of wear already. the seat 2k was reasonably private and reasonably quiet. useful wardrobe with enough space to put various items and shoes but the seat has almost no other storage space. things have to be left loose in the footwell area. footrest doubles as a buddy seat although his would be rather cramped id imagine. seat itself fine and comfortable. good enough to get reasonable sleep on a 12hr journey. cabin lighting and temperature perfect. view of outside restricted by the angle of the seat  just when it is interesting toff and landing you are strapped in and cannot see all the fun outside  the child in me i guess food and service excellent. the toilets  wow  a flimsy concertina door poor water supply into small bowl so not really good for brushing teeth. middleeastern airlines are so much better  ba really has to rethink. overall ba first class is equivalent to others business class. cabin crew very attentive  if only they had a better product to work with. travelled as a family of four to the maldives. despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didnt get seats together on the outbound journey. the plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. this seems to be an issue on ba routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to mauritius. on that trip the entertainment system failed all together. on the return journey from male i watched what i thought to be a three part crime drama called the tunnel. only after watching the third part did i discover that there was a fourth or more why why would you not have all the story this experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the ba service in business on this route. when you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. they dont need the space would also have been nice to sit together food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. a ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. there seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. on the outbound journey i pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. i returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didnt notice me. presumably this is why they didnt see the service request either. on the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. food was equivalently poor. this is the second ba business class trip ive taken to the maldives and each time i have been disappointed given the cost. ive also travelled economy on emirates to male which was actually better and business on emirates which was fantastic. i know ba have monopoly on the direct route from gatwick to male but i will be going via dubai on emirates in future. lgwmcolgw 1125th august economy class. got to the gate lounge to be told our seats has been reallocated to another seat this was the reason why  it was because there was a big family party that didnt want to separate  considering i paid a lot of money for my family to sit all together. got on to the plane thinking it would be the same as virgin atlantic but no it wasnt it was an old plane tatty one as well. food and drinks were limited on the whole 9 hour flight no snacks on board. the food was limited and when we got ours the people in front decide to recline there chairs in front so within that we have told hold our dinners luckily we didnt get burnt. well sorry ba next time i am flying with va im regularly flying perthhong konglondonport of spain these days. perth to london is via cathay pacific business class which is excellent. sadly i then have to swap to ba for london to trinidad where club world is a euphemism for slum in the sky. cathay pacific business class seats  4 across the width of the aircraft. ba club slum  8 across. if youre on a night flight that means tripping over people or being tripped over. decor is abysmal service is average to poor. seat and personal space design is lousy  but theres not much space to work with. film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue 625 lines tvs of the 80s. the overall impression is a dreary coffinlike space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service. dont do it fly with someone else  anyone else booked a british airways holiday so thats flight and hotel from london city airport to florence peretola airport. either it came up from the ba rep. or my husband asked about an upgrade to business class and was told that would be an extra 300 for the return trip. as it was for a significant birthday he thought why not. reasons why noone should bother with this upgrade for this particular flight. 1 no separate ba lounge at either london city or peretola airports. 2 faster boarding entirely pointless when you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at florence. 3 bigger seats and more leg room they are small planes so the same throughout. 4 luggage off first no point when it takes over an hour to get through customs at florence. 5 better meal yes choice of meat or fish. very nice but worth 75 each the ba rep should have told us about the lack of facilities and suggest a hotel upgrade instead. it was a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday was great but we paid an extra 300 for no reason whatsoever. when will they learn. i flew ba to dubai last friday in business. let me sum it up. boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive. can the product get any more unimaginative. the inflight entertainment was out of touch with modern media the screen so poor i couldnt see the movie and gave up. the sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that i think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is again horribly dirty. coffee was spilt on all the wipeable areas around my seat. in business you expect better. it is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any means and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyers. when i can i chose a different airline. we flew ba gatwick to grenada  first time with ba and only due to dates having been dedicated virgin customers. we upgraded to premium economy and apart from the extra leg room ideal for hubby but no odds to me at 53. no benefit and total waste of money at almost double cost of upgrading with virgin service was not great and food was awful  welcome on board drink in premium economy was orange juice in round plastic carton. virgin offers orange juice or champagne in a glass. no idea what food was on offer as no menu provided and just a disgruntled chicken or beef response when asked stewardess. old and tatty plane very small tvs. first and last time flying with ba  will change dates of holiday in future to ensure virgin flight. overall this overpriced upgrade didnt even compare with virgins economy service. i would strongly recommend dont waste your money or better still go with virgin. we flew indirect to orlando and back  although the miamiorlando orlandodallas and dallaslondon flights were with american airlines ba partners. the ba flight ba0209 was an old plane  the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor. your own screen but no control over the films which all ran at different times. having only flown virgin and singapore long haul ba rated way behind in all aspects. but that was nothing compared to the 737300 we flew on with american airlines from dallas to london ba 1531. i understand they are upgrading their fleet and i can see why having flown on the old plane we were unfortunate enough to fly on. the first 20 mins the plane stank like a toilet to the extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest delayed take off. the inflight entertainment was a joke  a poor quality shared screen with 30 others two films and no choice. the crew were the unfriendliest i have ever encountered  no meet and greet or goodbyes. i thought booking through ba would ensure some level of quality and that they would demand a certain level of quality from their partners but unfortunately not. the worst flight ever we are a family of five and i will not be flying ba again. travelled with ba from rome to lhr. staff at rome were wonderful what a contrast to heathrow. entirely through my own fault i left my passport on the plane. when i asked for assistance three members of staff at the helpdesk did anything but help. in itself this may not seem terrible having got myself into this situation but when they did finally deign to speak to me they told me the plane had left. i pointed out that the plane was still outside the terminal building. their response was to ignore me. i finally found one very polite helpful well informed and kind person who did help. he was a trolley collector london to budapest on club worldnow i dont even mention the fact that my luggage hasnt arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off you can sit in the new slimline type of seatwhich is thinner than the previous ones and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seats why not squeeze in another 2 extra rows which means that the leg space is less than half as it was in the old days  so exactly like in economy class. so you pay 300 dollars more for 3 stale finger sandwich and a scone  what a bargain shame on you ba for the lousy service. will never fly with them again. i have flown twice with ba now in business class to and from delhi and i have to say it has been absolutely poor me and a few colleagues flew out to new delhi for a business trip. ba were the pioneers of aircrafts after all they did create the concorde. key word in that is were theyve basically turned into a no frills airline. allow me to explain the blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a tft which had the same image quality as vhs tape the decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film airplane you still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor  and there was none. the plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. the toilets are exactly the same as economy except in business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. the food was ok but again nothing special. normally its the little things that make the differences but with ba they need a total make over. for a flight that happens everyday from london to delhi ba should be doing more. the decor of the plane matched the experience i got with ba dull. i wont be flying long haul with them again. my advice  avoid ba and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you. ba12 15th august 2014. in my mind that when i bought the ba tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. it turned out to be totally wrong. i used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with ba from changi airport to heathrow was the worst in so many ways. not worth money spent at all firstly the seat space was really small i cant imagine those who are bigger than i am because i am a medium size person. secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. they only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls. lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. the movies selection must have been 2 years old. flimsy earphones and outdated screens. all in all an unhappy customer. first and last time flying with ba upgraded the 4 of us to premium economy at 199 each for 4 of us a complete waste of money. have done this with virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive. food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food. none of us could eat the food it was so bad. on a 9 hour flight we were hungry. dont waste your money upgrading i wish i had read reviews before i left. flew sydsin and had a reasonably comfortable trip. problem is i didnt see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking. service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks and plenty of water. everyone rather terse i thought and not helpful. not my favourite to fly. the aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people. gatwick to cancun 777200 club world return in july. old plane which i think ba use out of gatwick. food  i cant understand how they can get it so wrong. we flew virgin upperclass to cancun but had to use ba this year due to dates will not use ba again. cabin crew not too bad but could be better. save your money or go with virgin. 9814 lhrewr in wc. clean aircraft but moderate dysfunction of armrest foot stool and video screen. we find this seating configuration very uncomfortable and will avoid ba when possible. one fa spent this flight chatting w. friend to the blockage of aisle and detriment of service. dinner was fairly horrid beef except for salad and cheese. late departure and 40 min late arrival with no explanations given. lhrmctlhr. excellent outbound flight. tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isnt up to much in terms of choice. different story on the way back though. standoffish cabin crew and no white champagne. rose only as we havent been fully catered. not a big thing but indicative of how slip shod ba can sometimes be these days. the seat is comfortable so i slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink. flew ba 215 lhrbos in economy on an ageing 747. flight was 45 minutes late taking off. seat was uncomfortable and cramped.meal served was overcooked slop. ife had glitches but worked eventually. overhead light didnt work. the larger people become and they are the less space ba seems to give anyone. the plus point was the politeness and professionalism of the cabin staff. just came back this morning on a flight from dubai  ba106. i was not impressed. the cabin crew were just not friendly or helpful. the plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. it look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. ba was so particular before whats happened the cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. the food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. i have to ask for water a number of times. there was no genuine warmth. it was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. id love to fly ba and support them but this is appalling. i would not recommended this  next time we are flying eremites. pay the extra. btw i noticed a number of other people have complained about this crew on the site too  seems consistently bad. i have flown lhrbkk many times with eva emirates oman and qatar. unfortunately this time i chose my national carrier. disappointed is not the word. to start with the seating arrangement is absurd. all the others manage 121 or 222. ba manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. when the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. food  ok there was a selection on the menu. however at service time i was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. on every qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. none of this with ba. once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. shabby is not the word. after a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. with no sign of a priority immigration pass being given i asked the steward for one. he replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. stupidly i believed him. upon departure at bkk no ground staff or passes. i return to the uk next week and for the first time ever i am dreading the experience. never ever will i fly my national carrier again. disgraceful. its any middle east airline again for me. qatar being my preferred choice. if there is an alernative i will never fly ba again. i used to travel ba and it was wonderful now it is like an old airline. i flew from seattle to london this summer on a 747 the leg room was not the best the plane looked tired and i was not impressed. i am disabled so it is difficult for me to travel anyway. when we went back to heathrow i asked for help to get to my gate and i was put in a pen with other disabled people waiting for our flights. no one told us that they do not send you down until your flight is getting due to leave. in that time we could have gone and had a meal. my flight back to seattle was on a b777. the aisles were narrow and the seats very narrow. i am only 53 but my knees touched the seat in front of me. it was very difficult for the people in the window and middle seats to get over me i had to get up out into the aisle for them to get out. being disabled to be up and down is hard especially in such a small space to manoeuvre ones legs. when people in front reclined it was awful. the food that was served was absolutely rubbish. what happened to the good ba service of a few years ago. no more ba for me if i can help it. considering our outbound flight to orlando was delayed a good 2 hours im not sure why i expected better service from ba coming home. over a day before our return flight was due there was already a delay posted bumping our flight up a whole three hours. the next morning we wake to find our flight now leaves at the break of the next day at half 12 in the evening we booked our flight to leave saturday so we would arrive home on sunday and be able to go back to work for the monday. but thanks to the reliability of british airways not only had we paid for two  now immensely  overpriced flights we will be loosing money from not being able to attend our jobs absolutely disgusting show from ba i honestly wouldnt even chance a brief flight with them for fear of having to cancel numerous plans due to the ineptitude of a shoddily run business i wont be recommending ba in fact i will actively encourage everyone i meet to avoid their awful business at all costs lhrhannover germany. you really wonder sometimes with ba. i paid 940 return and what a joke. last year i flew stuttgart and berlin in club for about600 and was very happy. firstly the flight ran from t1 at lhr. t5 club lounge is rather good. on first sight the t1 lounge looked ok. i arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. with a bit of grovelling i managed to get a plate of singapore chicken curry from the waitress. the whole food area consisted of a few miserable sandwichs peanuts and a miserable looking soup. drinks ok. flight was an a319 which left about 40 minutes late. couldnt be bothered to eat the prawn salad  which actually looked ok. fas were fine. in summary a real big ba con. flight was one hour and at 450 per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight in first to jfk. a miserable experience. 9814 lhrewr in wc. clean aircraft but moderate dysfunction of armrest foot stool and video screen. we find this seating configuration very uncomfortable and will avoid ba when possible. one fa spent this flight chatting w. friend to the blockage of aisle and detriment of service. dinner was fairly horrid beef except for salad and cheese. late departure and 40 min late arrival with no explanations given. flew heathrow  madrid return. have always been loyal to ba but no longer. t5 lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere  not particularly pleasant. bags not tagged priority. fast track not fast. service on board to madrid was exceptionally good and old style ba. return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. very disappointing experience and unacceptable. could not select seats online for return flight as computer had allocated them. eventually seats changed when called call centre  told couldnt be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. waste of time and energy. practically everything suggested as part of the club europe package didnt happen. club europe used to be so distinctive and worth and i always felt it was worth the premium price. to be honest i have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which i will now be using for my regular flights to and from spain. used ba for a return trip to denver and was very disappointed. plane was old and tired cabin crew did the minimum required and food was basic. had flown emirates the previous month and ba cannot hold a candle to them from the warm towels wide seats great entertainment and shiny new planes. wont be looking to support ba again. orlando florida mco  london gatwick lgw. wed aug 27 return sun sep 7. we paid over 150 dollars more for our seats and didnt even get a choice of what we wanted for our meal. in addition the inflight entertainment didnt work on our return trip. 2 recent flights lhr to sfo 12 hrs  7th sept then san diego to lhr 9 hrs 21st sept ba 272. club world cabin. wife and i have flown business class on  singapore air new zealand emirates air malaysia and virgin on 20 occasions to new zealand by various routes so we are familiar with the service provided at this level by other airlines. ba in our opinion doesnt come close. briefly  being charged 284 extra to reserve seats how do they get away with it personally we felt uncomfortable with the backtofront seat layout too enclosed and awkward to get out of we were in the inner cell and i would imagine irritating for the outside passengers as well to have people clambering over their legs. details  hot towels threadbare scraps of cloth that were stone cold in under ten seconds and then only one and nothing for morning wakeup cheap looking menus lukewarm tea and coffee thrust over the barrier in mugs a sudden rattle as the screen was lowered and a basket of bread rolls thrust under your nose having to reach out sideways to receive meals embarrassment at disturbing the outside passenger trays passed over them minute napkins expect paper sheets anytime soon cabin crew just doing their job walking up and down the aisles at great speeds so as to avoid being asked for something cold soggy croissants which are an insult to croissants and dont get me started about the bacon roll we were offered a drink before dinner and had to ask for a topup one glass of wine with dinner dry tough steak and a refill after we had finished eating no after dinner drinks were offered. lights outsee you in the morning i could go on but suffice to say we are so disappointed that our national airline could be so far behind the others. ba1326 lhrncl 18092014. as is the norm flight departed late. cabin crew somewhat passive aggressive. going through security at t5 prior to boarding was a more customer friendly experience. landed with the customary jolt at ncl. is there an alternative of course not not an experience to make me want to make ba my long haul carrier of choice. and an experience which is repeated frequently. airbus 321 from amman jordan to london. flight on time. full plane. very uncomfortable seats i am tall no leg room knees against the seat in front for the flight of over 5 hrs. this is the wrong plane for this tripnarrow single aisle only 2 toilets for all 180 passengers  more like a bucket and spade flight. food very moderate salad starter of 3 leaves and an uncut chunk of cucumber main course of chicken and potato was tepid not hot at all. cabin crew spent a lot of the time chatting in the galley at the back of the plane although the food service was quick. upgraded on the outward tripwhat a difference ba needs to sort the plane choice outthis flight is often completely full. economy was very poor. ba 084. yvr to lhr on august 28 2014. premium economy. much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on ba. staff were indifferent and inattentive. the meals were deplorable despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service  a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. hardly suitable food for a long flight. breakfast was worse  an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. very poor a number of seats in this cabin have metal boxes underneath rendering the muchadvertised additional leg room useless. ife far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming. a very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost. vie to lhr  seats were of the new configuration only 30 inches both in club and economy. the seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. the new cabin looks very small with the new seats and i would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with ba now. the service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations. i hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. ba short hall can now be classified as a low cost carrier now they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs. traveled to rome with british airways. on the way there everything went fine. a day before our departure we were told that the flight was overbooked and asked politely to change to a different flight. we were told that they would pay for the taxi the flight was earlier and no public transport was available. as well as for the breakfast that we were missing at our hotel. we agreed to change because we sympathized with ba representative who had a difficult job of asking people to move to a different flight and because we wanted to support british airways. big mistake. apparently everything we were told by their representative was a lie and no refund for the taxi fare was given to us. so much for doing ba a favor they are not a reputable company they once were. flew from ist to lhr on september 29. in short an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly 4 hours. it started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and lowquality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gates. i have used the star alliance lounge at ataturk airport and it is light years ahead of the ba lounge. the plane was an ancient b767. the business class seats had little leg room or recline were packed out hard and very uncomfortable. it took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts. this was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began. there were only two choices nothing vegetarian. the crew were disengaged disinterested and dismissive. the entertainment system consisted of only several old screens suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie godzilla which doubtless was a big hit with the 12 year olds in the audience. at the end of the flight we were given fasttrack cards to speed up our passage through customs. unfortunately only 3 of the 6 fasttrack booths were open and we ended up effectively in the slowtrack line. to add insult to injury this business class flight cost 200 more than that of its competitor turkish airlines and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the ba website. shame on british airways for this product. flew the new 787 business class from phi to lhr. the aircraft was impressive. it was quiet and comfortable. the lower altitude cabin and the higher humidity were not noticeable in flight but the lack of jetlag was noticeable. service was very good. the business cabin was 23 empty. the cabin crew were very attentive. the negatives was the seating and entertainment system. with the large windows the rear facing seats were a poor design. the feeling of closeness was uncomfortable. i guess the extra seat they squeeze in makes it all worth while to the airline. the amount of choices in all the video selection and the content left a lot to be desired. return was in a 777. the seating and entertainment were the same this and the a380 use to be my favorite airplane. however the 787 has become favorite airplane now. i think it is the last time i will fly ba business class until they change their seating. singaporelondon heathrow  i did not really see the ba hospitality. the entertainment was poor and the seat very uncomfortable. this experience makes me very frustrated the only good thing was the low price. lhr to yvr. september 29 2014. ive been a loyal ba passenger for years but after three recent flights thats not going to be the case any more. how ba have the audacity to screen ba a very british airline on their ife is beyond me while the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different. the food on ba85 lhr to yvr was atrocious  dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown sauce. the service was unsmiling unhelpful and inattentive. ba used to have a good ife selection. not anymore very unimaginative selection of films tv and audio programs. ive recently travelled on qantas and air canada on long haul and both carriers far superior to ba. air canada has significantly improved its standards. hannover  lhr. what a miserable experience this was. this return ticket was 950 for a total of about 140 mins flying time. i checked in online and there was considerable delays on this as there was following a phone call back to the uk an equipment change from an a319 to an a320. anyway i checked in online eventually and made my way through security. i asked an information post  as to where the club  business class lounge was and i was told it was land side and between this terminal and the next terminal. i could not believe it. surely a simple prompt online when checking in  could have told me this. flight left on time a reasonable light lunch and three gin and tonics later we got stacked over the east end for 25 minutes but landed ahead of schedule. a miserable experience from the so called worlds favorite airline. b787. just returned from a london  toronto  london flight. ba appear to be proud of their new dreamliner but they have scored a real owngoal by cramming 9 seats into each row 333. the only way this has been achieved is by fitting seats that are far narrower than the norm. we are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this was the first time i have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat  and i am quite slimlybuilt unless ba changes their 787s to a lesscramped layout i will now have no alternative but to make sure i am not flying in a 787 thus often avoiding ba altogether. i will let a ba steward have the last word the first time i sat in one of these seats i could not believe how bad they are  and he like me is slim. come on ba  start having a little regard for your customers comfort and health. vie to lhr  seats were of the new configuration only 30 inches both in club and economy. the seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. the new cabin looks very small with the new seats and i would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with ba now. the service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations. i hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. ba short hall can now be classified as a low cost carrier now they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs. lgw to szg. absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. booked flights to salzburg for travel in september way back in april and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. luckily we arranged an overnight stop in gatwick as we live in the north of england as otherwise dont know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. we were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at gatwick for 5am. this is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with ba. our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. having taken the trouble to complain to ba i am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service. ba need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice. i would not trust or travel with them again. ba92 41014 yyzlhr b787 gzbje. if you want to know what ryanair long haul will be like sit in e on the ba 787. appalling legroom seat width and non functioning ife. gold card holder flying around 200 trips a year. absolutely horrendous experience good luck to anyone taking the 12hr trip to chengdu on it new plane with the smallest seats ever. many passengers tried to stand the entire trip to avoid the discomfort if you are anything more than a medium build and have a bum and hips you will have a very uncomfortable flight. i am not one to moan but this is the end for me ba just took british from london to seattle. tired airplane. flew business class. very basic service. no wifi. nobody checking to see if you were interested in something to drink. basic packaged food. very disappointed. 777200 4class refitted with the new world traveller and wt plus cabins. lhrdellhr. very disappointed. on the outbound flight the food choice was gone before they reached the 4th row of the economy cabin meaning that myself and the rest of the cabin had to have the second choice meal  second choice for good reason. it was a truly unpleasant tray of food. the real issue is the introduction of possibly the largest entertainment equipment box in the floor space i have ever seen. it literally takes up half of the floor and prevents you from stretching both legs out. i dont know if this is exclusive to the refitted b777s but it is certainly a side effect of the new ife and isnt there on the the older cabins. the box seems to be under every window seat on both sides of the cabin. i really dont understand what the cabin designers were thinking allowing this box to take up so much of the space that is already so precious. they could have at least rounded off the corners. it seems rushed and last minute. this means that i am now avoiding ba when booking a trip if they are operating the b777 on the desired route. bye bye executive club silver. booked a seat in world traveller ecomomy for an extra €60 each way. this was to get an exit seat with legroom and a window. seat was advertised as window exit. yes it was an exit seat but there was no window at the seat. the slide  raft box protruded from the exit door greatly reducing the amount of space for legroom. seat beside me was empty but a guy was quickly moved into it when he asked for it despite us having to pay €60 each way for these seats. stewardesses were friendly but service was almost non existent. the child portion chicken dinner was in no way filling. was hungry throughout whole flight. no food or snacks offered until about 1.5 hours before landing when i was given a cheese roll with no butter or mayonnaise completely dry and unappetising. without being completely detrimental to ba i have found the airline has become tired and lacking in customer service from the cabin crew as i fly economy class at company expense this class of traveler is viewed by the cabin staff as something to be tolerated until the end of the flight. the aircraft that i fly on from london to mexico city are 747400 these aircraft have obviously travelled many hundreds of thousands of air miles the seats are mostly very worn and hard a 12 to 13 hour flight leaves one with a very numb part of the anatomy toilets seats are more often than not insecure or broken. food offered is now without a menu you get what you are given or go without from two choices the famous ba breakfast is now no more just a sandwich or a frozen roll. the inflight entertainment is often non functional and regular resetting of the system is quite normal sound quality is always very bad. my comments are not directed at just one flight or one aircraft only i have seen this deterioration over quite a few years whilst i fully appreciate economy and money saving is todays norm major airlines to my mind should think customer satisfaction at all levels not just the first class and business class customers. i have seen other airlines achieve and maintain very high standards in todays economic world of airline travel but sadly ba seem to be trailing to an embarrassing extent. travelled to cyprus from gatwick in economy as thought this would be fine as use them internally in uk. as we are tall thought seat pitch would be same as home. wrong. dreadful flight in extremely cramped cabin my husband was virtually trapped by the seat in front and the only saving grace was that we had a spare seat in between us otherwise i think we would have been standing most of the way. poor service and truly awful food if you could call it food. wrap and small roll with nice chocolate dessert. wrap was soggy and inedible roll dry and hardly had any filling. only one round of drinks then tea etc with food on a flight of4.5 hours. really smelly toilets and air conditioning poor. aircraft old and just a bad flight experience. took off late too have travelled in considerably better flights with charter airlines and following this experience will not be patronising ba again in economy once we have suffered the return flight have gone business class which is good but economy is dreadful. dont even think about flying on this airline. booked paid for and confirmed last february for a premium economy flight singapore to sydney for last saturday. when i checked in at changi the checkin staff member told me the incoming flight from london was overbooked and i was downgraded to economy against my wishes obviously. i would never have booked ba but for the premium economy offering so huge disappointment. gb75 compensation is simply not good enough. add to that the economy meal was inedible what did they do to the seafood curry. never again. ba1326 lhrncl. 10.10.14. i arrived on time at lhr from brazil using a different carrier. journey thus far was enjoyable and on time. i know that that shortest final hop up to the north east is usually the most problematic and unpleasant so i arrived fully expecting to land at newcastle and get home late. however yesterday morning i was wrong my flight wasnt running late it was cancelled i had a particularly revolting encounter with one of their professionals in t5. my courtesy and understanding towards the inept individual who was there to assist delayed passengers was rewarded with the cheap nasty passive aggressive and generally dismissive attitude which is offered so frequently by ba these days. no apology or empathy just waffle and rubbish. its just simply not good enough and a terrible reflection of what our flag carrier has become. to cut a long story short i arrived at ncl seven hours late. and no surprises my luggage was left behind at t5. but then again ba only had seven hours to transfer it onto my flight. well done ba simply the worst customer service that i have ever experienced anywhere ba038 pek to lhr 280914 business class b747400. first time i have flown ba long haul and in view of the many unhappy travellers on this site  i was keen to see for myself. i can honestly say i have never experienced such a dreadful flight. antiquated and filthy plane is an experience i would never want to make again. the seating in business class downstairs is a disgrace i was unlucky enough to have the aisle seat 17g which turned in to a flat bed so narrow my body and i am small was over the main aisle when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed. absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing and waiting the kitchen area could see my every move. completely unacceptable. no mattress and only a small blanket. there is nowhere to put even a pair of glasses or a bottle of water once the tray table was put up necessary to sleep. to get to the centre seats where my husband was  a dirty plastic ‘window had to be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space what there was of it. my husband said the middle seats trapped passengers in and getting out involved stepping over people. extremely difficult for short people. the whole design of the business class seats is very uncomfortable and seriously flawed. the food was badly presented and unappetising. the pa system from the flight deck was inaudible i could not hear the captain in the pre flight information announcement the other issue was a very mediocre in flight entertainment system which took an hour to get going and even the flight tracking information was not available for the whole flight. they werent overly concerned just superficial apologies. the toilets were filthy and grimy. the floor edges and all around the basin area where bits were falling off were thick with dirty grease. i looked into the galley and that too including the floors and edges of preparation benches was full of grime. total disgrace. the cabin crew seemed in a state of disorganised chaos having a great view of seeing it all from my seat. very little contact with passengers other than rather arrogant looks all round. needless to say i will never travel ba long haul again. they need to get on to an emirates airline and see how it should be done. as a regular longhaul traveller on emirates the difference between these companies is indisputable. perhaps the socalled ‘loyal ba customers have never been on a emirates flight to compare the difference. osllhr in business. ba has over the last few years put less priority on oslo and sas today has a better offering. ba is the only flag carrier in oslo that does not offer fast track security. the menzies ground staff are doing their best but does not have any authority to help when things go wrong. particularly the evening flights are very often delayed due to late incoming aircraft from lhr and i have several times been an hour or more delayed and lost intercontinental flights as a result. the deicing procedure is also much slower than on sas. the lounge in oslo is nice but not magnificent. ba has better service in business class than sas with better food and free middle seat. you do however pay much more than for sas plus. the crew was friendly and did their best on my last flight but seemed badly trained forgot to serve bread with the meal and spent a lot of time chatting in the galley. one sometimes miss the old well trained ba staff. sas also very often offer internet access on the london flights which is a plus. heathrow to bergen business no priority boarding bus out to plane which was packed  a bad start. aircraft cold slow cabin service and in fact glad to get off. food was ok the cooked english breakfast was nice. lhrden denlhr  always use upper class in va when i can. this flight reminded me of just why i rarely fly ba. most of the crew were disinterested. i raised a couple of points but i was told i was wrong both times. asked for another glass of wine twice with my main the stewardess forgot and denied that i had even asked for one. food going out was pretty good but coming home just awful. i for one can just not get my head round the seat formation. you stare at some stranger on take off and landing food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face. i flew one way mcolgw 6th october the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations british airways has lost a customer for life. i requested assistance due to illness which i couldnt have at orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait when boarding they wouldnt let me board without checking with three people just because i was young and didnt appear to need assistance. after this i could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldnt even ask if i was ok. the drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. the meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. the 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. why do they need to be chilled room temp would make them a bit better. the head rest was hanging off its housing when i boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. the ife screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both virgin and thomson on this route. when i got to gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance  if you dont look old then you shouldnt need assistance. never again ba. flew from london to calgary. the seats in the new dreamliner are awful. it was bad enough sitting in the seat but when the person in front of me lowered his seat it became impossible. his seat was right on my legs that shows how little room there is on these planes. staff started serving meals all of a sudden went by about 7 or 8 rows of us and forgot to come back to feed us. a319 barcelona to heathrow business no announcements for boarding so missed any chance of priority boarding. why pay extra for something you are not going to get cabin service slow  over an hour until meal served had to ask for another drink as only 1 small bottle given. they also ran out of the main choice meal and the cabin was not full had second choice meal and this was cold. to fly to serve  i think not. terrible service for an airline that is supposed to pride itself on service. ba213 heathrow to boston 290914 b747. there was nothing at all to commend this flight. i have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. the seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. the business lounge at heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. at 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. when staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. never once in two hours did i see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. on boarding i was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as i have been on other airlines. when i asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker  i was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. again i have always had help on business flights on other airlines. in the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. the level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. add in poor food and ife and decision to avoid ba flights in future was made for me. i fly the pos to lgw route on a fairly regular basis and the punctuality of the flight is bad. i suffered two 6 hour delays within 5 weeks on this route. the air steward wasnt friendly at all and was borderline aggressive when asking passengers to take a seat when the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. the inflight entertainment needs updating. the screens are small and the resolution low. the seats were not comfortable either and you can feel every movement of the passenger which is sat behind you whenever they reached for something in the seat pocket. lgwagp and back. 737400s on both journeys. these aircraft are looking very tatty now  seats worn cabins grimy and dingy. the food was a soggy halfwrap with a fillingfree miniature roll  it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. no choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. the claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash  we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. although we benefited from it on this trip ba need to change their hand luggage policy. there simply isnt space for 150 passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip both flights were completely full. on the upside both flights were on time and the crews were friendly  the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group. travelled to palma in new ba sardine business class. uncomfortable seats with ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. poor service. despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later causing misery. other passengers also shocked at conditions. if this is the new look business class ba then better off with easyjet or ryanair much cheaper and service could not be much worse. we have just flown economy class london to los angeles on the a380. outbound the meal was chicken which i do not eat so i was offered an almost inedible pasta dish. no more food was offered until 2 hours before landing chicken sandwiches i asked for a replacement cheese and chutney was offered. i was actually hungry by this time. return journey was chicken curry replaced by vegetarian lasagne. breakfast was awful a cardboard box containing a croissant jam cereal bar and a packet of dried cranberries. the service between meals was non existent. by far the worst airline food i have ever eaten. sorry no british airways for us. we flew london heathrow to singapore business class for the first time with ba and was not impressed  the cabin crew did the bare minimum they could get away with and as for the seating arrangement we just could not get our head around it  thank goodness we changed our seats prior to flight  we sat on the 2 outer seats that were ok though a bit narrow  felt so sorry for the people who sat in the middle seats as they had to face strangers on the take off and landing  we fly long haul on this route 4 times a year and can quite honestly say that after our experience with ba we would not wish to fly with them again. arrived at gatwick to find out that our prepaid for assigned seats could not be honoured due to an aircraft change. instead of three rows of seats a and b we were now slung across a single row with 4 middle seats and an aislewindow seat despite having requested and paid for the seat reservations 11 months ago. to make matters worse prem economy passengers had been bumped up to club world and were enjoying ab seats  total joke. food was ok crew were friendly enough but i will never travel ba again due to the absolute neglect or consideration for their premium customers. goodbye ba executive club and good riddance ba. how the once mighty have fallen. ba 0027 ex london hr to hong kong which departed 30914. hong kong to london sector on 17914. inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. it was a relief to get onto cathay pacific flight for next stage of my journey. how can two airlines be so different british airways is a disgrace. we travelled economy from manchester to toronto via heathrow the flight from manchester to heathrow and return was very good. the seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. the service from the cabin crew was excellent. the leg from heathrow to toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. the seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. unfortunately ba were let down by the attendants on the return leg from toronto to heathrow. whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable i have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. we had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. the lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. the steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. he did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. even after take off she had to ask again. when they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. the steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. this had not appeared by the time i had finished eating my meal so i gave her the bottle from mine my daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. the passengers on the other aisle were served about 15 mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. i asked for a glass of orange and a tea as i had not drunk anything on the 6 hour flight. the attendant scowled at me and then gave me half a glass of orange and half a cup of tea which was cold i did not see the attendants down our aisle smile at a customer once throughout the whole journey. flight lgw to tfs in business. like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be sardine class. seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour shorthaul narrower and with materially less legroom than before the same as economy. now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. one wants to like and use ba but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. unusually in my experience one of the fas was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too. lax to lhr  25 oct 2014. i agree with other reviewers that business class on the a380 is too crowded. i am a frequent business traveller to lax and if i had the choice i would rather be on the upper deck of the 747. the seats and small storage drawer if you are on the aisle feel cheap. service levels seem to be dropping in terms of drinks before dinner 1 instead of 2 and no attention to top up during the meal. my main course of fish was inedible due to being overcooked. the staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size cant blame them. we flew first on the outbound to lax which of course was better although the cabin feels quite sterile. considering switching to virgin. i have after years of loyalty finally had it with ba. every flight is late the catering gets worse and worse and the attitude of the crew has also deteriorated. i have taken 5 flights in 2 months and every single sector has been late. even the crew in first class have no idea what service means  i have to ask for things 2 or 3 times i am not offered anything unless i ask the food is inedible they tried to serve me a poached egg which i could have played squash with they ran out of bottled water in a flight out of lhr i cannot find any flights when i can use my free companion voucher or use my miles to upgrade. they wont even allow my pa to deal my flights for me. it just seems the rules and attitude of their management has become so far removed from their promise to fly to serve. flight 103 on october 14. we flew from london to calgary alberta  a long cramped ride. it was on the new dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs service almost nonexistent even on a 9 hour trip beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us row35 and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didnt even ask us whether we would like anything. when the coffee did come it was lukewarm. there was not one good thing about our flight. we will never travel british airways again. travelled from gatwick to orlando on the 24th october with ba and i was very disappointed. for a full service airline the service was no better than a budget carrier. we were travelling with 3 children in our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. both there and back the kids meals had run out by the time they reached us as had the edible options of adult meals. the cabin was hot which made for 2 very uncomfortable flights. we had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my daughter did because she was so hungry  had she not gone we wouldnt even of been aware that they were available. lesson learned  never fly ba again. lgw to cancun  flew with ba in cw. the galleries lounge at gatwick offers a terrible service  food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings priority boarding was announced for those travelling in cw unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. the crew were friendly and offered a good service. bas club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. the so called cw pantry is laughable soggy inedible wraps pasta served in plastic containers crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. the inflight meal was adequate but not memorable the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into its presentation the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. the return flight was awful the crew were miserable and clearly didnt want to be there. one member of the crew was very rude to an elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the seat and dared to ask for help. the meal just awful dry bland and totally inedible. the breakfast served prior to landing at gatwick consisted of a bacon roll which was vile the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew. 31.10.14  lhr to berlin tegel. flight out good modern plane clean food ok and cabin crew good even pleasant. return 3.11.14 1625hrs from berlin horrid. crew only interested in themselves. was tossed a cup of coffee and a snack. staff openly ate the left over food from business class in the rear galley. i have complained about this before but clearly ba dont find it unpleasant. the return crew reminded me why i try to avoid ba. brutorontobru 1st class. in bru check in passport control very long queues security fast track and lounge just fine but nothing very special. security in t5 with extra long queues and very little fast track. almost none. lounge in t5 a bliss in all respects. boarding ok although gate in t5b miles away. flight itself a disaster old tatty b747 in need of an urgent revamp. very used and ran down seats. cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. ran out of champagne. food not good at all. inflight entertainment and videos a bore with very old titles. bags not first out. return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track  lounge ok with option to dine before flying which i took in case food was same disaster as flight in. not full cabin this time so a little better service although quality is still zero. again london t5 lounge a breeze and fast and short flight to bru. ba275274 lhr to las vegas return in economy. both ways on 747400 aircraft both times aircraft were tired and in need of updatingrepairs. on the outbound flight bits of foam fillers hanging down on bulkhead wall. on return window blind brokenstuck. also on both aircraft the ife needed to be rebooted shortly after takeoff and was very ancient compared to other airlines. both aircrafts were very warm before engine start. the outbound plane cooled down but the return remained uncomfortably warm  opening airvents had little effect. very rowdy passengers on outbound flight but no action taken by the crew other than to stop serving drinks to the whole cabin for a period. on return flight crew seemed in a hurry to complete dinner service  hardly allowing enough time to eat food before returning to collect trays. food was good on both flights. overall the flights were on time and the seats were comfortable but difficult to get out of if the one in front was reclined. the service was functional but not particularly warm or friendly. it seems ba are either waiting to replace these 747s or have otherwise decided not to invest in the aircraft. terrible experience flying back from munich. flight delayed by several hours which meant arriving back into heathrow t5 at gone midnight after most of the public transport links had ceased running. nobody at ba available to help despite them knowing the flight was several hours late arriving which resulted in having to sleep at the airport floor overnight. appalled that ba would do this  it was an unpleasant experience but i coped but what about elderly travellers to make matters worse there was nobody available as a ba representative at munich airport during the delay until i complained. ba 0027 ex london hr to hong kong which departed 30914. hong kong to london sector on 17914. inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. it was a relief to get onto cathay pacific flight for next stage of my journey. how can two airlines be so different british airways is a disgrace. we travelled economy from manchester to toronto via heathrow the flight from manchester to heathrow and return was very good. the seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. the service from the cabin crew was excellent. the leg from heathrow to toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. the seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. unfortunately ba were let down by the attendants on the return leg from toronto to heathrow. whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable i have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. we had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. the lady in the seat next to me asked for a

then gave me half a glass of orange and half a cup of tea which was cold i did not see the attendants down our aisle smile at a customer once throughout the whole journey. flight lgw to tfs in business. like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be sardine class. seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour shorthaul narrower and with materially less legroom than before the same as economy. now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. one wants to like and use ba but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. unusually in my experience one of the fas was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too. i flew from mialhrdxb. the 747 like most of their crew is well passed its sell by date. the business cabin is tired and worn ife below standard seats are ok but nothing great. my biggest gripe were the crew on the second leg. we were in upper deck and found them quite inattentive and everything felt like a hassle but the best was to come. my wife and i had a sleep after dinner when we woke 2 hours before arrival we decided to have a drink. i pressed the call bell and ordered a baileys and a glass of wine. i was first told that the bar had closed which was nonsense after i complained they sent down a supervisor where a long argument presumed in which they basically told myself and my wife we were too intoxicated to have anymore drink the way they spoke to us was both condescending and humiliating and after all of this on clearly seeing we were nowhere near intoxicated they served us another drink. as a seasoned traveler i have never been spoken to like this before. we flew american in business on the way to mia and in stark contrast the business cabin was excellent on the new 777300 and the crew were only too happy to serve you. ba really need to have a look at themselves your crew by large seem to have an attitude problem see the paying passenger as an inconvenience rather they a valued customer. with such choice from dubai i will never travel ba again. if you want to pay thousands for a worn out badly designed seat to be insulted by crew who will go out of there way not to serve you book ba otherwise do yourself a favour and go with an airline that doesnt employ over unionised staff that take pleasure in being rude to passengers. 31.10.14  lhr to berlin tegel. flight out good modern plane clean food ok and cabin crew good even pleasant. return 3.11.14 1625hrs from berlin horrid. crew only interested in themselves. was tossed a cup of coffee and a snack. staff openly ate the left over food from business class in the rear galley. i have complained about this before but clearly ba dont find it unpleasant. the return crew reminded me why i try to avoid ba. sunday 211 dublin to heathrow. flight arrived late and departed even later due to the absolutely ridiculous length of time it took to board people. finally got to my seat to discover a young girl with two kids occupying it. shifted them out the way and continued. had to help this girl with the seat belt for the child as no one seemed to have explained to her what to do. flight was late so had to run out of terminal 5 which is no mean feat. if you are not in a rush use british airways otherwise pick another airline. london gatwick to tampa and return ba2167 and 2166. outbound flight departure was delayed for over an hour due to technical problems. 90 minutes late arriving. in flight service to economy poor very few drinks people having to go to the galley to get water or juice. special meal on return awful and inedible. we ordered the same but got a different dish. didnt eat it. return flight delayed over an hour due to sick passenger which necessitated return to stand and passenger bag offload. entertainment system unreliable screen cutting out. check in staff in tampa told us we had no seats despite having printed boarding passes turned out her computer was on the wrong day they were good overall and lenient on baggage weight. san francisco to london heathrow in august  appalling. i flew to lax on the a380 which was ok but flying back on the ba 747 was a truly forgettable experience. it was in such poor shape and the staff were hopeless. the inflight entertainment was virtually non existant and seating was cramped. i flew the next day onto hong kong with cathay which is head and shoulders above ba. for the amount it costs there are so many better alternatives. i had a very poor experience with ba from joburg to london was cancelled. we were kept on the tarmac for four hours with very little information and eventually told there was a technical fault so we would not be flying for another 24 hours. i needed to call my workplace to arrange work cover but the cabin staff said there was no ba phone i could use. passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little direction on what to do. we were eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel staff were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms  families were separated. ba did not publicise the right of all passengers to eu compensation but i knew about this so did apply and receive the legally required amount promptly. all in all this was a hugely disappointing and frustrating experience from an airline that had previously been my preferred airline and i would no longer recommend ba. flew mct to lhr on 1 nov 14. staff at muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife who is a wheelchair user. catering on the flight was awful. food was inedible and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. on arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user despite having assistance booked in advance which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. we flew out on oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff. laxlhr. the flight started badly with the lounge facilities or lack of at lax. there is no first class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal businessfirst facility shared by ba qantas and cathay pacific. two hours before my flight it was a zoo. rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. the food and beverages was to a very high standard. there was no separated boarding lines for first passengers. flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. a poached salmon starter was neither here or there. luke warm soup. a rather nice but not exceptional italian style chicken dish. all served with cheap canteen style cutlery  long gone is the nice silverplated cutlery they used to offer. wines were fine. turn down bed service reminded me of why i dont like the new ba first class seat. the silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. in bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table  the bed is to narrow. i am 6 4 tall and not overweight. its very awkward and uncomfortable. ba in old first i am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they dont. you get a thin duvet. this makes the bed incredible hard and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. i dont think i slept more than an hour in the whole flight. the tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. this fare is sometimes as much as 7000 – one way and its not worth it. what amazes me in the competitive world that ba operate is that they dont seem to look at the competition. they trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. mind you on the lax route the only alternative is aa – and they have little ideas on quality in first class. when i look at what sia emirates the best in my view and etihad offer ba do not come close. ba often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. in fact over the last ten years the prices have skyrocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well  downwards just flew to and from new york jfk with ba flight out was great modern plane comfy seats and cabin crew who seemed to enjoy their jobs. unfortunately the flight back was very different old tired jumbo plane poor seating poor inflight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly couldnt be bothered and everything seemed to be too much trouble. plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the aircon on nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. have flown long haul with virgin and cathay pacific and these were much better on all fronts would only consider ba in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers san francisco to london heathrow in august  appalling. i flew to lax on the a380 which was ok but flying back on the ba 747 was a truly forgettable experience. it was in such poor shape and the staff were hopeless. the inflight entertainment was virtually non existant and seating was cramped. i flew the next day onto hong kong with cathay which is head and shoulders above ba. for the amount it costs there are so many better alternatives. i had not flown ba longhaul for over 30 years before this flight. i flew yvrlhr as the final sector of a round theworld trip and i have to say i will not be in a hurry to repeat the experience. the 747436 looked tired and ready for a refit or the breakers yard. the seat was the most uncomfortable economy seat i have ever sat in despite the headrest wings which are a nice feature. the lower part of the seat backs are fibre not hard plastic enabling the passenger behind to put their knees into the small of your back. this happened frequently throughout our bumpy flight. the cabin service was lacklustre and the breakfast unappetizing. its a shame that our national carrier has such a mediocre product compared with emirates or air nz. if i was a teacher i would mark ba as can do better. recently flew with british airways on europe trip. one of our flights was delayed due to fog in london so we missed our connecting flight to paris. had to stand in a queue for over three hours waiting to be reallocated another flight. only 3 staff serving 200 people. not even water was offered to people waiting in this long queue. awful customer service would not recommend to anyone. british airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent 8 hour flight. we made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. this was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. it is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. when we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. which is strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. while its always fun to meet new strangers we will not be flying with british airways again. checkin in toronto was ok no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. lounge in yyz was nice preflight dinner was just about ok with modest quality wines offered. chose an aisle seat yyzlhr bad idea. seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. tried to sleep but not possible with inflight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the window seat passenger who appeared to be a ba staff member who was determined to drink all night. didnt eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. decided on a window seat for the return lhryyz. bad idea again very claustrophobic. during the entire flight i managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. thereafter no matter how many times i pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. no offers of cognac or liqueurs. dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. when i say overcooked i mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. hadnt flown ba for a number of years and being a brit thought it would be a pleasant change from air canada on this route. it was a change but not a pleasant one. its back to ac for me. their business class is way better than this experience. perhaps i was just unfortunate. on the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time. laxlhrlax on the a380.the first thing i noticed you can no longer upgrade with avios. unlike the days of ba miles any attempt just brings up no availability or the website simply tries to make you buy an upgrade. not a good start. next up at lax the plane was a good hour late arriving. finally boarded and the flight was ok. food was from the club world menu wtp seating fine enough wine good ife but then landing late at lhr a delay because an airbus was at our spot. next the airbridge will not work followed by an airbus is in our spot. over 35 minutes wasted sitting there with children bullying passengers. if the pilot wishes to lie please be consistent. route back all quite normal but i feel somehow ba have thrown the baby out with the bath water. as a share holder i prefer discounts to dividends which are doubtful ad i preferred using miles to upgrade try finding flights from the us you can book with avios and finally why did that pilot lie to all of us sat there waiting to park time to stop collecting miles change credit cards and look for an honest airline i feel. phoenix to london  outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. the problem we had started on our return flight home. we boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. after being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. i was attempting to work but when i went to plug in my laptop battery i found that there was no adapter for me to use. since i could no longer work i decided to put a movie on. the tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. the flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and i give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. i decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. you can imagine my surprise when i saw him sitting in business class with a tv screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. at this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. it doesnt make sense to me. just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in phoenix to face another issue. we waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in london. weve flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. the difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadnt made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home. well this time nobody informed us so we stood there waiting for 45 minutes at the baggage claim before we were told. iahlhr b747 which was old but sat upstairs and it made it very pleasant. they charged 129 extra to reserve a business class seat in the upper deck. do not care for the seating of one seat forward and one backwards. the food was terrible and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too. felt like i was in economy. nuts were in a bag and breakfast was not much better. flight attendants not very friendly. yvrlhrams. an uneventful journey with ba but their boeing 747 from vancouver was a flashback to the 1990s. dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable  you could also occasionally feel the persons knees pushing into the back of your own seat. the inflight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. the cabin crew were courteous and friendly. arrival and transfer in bas terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. the connecting flight to amsterdam was a modern airbus a319 with bright and comfortable interiorseating. unless ba revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with virgin air canada or even air transat for the vancouverlondon route. british airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent 8 hour flight. we made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. this was our first time flying with

because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. while its always fun to meet new strangers we will not be flying with british airways again. flew return lhr to lax on the a380. condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. ba had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. this was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. the food service was acceptable and has not changed much except for the smaller portion from which i first flew with ba about 15 years ago. service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. the downside was the seat design. ba is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. this makes the tray table and video screen far too small back to sizes that i experienced back in the 90s. this made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. all other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. the worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after i asked him repeatedly. this resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. the cabin crew just shrug me off when i asked him to ask the gentleman to put up his seat for just 10 minutes. come on there is a big difference between good service not upsetting customers and just avoiding difficult situations. i cannot believe that ba calls their plane from austin to london a dreamliner. im sitting in their so called club world which is the equivalent to americans business class and this plane is awful there is no room to put anything at all. everything and i mean everything goes in storage. you are literally looking straight at the person next to you. attendants are rude. dont waste your money. while its nice to go nonstop between austin and london this will be the last time i ever take this flight. bgilgw premium economy august 2014. silver tier status. older plane with older version of ba pe seat. adequate leg room though. cabin crew barely visible for the 8 hour flight and quite short tempered when they served dinner and breakfast. on ba website pe meals advertised as being a choice of two dishes off the business menu. we were definitely served an economy meal for dinner which was fairly average. breakfast before we landed in lgw consisted of a hard cold croissant with jam and fresh orange with teacoffee. at the end of an 8 hour flight this was really disappointing and i would have been disappointed with this in economy never mind pe. when i asked a flight attendant about this i was treated abysmally. overall it is not worth paying extra for pe taking into account the poor standard of meals but especially the lack of courtesy and basic manners shown by cabin crew. lhr to mia on 1282014. pros lighting window blinds large tv personal storage pjs and food. cons seat does not conform to lounge chair without activation of sleeper section. no bedding provided except used throw pillow from last seating. four middle seats crowd the area too much. bathroom very small. cabin was very very dirty. advise fly aa 777 or 77w on same route. british airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. the cancun route and the nassau routes i have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. this saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. one example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems i encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as ba only allocated one packet per person. the staff all agree that this was pathetic no lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket. i cannot believe that ba calls their plane from austin to london a dreamliner. im sitting in their so called club world which is the equivalent to americans business class and this plane is awful there is no room to

nonstop between austin and london this will be the last time i ever take this flight. lhrsfo  club world. i find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedbacks of others regarding bas premium products. online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful. that is it whoever designed the club world seat needs to have their head examined. the board that signed off on the product should be fired the seat was narrowed with no space to put your drinks without lowering the dining table. that is just plain stupid. having to step over another pax to get out of your seat if seated in window is another stupid concept the design offers absolutely no privacy if seated in the aisle. the food was okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class compared to the likes of air france or lufthansa. entertainment selection were poor but better than klm and the screen not of good size. fly crews were ok. i ordered the beef and the pax next to me did the same. even though my order was first my neighbour got the last order. fair enough ended up with turkey roulade was ok. the crews were apologetic but not attentive. having flew other carriers i can honestly say theirs little enthusiasm shown by the crew which is a shame. had an opportunity to look at the 1st class menu. to be frank any carrier who does not offer caviars in its first class cabin in my view is out with the time. making this observation because in 2 months i will be travelling to mexico and the price comparison between lufthansa and ba are not far apart former slightly less but i suspect flying lufthansa is likely to be more enjoyable than ba based on the experienced of this journey. will see if the return flight might tilt the view to the . i would not pay the published c or f class fares on ba. the product line does not equate to the price. ba was the waitrose and is now between tesco or asda. the tv is the worst i have ever experienced and i mean of all tvs ever not just airline tvs the contrast was nonexistent and the resolution appalling. it was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see when the cabin lights were off when they were on it was impossible to see it wasnt just my seat my colleagues was the same and i could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of tvs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. the tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. the table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight  it wasnt even turbulent. power sockets on a flight originating in the uk and run by a uk airline should be uk sockets not us sockets the food was adequate but nothing special ive had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid it had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit finally when the club world cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry theres none in this trolley so you cant have any. all in all this isnt the level of service that i expect when paying nearly 3000 for a flight. it was my first time flying club with ba and i had expected a level of service equivalent to business class with other airlines how wrong i was lhr to bkk outbound on boeing 777 sin to lhr inbound on boeing 747. outbound flight delayed which seems to happen on a regular basis for this flight which meant a missed connection in bkk. flight ok but the catering was ridiculous on a 11 hr sector only 2 choices which meant they ran out of chicken after about 5 rows and everyone else had to make do with the vegetarian option. flight back was on time still only 2 choices of meals but the crew were excellent very friendly and approachable. the ife was very limited compared to the middle eastern carriers and ba really do need to up their game if theyre to compete with emirates etihad and qatar on these routes. its also much easier to fly with those airlines if you are from any part of the uk other than london and the southeast of england as ba only do long haul from lhr and lgw. british airways are not interested in

switched to vueling. on this flight we had to pay for refreshments. i wrote in to ba to complain and had no reply. after several weeks i rewrote and eventually received an apology but no explanation as to why we had to pay for food. lislhrvie on dec. 8 both legs on an airbus 320 in club europe business class  both legs on time seats were economy seats with the middle seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats which are less comfortable and have a reduced seat pitch – checkin in lis was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but business class waiting lines were very short so overall it was ok. lislhr leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive european fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales. other than that business class flight attendants were behind the curtain reading magazines chatting and rather attending to themselves than the passengers. at 11 am the business class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate. extremely disappointing and poor for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in heathrow after 1 pm. on the lhrvie leg service wasafternoon teameaning again sandwiches. however this time at least it was more appropriate due to time of day. full bar service on both flights and the french white wine served was ok. the mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to ba standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness. transfer procedures in lhr terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at lhr even intraeu were hassle free and easy. bas galleries lounge in lhr t3 was again an oasis of rest amid a busy airport comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries. in lisbon portela ba uses the shared blue lounge which is small and offerings are rather limited some limited snacks ok drinks but at least good nespresso coffee. although small it was not crowded which is a plus. so ba delivered a good basic product for economy standards but i fail to see any real business class service offered here not seat wise not meal wise not service wise. the only saving grace was the galleries lounge in heathrow t3 and the better service on the lhrvie leg. not recommended for business class within europe based on this experience. oneworld sapphire. lgw to tfs in club europe. disappointing that ba has downgraded its ce service to such an extent that it is not really worth paying the extra for short haul. too little leg room now such that new seats are no different from economy  yes the middle seat is not occupied but what both my partner and i would like is additional leg room. not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. new seats are uncomfortable as well. lunch service reminiscent of economy food trays of the 80s too. cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin  ce clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer can no longer recommend ba for a four hour shorthaul although good timekeeping. such a shame that ba has allowed this to happen. think again ba. lhrsfo  club world. i find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedbacks of others regarding bas premium products. online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful. that is it whoever

the waitrose and is now between tesco or asda. muscat  abu dhabi  london. delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. no welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. no cabin checks done on one side ex abu dhabi. menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience. we flew from manchester to lhr to ycc and return over the christmas period on the dreamliner. the only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from london. the dreamliner is narrow and uncomfortable. we had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. the 333 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats the leg room was just about acceptable. we sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced the risk of being kicked from behind. it was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. the food was typical air line food. the crew were variable. on the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. the lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch. we are returning to canada in a few months but we will not be using ba despite my husbands executive club membership. ba are still great for short haul but they need to rethink the dreamliner experience. travelled from london heathrow to tokyo haneda overall not a very pleasurable experience. the seats were uncomfortable blankets were of poor quality. seats were crammed too close to one another the pillow provided was also of poor quality. the entertainment system was great for tv shows but terrible for movies only one headphone worked and occasionally the sound would black out the system suffered a few malfunctions but smoothed out once up in the air. the food was delicious but the tea and coffee was poor. staff service was good but still lots of room for improvement. the aircraft and the experience itself seemed old and dated compared to other carriers i have flown with. travelled club from mia to lhr last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare aa flight which was excellent we paid an extra 170 to prebook seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. its been several years since i last tried ba club on a transatlantic flight and i was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. compared to the emirates business class id experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before ba are fast becoming the lada of the airline business. the seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. the entertainment really poor but worst of all the food i would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege the breakfast was a joke. a glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll my wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the cabin crew first offered her one then said oh sorry of course youre vegetarian and that was it  no alternative never again ba had a good ba flight out to barcelona but found on return switched to vueling. on this flight we had to pay for refreshments. i wrote in to ba to complain and had no reply. after several weeks i rewrote and eventually received an apology but no explanation as to why we had to pay for food. lislhrvie on dec. 8 both legs on an airbus 320 in club europe business class  both legs on time seats

least it was more appropriate due to time of day. full bar service on both flights and the french white wine served was ok. the mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to ba standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness. transfer procedures in lhr terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at lhr even intraeu were hassle free and easy. bas galleries lounge in lhr t3 was again an oasis of rest amid a busy airport comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries. in lisbon portela ba uses the shared blue lounge which is small and offerings are rather limited some limited snacks ok drinks but at least good nespresso coffee. although small it was not crowded which is a plus. so ba delivered a good basic product for economy standards but i fail to see any real business class service offered here not seat wise not meal wise not service wise. the only saving grace was the galleries lounge in heathrow t3 and the better service on the lhrvie leg. not recommended for business class within europe based on this experience. oneworld sapphire. after flying iberia madscl the return journey from buenos aires to lhr was underwhelming. old tired plane 777 with a 343 set up for a 13 hour flight compared to a far more comfortable 242 on iberia ife screens smaller than any other airline with very limited options uncomfortable seats with minimal leg room. fas adequate as was the meal. i dont understand why ba is 4star rated and iberia and lan are 3stars or how they can charge much more than any other european airline they dont even want to try and being british i am really disappointed with the state of our flagship carrier. how are they going to compete with emirates qatar etc being an ex pat i decided to fly the flag from seattle back to england in november 2014 to celebrate my 60th birthday. i was accompanied by my wife a son and daughter with their spouses and our 2 year old grandson. between us all we spent a considerable amount of money to fly economy class. after a short time into the flight we soon discovered the economy seats on the 777 to be extremely small uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway i wonder what genius came up with that one. aside from serving us steerage passengers that stuff they called food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. they wouldnt even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. they didnt even check to see if my grandson needed anything. as far as flying ba again there wont be a next time. club world to st lucia on the 16th december and the service was dreadful  even for ba. when we boarded the aircraft my wife asked for a glass of champagne while we waited for takeoff and the hostess said i would have to open another bottle. she then walked away and did not return. given the cost of the ticket we would have bought that bottle many many times over. i like to watch movies or the map of our progress and on a flight of over 8 hours this is important to me. you guessed it the video system did not work at all for me nor for several other customers around me. i did complain and have been offered compensation of 60 but only against the cost of another ba ticket. as far as i am concerned they can keep their voucher as my wife and i will not fly ba again  ever. british airways call themselves a full service airline. this they seem to think means providing a packet of crisps or a cookie with your drink of choice. how can it be called full service if they even run out of crisps on a 45 minute flight between london city and amsterdam really poor. lhrsfolhr. why do i keep thinking ba will improve the 747 on this route is falling to bits. their business class configuration is terrible. facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up food on both legs awful but worse coming from sfo. also club kitchen pathetic. ife systems the worst of any airline. ba please travel on emirates just once and see how it should be done. staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to lhr on upper deck staff were verging on cant be bothered served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. then empties sat on table for two hours before i dumped them in galley. breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. both of which left uneaten. i keep booking through blind loyalty but after bahrain and san fran in december decided no more. they have just got too bad. muscat  abu dhabi  london. delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. no welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. no cabin checks done on one side ex abu dhabi. menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience. miami to brussels with a change at heathrow terminal 5. lounge in miami was ok ample choice of spirits but very basic champagne. food lots of cold cuts cheeses and some pastries. plane rather dated 747 and not very clean. fas very courteous and extremely friendly  great choice of very good champagnes wines and spirits. where ba fails the poor quality of the food  extremely basic without any luxury items  not acceptable at all for a first product  ife just ok. seat kk  fa gave assistance for the sleeping position. connecting flight to brussels i was informed by the  once again very friendly and courteous fa  that ba did cancel the fruit platter as a special meal. is fruit also too expensive will move to other companies for long distance flights. flew lhr to denver colorado on 261214  6115 for a ski holiday. absolutely disappointed and outraged at the rubbish food served on both flights and obviously what i consider as edible and what ba class as edible we shall truly disagree on  awful food. coffee rubbish asked for more water and never got any the inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. the male stewards were fine and happy but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink which never arrived anyway thought ba had got rid of that superior lucky to fly with us attitude will not fly them again if i can help it. cairolhrsfolhr overall ba are suffering from a fleet which desperately needs replacing. the 747 to sfo must have been 20 odd years old and looked it. ancient ife with tiny screen virtually inaudible sound and minuscule choice. seats were ok actually moderately comfortable for economy staff better than they used to be. the flight from cairo on a much newer airbus a320 in a long haul configuration was much better. big ife screen lots of movie choice comfortable seat charming cabin crew shows what could be with a newer fleet. as a brit this itinerary was a rare chance to see what transferring through lhr is like well i just made my connection but why oh why have they designed such a massive t5 only to put a bottle neck of 5 or ten transfer desks for the tens of thousands changing planes every few hours that transfer hall should be massive and full of staff rather than anxious travellers fretting about missing their connection. if i were ba i would sort that or else keep losing transfers to schiphol or cdg. overall i get the impression ba is living off the captive market london provides hundreds of thousands of very rich people wanting long haul direct flying for which there is no competition. if there is ever global deregulation bas long haul business will go the way of short haul with emirates playing easyjets role this time. i have used british airways over a number of years for work and leisure trips nonexclusively and must say i have noted a gradual but continued decrease in service quality. on a recent return flight from johannesburg travelling with an infant we were delayed for over 30 hours. the way in which the delay was handled was terrible. minimal staff meant it took three plus hours to get checked in to a hotel. then trying to arrange the return minimising waiting time for the little one took 5 hours with two staff serving 400 passengers with no concern for customers. tried calling head office and they were less helpful than the booking agents.my intention is to avoid where possible and in many cases they are cheaper alternatives. lgwmla. for some crazy reason i still fly british airways and pay for club europe. following this trip i have come to my senses. apart from a berlin trip already paid for in may they can say goodbye to my business travel. this was an airbus 320 previously owned by bmi. it was not difficult to work that out as it was still showing the bmi banner inside. the plane was never used for business. all the seats were a miserable 30 inch pitch. there was not even a curtain dividing club and economy. just how ba think they are going to get away with this type of robbery for much longer i dont know. unless there is an alternative carrier offering proper club facilities then its low cost airlines for me around europe. just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to thailand flying to and from bangkok with ba on 777 aircraft. i definitely would choose another airline next time. we flew out on 31st december 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. one of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. for most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. my inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldnt be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. return flight crew on 16th jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. the inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didnt work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. one staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. tray table was broken in seat 27b also. the crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what i call a night flight. i used to love flying ba as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and i am sorry to say neither my partner or i enjoyed the experience. will look to eva thai or one of the middle eastern airlines next time. took a return trip to dublin over christmas and found ba to be extremely disappointing. my principal complaint is the dirt  the seats and floor area looked as if they had not been cleaned for many flights. also at 58 i am not that tall but still found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. lhrsin on a380. first class seat 1k. crew unprofessional most of the time forgot seat 1k existed with no welcome drink until 15 mins had passed no water top up until i asked 3 times forgot wine match with first course and everything handed out with ok as a comment. new tasting menu was very good. had a flight in business with cx a few days later and the food quality crew and overall service was another league  far outshone ba. the ba first product is a waste of money and crew need a retrain. london gatwick to mauritius 27th december return 7th january. 777 aircraft economy class. i never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. the seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. in the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. when the passenger in front put his seat back i couldnt use the tray and when i asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. ba are miles behind the far and middle east airlines and still charging more. i have no idea why people use them. bangkok to london heathrow. 8 sep 2014. on this flight british airways stinted on everything. i dont mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. british airways is not cheap. as soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. everyone had their airline blankets over them. there were not enough stewardsstewardesses. forty minutes before the welcome on board drink  and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. seatback tv did not work in the section i was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. the seatbacks should be checked before the flight. however eventually they did work. a small number of films tv shows i have never heard of and no games option. first meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. and creamers even for tea whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. british airways even ran out of beer ba hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they dont miss a trick i resent having to pay to book a certain seat. the flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. never again. ba191 19th jan london heathrow to austin. legroom in economy is too small. im 62 and just dont fit. on a long haul flight recently i sat with my knees sticking out into the aisle and adjacent seat space for 10 hours. i returned from jfk last friday morning reasonable flight although delayed for an hour and a half. main meal was okay but the breakfast was appalling a stale croissant with some jam. i paid good money for this flight. really disappointed quality is slipping away. flew back from milan lin on jan 4th. because of mist the pilots actual characterization most flights that morning had been delayedcanceled inout of lhr. no delay info given at checkin nor at gate. upon boarding the captain informed us that because of mist we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. my connecting flight to sfo was 2.5 hrs after landing in lhr. flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to sfo most likely too. upon landing in lhr a sea of canceleddelayed lost souls. i was immediately told i was forced to miss my connection because my flight to sfo was on time. i was forced to join the longest line ive ever seen for rebooking. it never moved. we were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs and faster. crossing the border control took just as long. upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. i finally managed to join the free wifi and call bas office to get rebooked online. i was rebooked on a flight from sfo to lhr. the wrong way around. when i pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a computer glitch and promised to call me back. she finally called me back and got rebooked on aa flights to jfk and to sfo from there. the next morning at the aa check in they could not check me in on the jfksfo because of issues with the ba ticket. it took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. i nearly missed the flight to jfk too. my suitcase was never loaded on that flight and i didnt get it at jfk. it took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. i will never fly british airways again. return flight from lhr t5 to washington dulles iad in club world. check in was fine even if the layout of the t5 checkin area isnt the most intuitive. security was efficient. however the ba lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. outbound flight on the a380. boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back ontime. the club world cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. it was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. the club world seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. the entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasnt terribly extensive but everything apart from the inseat usb power socket was working. the general layout of the cabin was terrible. not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for takeoff landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. it makes everything feel cramped and cheap. meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. overall id rate the outbound experience as okay for a business class flight. return flight experience was far from okay. my flight departing iad at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. told that there were no club world seats on the earlier flight out of iad that night which i could just about make at a push and i would have to fly back in economy. when i asked about the ba flight from baltimore bwi an hour later i was told that yes there were club world seats available that evening so i asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. arriving at bwi checkin i was informed that unfortunately there actually werent any club world seats available and i would have to fly back in world traveller plus. the flight from bwi to lhr t5 was on a rather old 767. the cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. world traveller plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. inflight food was bland. the crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. flight left and arrived on time. as a uk passport holder immigration at t5 was quick. baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall. took a return trip to dublin over christmas and found ba to be extremely disappointing. my principal complaint is the dirt  the seats and floor area looked as if they had not been cleaned for many flights. also at 58 i am not that tall but still found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. i have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. i just came back from a nyclhrdubai trip and will not fly ba again. several reasons my seat in business class was noticeably filthy  crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. when i told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. i was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes the plane had not even taken off and told that i would not get breakfast. i was served raw chicken and when i expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane the dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies  not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that i was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with ba is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. as a customer paying nearly 10000 usd for a round trip ticket i shouldnt be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. the seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. there are plenty of other first class carriers out there that i will now become a customer of. flew amslhrjfk return 26th dec  31st dec. amslhrams on a321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it  yet also modern. nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts though a sandwich would be nice on a midmorning flight. they are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. lhrjfklhr on b744 totally different experience. transferring through t5 at lhr easy enough although i got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max  but hey this is the uk after all. also ba advertise t5 as like its one building  not the case. all this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. they actually board a fully booked b744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. given all the 788s completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges i felt this was totally unnecessary. turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly club world and first seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. how to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. prime example service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. seats dated and sometimes broken  my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. ife well just bring your own tablet. so dated its just not worth switching on. the cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. arriving early morning from jfk of course we parked at a hard stand. waited our turn for 20 minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. ba this is not acceptable. disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. but a fully loaded 744 come on. we travelled ba in business class lhr to vegas before xmas and returned to lhr from san diego in january. business class travel is a rare treat for us and i cant understand why ba persevere with this unique forwardsbackwards facing seating layout. to sit for 11 hours face to face with a stranger is awful as is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seats. the cabin crew were great food was below average and the inflight entertainment system abysmal poor choice and terrible picture quality. outbound we were upstairs on a 747 there were two attendants assisting only 16 passengers and they did a good job and kept the two toilets clean. given these circumstances this flight experience should have been fantastic. however given the negatives detailed above i would classify it as just about average. we returned on a 777 and my negative feelings are sadly the same other than we were stuck on the plane for 40 mins on landing awaiting buses to disembark. lhrjfk. end of a oneworld rtw trip. what a disappointment. after a mindnumbing trip through flight connections ba to ba and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the b concourse only to get on a 1215 minute bus ride i was escorted to the fc cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. the aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carryon bag in the overhead over my seat. very claustrophobic. seat was strange. very narrow and difficult to sleep in  at least 67 narrower than the seats on cx or aa. strange recline mechanism  normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. the seat reclines in one motion so you cant fine tune it like with other airlines. menu looked fantastic  apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course indian style lamb was virtually inedible. cheeses were good desserts and wines ok. evod was not to the standards of the competition. fewer movies and tv selections than either aa or cx. crew was fine. stick with aacx from now on. cabin crew polite unfortunately ba ran out of chicken ran out of wine ran out of soft drinks. the food was awful. inflight service was a disaster  did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight everything counts obviously ba overlooked this. to be fair all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. i will never fly again with ba. on a recent flight from johannesburg to london i was shocked to find such cramped seating conditions in the world traveller economy class section. having not been able to secure an aisle seat which would have made minimal difference anyway i was allocated a middle seat of 3. like many other men and some women i am over 6 ft. with long legs so the acute discomfort i experienced was manifest from the start of the flight to the end about 10 hours. it was difficult to stretch my legs and at times i had to stand in my seat to alleviate leg cramp. it also caused me considerable back pain. i did offer to swap seats with a lady in the adjacent aisle seat but she was unwilling to do so that was her prerogative. so it became necessary to disturb her on a number of occasions to take a walk along the aisles in order to alleviate leg cramps. the cabin staff were cooperative in allowing me to use one of their seats in order to stretch my legs but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence. reading very similar reviews it does make me wonder if british airways will bother take any notice or continue to treat their passengers customers in this appalling fashion. about 10 years ago i experienced an appalling flight from buenos aires to london via british airways albeit for different reasons and swore i would never use them again. but i felt i would give them one more chance. what a mistake. the worlds favourite airline  dont make me laugh. heathrow to boston on what was once called queen of the sky now grandmother of the sky. went wtp on ancient 747 with tiny monitors with badly scratched screen and awful selection of movies and music. food just ok but crew very good. not worth the money better off in economy. the flight was to dubai we travelled on the 9.45pm outgoing and 3.20pm incoming to heathrow. we travelled in economy the seats were cramped and hard. it was freezing cold so cold in fact passengers wore coats with a blankets on them as well. the food was awful no choice whatsoever. i asked for a coffee because i was so cold but had to wait an hour and then had to ask again before i received it. the flight attendants on both flights did not look smart appeared to want to perform there duties as quickly as possible without any care for the passengers wishes so that they could stand and chat at back of flight and catch up with each other. we have had better flights on easyjet. lhrzurich. the trip got off to a good start as the north lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test  which it is when it is busy. had a nice early light lunch. the aircraft was a new a321. i like this plane. it was rammed end to end. the plane had the new club europe seats and it reminded me how well ba seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality  but isnt. unless you are seated in row 1  the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. as with the old c.e. seat  the centre seat between 3 seats  is a table. quite why this is logical escapes me  because it seems to imply that if it suits ba they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. this was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable  wide c.e. seat. at the same time justify the higher pricing. its no wonder ba have very few  if any  travel industry awards in the services they provide. so frustrating. i had another light lunch and a couple of gin and tonics which was nice. the fas were great. flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to zurich in 80 minutes which was great. the worlds favourite airline try the worlds most frustrating airline flew ba2043 gatwick to male in world traveller plus. plane a boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. the main dissatisfaction was the food  going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. the choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir. i finally got my choice when the captain gave up his first choice other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job. lgwams on friday 13th. flight delayed by almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time reason provided by captain was late inbound aircraft. this was my third late running ba flight in as many weeks. no apologies other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight deck surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other than looking after their guests on board. i have two more flights in the coming month with ba rather regretting having booked with this carrier now. beyond appalling. flight delayed by ten minutes departing rome to lhr. as a result one passenger decided he was going to miss his connection in lhr. he was allowed disembark thus leading to a delay in departure from rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. consequent late arrival to lhr. missed connecting flight. abandoned in heathrow at 10.30 on a sunday night had to book new flights miss a day work find a hotel for the night. ground staff of no use whatsoever. staff totally unhelpful. taking things to a logical conclusion what was to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus delaying the flight ad infinitum. correspondence contact with ba has been a joke since. i have always travelled ba and have recently been upgraded to bronze which i would have thought had a few perks wrong my 15 year old son and i travelled from lhrnyc on ba but it was a codeshare with american airlines. i couldnt check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldnt book an aisle seat either. ba at the airport apparently couldnt help because it was a codeshare even though i had bought through ba the flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. coming back we flew from washington dulles airport  there was a snow storm and it was freezing. the plane which was an airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing on time not until 6.15 pm on the 21st feb. then ba announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled we were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs we sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water there was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldnt get off the plane. it doesnt take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. the final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings british airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. its a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part time to look at a new airline to fly with. i fly ba business regularly between delhi and london. i was surprised at how dirty the plane was  on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. the food quality is generally pretty poor  especially on the delhi to london leg. also why not get some decent magazines  country life decanter the economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of hello i residually like ba but they have to up their game. lhrjfk. end of a oneworld rtw trip. what a disappointment. after a mindnumbing trip through flight connections ba to ba and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the b concourse only to get on a 1215 minute bus ride i was escorted to the fc cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. the aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carryon bag in the overhead over my seat. very claustrophobic. seat was strange. very narrow and difficult to sleep in  at least 67 narrower than the seats on cx or aa. strange recline mechanism

inflight service was a disaster  did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight everything counts obviously ba overlooked this. to be fair all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. i will never fly again with ba. british airways general onboard services in first are generally acceptable. however the airline refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should be added for paid first class passengers. ground services such as special assistance for transfers that are so widely available on other carriers for their first class passengers are sorely lacking at ba ex. lufthansa first class terminal and transfers at fra and others. even as a gold executive club top tier member there is nothing available  even when i call and request assistance on longhaul first flights ex. lhr to hkg that involve changes in planes between t3 and t5 at lhr. ba needs to wake up and examine the overall first product. the upgrades to the first cabin are also marginal. packing 14 narrow even on new a380s seats in first puts the airline at a huge disadvantage to other oneworld carriers who have a true first product ex. cathay has 8 true suites in first. wake up ba  your premium fare paying customers are irate over this lack of first product amenities including full ground support especially upon special request for paying first passengers. lhrwashington in club world. my disappointment continues with ba on the a380 club world seat. in theory being the flagship plane  it should have the flagship business class seat. as a regular traveller with ba i know the club product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. what ba risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom will notice and take offence and fly with someone else. its a bit like the ba first product this used to have caviar on the jfk route and silver plated cutlery and krug champagne. now they dont. i notice because i used to experience it. meanwhile prices have shot up  and quality has shot downwards. very disappointing. flight was cancelled with no explanation. no offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in thailand. my flight from bangkok to heathrow was horrendous. travelled world traveller plus which is a total waste of money. we were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. i was offered beef or fish. it was actually chicken. apart from a tub of ice cream the next meal was not for another 89 hours. when the meal did arrive it was pasta or chicken. i asked for chicken. it was fish it was also vile. sent it back. judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. i went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. i was advised if i wanted more tea could i retain the paper cup as they were running out it was like being on some 3rd world airline. this is ba. supposedly the flagship airline of our country. its an absolute disgrace. i have flown for over 40 years and never again with ba. flew from sfo to milan via heathrow on 214 returned 221. outbound was rescheduled due to changes requested by my companys business partner in milan. this was the third reschedule and ba charged 433.40 533.90 and 275.00 successively on a basic 1822.00 economy flight. no other airline does this in my experience. incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time  unless i paid an extra 53.00 for each flight. i did so but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. on the way out my antiquated inflight display did not work. on the way back my headphone jack was broken. we left heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the ba website indicated on time arrival so my wife waited two hours extra at sfo. overall a very poor experience. i will avoid ba whenever possible. my return flight from cape town to heathrow ba0042 30115 was a miserable experience. my entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily be reset. no one was available to do it. when it did become available it was lightsout time and my seat would not recline. it was not possible to focus on the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close quarters. two stewardesses thought the seat belt was preventing the seat from reclining but when this was not the reason no one else came to investigate. no one seemed to care that i needed to stand for long periods to relieve my back. being polite and patient did me no good. i have several questions. how often are the seats serviced why is the entertainment system so unreliable how often are the seat belts checked because mine kept slipping customer services want me to chose ba in the future but as they ignored addressing these issues when i wrote to them i have too many doubts. london to budapest and back in club class. first leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. the return was terrible. ba do not pay for cub europe travellers to use fast track at security  disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. the lounge is mediocre at best. absolutely not worth paying for club. ba need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices. flew to bangkok with thai airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. we were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with ba. the leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic i couldnt see the tv screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as i have long legs and couldnt put them out in front of me. so uncomfortable. the food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice after a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different. does ba actually read and take notice of these negative reviews are we wasting our time first time in reduced leg room club europe. dont bother no different to economy both colleague and i sat with legs splayed jammed into seat in front. save your money fly in the back and spend considerable savings on a better hotel better holiday or whatever. good crew and food though. i took a flight from gatwick to barcelona. although it had a ba flight number it was operated by vueling and that meant i couldnt use the ba lounge despite my silver executive club membership. i didnt choose vueling i was under the impression i had chosen ba and would get the ba perks just the same. there was no in flight entertainment hence 15  it should be 0 of course. we travelled cunlgw 11 march and its the last time we will ever travel business class with ba. no lounge facilities at cancun only a voucher offered for use in departure area food outlets. on board usual gymnastics to get in and out of seats ran out of food choices for dinner limited choice for breakfast tea served in a cup without saucer. cabin staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight. better value in cattle class. due to a health issue i chose to fly business class from sydney to singapore singapore to heathrow heathrow to mykonos and then returned ba15 6th october. i was seated in the same seat 16k both ways. my main problem was that by the time they got to me for each meal time whatever i had chosen off the menu they had run out of or there had been a mistake and they didnt have the meals that were on the menu. often i would have to call out to them for a drink as they seemed to forget that there was another seat. in the morning because i am diabetic i had to go to the front and ask for something to eat which was hard as most people where sleeping and i didnt want to disturb anyone. british airways business class is outclassed by rivals. the lay out of the seats needs sorting  i do not expect people to step over me when i have my seat extended in order to get out of their seating area. the inflight food was poor. drinks were offered occasionally  34 times on a ten hour flight  slightly warm coffee  ran out of ice. the idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley was a joke. non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food. inflight entertainment very poor. the terrace lounge at gatwick is outdated  no hot food apart from porridge we checked in at 9.00am a few pieces of cold toast plus the usual cold meats and cheese. booking business class with british airways is definitely not worth the money. i have to admit to not being a fan of the ba club world business class configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. on my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. on my flight from mle to lgw 10 hrs 35 minutes i was in 11b facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10b. the passenger in 10a facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. it is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in male and so after take off i was looking forward to a cold lager. the drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. the fa said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. i cannot drink warm lager and i am not a spirit drinker and so went without. i settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. no entertainment system and i then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. there were 2 meal services on the flight. the first one was ok but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad. not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at lgw all the economy bags came off first and the club bags with priority tags attached came off last. i have been in correspondence with ba and customer relations has stated you traveled in the cabin you originally booked. however the meals we serve and our inflight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. the ba website has a description of this service which includes 1 extensive flight entertainment system. 2 seat converts to 4 key positions. 3 choice of light meal or four course dining. ba claimed to be the worlds favorite airline. they are not mine. they also clam to fly to serve. well as they say they did fly me from mle to lgw bt i am not quite sure where the service came in. travelled back from cape town on 28th february 2015. booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat complained to ba and told that the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft youre travelling on. what a total rip off the seats were extremely cramped our inflight entertainment system keep failing. once the food had been dished out and tidied away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing ba need to get their act together and invest in better aircrafts. clapped out 747s  even first class looked shoddy flew to bangkok with thai airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. we were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with ba. the leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic i couldnt see the tv screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as i have long legs and couldnt put them out in front of me. so uncomfortable. the food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice after a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different. does ba actually read and take notice of these negative reviews are we wasting our time dellhrham in business. the club world product feels really old now. the seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. it was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to air india which has modern flat seats on the dreamliner. the food was ok but nothing special. the service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. amenity kits very cheap. the young indian crew members on the delhi route noticeably better than the older london based british crew. the plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. basically everything was mediocre if adequate. the overall impression was a product past its prime from the 1990s. old planes old crew old seats old ife ba are losing ground not just to emirates but also other european carriers like lh or af. it feels like the 1970s and 1980s before ba transformed itself. i have been a longstanding ba gold card holder and frequent business traveller. ba has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 64 i could not sit without great discomfort. this shows complete contempt for bas customers. i first encountered this on a round trip to brussels. it will be eurostar for me in the future and air france for which i also gave a gold card on other short hauls. is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than easyjet offers comfortable seats and plenty of space but the food was poor and the inflight entertainment system was rubbish. the screens were small and the picture quality terrible. i liked that fact that the cabin crew were more mature people but the service was far from attentive. this is the first time i have flown with ba for over 15 years and i will try and avoid it in future. i have had much better flights with other airlines. return lhryvr boeing 747400. i had been advised to fly ba but unfortunately i ended up very disappointed with the return leg. my seat was double booked so they eventually got me one but the entertainment system was not working when i asked about it she said it had not been working yesterday either. no other vacant seats in economy but there were loads in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with nothing. definitely would not fly with them again. very disappointing experience. arrived at airport for a flight to nice and learnt it was 1.5 hours late  with arriving aircraft nowhere in sight. prior flight was boarding also delayed having no luggage checked and seats available i thought i might get to nice after all in time. no such luck. whilst the flight continued to board for another 15 minutes i spent arguing with ba staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight. first class lounge staff refused to call the gate. all with flight is finalized. in similar situations with other airlines most notably lufthansa they always reopened the flight and got me on. the only excuse was its the rules obviously ba. staff in addition took calls whilst handling my  urgent  request further delaying the process. if i have a choice i will definitely use other airlines. in addition they have changed the seating in europe to come more in line with easyjet and ryanair. at 64 very uncomfortable. doesnt help to upgrade to business same seat. so you end up paying 300 pounds for a very predictable and unexciting food. london gatwick lgw to lanzarote ace. we havent flown ba for sometime and to be honest we have no desire to fly with ba again anytime soon. the plane was an airbus 320 and was just like a bus. uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. we sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. we both came off the return flight with bad headaches. the food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. the service was ok nothing to complain about very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. we flew the same route in october last year with a uk holiday airline and that was all round far more superior. 2332015 lhrsin ba011 first. awful from booking to completion of the flight. as a ba. gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new a380 only to be told by ba in may 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to i wonder why ba squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s. at the beginning of march i checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. i called the ba gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight i found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. i can only assume that rank has its privileges. now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the pa being inaudible i felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned i was ignored. i booked this flight for us a part of a special far east holiday i had high expectations of ba first which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. will now try to avoid flying ba in any of there classes once i have redeemed my avios balance. i travelled from london to joburg and back on the airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. on the way out i was in premium economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. the return in business was a different matter. i was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passengers feet to vacate my seat. all this at a premium price. shocking. the cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers views on the cabin never again. return lhryvr boeing 747400. i had been advised to fly ba but unfortunately i ended up very disappointed with the return leg. my seat was double booked so they eventually got me one but the entertainment system was not working when i asked about it she said it had not been working yesterday either. no other vacant seats in economy but there were loads in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with nothing. definitely would not fly with them again. i usually have very positive experiences when flying ba. this time travelling on 300315 lcalgw the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers. it was a 4.5 hour flight and were served the meal within the first 20minutes with nothing to do for the next 4 hours. there was no inflight entertainment. the staff did not offer any hot drinks and when i walked all the way to the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if i wanted one i could go and get it from service area. the staff couldnt have looked any more disinterested in their passengers british airways could not care less when they knew our flight from leeds to heathrow had been diverted. some queued two hours for another flight with two children only to be told we had to go to heathrow by coach with no toilet. we had nothing to eat at the airport as no one knew what was happening. we finally got to heathrow to be put up in a hotel and have a meal so we could fly to miami the next day. it was a total farce at leeds we lost a days holiday and with two children there was no consideration for them at all. we await our homeward journey on monday and hopefully it will be a better trip back. travelled by airbus 319 to lyon and back to heathrow. the new layout is very cramped. by reducing the legroom in club europe and removing one of the toilets at the rear they have crammed in 11 more seats. seats 25a and b have no window as they are placed where the toilet used to be. they are adjacent to the door of the one remaining toilet. not very pleasant. expect long queues to use this one remaining lavatory. they also seem to have done away with the cooked breakfast on all european flights that start before 9.30am. lhrfra in club europe. first part is not really a review more a rant. i travel a lot for work and always try to fly ba whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a gold card so for our annual vacation i was looking forward to hopefully getting us all wife plus 9 year old daughter into the first class lounge at lhr as a nice start to our holidays sadly the staff member on the door said no.  yes i know you can only normally sign in 1 guest but for my other 50 flights a year i never sign in anyone still no joycomputer said no. so i asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively that is not protocol. we walked away having been made to feel like naughty kids. rest of the trip was finein fact i would go as far as to say the flight was excellentreally friendly cabin crew who made us feel welcome and gave us a good start to the holidays. actually i would say this was ba at its best having just seen them at their worst. score given here reflect the good service in the air would give almost full marks if not for the ground staff behaviour. while i booked with ba i at first did not realise that they were putting me on a vueling airline but flying under a ba number. quite clearly this airline is at the bottom of the bucket airlines in both service and comfort. as we were flying back from barcelona to the uk having my knees wedged up against the seat in front only lasted a couple of hours. the food service which you had to pay for was indifferent and very expensive. if you sat in the middle of the plane you just didnt get served. probably the most worrying thing besides the extremely poor english by cabin and flight crew was the cabin staff apparent indifference to seats being up right for landing preventing some passengers taking their over head luggage down while in the air and on landing passengers up and around while the aircraft was moving. perhaps uk bucket airlines are not so bad. 17 april 2015 airbus a320 business heathrow to lisbon. a total waste of money. the food was horrible. a couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. there was no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. the seat pitch was pathetic and could not even get a rest. i am very disappointed that i did not choose tap instead of british. 10 april 2015 airbus a320 business heathrow to rome fco. a total waste of money. the food was tea there was no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. as alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes theres nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and deplaning first. dont waste your money unless someone else is paying for it. flew ba256 from delhi to heathrow  usual ba issues which have been repeated here many times. firstly the first cabin was not clean at all with debris on the floor food still in the seat  its pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board the food  the food can only be described as truly awful to be honest i would be complaining if i received this standard of food in economy  the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. i did not bother with desert afternoon tea served up probably the worst patisserie i have ever had the displeasure of tasting  completely inedible. the cabin crew were good and pleasant however i was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. it would seem to me that ba are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but i am struggling to see any level of improvement i take at least 1 first class international flight every year. have flown ba for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. the lounge not run by ba but used by ba at delhi was very good indeed. we flew for the very first time on ba on 270315 and returned 060315. our holiday to st lucia from gatwick was booked through kuoni and we usually fly with virgin atlantic. we always upgrade with virgin to premium economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the premium economy experience with virgin is very good. therefore we booked ba world traveller plus expecting the same degree of service. what a disappointment i would not advise wasting your upgrade money. apart from getting the larger luggage allowance ba world traveller plus is almost exactly the same as world traveller. the service both ways was appalling the seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 89 hour flight we had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with business class customers and had no time for our section at all. on the way back my husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. we only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. on this length of flight i was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and were asleep throughout the 9 hours. the seat back tvs are very small and my tv didnt work properly and i couldnt even watch anything. the aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. we will never fly with ba again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone. substandard food in business class london to mauritius arbitrary upgrade policy  as we could not afford bus class on return flight booked premium economy we told that because we were bus on way out we would get priority consideration on way back. charging for seat selection is a rip off was separated from my wife on way out 15th aug 2014 flight ba0272. me and my 3 friends flew from san to lhr then to ist. our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be completed. i wonder what would happen if we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. when they gave us our tickets we saw that they put us all separately. they could not even manage to sit us together. when i was thinking how could this get worse we missed our lhrist flight and waited in a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. while a clerk was trying to complete our checkin for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passengers processes and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk was offering 800 dollars per person and free accommodation for volunteer passengers to fly on the next plane. ba0010 world traveller 4 apr 2015. bangkokheathrow london. ba0009 world traveller 17 apr 2015 heathrow london  bangkok. the check in staff were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg of my trip i also met others on the same flight where this was allowed. the plane was old. the cabin crew were professional however compared to the middle eastern airlines the service wasnt nearly as good. lhrbkk in club on b777. fourth long haul leg on ba in the last month and this was by far the best flight. that said i still think the product is disappointing. im the camp that says the seats are highly uncomfortable. they are far too narrow as an average sized person still finds their arms draped across the arm rests while trying to sleep. you simply cant keep your arms by your side. as such little to no sleep. ife outdated and awful. lhramslhr in club europe on a321. nice service for a short hop. i think bas club europe product is better than their long haul product. no flat beds but aircraft were in good condition cabin crews professional efficient and genuinely nice. food was actually edible with a cheese and charcuterie plate. both flights delayed due to heathrow congestion and amsterdam weather but other than that a pretty good experience. lhrphl ba067 19th april. one of the features of a british airways ba flight that attracted me in the past was the breadth of specialmeal options. this until recently included a seafood meal. indeed ten years ago ba had fishermans pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chickenorpasta  then they boasted of their support for the british fishing industry  no longer. seafood meals are gone. why from a ba response id like to inform you that the meals have been removed due to the low volumes with many of our customers now choosing other options. indeed. if no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no options. there is only chickenorpasta. really what would it take to offer a cold seafood meal a tunafish salad and a bread roll one more reason to choose ba is gone. one more reason to fly with a middle eastern airline such as etihad who still care about service of a sort that ba has started to abandon. 17 april 2015 airbus a320 business heathrow to lisbon. a total waste of money. the food was horrible. a couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. there was no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. the seat pitch was pathetic and could not even get a rest. i am very disappointed that i did not choose tap instead of british. flew gatwick to kingston 13315 return 27315 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together ba did not even try to accommodate us. not worth the money virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. will never travel ba long haul again be warned dont waste your money. ba1326 heathrow to newcastle 22415. checked in at t5 by an agent who should train some of the others. very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. the good experience ended there. punctuality reared its ugly head once more. ive recorded this repeatedly. departure was delayed 45 minutes. not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly i can pretty much count on it. its a shame ba cant address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. once on board ba is like a tale of two airlines. some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. but whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. when we landed at newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule well marvellous not in my opinion. having just flown around the world on another airline which was able to operate twelve out of thirteen flights either on time or ahead of schedule i have to say that i remain generally unimpressed. ba 1321 newcastle to heathrow 1415. check in at newcastle was as always very fast and efficient. once on board the cabin crew did a great job of welcoming everyone. a great crew offering old school ba charm at its best and no small achievement considering the very early departure time. new and very compact seating which seems to be the new norm for economy class travel on short haul european flights. flight arrived at t5 not quite on time as i remember but hey ho not at all bad. 15th aug 2014 flight ba0272. me and my 3 friends flew from san to lhr then to ist. our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be completed. i wonder what would happen if we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. when they gave us our tickets we saw that they put us all separately. they could not even manage to sit us together. when i was thinking how could this get worse we missed our lhrist flight and waited in a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. while a clerk was trying to complete our checkin for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passengers processes and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk was offering 800 dollars per person and free accommodation for volunteer passengers to fly on the next plane. we flew premium economy class from singapore to london on a 747 carrier. it was a waste of money. the plane looked 100 years old and nothing seemed to work properly. the entertainment system remote control was stuck to its base and it had to be removed with a sharp instrument. the little screen showed a blurred picture so it was not worth watching movies. the crew was nowhere to be seen and they couldnt be called if you needed something because the call button had been cancelled on all remote controls. at some stage i went to the toilet and went through the kitchen. the crew was there talking and laughing and one of them was sitting reading the paper. shame on you ba. never again for my annual trip athphl via any european city dep 183 return 194 this time i chose ba because they were the cheapest. this was my first flight on ba to the usa. soon after my choice i tried to select a seat as far front as possible however i was asked to pay 35 euros for a seat in row. 27. 35 euros and you are almost at the end of the aircraft. in the end ba was more expensive than others. the flight was ok and punctual b777 not really my choice as very noisy staff service  one hostess was excellent another was ignorant and unwilling. food the usual penne rigate. complained to ba via email however no reply was ever received. for my return flight i was in row 30 same noisy b777 same penne rigate and of course a good choice of inflight entertainment. breakfast with lovely frozen bread roll. yes frozen or chilled. my next choice will of course not be ba. istlhr the so called business class is a joke and is virtually indistinguishable from economy on any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline properly there is no sort of entertainment whatsoever on a four hour flight. having flown on turkish royal jordanian emirates and cathay pacific in the past couple of months only made the contrast more striking. never again laxlhrlax april return may 14. another chance to try the a380 product and all seemed well online check in bag drop sensible loading on the air bridge at lax but once we boarded a self important flight attendant decided she had to check the boarding passes to ensure we were on the right plane on the right day. no you do not we have been checked all the way along. still even this pitiful attitude could not dampen the sterling job done by the pair of flight attendants we had. they gave mixed fleet a very good name. now having got through everything needed on that trip we had the return. wtp so the food was ok the thing is during the trip the lax sector had reverted back to the legacy staff. disaster. the staff tried until around half way through the flight when a woman who spoke with a brogue i guess eire arrived to take charge and declared the bar closed. so too were snacks of crisps etc. half way through a long flight ba claim the bar service and snacks are available throughout the flight. clearly they are telling lies. this poor creature shut things because she had counted everything. anyway if ba wish to lie to us we will not be buying from their high life shop. it cuts both ways. so to sum up most ba staff really do try to make passengers the customers enjoy the experience certainly i have always flown ba where possible however when one employee on each sector can colour the experience in such a negative manner i shall not be rushing to fly them again. closing the bar and snacks after less than six hours on a flight of over eleven hours to fly to be self serving. i really can no longer recommend ba. over the last couple of years i have travelled to china by emirates klm virgin atlantic and ba. the next time i travel ba will be my last choice. i got the impression from the very start that ba are penny pinching at every opportunity. their lounges are basic and the food minimal. although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. the cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. if you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out. our flight on economy long distance from the austin to heathrow was the most uncomfortable weve had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. the seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. we had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. the evening meal we were served was inedible. the pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. it was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. the foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. as for the breakfast in a box it was so bad i cannot comment. weve had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on myanmar airlines we want to support our national airline but definitely not on ba economy. it seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class. a huge disappointment. ba 138 1352015. ba 273 1352015. just completed my first ba flight in club world. the experience can be summed up in a single word  pathetic. the flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre couples seat. the crew was totally indifferent. the light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. if you are seated in the centre couple seats you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. the buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge. will never travel ba again. we travelled on flight ba11 from heathrow to singapore on 25th july 2014 and it is most unlikely we would travel with them again. we were supposed to depart at 2000 and had arrived early to escape the rush and heat of london. when we checked the departures board we noticed no gate number had been allotted to our flight. we hung around gate a area and waited for further advice and waited and waited. the clock ticked on and we all waited for the advice the board is supposed to display. come 1920 supposed to be boarding and still no gate number or advice as to the delayed boarding. i could go on and on but finally at 2008 yes 8 minutes after scheduled departure time the board declared that we had to go to gate b area for a 2100 departure. still no explanation as to why we were an hour late. we caught the transit service and headed over there finally boarding the plane after the rescheduled departure time. the air conditioning was virtually nonfunctional and we were forced to sit in the stinking heat waiting for some sort of explanation and apology. the staff seemed surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one stewardess near us at the rear of the plane refused two requests from passengers to bring water using the defence that she was on my own back here and cannot leave my post. incredibly she left her post several times when it suited her to talk to other stewards etc about 2110 the captain announced that they had lost a passenger and we should depart within 1015 minutes. finally at 2221 we took off after sitting in the terrible heat and humidity of all those bodies for over an hour with no service of drinks or anything else after boarding over an hour late yes we departed 2 hours and 21 minutes late and still without explanation or apology of any kind from any of the staff the air conditioning did not start to reduce the temperature until more than 3 hours into the flight when we landed at singapore the captain announced that he hoped the ongoing passengers hadnt been too inconvenienced by the holdup. i guess that was bas apology totally disgraceful ba andwe still dont know why we were delayed. punta cana  gatwick. world traveller plus cabin on b777. i find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. the front row of world traveller pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. ife was ok but nothing special. main meal was ok but breakfast was an absolute disgrace a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. no alternatives offered. i know this is not business class but for the premium i paid for world traveller plus i feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. the drinks service was nothing special either one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. then nothing until breakfast. regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. when in all innocence i used a toilet in the business class cabin i found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when i emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. fair enough but when i explained that other passengers in world traveller plus had also used the toilets in business class i was virtually called a liar. i backed off from an argument but i found the experience upsetting and i simply couldnt get to sleep thereafter. i eventually disembarked at lgw hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. in summary world traveller plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but dont get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service. after a recent flight to st lucia with ba if i have a choice in future i will fly with another airline. from the start of the return trip we experienced problems. headset failed to work on reporting this to the cabin crew i was informed that you need to jiggle it to make a connection so needed to unpack my own kit to watch a movie. meal time the only choice left was pasta one with cheese and one without the passenger next to me had the pasta it looked like it had been reheated with the cover off very hard. on mentioning it to the cabin staff all she got was their cutting down in all areas. re the movie this picture quality was a disgrace picture and sound kept braking up i switched my phone on and again used my own music to get me through the 8 hours trip. i have cancelled my ba membership. sadly flying british airways is no longer about a great experience  it is a seat on a flight which you pay a lot of money for. we had a number of issues that we tried to get resolved via customer services but were told they couldnt do anything until our journey had ended we were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address our issues during our journey. ba staff at heathrow told us the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage causing big issues the plane was overly hot on both legs of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flights this is a known problem on these older planes. the breakfast on our return flight wasnt fit for consumption  an ice cold hard croissant after 7 hours of no food really poor service and even worse customer services. lgwher. a320 on one of bas new touristorientated routes. sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the pennypinching new club europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. if this is the way ba are going it doesnt make sense to pay the extra. they really should think again about their premium service. first off this particular flight from ewr to lhr and back was advertised as a boeing 787 dreamliner. the actual jet was a 777 much less comfortable. the flight going to london was 3 hours delayed coming into ewr something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in boston ma. in fact they had not allocated a crew. coming home my prepaid seats were changed in premium economy to seats next to wcs so i had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight. i was also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email was followed up with one that stated that the first one was sent in error. fact i did get back to the usa. reality ba no more  never again. the problem with ba is not their cabin crews who are quite nice. the problem is that their customer service is a joke. cannot recommend this airline. ba 10 bangkok to london heathrow may 26th 2015 world traveller plus premium economy. first the positives checkin at bkk was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at lhr about 15 minutes early. unfortunately while world traveller plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of world traveller plus. the cabin seating and equipment were tired  the entertainment system was old and barely functional. however by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. after the first meal service an uninspiring chicken curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the ba website about the supposed enhanced dining experience of world traveller plus calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. it seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being interrupted barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. in stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on qantas to bangkok the previous day this so called premium experience on ba was extremely disappointing. our advice dont waste your money on ba world traveller plus. zrhlhr. a bit of a disaster. my flight ba 719 was delayed 90 minutes  and so was the preceding flight. so one is acceptable  two is well a coincidence. or not. left 90 minutes late about 20 minutes after the earlier late departure got stacked over kent  landing about 2 hours late  from a 80 minutes flight. plane was almost brand new. crew was great  but in the end couldnt care less. ba at its worst. pathetic. club world just flown london gatwick to las vegas in club world and very disappointed. staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing you a favour. the seating of 242 in a business cabin is unfair trying to pack too many people in. they didnt offer anything to try to make you feel a bit special and i had paid a lot of money for the tickets. i normally fly virgin atlantic on this route and will defiantly be using them in the future. we travelled on flight ba11 from heathrow to singapore on 25th july 2014 and it is most unlikely we would travel with them again. we were supposed to depart at 2000 and had arrived early to escape the rush and heat of london. when we checked the departures board we noticed no gate number had been allotted

worth it for the extra comfort and space but dont get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service. worst customer experience on ba flight. i have a confirmed flights for british airways from singapore to sydney for tomorrow. when i tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online checkin. i called the ba contact center in the uk and was shocked with the response received. the person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating. essentially ba wants to sell their seats at a premium. they arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesnt mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation. we are travelling as a family but got scattered seats. very embittered with the overall experience. will never fly again with british airways. i had this terrible experience of traveling british airways from heathrow to calgary. the plane was parked in a nomans area and we were bussed to the plane. to my horror i had to climb through the stairs with my carry on bag the width of the seat and the leg space is the smallest i saw in my 40 years of travel experience. its a shame that that the airline is using this kind of carrier for a transatlantic flight. the quality of food is one of the worst i have ever seen. i picked the nonveg chicken item the taste and content was hopeless. the container was marked for expiry as 281116 07.53 an expiry after 18 months but marked for the hour and minute. the only positive thing i can think of in this torture for 9 hours is the attitude and service of the cabin crew they were great. ba362 6th june 2015. if this were the first flight i had taken with british airways i would not be impressed. at check in there is a lack of professionalism. the customer does not come first even at the first class check in. staff interrupt each other and discuss their own business in priority to completing the check in. the flight was in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such as was provided given as ten minutes. the aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumbs on the seat and grease marks on the windows. the inflight shopping was made difficult as there were no inflight duty free magazines available in club class. inflight entertainment system did not work. whilst the food was good it had to be changed as the first offering was cold. inflight crew were pleasant and efficient. upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passengers. herlgw. our return flight confirmed our view that club europe is a waste of money on this new route. her is infamous as a relic of the 70s and ba have done nothing to improve that. checkin was interminable despite a club europe desk. there was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. no lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. not surprisingly there was no priority boarding. our seats 2d and 2e are the only decent seats in the new club europe. service on board was adequate. lgw was the usual nightmare taking 45 minutes to crawl through the boarder control fiasco. we certainly wouldnt want to repeat our ba experience to and from her. im very disappointed with my ba flight as it was very poor. i was traveling from gla glasgowlca larnaca via lhr london. on my first flight my tray table fell on it hinges. they did gives a full breakfast though. then on the second flight the middles of the seat were full of dust and gum. secondly the television on the 767 was broken. finally on a 5 and a half hour flight they gave us a little chicken or vegetable wrap with a choc pud. ba006 19th may 2015. awful premium economy service  bad old cabin with faulty inflight entertainment and they even split my wife and i up when travelling back from japan  how is that acceptable flew from heathrow to san francisco on may 1st with ba. what a disappointment i had to pay over 120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. then we couldnt access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was ok typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey dont they stock up before picking up the next passengers luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues. would i fly ba again certainly not long haul although unfortunately i have to return to heathrow with them from boston today. flew to tampa from gatwick on the 12515 return flight on the 25515. had flown with ba on several occasions to mauritius. cant believe despite the number of complaints ba received nothing has changed regarding the food the service. admittedly some of crew are good but some of them makes you wonder why did they choose such career. ba seriously need to review the customer care they provide. dinner overcooked frozen rolls with a cereal bar for breakfast  really tasted better food on cheaper airline. come on ba listen to your customer and improve your service. very disappointed with ba. fralhr on a319 we sat on the plane at the gate for almost 40 minutes due to one runway closed no drinks offered. no veg meal for my wife empty bottle under the middle seat tray. landed allegedly almost on time due to the excessive time scheduled for the leg. flew club world from gatwick to barbados in april to connect with a cruise back to europe. arrived on a norwegian flight from stockholm at gatwick the day before and were able to check in luggage the evening before the flight to avoid any delays next day very quiet efficient checkin in economy section. missed club world checkin. next day very efficient priority security straight to lounge. very crowded but found seats eventually. ordered champagne delivered promptly but it was difficult to get a refill as staff a bit overwhelmed so fixed own g&t. boarding on b777 efficient and shown to 2 back facing seats basically a double bed. glass of champagne provided as we settled in. take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. several drinks services before and during meal service. very relaxed and very professional crew. food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which i was privileged to enjoy. the seat was strange. very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. ba has 8 across seating more than any other business class operating the b777 in the world. entertainment ok. reasonable screen but hardly world class. things going fine until 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. what about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly club as a special treat. we persuaded a very nice first class ca to raid first class to provide a glass of champagne. after that we were on our own with the club kitchen. what a joke. packets of crisps and a choice of red or white.  very poor indeed for business class. all in all an ok flight with a very good crew but signs of penny pinching throughout. oh dear ba how you have deteriorated. this review refers to a return trip from india bomlhr in premium economy. the seating is fine in this class and is definitely worth the extra from standard economy in terms of the leg room. however thats where it ends. the service compared with business which i travelled out in is woeful. the ba cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in business or first as secondclass citizens and barely do their job. that and the awful food  the worst ive had on a long haul flight has made me seriously rethink my choice of carrier next time i fly the route. terrible. flight time is well over 2 hours. seating is like ryanair but we are talking ba club europe. which genius decided that 30 inch is sufficient for premium passengers no idea what to do with my legs. its impossible to use my laptop. this is not business class. very uncomfortable flight especially for the money i paid. ba  rethink flight was delayed 2 hours  i was given reasonable notice but then had to rearrange my connecting flight and ended up with a lot more time at heathrow than i would have liked. checkin was fine and cabin staff attentive food average  but i do have an issue with space. the 747 fuselage tapers at the back  theres not enough room for 343 seating and rows 51 on have 242 configuration. rows 4950 dont have enough room for 343 seating either but ba do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seats narrower than the rest. i endured a 9 hour night flight in one of these horrible seats my back was twisted and sore for weeks after. this is just not acceptable for a longhaul flight especially at night  ba charges extra for seats identified as having more room by the same principle these seats should be advertised as having less room and cashback offered for anyone prepared to accept them small children perhaps. lhrncllhr. i was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning i was to fly  the whole point of this trip was so i could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. i managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed i had to now arrange last minute accommodation i thought this would be straightforward and as far as rebooking it was via the ba app. what it didnt tell me was that the flight i rearranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as i received a a textapp notification telling me so  i think this was very sneaky not to mention before rebooking and i spent a couple of hours getting to know terminal 5. the general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable  more than anything when everything else is cutback reliability becomes golden. the plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and i liked the simple but elegant cabin. ba staff also do let things down a bit often quite brusque and unfriendly and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. cabin crew were fine but lack warmth of some other airlines. sadly there arent any other options on this route so will probably be switching back to rail despite sometimes competitive fares. after flying many many times i can honestly say this was the worst plane i have ever flown in. the aircraft was old and falling apart. during the flight the handle of the toilet flew off one of the overhead bins was loose and the table holding the bassinette was broken. the carpet was threadbear and the equipment was being held together with tape. they did not have enough food and nothing available for me i have a nut allergy the food that was served was not fit for human consumption. the toilets were not cleaned during the whole flight 13 hours and as a result the smell from there was disgusting. the rubbish bin was overflowing with waste which included soiled nappies. the only time we saw the cabin crew was when they were serving food. they looked very scruffy not what you would expect of a ba cabin crew. all in all a very unpleasant flight. i travel to asia every year and will ensure i never fly ba on this route again. overall good experience. ba owns vuelingiberian airlines booked me paris to rome. if they try to book you on this airline say no. no leg room no service never again. after two weeks in europe i was really looking forward to going home to my family. when i finally got to the ba counter in the rome airport i was told my flight to london was delayed. i would not be able to make my connection in london and i would have to spend the night and fly out in the morning. at another ba desk i was told they had a hotel for me within walking distance. well im 70 and i would say more like walking distance if youre a camel. the room and hotel were finebut when i went to the restaurant with my meal ticket i was given a menu with three items on it told i could have water for free but be charged for any other drink. i had paid extra to book my aisle seat months in advance but now i had to book again ba should have done this one day in advance of my flight middle seat for my 12 hours of flight home to la. check in at tegel was a disaster and ludicrously for it has a lot of ba flights i was told there are no ba staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure 2 check in desks were open  1 business 1 economy. as a ba silver card holder i joined the business queue. first one lady had considerably too much baggage. the arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight others were way too large. after 20 more minutes i asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. this was not possible i was told. eventually another economy desk opened yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. finally after more than 40 minutes someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all looking forward to a drink in the lounge i then discover there is no lounge airside. as for the lhrord flight i have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. to board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31 was a major shock. this is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. the worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. the meal was ok and the ife had a decent selection of movies. but overall the flight was hugely uncomfortable. with some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31 ba has lost my future business. after my flight to vienna with ba i was hoping for a slight improvement on the way back  however the service was very boring. drink service was rushed with the stewardess pouring an entire miniature of vodka into a drink before putting a drop of tomato juice in when i asked for a tomato and vodka  unpalatable. was glad to be off the plane in all fairness. hoping that one day ba will wow me. slightly disappointing flight in an aircraft that was showing its age. it seems very little effort is put into cabin decor meaning it looks quite tawdry in all fairness. food was okay  ham and cheese croissant  but nothing to write home about. seats werent great for someone my height and all in all i was left feeling underwhelmed  budget level offerings at a high price it appears ba continues to adopt a do as little as possible for this route presumably due to their monopoly. the aircraft and cabin is looking tiredold and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with emirates etihad and qatar airways. outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. my seat 2k was shockingly filthy. it had been cleared since the last passenger but i noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food drink splatters on the cabin wall crumbs in seat foldsgaps and stained cover all sorts of debris on floor in gapscracks and remarkably grimy carpet. cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. seat was ok for comfort but mediocre ife choice with very poor quality screen. meal service was good for food and drink although dirty environment was offputting. lacto veg meal much improved since last tried. pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. mars bars and kitkats are tragically promoted as retro but some nice ice cream. return in 1k and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. im ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. tired so skipped dinner. decided to watch a short tv programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward although even less programme choice. i found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode but got five hours of sleep. the cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. awake for breakfast so when attendants were offering bacon rolls i asked for my wife and my requested lacto veg meals. staff returned ashen faced and profusely apologising with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. such bad service and a lack of joinedup thinking you couldnt make it up. postflight i found the ba customer complaints dept to be dreadful and left me far more disappointed with the service than at the end of my flights. disappointed. the food was poor my wifes steak could have been anything my curry had a tiny piece of chicken. the cabin was less than half full but cabin crew hadnt time to bring a glass of wine. after the meal staff disappeared. no after dinner drink offered no refreshments during the night. for the price this could have been a lot better. return on old b747 was better. this is my 3rd flight with ba in 8 months and  the worst yet. the customer service and communication is appalling. originally my return flight was from rome to london gatwick but my flight was cancelled due to issues at rome airport. but instead of ba getting in contact with me in regards to this the third party company i booked the flights with had to. when checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. when i  spoke to them on the phone they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though i called the customer service number. this is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service was good which is surprising. but as a result of the rudeness lack of communication and appalling customer service im very unlikely to ever use them again.  this was my first time with british airways. i was disappointed in the amount of seatleg room compared to some other airlines ive traveled with. i was also surprised that on longer european flights london to istanbul for example which i traveled there was no tv when the flight is as long or longer than flights in asia from countrytocountry which have tventertainment system. the universal entertainment system was broken too and the sound wasnt working. the service button to call an attendant was broken too. a stewardess on this particular flight from jfk to lhr ba1511 on june 19 2015 was so rude to my daughter. my daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food options on the plane included dairy. my daughter asked nicely if there was any nondairy options and the stewardess takes the food from my daughters tray and says i guess youre just going to have to eat that salad. it wasnt what she said that bothered me it was the way she said it. she didnt offer pretzels or nondairy snacks or anything. this was my first experience with british airways and i was disappointed. it wasnt until my flight back home that i felt a bit better. on my ride back with british airways not this flight in specific from lhr to las i encountered a steward who was very pleasant polite and very professional.  as a frequent flyer on various airlines british airways is by far the worst i have experienced. substandard customer service even before the flight. my original plan was to fly from toronto to rome via london on july 2nd. three tickets were purchased and confirmed in march. two weeks before departure an email was sent to me altering my flight from london to rome. i called and waited on the service hotline  i was able to get myself on one flight and my parents on another. the rep refused to try to put me together with my parents. less than 48 hours before departure my rescheduled flight was rerouted to naples. the agent told me all extra travel expenses would be my own. on the day of departure i got my flight from gatwick to rome after rushing from heathrow. i was told initially the flight was rerouted to naples and just before departure this reverted back to a direct flight to rome  very confusing communication. i arrived in rome to discover my parents flight was delayed for four hours. with more ba flights arriving into the terminal the service desk was closed before my flight even arrived. there are no ba reps anywhere to seek assistance. my family and i flew from rotterdam to london on 26th of june and its our first time traveling with ba. we chose it as we thought this airlines would be better than budget airlines with constant delays. we were very wrong. we arrived at the airport on time and sat down to wait. ba announced flight delays due to technical error for 1.5 hours before finally announcing that the flight was cancelled. we were given no explanation except for one phrase technical fault. we were then unceremoniously sent back to queue in line to be rescheduled. we waited another 45 mins and was then transferred to a 7.20pm flight original was 1.05pm. we were denied all chances to board an earlier one at 4pm. we did not complain or gave ba any trouble. we followed procedures and applied for compensation online. their reply was simply a sorry and they denied all responsibilities. returning from chicago to berlin the overall flight experience was no better than the outward sectors a week earlier. i opted to skip dinner and instead have breakfast since the flight landed around 1000. breakfast was a hard slab of cake with one drink  a total disgrace once again the cabin was too warm and i saw no passengers using their blankets. the berlin flight exlhr was delayed initially due to the usual late incoming aircraft excuse and then to a broken apu. so no air was being pumped in to the cabin and the engines could not be started for some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work. meanwhile on one of the hottest days of the year we waited on board in increasingly saunalike conditions. the captain kept us informed and then made up a bit if time although we still landed 35 minutes late. my experience chimes with the general consensus on the club world service lhrjfk. cabin seats and fittings are showing their age and look rather shabby by this point. not too clean red wine spills on my foot rest when i boarded. tiny screen and ife looked dated not great entertainment selection. the food quality was good but service from cabin crew was rather indifferent with little attempt to make it a special dining experience. nuts and chocolates served in packets not bowls. not attentive over providing drinks refills or water. i wasnt offered all of the items listed on the menu  where did my fruit and cheese platter go had to ask for coffeetea refills after the meal. brewed coffee only  no fresh lattescappuccinos. was not offered disgestifs after the meal. cabin crew disappeared after the meal. self service snacks in the galley were economy quality apart from some nice rose champagne. just not a luxury or experience felt like i was in economy but with more space and food. on this occasion my partner and i experienced a 3.5 hour delay with ba. there was no communication at the airport nothing until we got onto the plane where the captain told us delays were due to a bag that had not been checked in correctly at heathrow. because of the delay when the plane finally arrived it had no water on board and was not permitted to fill up at our destination. this meant disgusting toilets because of no flush and no warm drinks on board. we were sat on the runway for an hour because the engines would not start. we had no aircon for 40 mins. when we finally got back to heathrow the captain told us that he was sorry for the issues. our night flight was delayed by nearly an hour not the fault of the airline but a contributory factor to our disappointment with ba on this flight 17th june 2015. we paid extra for our premium economy tickets then extra again to reserve seats and past experience with ba and with equivalent seatsservice on virgin atlantic had led us to expect value for money and some small rewards for the extra costs. not this flight however where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom. we were last to board after first business and economy. where customers in premium economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice now it is water or juice. once we had taken off drinks were served fine but when the steward came to collect the empty glassbottle he knocked the glass onto the floor where it broke  the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps i was made to feel that the breakage was my fault dinner did not arrive until after 11pm by which time i had rather lost interest as had my partner. so far our extra costs had bought us extra leg room and one glass of wine i was not offered a second possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass. overnight by contrast to other night flights the lights were never fully dimmed there were no offers of waterorange juice to prevent dehydration. the promised on the menu card morning light snack and coffeeteafruit juice was a hastily delivered piece of driedup cake and a weak coffee  no mention of fruit juice. i couldnt really see what my extra costs were getting me that those in economy had for less  the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in fronts fully reclined seat. i will not if at all possible be travelling with ba again. it left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday. same tired plane back to london. ground and cabin staff were friendly pleasant and helpful. a first on this series of flights. flew on the same plane on the way from lhr to ist see other recent reviews. moved to row 1 for more space. still substandard and why why put economy seats in business class lounge was crammed and noisy preflight. i joined star alliance as a gold member so at least got to see the miles and smiles lounge. ba look around dont rest on last centurys efforts. ive flown ba first but just wouldnt any more. responding to skytrax reviews may just help increase profits. i must say apart from the cheery crew on ba 677 the polite but totally disinterested service when it exists and old cramped cabins will be my memory of this business trip. all i can say is mediocre. having flown this route with other airlines in business class i believe i have been spoilt. the british airways product is old and just adequate. tv screen small and poor quality food okay but nothing more seating poor. the one highlight was quality of service from the crew. i had nothing to actually complain about but nothing to make me want to use this product again. i have been flying between dublin and london once every 2 weeks on average since the beginning of the year and i have regularly used british airways at the beginning. however i have found their new policy of asking for 15 for seat selection even at checkin really annoying unnecessary and insulting to loyal customers. fair enough if they want to charge for prebooking of seats but at least they should allow selection at checkin time in line with their direct competitors on the same route aer lingus. i have also found the service food drinks etc extremely poor for the fare charged even for the short sector. if they continue their moneygrabbing policy i will definitely and happily give more of my business to aer lingus and cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows. uncomfortable serviceless low class. i had low expectations and they werent met. club world has gone from leading to lagging. cramped pods 8 seats across when others have 6 and a tired old plane. i usually fly in an aisle seat but know better on ba so was in a window seat. the passenger next to me was repeatedly woken as food was handed over or spilt on him. after the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. only one bottle of water all flight. the food was tasteless overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiments reminded me of fast food chain. at the price this is the worst product in the skies. seat was broken and ife clunky. being used to cx qf sia finnair air tahiti nui aa lan chile and more i hesitate to call it business class because it isnt. expected club world got club europe  the same as economy on any decent airline. food was okay plied with alcohol if you wanted it. must be the oldest aircraft in the fleet. no ife other than a 24 screen for the cabin. was told by the ground crew that my qualifying international cabin bag needed to be checked in not happy. its been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. my colleague had the same. officious and uncalled for. exactly the same cabin bags were rolled aboard 4 days later on the return flight. seats were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airlines. why pay for club europe business class when you dont get it i managed to switch to upstairs on the 744 so happy as it is a quiet space. seat 64a footstool was broken so the night was uncomfortable. we left singapore around midnight and got into lhr at 0441hrs so sleep was intermittent as i tried to adjust the seat to compensate. food out of singapore was okay but still lacking. one pleasant attendant one grumpy. no fast track on landing because we got in early so queue with coach tours. im stuck on british airways this trip but wont be booking by choice again. adult meals ran out just sausage and potato left no childrens meals available return flight delayed by 7 hours as plane was not in a safe condition. scheduled flight at 8pm departed at 3.30am they had to fly one in to orlando all the way from cardiff  a bad joke. no childrens meals available.  once british airways review their seating facilities i will use the airline again. the seats are so cramped and when the passenger in front decided to recline his seat that was it no matter how much i asked him to recline back he would not do it. only when the food arrived did he move his seat  and to add insult to injury the food tasted vile and ended up eating the bread roll only. i will use ba now as a last option. flew back 30 june lgwmco flight delayed at gatwick for 8 hours. got told at 13.55 when flight was supposed to leave that there was a technical fault and they were bringing in a new aircraft from cardiff told to report back at 15.15 to be told that still not here and to report back later and given 10 voucher. told we would take off at 17.15 come 17.15 got told they needed to try and get a crew. did not depart until after 9pm. it was our tenth wedding anniversary not one member of staff said anything i spoke with back duty office the day before and was told they would arrange a glass of champagne inflight. boarded aircraft which was a very old 777 no champagne no duty free and no kids packs. my ife had to be rebooted. ba is getting more like a budget airline every time i fly. i now have to pay 15 to choose a seat when i book in and then wait an unreasonable time to board. fast track were called forward first and about 80 of the passengers went that way. when i finally got to the front i asked if all the fast track were fast track and was told no but we are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue so what is the point. easyjet and norwegian are far better than ba for short haul and any middle east airline for long haul. try harder ba please check in at first counter by a scruffy guy who wouldnt check my bag through on a connection. the ground crew were ordinary on first check in nothing special and in the lounge. unable to answer if there was an arrivals lounge at changi and just not interested in passengers sorry customer compared with comparable qantas products. managed to get upstairs at the last minute on ba11 107. excellent cabin crew. couldnt have been more different than on any other sector on this trip. interesting and interested. they couldnt understand the lack of through bag at singapore. good food clean cabin uncomfortable and dated seat so didnt sleep much. this cabin crew probably dont go on to sydney. shame because they were excellent. having encouraged passengers to checkin online and save it staff time and money what does ba do it reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. business class bag drop at 0830 at heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. then having raced through security there was the almost inevitable flight delay only this time the 40minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result we were told of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport with flights taking off to the west there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks. sadly the gap between the national airline and budget carriers just gets closer all the time. if i could give it a zero i would. from the moment we checked flight departure time and were incorrectly informed resulting in waiting to board for over 3 hours to the incorrect arrival time as stated on the ife screen. a 12 hour flight with only 1 main meal plus a snack served  without any drinks. their idea of an asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and rice drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away. very uncomfortable hard seat aisles so small that most passengers had their legs stuck out in the aisles and finally finishing with nearly an hour getting thru customs to then having to wait 20 minutes for my luggage. can you please get off your backsides ba and fly economy with singapore airlines as they still realize its human beings they are transporting. i might have been in economy for service food and seating 8 abreast. no room to move. if you are over 80kg or 6 youre squashed completely. wc clean with paper towels. adequate ife. the difference between older crew on prior sectors and young cabin crew on this flight was stark. they were polite and totally wooden. on past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and as a frequent flyer even say thanks for choosing ba. hung clothes returned crushed. the dinner was the same as jet airways domestic economy. breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit tepid tea pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil. club world is like a stretched economy with a business class fare. lhrbkklhr. started badly with all the ryanairesque baggage warnings at terminal 5. bas low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. outward food superb best economy meal ive had in a long time. return trip horrible. at checkin i was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory ba limit. was asked for 65 more but declined. when i quoted thai airways 30kg limit i was invited to buy a ticket with them. so i had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. on the plane i had to sit next to a very fat man not bas fault and the food was disgusting. some rubber chicken with four strips of gravysodden potato wedges. no vegetables. second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. no salad yoghurt or other goodies. between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. ife had the smallest screen i have ever seen and a poor choice of films. return flight journey progress constantly broke down. generally a poor experience considering bas prices. will not be using ba again. i was amazed that this airline charges extra to book a seat in advance. i have never seen that on any of the nondiscount carriers especially in business class. when i pay for a business seat i expect that seat section will be free and i wont be charged for another 147. the bclass is not uncomfortable just configured weirdly with little storage space near the seat. the fas have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. the food was flat out lousyit looked like bad microwave fare. the service was ok nothing special. although i wasnt going to watch any inflight entertainment i did check it out. pretty meager selection. if given a choice i dont think i will fly ba after this trip is over. first leg cailhr was on time flight crew was pleasant but the seating was very cramped and legroom almost nonexistent. the second leg lhrjfk wasnt much different with helpful crew but horrible seating space. my knees were pressed against the seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them one at a time. it used to be a flagship carrier but now its not much better than a budget airline. will do my best to avoid. i had the misfortune to travel up to newcastle on a handbaggage only fare which for some reason doesnt entitle you to choose a seat. i was allocated seat 11a which had the tightest legroom i have experienced luckily it was only a short 50 min flight. these fares arent cheap and ba seem to be focussing more on extracting as much money as possible rather than providing a good service which is a real shame. day trip to vienna used ba economy as their business class fares are a complete rip off on ba these days. heathrow t3 departure experience is quite shoddy compared to t2 or main ba flights out of t5. service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best and staff seem to perform to a script  in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a ba uniform they think they are so excellent  a sad fact is their standards are below several major european airlines. the purser csd or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child and then proceeded to make the pa announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice  again this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow tds. as a oneworld emerald not with ba i stick with oneworld members but austrian offer a much better service and quality standard than ba. let me just start off by saying that im an educator and i have the patience of a saint. this being said after my first flight with ba when my luggage stayed in tampa and didnt make it to the uk until four days after id arrived i stayed fairly calm. mistakes are made. my flight had been canceled which seems like commonplace at ba and was rebooked after only three hours on the phone. when i ventured to take my trip home i was notified via text message that my flight had been canceled yet again. after speaking to a calm man about my horrible experience thus far he informed me of a customer care number that i could call and complain about my flight. lets remember im a teacher and i also payed 1800 for this trip. thats an entire months pay just so we all know. im meant to leave tomorrow and still have not received confirmation via email. i cannot reach ba via telephone. ive not been given proper accommodations to resolve my dissatisfaction with ba. needless to say i will never fly ba again. the baggage check in took forever it was 4550min of standing in the queue. the flight looked good and well maintained 777. inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies documentaries talk shows 5* for that. the seating space was just about good enough. be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. the air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. the inflight food was extremely hot in short it was burnt. the answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight. this was the first time in 12yr of international travel of hearing this excuse. flight was decent. have to say the seat was rather cramp. im 180cm or 5 foot 9 sat at seat 32f. inflight entertainment was alright but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. it damages easily if it gets caught on something. i had to change 2 headsets because of that because being in a aisle seat you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. service was alright. i requested for eye shades and it came about 1hr later crew must have forgotten about my request. i didnt pursue it as i thought i could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. in terms of food it was appalling and greasy. overall i will not say never again but given a choice id look out for singapore airlines first then the big 3 gulf carriers. for the right price id do ba again otherwise there are better ways to suffer than that cramped seat i have flown in business class with ba on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. if you get an indifferent crew  which in my experience is not far off half the time  they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible go to sleep and not bother them any more. once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you never check on you and leave you to ask for everything. i have never had that experience in business class with other airlines for example emirates eva or lan chile quite the opposite. anyway ba were offering a special price to upgrade cash only to first on my vancouverheathrow flight. i thought id try it. it was a waste of money. the first sign of trouble was the fact that i was not welcomed or addressed by name  an absolute must i think. then the male and they tend to be the worst on ba i am sorry to say flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy  he just doled them out rather than hand them to and speak to each passenger in a personal manner. the wine selection didnt seem so very much better than business class and when i asked a specific question flavour of champagne the flight attendant didnt know the answer. i eat slowly and was still on my main course lamb and rather dry when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. i thought oh no surely not in first. well i was wrong. i was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. after that unbelievably i was abandoned again and in protest got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. i asked to speak to the cabin services director female delighful manner who was full of apologies of course and off i went back to my seat. when i was finally given coffee the flight attendant who brought it another female confided that ba dont have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do i couldnt believe my ears. as for the cabin being in the nose of the 747i felt cramped. the moodchanging lighting doesnt compensate for the dark monotone blue of the seats and carpet. the inlight entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. i know this reads like a demolition job on ba but i have made no exaggerations. i really think willie walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. hed find out for himself. i want ba to be the best and it simply isnt. lastly my experience of the hit and miss service of ba business class is shared by every other person i have ever mentioned it to. if youre flying ba stay in business class youre not missing anything. this review is written due to what i feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. the first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff i have ever come across. the lounge was fine but it is looking tired. service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. no priority boarding had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes no greeting at the door no escort to seat no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty covered in crumbs and other such food. opened two magazines both torn ripped and in rag order. staff very pleasant professional and very helpful. food ok not first class wines good. the entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. the seat would not lie flat and hard to move. bought on board duty free and asked would i need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. deplaned no escort no gate to go to given wrong directions to the lounge. had to clear immigration although not entering the uk waited 45 minutes to be told duty free i bought on board could not go through i would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. this was done had to reclear security again got to the lounge asked for a shower told too busy. connection flight was delayed by one hour waited at the gate. flight to dublin short salad served and tea. priority bags were the last bags on the belt. overall this is not first class it is not even premium economy. i fly 1214 times a year and gold level. ba you have lost your edge i will stay loyal to qatar emirates and cathay pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. my advice do not waste your money with ba its service cutting to the point of insult. i am a very frequent long haul traveller and although i will often choose the asian carriers e.g. singapore airlines jal cathay over british airways being based in london means that i do often fly with ba. i find bas long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. the seats dont quite lie flat and its not unusual to get a broken seat and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out  i cant think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. i am told by a ba contact that they considered changing the configuration for the a380s but didnt in the end. worst of all i find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent  most often its a little begrudging occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. i was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from lhr to tokyo haneda when settling down in my seat i looked down to find a dirty napkin used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet good job i hadnt taken my shoes off at this stage. my husband flagged down a member of cabin crew who said she would come and clear it but didnt. i flagged down the cabin services director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. upon my return i complained to ba. after three weeks they deigned to reply but it was on the lines of our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards we are sorry you didnt find this to your liking  effectively implying that i was making a fuss over nothing.  booked for our trip to uganda in feb 2015 we spent 1450 for 2 return tickets had to pay an additional 100 to reserve seats on the flights. about 2 days ago i received a text message not a call saying that our flight had been cancelled  left us in the dark until i had to phone their 0844 number to get transferred to a delhi call centre when i was told i could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flights and not the seats on this now non existant flight. i had to phone back a further 2 times to get through to someone that could understand that i did want my 100 as well. in a nutshell i will not book with british airways again ba seems to be losing its ability to run an airline. i have had 4 flights canclled in the last 3 months 3 of them while i was at the gate. every flight which does operate is delayed. staff attitude is appallimg they just dont seem to care. i have no compensation. my step daughter was deinied boarding due to ba overbooking. ba then messed up her rebooked flight and then lost her luggage. no apology and no compensation. should their slogan be  not to fly not to serve previously a loyal ba customer i usually travel economy on shorthaul but i am 64 with long legs and am very uncomfortable unless i can get exit row. so on this flight i took advantage of a what i thought was a reasonably priced club world ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch. horrified to find on boarding that ba have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch  exactly the same as in economy. the presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. fortunately this was a short flight but even so i was extremely uncomfortable. cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly ba dont care. i sometimes go to cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. the meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as late breakfast and no wine was served. it is clear that ba are putting profit over customer service and i am amazed that anyone travels club europe. later in the year i was due to travel to south america via madrid in business class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline. in future i will avoid ba shorthaul wherever possible. ba shorthaul business class is now nothing more than a con. the seat is the same size as in economy barely 29 inch seat pitch so no extra legroom for the extra money being paid. the middle seat is blocked but they then go and stick a table in it making it not only hard to get in and out of the window seat but also no thought to emergency evacuation situations as it is alomst impossible to collapse the seat down  it took 3 fas when i asked them and almost 10 minutes. why does ba put these awful tables in nobody uses them and when i complained to ba i was told dont sit in a window seat  what sort of customer relations is that. never again ba business class shorthaul for me i have flown many years with them including holding a ff gold card for 3 years and numerous silver cards. as i said at the beginning  nothing more than a con. what has happened to ba in recent years it has been a long time since i ventured onto their long haul flights and after this trip i will steer very clear again and stay with cathay pacific and japan airlines. airport service in narita is always good  because it is not ba providing the service. but for the rest of the trip simply awful. the seats that were introduced back in the era of the only ba boss to improve things are cramped claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight. because of the seat design there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the good airlines now offer in business class. the cabin staff were frankly laughable sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive japanese fa. british airways is trading off a very distant reputation and it seems that most british customers select them simply because they are british  anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that ba is now well down the quality list and it is about time skytrax downgraded them to 3star airline maximum  they do not meet 4star. ba markets itself as this slick british style when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline  many uk companies and uk departments stipulate ba as a no 1 choice and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. if youre proud to be british i would recommend you give ba a wakeup call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards. as a closing point i recently travelled china southern airlines on my outbound sector to guangzhou and they are streets ahead of ba in almost every element excepting some language skills. after 7 flight changes we took off to lhr which i was pleased about given that so many of the shuttles our friends have tried to travel on have previously just been cancelled. the aircraft from lhr had seen better days and i did wonder if we were in pe given other airlines we had travelled with. i would say categorically that it was not worth the extra hike. just book economy with extra leg room. given we used bas partner airline aa which was awful and given the chap next to me had his family flight to canada cancelled by ba and had to go a day early via ny i would never book with ba. staff on board were excellent. considering bas fares were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our british son in law. plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. we flew premium economy seats are bigger and have leg room but theyre not comfortable for some reason. flight crew was fine and professional. inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. cabin and seats were clean and neat. inflight kit consisted of socks ear plugs mask pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  they offer pillows and blankets. but although the seats are wider they werent easy to get in and out of and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. the meals were fine though served on a tiny tray loaded with food the meal was pretty good. not a lot of choices to london beef or pasta from london back to la it was beef or fish. it was hot and there was a lot of food a salad small  cheese and  crackers. roll butter and dessert but im not sure id say it was what bas advertisement claims. it didnt feel it was a premium meal. they also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. the entire plane was dark. the second meal was a breakfast but not especially appealing. on the return to la it was a very odd casserole rather dry and bland. the flight was smooth and arrived on time coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from germany. they lost one of our suitcases enroute we arrived on thursday afternoon the bag was delivered late friday night to our hotel no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. not even an email or text we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight friday we werent notified by ba until saturday afternoon. we ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts underwear and shorts to get by. if wed known they had found the bag we wouldnt have spent the money. poor communication on their part. not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. i guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all. i doubt wed fly ba again sadly id hoped for something special. we flew business class to vienna on the 28715 terminal 3 is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this. there was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. the outward journey was okay flight attendant was pleasant. i think the meal choices could be improved  these tickets are not cheap. however the return flight 31715 which was in economy  also not cheap was not good at all. the attitude of the staff was really below par. the food choice was an iced bun and a chickenbacon bun. seeing the choice i asked for the vegetarian optioncouscous with a few slices of pepper  all of which were tasteless.  when asked would i like a drink i replied  bloody mary. i should have known better as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through produced the drink without any ws. i asked if i could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink  turning the tomato juice a dark brown. ba need to remember we as the customers pay their wages. the staff were great food was pretty good their seating policy is a sham. for that reason id never fly with ba again. i have issues with arthritis and they changed my aisle seat to a window seat at the last moment and i had to endure no room to move for most of our flight from london to sydney. short trip to vienna in ba economy class from terminal 3. new a320 cabin on the flight out  looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. other than the cheap highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. staff service minimal  they served breakfast and collected the leftovers basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight  not even an additional beverage service. im sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. return a couple of days later older aircraft but clean. same indifferent service similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. this wasnt a cheap ticket over 200gbp  i know ba are competing with low cost airlines in europe but when are they going to realise they arent a low cost airline a bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how i felt leaving those flights. ba sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd. british airways business class product has not really changed over the last 15 years and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards and entertainment. what once made ba a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. unfortunately they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. on this particular flight the cabin was half full but the crew rushed the service to an extent i have never seen before the predinner drinks were served and less than 5 minutes later i was served the first course. i did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and i was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. ten minutes later the trays were taken away and the lights dimmed. we did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours and no water or juice were ever served. unfortunately ba has the only nonstop flight between cape town and london but next time i will fly emirates via dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip. had a very unpleasant experience with ba this time. they changed our family seats without warning. first time flying with two babies booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband. both babies are lap seat. two days before the flight i called the ba service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. on the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart. for 12 hours flight our family seats are arranged far apart. after more than 40 minutes standing at the counter waiting for the coordination we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane. no food for my 2 year old. if we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane what do ba expect baby can eat no help from staff with any service. when babies are crying and very restless  we didnt get any help from ba staff. when i flew with other airlines flight attendant brought small toys to help distract and entertain baby. ba forgot to unload out stroller when we landed. if brirish airways honestly thinks they are a premium quality airline they need a look at people like myself who have had one after another bad experiences  arrogance trading on past glories old cabins high prices the list goes on. i booked a flight to florence through ba website received a british airways eticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that i was flying with vueling. never heard of them. to cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. at the gate when we finally got there one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left italy yet. we informed the ground staff. they did not day a thing. after half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived how long we couldnt be told and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. i headed straight back the the terminal and sought a british airways rep to try and get an answer firstly because that is who i booked my ticket through and secondly as vueling have no representation at the airport. i was told it had nothing to do with british airways and they couldnt help. i explained the situation again and asked to speak to a supervisor. i was denied that right. i by chance saw a customer service representative walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him. he looked at me as if i had 2 heads and in the end walked away after calling me an arle. 100 true in the middle of gatwick north terminal. my wife and 6 week old child were themselves waiting at florence 4 hours for me. we were told vueling were going to try and get us out the following day. but no guarantees. i booked another flight with british airways to get to my family and british airways have offered nothing not even an apology. vueling will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedures. british airways should be ashamed of what they have become.  british airways charged me 100.00 for a too large carry on leaving my destination even though i used the same carry on traveling to my destination without charge and have never been charged for this carry on  it fit into the carry on size check in front of his eyes but he continued to tell me that it was too big and i needed to be charged. i had to call and email multiple times to get this investigated and which point they told me that day your carry on was too large and you needed to pay the fine no refund. will never fly with this company again. from the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a 24 hour flight i am thoroughly disappointed with british airways. my husband and i travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from london to sydney together. i phoned british airways 3 days before my flight from london to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. i was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. however if i wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. i was not giving this moneygrabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so i refused this option. my husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. when online check in opened my husband and i were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. phoning the call centre resulted in being told the checkin staff could assist. arriving at heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. the staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. the only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the singaporesydney leg. this woman did not even work for british airways but was the most helpful. not one british airways staff member apologised for this. the cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in economy. a request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight i was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane. i will only be flying with emirates or singapore airlines in the future who know how to look after their passengers. i am a silver card holder work in aviation and fly around 34 times a week. up to 2 months ago i was loyal to ba as it is an english airline with english values but this loyalty was unfounded. my main issue now with ba is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. on frequent trips to dubai with ba on a 30 year old 747400 it seems that ba has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. the seats were old and falling apart not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. the arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. the inflight entertainment was shambolic the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. on short haul flights in business lhrmun the upgraded cabin is a bit of a con. the seats are lightweight. uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without ac on. my worst experience was trying to fly back to munich from london. it was an old a320. as we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. on landing they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. this i feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100  passengers off as the last flight to london departed. we then had to stand around for 2 hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. i would not recommend ba at present even the new a380 i flew on to la had so many faults and badly thought through. i will miss the easy access of terminal 5 and lounges that i earned through loyalty as many other customers do. however the age quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care has lost me as a customer.  the outgoing flight was fine the return flight was cancelled due to an issue with the plane. i understand this happen as i am a seasoned traveller however what happened next was unacceptable and what you would expect from a low class airline. we were handed tickets for an american airlines flight from a different ohare terminal and told you have to go now. the terminal was in chaos and travelling from the international terminal to terminal three took one hour. getting boarding passes and going again through security was another hour or so but the flight was delayed and left two hours late. flight was very mediocre and not what i had paid for with ba. we arrived in london and guess what  no bags even though we spent more than 5 hours in chicago airport and were assured our bags were on the flight. that was sunday now it is tuesday no on has contacted us and no updates. the seat that i had booked 24 hours in advance a window seat had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin i complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full. once onboard i discoverd that the interior was worn and the seats very uncomfortable. the inflight entertainment or the vod video on demand system apeared to be vhs and was broken for my seat one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minutes. the screen was very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the inflight entertainment was more tiring than not watching it. the food was average but seemed to match the aircraft as it was dull and tasteless. as this was an overnight flight i expected to be able to get somewhat more than a 30 min nap which was interupted any sleep was not possible due to the fact that there was 5 infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least 3 were shrieking at any given time. the boeing 777 should not be still used on long haul flights as it does not live up to the standards of bas airbus a380s or boeing 747 flights. i had an excellent flight out on ba and an amazing stay in washington d.c but the flight back put a dent in the enjoyment of the holiday. very poor flight. broken seats toilet stuck together with tape and everything rattled around like an old car. the inflight entertainment was terrible screen tiny and very poor quality. staff pretended to be interested and made glib promises about refund and upgrades for the way home which turned out to be a pack of lies. i guess it was get them off the plane and i will not see them again. my various email to ba were met with a standard letter and an offer of a 50 pound refund. an insult considering the thousands paid for the air fare.  this is a very mediocre business class product and definitely not up to the standards of other airlines. the seats are tight with no storage space for even a bottle of water and the configuration is poor. i had 16k as i was told it is the best seat in the cabin  back corner rear facing but very private. forget any meal choice  being at the back means you get what you are given. wines were ok but the food was ordinary. the crew were probably the best part of the whole experience  but they are nowhere near the standard set by qantas crew. you can do far better with qantas emirates or cathay  forget travelling with ba as its just not worth it. i was booked in first class as a paying passenger on this airline but went to check in and was told they had oversold the flight. i was bumped onto a qantas flight leaving half an hour later via dubai which may have been a blessing in disguise as qantas was outstanding  see my seperate review. i chose the flight with ba via singapore for timing reasons for sleep  and for the use of the first class arrivals lounge at heathrow as i had a flight onto berlin several hours later. by going via dubai it threw my sleep out and no arrivals lounge to use. i had to change terminals and beg my way into a standard ba lounge  which was no mean feat. what really annoyed me about this was bas attitude to the whole thing. firstly i am of the opinion that no plane should be oversold least of all first class. i was after some compensation for the inconvenience they caused  and eventually they offered me a 200 voucher after weeks of back and forth emails. i had a business class return ticket to sydney and was after an upgrade as compensation  not unreasonable otherwise i wouldnt have asked for it. the whole experience of dealing with ba in regard to this was awful. for a fare paying first class passenger to be bumped off a flight and be treated so disrespectfully after the event is a poor reflection on their level of professionalism. i will not be travelling with this airline again. the staff were friendly and food was good selection of films was more than satisfactory. however due to a power failure at heathrow our luggage did not make it on our flight. i was appalled to see that there was no back up at all in the first place but then we were told our baggage would be with us within two days by one of british airways staff. it is now nearly our fourth day on holiday and we still have not got our bags. i understand that this happens and sometimes is inevitable but i am most dissatisfied by the information british airways are able to provide us about our bags. all we know is that they have left heathrow we dont know which airport they were flown to if they arrived where they are or when we can expect them. they have no details of any individual bags and i think this is disgusting service. the staff have been unhelpful and unwilling to aid us in finding our luggage which has spoiled our holiday completely and left us in a dofficult situation with 4 children under 12. i selected british airways on this trip ahead of air china who ive used a few times from beijing. what a mistake because despite some of the problems with chinese airlines they offer a far superior service to british airways. the cabin seats etc were dirty and claustrophobic on this british airways flight and i bitterly regret my patriotism in selected them for this trip. food is basically on a par with many asian airlines economy class standards and you need to be very cautious about believing any of the marketing rubbish that british airways provide in different areas. this is not a premium experience and was a true waste of money. staff were on another planet as far as service was concerned  abrupt unsmiling and intent on getting service over as quickly as possible before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley. using the call button was a waste of time midflight i guess they were all resting by then. i know that on air china the wine may be served rather warm a cold beer is hard to get and staff language skills are limited to standard phrases but their staff are cheerful enthusiastic to serve customers  and their business seats a lot more comfortable. the british airways motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation. luckily my company doesnt restrict me on airline choice and this will be my last trip on british airways who i first flew in the 1960s when they were a truly great boac.  our return flight from barbados to england was delayed by 25 hours. the experience at the airport was dreadful  initially told that we would be updated every 15 minutes that was the only update stuck airside with no food all food outlets and shops shut a free for all when some bottles of water arrived. inability of ba ground staff to communicate with immigration a walk of about 6 feet or a phone call chaos when trying to give immigration cards back to hot tired thirsty and hungry passengers. the positive in all this was being put up in a hotel. again  lack of communication. i was never contacted directly  people in the group were updated by ba on twitter. great if you have internettwitter.  despite putting in a claim from ba for flight delay i have not yet had a response from a human being. not sure re star ratings  this site does not appear to let me put a zero star rating. flight was picked because it got us from riyadh saudi arabia to newcastle uk in a reasonable amount of time. what ba failed to inform anyone was that despite advertising the flight from ruh to lhr as landing at 5.25am bst at lhr is that planes cannot land at lhr before 6am. so once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the newcastle flight. we made it and got to newcastle only to find that our two suitcases were there but my golf bag which i had paid for did not make that flight. it did make the next flight to newcastle but i had already had to set off to make an appointment some 170 miles from newcastle. it took 3 days for my golf bag to arrive at where i was staying. not one word of apology from ba. the seats on the flights were ok service of crew satisfactory the headsets didnt work from ruh to lhr and i tried three sets. best part was the hot bacon sandwich between lhr and ncl. i have been a long time supporter of ba but they have successfully managed to degrade the economy product to such an appalling level that i suspect that us based carriers now offer a better product. from ridiculously expensive fees to book seats in advance to childsized low quality meals on board to planes on our route that only offer the dense 333 configuration and new policies limiting the amount of avios you can earn with economy tickets i have had enough. my partner and i left both the transatlantic flight to lhr from phl as well as the lhr to txl flight absolutely starving. a very sad state of affairs for ba. what on earth has happened to british airways inflight meals on our way out to rome we were told that the plane had to be changed so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it i thought well ok maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes so no hot meals available. however on our return not only did we have an hour delay still not sure why that happened we were traveling with a 1 year old baby so it was quite stressful just waiting around but on our flight our meal was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce they said chicken was in it but i didnt have any in mine. that was it no hot drink either the drinks trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling. im not a fussy person but i thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot i didnt have time to eat anything at the airport and arrived home at midnight i was starving. travelled on august 8th when there was a power outage at london heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. the way ba handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. i called several times and had to go to the airport twice. there was much confusion with the ba people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. no follow up though i was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with ba again. where shall i start 4 hours delay or the days without my luggage i came to nassau for my wedding me my wife and our 3 best friends. we arrived to nassau on tuesday with 4 hours delay but the most annoying part just begun. our wedding was on friday me and my wife were without luggage until thursday due to hell knows what was going on in ba my best mate didnt receive his luggage for a week and on my wedding he was best man so i had to give him cloths to wear. we had to change the organized wedding date to another 3 days later. he received his luggage on a last day of his staying in nassau. from the first day arrival ba was contacting us and saying same thing the luggage is coming next day and that was for me 3 days my friend 1 week. when i received my bag they lost my key that i gave in airport in nassau to ba person i signed the contract that i agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. they lost my key and i had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. the plane was old but pretty well maintained. me and my wife slept half flight but when we woke up the cabin crew told us that we cant have warm food anymore  we had 3 hours to fly and  we were hungry. ba you almost ruined my wedding you ruined all my friends staying he received his bag on a last day vacation. all ba flight to nassau that week were all delayed from 2 to 6 hours. never ever again. the staff were not friendly or even helpful. a pregnant lady beside me asked for help with her carry on and the rude answer was if you cant carry it dont bring it on board. my husband asked for an extra pillow and he was told  only one pillow per passenger. the lady beside my daughter was not given food and when she asked for it the flight attendant answered in a loud voice i did ask you which did not happen. dont fly this airline unless you have no other choice. the staff were not friendly or even helpful. a pregnant lady beside me asked for help with her carry on and the answer was if you cant carry it dont bring it on board. my husband asked for an extra pillow and he was told only one pillow per passenger. the lady beside my daughter was not given food and when she asked for it the flight attendant answered in a loud voice i did ask you which did not happen. so dont fly this airline unless you have no other choice. i wish i could comment on the service on the aircraft but with a 27 hour delay i am unable to and can only comment on the ground service after being informed the aircraft was delayed because of a technical fault. it is not the technical fault i am worried about but the way the problem was handled by bas ground staff at johannesburgs or tambo airport. the cabin crew had arrived at 18.00hrs and boarded the plane which was due to depart at 19.20hrs to london. at 18.20hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. the chaos then started. people close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights which were fully booked. after about 40 minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where ba staff would be there to assist. got to arrivals nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. a series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. nobody was directing passengers at each stage. passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said south african airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. the line slinked back into the arrivals area. only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. chaotic scenes. no line for families or premium passengers. in the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. no clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. all airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled  it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. in this case there was nobody in charge nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. a true shambles. passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave scheduled to leave 27 hrs after original departure or what the real problem was rumours only. flying club and having a ba gold card with gold list status meant nothing. pretty poor experience flying with ba. staff were not enthusiastic about taking care of passengers food portions were insufficient online check in was a problem. ba was able to process my payment for upgrading seats but once they took my money the website stopped working and no longer let me select seats or checkin. ba is more expensive than virgin atlantic and delivers worse service. virgin allows passengers to pick their seats on booking ba charges passengers for that option. ive booked 60 tickets on transatlantic flights over the past 5 years  ba virgin delta and by far the best experience was virgindelta. i wont be booking ba  not very good value for money customer service at its worst rude and impatient staff at the baggage drop and only one person to help at the check in machines. usually i would recommend flying british airways but after todays appaling service i will think twice. this was my first flight on a british airways aircraft with the new slimmer seats and i was quite appalled by the seat pitch space between rows. the seat back in front of me i was seated in 14c was so close to my face that i could not hold up a magazine to read. i had to try to twist sideways in my seat and hold the magazine in the aisle. i passed on the light breakfast that was served because it just seemed like too much trouble to try and eat from a plastic box that would have been almost pressed against my chest. the cabin crew on my flight was very pleasant and professional and the aircraft interior was immaculate but in the future ill avoid british airways within europe. the singleaisle aircraft of air france which i fly regularly are far more comfortable. they sold me tickets without any luggage allowance. i paid 100 to add 3 bags using their online system. when i took the return flight they charged me again. but this time double. so a reasonable 200 pound flight ended up costing me 600. ill never fly with them again. theyre more expensive than everyone else and theyve totally changed their luggage terms. what a complete rip off. not impressed. the cabin crew lacked energy and enthusiasm. poor service. there was also rubbish left in the pocket of the seat in front of me when i boarded the plane. there were food crumbs on the table when i unclipped it and the magazines looked well used. i expected more from british airways. i wont be flying with them again. we flew with british airways to st lucia on flight number ba2159 on 28715 and returned on flight number ba2158 on 982015. the journey to st lucia was pleasant enough as we were upgraded from economy to premium economy due to spare seats. unfortunately however the upgrade meant that my husband and i no longer had seats together as i has with the seats id prebooked and as this was our honeymoon this was quite important for us. the journey home however was extremely disappointing. on finding our seats we discovered that the plane had not been cleaned since the previous journey. there were empty sweet wrappers in the pocket and crumbs all over the seat and on the floor. we were not offered a new pillow and blanket and instead were left the ones used by previous customers. in my case blanket scrunched up on floor with pillow on top. in comparison with other long haul flights we have travelled on with virgin and emirates british airways seemed to provide much less space and poorer facilities. needless to say the flight was an uncomfortable one for many reasons. on future holidays we will be returning to other flight operators. the sad decline of our national flag carrier seems to be continuing unabated. i fly the lhrphxlhr route on a monthly basis and although ive spoken to colleagues about changing carrier as ba offers the only direct route into phoenix i have stuck with them. but where to begin the 747400s used are ageing shabby and tired if they were your old horse theyd have been taken to the knackers yard years ago. throughout the aircraft the seating is uncomfortable space cramped and onboard facilities lacking and limited. the avod in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity the screens are smaller than most of us have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch. when the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom. catering is just awful in the economy cabins and only marginally better in business although i see the airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade. one word of caution here  if you are upgraded your meal stays behind despite you paying for it. all in all ba is slipping against the competition and delays are common place as to be expected lhr lounges are in need of a complete makeover and its a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who seem happy in their work. ive one more ba flight to go and then its adieu from me but then given how they so sparingly issue tier points now its not like im going to miss them. did this same trip last summer with delays etc but thought we had just been unlucky but history repeated itself. all legs were delayed. technical issues or weather were blamed. ba do not seem to have much in the way of contingency plans and particularly where terminal 5 at heathrow is concerned it takes very little weather to throw the whole place into confusion. at all points information was lacking or contradictory. i cannot decide if they lie or are so inept that they do not communicate with each other. eg our internal flight home was showing as being subject to big delays for hours online. when we arrived at the gate the delay was announced as a sudden crew issue. a new thing this year seemed to be to bring out the captain to speak to passengers  maybe we were supposed to be charmed. this happened both at heathrow and boston. on the long haul flights the seats were tiny  the internal ones were better which seems strange on both long haul legs of the journey the entertainment system did not work and the food was lamentable and definitely worse than a few years ago. the cabin crew were nice but thats about it. absolutely disappointing experience. flight was delayed by more than 2 hours but ground staff were unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport options even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport options available. reason was claimed to be weather but both aberdeen and london experienced good weather with no other flights being delayed in both locations. concocted reason to fool passengers. would not recommend this airline previous two flights have been delayed for at least an hour each. not sure who invented these seats but they are awful. difficult to get in and out if you are inside. has not flown british airways for a number of years but they have not improved in this time food still very mediocre and service the same. you even had to pay in advance to select a seat which we did. however when we checked in we were told sorry crew using the seats you paid for still waiting for my refund. inflight entertainment is rubbish  movies well past their sell by date. back to emirates for us. slight delay. games advertised on website not able to access in economy. tv not working for 1st hour then when it did couldnt hear it though the provided headphones so had to choose film with subtitles. although staff doing their jobs the 3 near us seemed to have an attitude a man behind asked for a cup of tea and the flight assistant muttered under his breath. my partially sighted mother asked politely for milk with her tea and the flight assistant made her feel stupid by shoving it in her face and sarcastically saying there it is. i realise she didnt know my mother was partially sighted but maybe she should be aware that you cant always see peoples disabilities. i had no problem with our outbound flight to denver from heathrow except the headphones the staff on that plane were all very pleasant i will think twice before booking ba again. a slight delay in boarding ba 816  scheduled departure 1255 resulted in priority boarding being suspended for general boarding. hardly had the wheels left the ground before the person in row 1f i was seated in 2f reclined his seat back as far as it would go. when one of the cabin crew walked past seat belt sign still on i asked if this was allowed. to my astonishment i was told that yes it was. it was my understanding that the seat back must be in the upright position while the seatbelt sign is on during climb. flew from gatwick on 090815 to genoa to join a cruise. whilst the aircraft was clean everything else seems to be very old and fit for purpose for a display at a museum. at the back only one toilet was working. seats very cramped and not comfortable. it was an 8am flight to my horror only a small cold croissant with a bit of none descriptive cheese in the middle was served with a hot drink. bearing in mind the flight price on skyscanner for could have cost over gbp500 pounds. in the good old days british airways flights from manchester to heathrow lasting about an hour served hot breakfast. it appears british airways does not want to maintain its quality image and i am really disappointed on this flight. i can confirm what has been reported earlier about british airways long haul flights. our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. the tv screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an ikea couch from the 1970s. the usual food choice of pasta or chicken was reduced to chicken only. on top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part  only available in the uk. disaster at the checkin counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation  british airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist we had to find a room for 4 two small kids on our own at almost midnight. this was definitely the last flight with british airways. thoroughly disappointed with this supposed legacy airline. having been delayed for an hour on my british airways connecting flight to lhr and stuck overnight at a heathrow hotel i was looking forward to getting going on the morning flight. reality check. this aircraft is old and decrepit and was built in the 80s it should have been retired long ago. a quick google search shows that this aircraft makes up the majority of bas longhaul fleet. the seats are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you. i am 5ft 8 and weigh 70kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me. everything is old and looks it too. even the staff. the seats are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath. in fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature tropicana bottle i had put the seat pocket. even the safety animation video looks like it was made as a school it project by 11 year olds. staff are cold and unfriendly it would seem that their contracts forbid smiling of any kind. the inflight entertainment screens are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixels it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed. they are running on brand image only and even then theres only fumes left in tank. do not fly ba at least until they seriously upgrade their fleet.  my wife and i flew from toronto to london return using ba business class in july of this year. this was part of a trip of a lifetime we had planned to the uk. we have never flown business class so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. i am not sure if it was worth it at all toronto to london was an overnight flight london to toronto an afternoon flight.  ease of booking online was very good customer service on phone was poor obviously outsourced so a language barrier. check in at toronto was average nothing above check in at any other counter. lounge at toronto very good great food drinks service facilities. aircraft cabin with average state of wear seats  center rear facing seats. comfortable but lacking any type of space the lie flat bed was good cabin crew were on auto pilot  not rude but certainly not great  food was average. the return trip heathrow terminal 5 to toronto was not really any better. the business class lounge at heathrow was not good. lousy food looks very worn very busy travelers sleeping across multiple seats bathrooms were average .i would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. the distance from the main concourse after security to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate especially if it is in the b or c sections is a great distance and involves a train ride same seat on the return trip so again average. food service etc all average. overall we were not impressed with british airways business and would not use them again consider air canada or another airline. i flew air transat club class 2 month prior to the uk and i enjoyed it a lot more and a hell of a lot cheaper british airways did not impress i didnt really know what to expect from this flight it had been a couple of years since my last ba flight gatwick to nice in that case we were on our way to lyon airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed london. upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. with little information given as to why. when we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation a bit like every man for himself. what amused me was that the captain came on over the pa and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. the captain kept us informed as best he could the cabin crew showed no effort at all. they showed no will to actually be there they didnt check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39°c outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. once we took off the service seemed rushed i wasnt able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back no so much a pitiful ham and cheese bun thing and a drink. there was no personal touch to it. as we were approaching heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley we were in the back row was the two crew complaining about their hours. im flying with ba citiflyer to dublin in september if the service hasnt improved ill think twice if i really need to travel ba again. london to miami return. flew out with 5 children one was an infant turning 2 during holiday. had necessary booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me bookings were linked and there would be no issue. upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented dont even touch that its hassle just refer her to ticketing where i spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. my flight closed and took off without me  despite me constantly stressing that i had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. long story short i was dumped on next flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children no explanation of what was going on  people being served all around me by person who was supposed to be dealing with me no child meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. resulted in me being stranded at heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. however this wasnt all  check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. i had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. this was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos. had a further 3 hour wait at the other end as all medical assistance booked had not been transferred as requested. would never fly british airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at miami. i have been flying with british airways on the lhrgva route for a while now and the original excellent service has been declining. i am an executive club silver member and due to changes to the executive club i am now earning a lot less avios and tier points than i used to. also the slimmer seats on the aircraft in this case a rather old a319 are much less comfortable and roomy. i find it quite tight and i am not especially tall at 6ft. the cabin crew were not particularly attentive but friendly. they barely bothered with the passengers onboard even though the flight was nearly empty. overall it is disappointing that our flag carrier is becoming more like ryanair with every enhancment they make. i have recently tried swiss on this route and they were cheaper and provided a superior service. my return british airways flight from dubai to lhr started badly with the worst lounge experience i have ever visited. a shared lounge for club and first class  in either class it is terrible. tatty and years past a refurbishment. given that ba has flown this route for decades one does wonder what they are playing at. i could only enviously look at a pristine emirates lounge across the departure hall. my wife tried the breakfast  a dried up sausage and disgusting scrambled eggs. she declared she would not give it to our dog charlie a cocker spaniel. the boarding gate was miles away and ba shipped us over to gate in a golf buggy. it took ages apparently they are installing a first lounge later this year the same story i heard at lax last year. the flight left on time. fas were terrific and it seems ba rely on crew to make or break every flight nowadays. the seat was much better than outbound on a boeing 747. food okay  starter of dried asian duck was fantastic. soup very good. grilled salmon okay  a bit dry. wines very good and chilled properly which is often not the case. only four passengers in first  including my wife and i. it wasnt too bad  but there is no wow factor. shame.  british airways flight was delayed due to a fuelling problem with the aircraft despite it having been sitting on the ground for 9 hours between flights. the lounges are full of dirty plates and glasses on every table and the food is insufficient for the volume of passengers. antiquated entertainment system kept coming up with please wait several times during the flight whilst the cabin crew gave apology announcements and kept trying to reset it. british airways club world meals are full of packets and wrappers which doesnt exactly reflect a premium product. the cabin looks old and tired. the amenity kit is cheap and useless. i paid to reserve a particular seat and it was changed due to unexplained operational reasons. terminal 5 which is british airways  home had a complete baggage system breakdown causing queues and chaos so my luggage arrived 3 days after i did. what is there to like about ba absolutely disgusted delayed by 45 min with no reasons on a quiet night with one other international flight. baby seat too small no infant meal available after confirmation at checkin. entertainment system stuck on a loop and not working. dirt between seats that is disgusting. old seats and flight. flying in 2015 this must be a 20 year old flight not comfortable. however good leg room. london to new york jfk is the most profitable route for british airways. my ticket cost nearly 5000 return. i fly fortnightly between london and new york jfk. the aircraft are tired food is poor even the new gourmet business class food. british airways management should try the breakfast porridge with salt and blueberries what about the afternoon tea sandwiches yuk. toilets often out of service and on my last 6 flights at least 1 of the toilets has been out of service. the last flight ba117 on wednesday 2 september 2015 the power failed meaning all the seats in my section of business class had to be manually positioned. the inflight entertainment system stopped. the staff were great but frankly all the company is doing is putting staff in a difficult position. in 2015 my company will have spent 120k on travel to and from london and new york. too much money for such a mediocre service aircraft that are many years beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction. what a fall from grace. in august i flew singapore airlines london to melbourne. what a difference in aircraft quality customer service experience and value for money. please british airways sort yourselves out. letters to keith williams or willie walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff. lots of promises and little or no action. my most recent cabin was held together by pipe insulator. the last one the same and horrible condensation issue with the air con resulting in a soaked blanket at take off. compared to the likes of eva air or qatar airways british airways club world is by far the poor relation. flew from glasgow to new york via lhr the seats have zero storage apart from the small drawer at floor level. it is astonishing that for the money they charge you have to step over the legs of the person on your outside especially if you accidentally trip and land on top of them. food was satisfactory although a small bacon roll for breakfast was again a poor show. avod was also satisfactory. apart from the flat bed this just really doesnt have a premium feel about it. on our recent trip on both legs the crew were excellent but the product from our national flag carrier simply is not worth the premium prices they charge. london heathrow to dubai in british airways first class. the trip got off to a good start with the concorde lounge at terminal 5. very comfortable and private however showing signs of wear and tear. needs a bit of a refurb. boarding was announced and we promptly left however only just made it to the gate. very odd but i am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for boarding. the plane was a very old refurbished boeing 747400. quite why ba hangs on to these gas guzzlers is a mystery. i estimate the plane over its life so far has done about 90 million miles enough to get to the moon. much criticism has been said about cramming so many first suites into the nose of the plane and i can say that is fully justified. it was a day flight so not worried about sleeping but if it were a night flight as a tall but not overweight man i would struggle to get comfortable. its like a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. a cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer boeing 747400s for another 510 years. if so this is truly unbelievable. given the emirates competition on this route their fantastic suites and they always serve caviar one does wonder if the sales and marketing people at british airways have a clue how to entice customers to the overall experience. there is so much criticism of british airways on this site one wonders why they dont listen. it can only be perceived as arrogance. food was fine. very nice mezza nice soup and spicy middle eastern style chicken not bad at all. champagne very basic and krug has long vanished from british airways routes. cabin crew were terrific – faultless. travelling a boeing 777 on the way back. hopefully a better seat. on the upper deck on ba 282 aug 31st although the equipment is relatively new once you are in those hideous seats you wouldnt be aware of what aircraft you are on. squeezing as many ying yang seats onto an aircraft does not constitute a premium cabin experience. british airways missed a great opportunity to enhance their club world product but while other carriers improved their cabins ba seem content in leading the race to the bottom. the crew on this flight looked as though they did mot wish to be on duty and one in particular was really obnoxious to a child. the childs parents were certainly mare tolerant than i would have been. crew turned a blind eye to two passengers who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead lockers while the aircraft was still climbing and the seat belt signs were still illuminated. once the food was served crew were nowhere to be seen until breakfast was served. due to the awful food served on this route on a previous trip i ate before boarding so cannot comment what the offerings were on this sector. the club kitchen is a complete waste of time. i did attempt to have a snack from the club kitchen during the overnight flight after negotiating the outstretched legs of a sleeping passenger but the unlabeled sandwiches were chilled out of their existence and were inedible. british airways really need to up their game in respect of offering a premium cabin service. the concorde lounge is a long way in the terminal and after queuing placed on the bus to the aircraft along with all the other passengers  and wait standing in the crushed bus on the tarmac for 20 minutes. once onboard i asked for a vodka martini not too difficult surely. after a 20 minute wait the steward informed me he was sorry for the delay but he had no martini glasses. okay this was british airways first class but not such a huge deal he offered it to me in a wine glass instead not a big problem.  20 minutes later he returned and said he couldnt serve me a vodla martini as there was no martini on the plane.  then came the dine as you please meal option. i asked for my dinner to be served 2 hours into the flight i was asked my choice and chose the steak  to be told there was no steak left.  it was suggested i try the fish i do not like fish so i was left with vegetarian option. the dinner arrived half an hour later not the two hours later as i requested.  i would never choose to fly british airways first class again. my british airways return trip from milan to vancouver via back wasnt too bad but the seats were really unconfortable and there wasnt enough leg room. furthermore the flights took off late so i ended up having little time to take the connections. there is definitely space for improvement at british airways. i have flown regularly with british airways between the uk and other european countries where economy class seats are leather and reasonable onboard service. based on previous experience i decided to make an intercontinental flight between the uk and rio de janeiro brazil believing that i would find at least the same comfort offered on european routes by british airways. it was not. instead of decent seat conditions expected for a 11 hours duration flight i found seats that barely accommodate a normal person not so tall not overweight and completely unable to have a decent meal during the flight. the economy class of british airways can be defined as simply terrible. do not waste your money by paying a bit more believing you will find comfort in an intercontinental flight flying economy class with british airways. just buy the cheapest promotional airline ticket that you find on market youll be served the same way and will save some money. we were delayed going out from heathrow to bangkok but were notified by british airways before our journey to the airport. the seats were reasonably tight but being economy i expected that the plane was freezing both there and back every one was given a blanket so wrap up warm. the film choice wasnt good and dont book seats next to the toilets seat row numbers in the 20s you will always get served last and they do run out. las vegas to london heathrow with british airways. what we were expecting and what we got are two separate things.  we boarded the aircraft on time and were greeted at the doorway but once inside the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting  no help anywhere we settled into our seats which were narrow and very cramped and the heat in the cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. the service commenced once the flight was underway and free drinks were offered and if you fancied a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. the meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given  or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. this was changed when it was brought to the attention the of the crew and looking back i think she would have been better with the wrong choice that was given and suffered the consequences as it looked unappetising bland and who knows what it was. no vegetables no meat. the rest of the meals were served or should i say thrown at us offering pasta or chicken. the attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. for the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. one  of the screens in the seatback wasnt working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin crew being told  why arent these things checked prior to boarding the space you get in economy is abysmal the person in front of me put his seat back and was nearly lying on me the leg room is shocking and the seats uncomfortable. my son couldnt eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up as he couldnt see it. the cabin crew should make an announcement when meals are served for passengers to upright the seats out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when theyre serving meals  no they dont as it would be too much of an effort for them. the only good thing about the flight was arriving early so we could get off it. would we fly british airways again  on this experience no you would have more room in a tin of sardines british airways need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service to everybody on the flight  not just the passengers in the posh seats and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course. ghastly describes the british airways experience in a single word. the new club europe seats are not fit for purpose at all when it comes to a 4 hour flight. its impossible to stretch out because there is no space and i am only 6 foot tall. its impossible to work because there is insufficient space and its impossible to relax but the new seats barely recline. this is by no stretch of the imagination a quality airline product. for anyone prepared to pay a premium do yourself a favour and give your money to another airline. i used british airways to hong kong in 2012 and remember vowing to never use them again. however as i needed to get to new york and back quickly i had to use british airways and i thought they may have bucked up their ideas. the flight to nyc was on a boeing 747 which really did need an uplift the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. the entertainment system was terrible and limited. on the return flight i was on a boeing 777 and although slightly more modern the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didnt work. the staff were better than the previous flight. however british airways did manage to mislay my baggage between nyc and manchester and i received it 24hours later battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside. ive decided that whenever i fly eastw ill continue using emirates or singapore airlines both of a far higher quality than british airways and to the usa maybe virgin have to be better than ba surely. ill never use ba again. i am so upset with british airways that i will avoid them in the future. if for any reason you have to reschedule your trip their fees are beyond anything ive ever experienced. i booked a flight from istanbul to denver in business class and unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control had to cancel. the flight one way was 2900 which is a lot of money. their restocking fee was 25 in order for me to receive a credit of 75 of the original fare. in addition there was a 525 penalty fee so the total penalty was 1250 so now i have a credit for one year with british airways and i will have to deal with them again.  what a rip off. whilst i dont expect too much from economy i have to say i was very disappointed with british airways from gatwick to mauritius. i chose this airline as i expected the planes to be in good condition and the room slightly better for someone of my height. instead the seat was so worn out i could feel the frame underneath and the legroom appalling. the staff were very polite and attentive but the food left a lot to be desired.  though even they have been trying to improve their service and image recently. the days of british airways as a classic british airline with good service and professionalism went with the sale of it to other nations. it is not what it appears. we also noted that cabin staff in economy could barely cope with a full cabin. instead of a trolley starting at either end there was only one with two staff. for the widest short range jet of 25 rows 6 across this was not enough. costs have been cut clearly staff are demoralised and customer service has gone out of the window. obviously not the window at row 25. 30th wedding anniversary ruined due to british airways not loading baggage onto flight  not just ours but the whole flight baggage handling belts broken so baggage all piled up in departure lounge. baggage tracking website does not work so thats a waste of time call centre in london diverts to call centre in india so you cant understand a thing being said and vice versa. pilot and staff must have known there was no baggage in hold and yet the flight was still allowed to leave. italian contact number for british airways lost luggage was unobtainable and given out regardless of that fact. would not recommend british airways to my worst enemy. worst experience ive ever had in an airport poor organisation with bad customer service from british airways staff who didnt care that i would have a 5 hour delay due to been told i would need to cancel and rebook my conecting internal flight. as my flight was delayed between jfk and heathrow. i was appalled to see how badly immigration was dealt with and how little effort british airways put into organising its customers. some people where told to go to a service desk and cancel and rebook flights while others got put in a fast track immigration queue. no staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and i were experiencing after a 7 hour flight. i would never recommend british airways to anyone. they only care about premium paying passengers and the service they claim to offer has been left behind by other providers. absolute garbage british airways economy on a boeing 777 london to bangkok. the seat was terrible had the ife release knob wedged in my leg for 12 hours and a food tray that could not open so unable to eat. stewardess asked if i would like to put food tray on my lap. the seat was not fit for purpose.  lhrphx 16 sept. last few times ive flown british airways id been forced to consider ba as a discount airline that doesnt deserve its 4 star rating and i was not looking forward to this flight. we had awful seats at the back of a very full plane so asked at bag drop about upgrades. paid 230 each to go up to wtp a bargain when added to the price we paid for our seats in coach and it was worth it does anyone know why we check in online or go to a selfserve kiost but still have to go to bag drop to pretty much go through the check in process again boarding went as usual smiley welcome aboard and to our seats. this aircraft had wtp immediately behind first. good leg room comfortable seat small cabin of its own. a small amenity pack is provided although most of the stuff in it is inferior and hardly worth having. only one fa worked our cabin but he was friendly and efficient and the lack of more staff was not noticable. drinks trolley and lunch menus then food served. lunch with 2 options china plates real cutlery napkins etc.  food was very good even though only one option left by time we were served. had beef which was tasty and tender and well presented. a snack box was passed out a few hours later and dinner served 2 hours before landing. interestingly dinner was from economy. foil dish plastic cutlery paper napkins. given the price of wtp ticket would have expected better then that.  only one juicewater round but fas were in the galley and happy to get whatever you wanted until we drank tham out of bubbles. being an older plane the ife was ancient with a very small screen that had grid lines showing and a barely adequate movie selection. noise cancelling headset was not the best and hurt my ears. ife was only a minor irritation as flight was scheduled 10 hours 45 and i was more interested in comfort which wtp provided. only real gripe is the tray table. it folds out of the seat arm as a drinks tray then unfolds to a full tray. problem is drinks slide off when in small mode and you have to brace the full tray on your knees to stop your dinner sliding off. british airways is relying on its past reputation rather than providing a good product these days and i avoid them if i can because of that. i didnt think i would be saying this but i enjoyed this flight and it was probably the best ba flight ive had. a shame then that i will still avoid british airways if i can. i have not got as far as even flying with british airways this time around and the customer service are a nightmare. sent an email with flight confirmation and agreed time to us yet a later email tells us different time. they say we need to take it up with vueling their sister company  call vueling and are told it is a british airways issue. none of them will take responsibility for changing our flight times without asking. its now too late to get an alternative flight at a reasonable price so have to return at a stupid time in the morning which has ruined our anniversary weekend break. no compensation or anything. horrible greedy company who thankfully are in decline. pay a bit more and fly with genuine 4 or 5 star airlines. about 3 levels below cathay pacific and the rest around that price bracket. british airways introduced its new club europe business class which is basically economy class minus the middle seat. leg room is same as in economy. when i asked flight crew whats new about it she indicated with her hands that the seats were more cramped now. it is a shame that british airways has fallen prey to greed and instead of upgrading its business product it has introduced a very poor product on club europe. food was poor and so was the inflight service. if the person in front reclines it is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it. i will never fly british airways club europe again. british airways from heathrow to vancouver outbound torontoheathrow inbound both on rather ancient boeing 747400. both flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule and the fare was competitive. checkin and bag delivery was fine at all 3 airports. the aircraft interiors were shabby at best seats uncomfortable ife hopeless food awful. cabin crew were mixed one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duties in a perfunctory way. one male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly. from the good days of quality service in the 1980s british airways have gradually deteriorated into a thirdclass carrier and can never hope to compete on customer service with the airlines from the middle and far east. what a shame. glasgow to cape town via heathrow with british airways and the short flight from glasgow to heathrow was fine exit row seats with plenty of room although the catering was a bit bizarre a drink and a packet of crisps. the flight to cape town was however a different story. the boeing 747400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. the economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move and im only 510 tall. the seat back entertainment screens must be first generation tiny screen with a grid of lines on it ive seen smart phones with bigger screens the crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and i quote her guests and who made the flight a bit more bearable. the food on offer was standard economy class fare it filled a gap just. the flight time for ba0059 is 11.5 hours so british airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room and better catering for economy class passengers who do make up the majority of people on board not the premium passengers. the old british airways corporate slogan the worlds favourite airline are long gone. for our next flight to south africa or elsewhere i think it will be back to klm for us. i have flown business class long haul on emirates qatar airways air france klm american singapore thai airways cathay pacific and most recently british airways for work within the last 24 months. i fly long haul 810 times a year so i would consider myself to be a moderate user of the service and know what i should expect for the money. i will never fly british airways again if i can avoid it. i arrived on time and it felt like a safe journey but everything from check in to the seat configuration and comfort and cleanliness the food and the entertainment system were so far away from the competition. the cabin crew were snooty on the a380 out of lhr  in this example i was a silent observer to several unacceptable customer service responses. the only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the staff at the washington dulles lounge the rest of ba could learn a lot in there. very disappointing ba its a shame your product quality is so below par. im proud to be british but not when it comes to our national carrier what a shame. london heathrow to copenhagen with british airways and i was surprised by the service. customer service was poor particularly on my outward trip. some of the cabin crew seemed disinterested and did not even greet you as you came onboard  they continued to talk amongst themselves and ignore customers. the seats were uncomfortable and the little lunch they provided was atrocious.  i used british airways club europe from lgw to naples. basically the flight is the same as long haul economy except no entertainment and the middle seat is left empty as far as i can tell there is no difference in legroom and seats are identical to economy. im not sure how british airways can pass this off as business class.  my advice if booking a business class flight in europe look at competitors otherwise book economy and save the money. only really good thing about flight was an amazing cabin staff that looked after us really well. london heathrow to kos return. outbound the galleries south lounge looking shabby. onboard cramped seats 2df disinterested cabin crew and appalling breakfast. return there no lounge at kos airport slow busing to plane attentive crew and good lunch. both flights on schedule and baggage return reasonably quick. a case of two halves but the new british airways club europe is poor value. i fly about 12 times a month 90 of the time with british airways. im not sure what is going on with british airways but their service is just getting worse and worse. you can see the individuals are trying but it seems the business just doesnt want them to be able to deliver that world class first service they owned for all those years. i can only assume its about cost cutting as their planes are so dated and falling to bits now. especially when you compare it other airlines like cathay or american airlines. in all honesty if you can fly an alternate airline youll probably get a better first class cabin and cheaper  id recommend it. also how does this airline not have wifi on their long haul yet once a pioneer of the air world. british airways is now a half dead dinosaur with no real sense of direction. london city to granada. ive flown with ba a lot over the years most recently in business and first and have until recently always had a favourable opinion of them. i recently used avios to take a short break to granada with my brother. my normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because i dont believe the extra cost whether this be actual money or avios justifies the perceived benefits. regrettably no economy reward seats were available so i opted for club europe. the only real benefit on this particular route was the increased baggage allowance although this was of no real use for a 3 to 4 day trip so what did we get for our business flights no lounge at city airport no fast track at city airport a holding pen prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding. seats in club europe are identical to those in economy. the breakfast going out was terrible burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant. the lunch if you can call it that coming back was also terrible  a cold salad dish with dried out rolls accompanied by vinegary wine. no lounge at granada no fast track at granada coupled with a single checkin desk most of the time and long queues i complained to ba about this  the initial response was that club europe left the middle seat free to allow more room. whoever responded obviously didnt even think to check the aircraft as there is no middle seat on the embraer  its a 2x2 configuration for the whole aircraft. after some considerable persistence on my part a partial refund of 5000 avios each was provided by british airways. i recently had the choice of flying club world to hawaii ba to lax and then aa to hnl but given the fact that british airways club world can be quite claustrophobic ultimately decided to try out qatar airways new business class to thailand via doha  by all accounts their business class is comparable to british airways first class. i shall review this some time next year we arrived in paris with british airways at 13.00. it is now 00.47 and our baggage has yet to appear we were told it was on the next plane due in around 15.00 and would arrive at the hotel by this evening. special weekend ruined. cannot get anyone from ba on the phone. what has happened to british airways  tokyo haneda to heathrow in club world with british airways.  my trip was on an old boeing 777 and apart from the old product i could not believe the dirt and wear in this cabin. crumbs and mess around the bottom and edges of the seat grubby marks that i presume even the japanese cleaners could not remove. the toilet i used remained dirty throughout the flight. the meal service has been much debated and is served rather pushed at you on a cheap economy style format and quality is on a par with jal economy class i used in august. im british and like to support ba but the honest fact is that ba have slipped right down against from the competition. my journey out was from frankfurt on lufthansa an airline i probably wouldnt have used a few years ago but their business class standards are so much higher. ba cabin staff should go to lufthansa for some training and maybe they could lose some of their arrogant approach.  a 3 hour delay but notified by text earlier in the day so no waiting around. the problem is that british airways business class club world product and service is so old and tired that it is just very poor value and quality. the inflight entertainment is constantly faulty and breaking  they had to keep resetting it this has happened on the last two ba club flights i have been on the seats are tired it was not very clean  the lockers by the windows on the upper deck were dirty and falling apart. the food was quite good except the dessert was awful  they always seem to serve the same lemon dessert on this leg. the crew were pleasant but the planes are too old and tired now to make this an attractive option. i look to avoid british airways when i can for business class. my son and his fiance travelled to st kitts to get married. they spent ten days on their weddingmoon. when it was time to return they were unable to check in online. the website offered a phone number to call and there was no answer. they tried for three hours. they finally called me in the uk and i called british airways. i was told that because i did not buy the tickets with my credit card they couldnt help me. i was given another number to call. the second person i spoke to managed to resolve the problem that was preventing online check in which meant that it was then possible. however so much time had passed sorting this mess out that by the time we got into the system most of the seats were allocated and my son and his new bride could not sit next to one another for this long haul flight. when they tried to upgrade they were told it would be 1000us each. british airways could not care less. having previously flown with british airways a few years ago i was quite disappointed. the legroom was as expected and i had no complaints about that but the food was awful and the service was terrible. we were sat next to a group of drunken passengers who were loud and were continued to be served drinks throughout. i am sure this didnt make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised  running out of drinks etc. as we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choices by the time we were offered food  the crew were not really interested. when asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to us and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused. the food was poor quality dry hard chicken with very little flavour. breakfast was an egg mayonnaise roll and again there was no alternative. i paid extra to fly with british airways but found the service and food lacking  really would not recommend flying long haul with them if you can help it. you can see they have made cuts to the budget london heathrow to bologna return in british airways club europe. very disappointing. the seats are basically the same as economy seats they just dont sit someone in the middle seat so no meaningful increase in legroom or width. food was very average on the way out salad with very dry prawns pretty tasteless but nice on the way back tagliatelle. staff were on the whole were good but given the seats i wouldnt recommend spending the extra money for club europe. the british airways seats were extremely small uncomfortable and did not operate properly. in order to recline the seat or return it to the upright position you had to do it manually. the bathrooms throughout the plane were dirty and smelly from the minute we boarded. the meals british airways served were abysmal. on the way home from london to the u.s. passengers had the choice of a chicken curry dish with saffron rice or the vegetarian option. the smell of curry makes me nauseated so i opted for the vegetarian dish. i was served greasy overly seasoned pasta soaked in oil and covered with a soggy bread crumb topping. it was inedible. my partner received the chicken curry dish which was small fatty pieces of chicken overly seasoned and soaked oil. the dishes served are poorly chosen for the general population of people who fly british airways. the food should be clean fresh food not covered in grease and oil and not overly seasoned. the portions are too small and the dessert items chosen are also odd and not appealing to people. it appears british airways will serve just about anything so they can keep the food prices down and the profits up. checked in online for our british airways flight from larnaca to heathrow. and discovered my wife and i were seated 4 rows apart. no seats together were available in the seating chart under manage my booking. is the ba software so poor that it cant keep 2 seats together when booked at the same time the answer must be yes. the checkin person said they would try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate but as usual when you present at the bagdrop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay. in this case needless to say our separate seating remained separate. i wouldnt take the trouble to record this here except that i have felt irritated for the last few flights ive done with british airways with poor food inflight entertainment screens that work intermittently faulty headphones or being seated so that the only screen available is the other side of the business class dividing curtain which was drawn half way through the film. ive preferred british airways on the basis that some of the budget operators charge you the same by the time you add their various extra charges. im now coming to the conclusion that if they charge the same i might as well fly with them and then i wont have to wait an extra 5 mins to get off the plane while the business class punters get off first. denver to london with british airways. we were allocated rubbish seats near the toilets. the seats would recline but would creep forward during the night which bent the jack in my headphones.  lately weve found the aircraft are tired and in much need of an update. poor quality screens  very small seats. not much bigger than a short haul flight. find the air hostess  stewards are often quite bored and provide a no thrills service. theres not much wrong with them per se but a smile would go a long way. we now specifically look for other airlines to fly with as weve had enough of british airways for long haul flights. heathrow to munich return with british airways. i have never published a negative review of anything ever before i work in the service industry and have several friends who are cabin crew. i am not a demanding passenger i rarely request anything unless invited to do so and i rarely request anything other than water. however my first experience of british airways business class was let down by crew serving me. the female cabin attendant on my return flight could not have been nicer but the male attendant on my flight out was noticeably dismissive of me as a female passenger. to the men sitting near me he was chatty and offering them extra drinks etc. i was made to feel like a huge inconvenience. such a shame and it has made me reconsider whether the extra cost is worthwhile. have flown previously in british airways business class. flew in world traveler economy class on this trip with adult children on their first flight to england. loading was chaotic. seated middle four seat section row 49. no air conditioning in cabin. several of us complained about heat and lack of air flow. did not get answer from stewardess until an hour into the flight. took 3 hours before air conditioning kicked in. no room under the seat to store handbag. seats appear to be smaller. when person in row in front of me reclined i had minimal room to move or to access my purse. little attention from cabin attendants. told them i was getting dizzy from lack of cool air and they allowed me to move to seat in galley where air was cooler from business class seats. food served was terrible. no advance menu to choose from. no individual lighting or air. i thought it was my worst experience until immigration 2.5 hour wait in line to clear immigration  customs. our prepaid taxi waited 90 minutes and then left. horrible experience. the return flight was worse. delayed 1.5 hours on the ground due to no air conditioning in coach seating again though first and business had it. they brought us water in the last 30 minutes. will never fly british airways again. london to seattle with british airways and i was very disappointed when dinner was being served and to my surprise they did not have my vegetarian meal onboard  but somehow they gave to others although i requested my special meal when i booked my flight return at least 5 months earlier as well as checking in online. in the end i sat while everyone else ate around me this was a long flight couldnt sleep and remained hungry so i didnt enjoy the experience. british airways from heathrow to manchester  ok its only a 35 min flight but about a one hour delay with no explanation before take off and no apology from the flight deck. i booked a seat near the front and was moved to the very back row because of a change of aircraft. there i could hear every word of conversation from the young cabin crew in the galley. and not all things the passengers should be hearing. torn uniform on female attendant brusque drinks service from male steward who gave the impression that the job is a bit beneath him. waiting ages for the plane to empty so i could get off. crew not helping anyone and no eye contact for the dismal goodbye on getting off. first and last time travelling with british airways. the flight outw was reasonable although they are sadly lacking in comparison to other airlines. my first question is does anybody from british airways actually read these comments if they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad we arrived in toronto on 9th september to be told our luggage had been left at heathrow along with 80 other bags. they were well prepared at toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem  after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. british airways should investiage the company they use in toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered even hanging up on the hotel manager who tried to help us. only after my husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the friday to be delivered. the final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4  not a problem normally. but it had cost 90.00 extra to book these seats and not one of the staff was interested just a take or leave it attitude.  london heathrow to san francisco with british airways and unimpressed. checked in online but had a bag to drop i was issued with a fresh boarding pass at the airport and was there plenty early enough. everything seemed normal until i reached the gate for boarding  the scanner at the final checkpoint reported not checked in. after a 5 minute or so wait i was allowed to board but moved to a different seat i was told this was the final one but not given any explanation as to why. once on the plane i was asked to move to what turned out to be my original seat. i filled in bas feedback form about this and asked what was going on but they were apparently receiving a high volume of complaints and never responded. in the circumstances i think ill stick with more reliable airlines from now on. the flight itself was delayed by a 12 hour while they waited for more passengers. the flight itself was uneventful and the meals and service okay for economy. having said that the boeing 747 is horribly outdated and the ife system repeatedly failed and had to be rebooted. nairobi to london with british airways. the service was good except that they gave given up on collecting jackets. seat is getting tired  bits coming off. disgraceful level of cleanliness  between the seat and the side of the cabin was a very old accumulation of fluff mouldy peanuts crumbs an old sandwich wrapper and a mini mars bar very old. felt sick. given this was highlighted in the press recently  it must be that british airways really does not care. i recently travelled british airways from phoenix to london heathrow. this is my 3rd time i have flown this route onboard one of the boeing 747400 and i must say british airways have got to either fully upgrade their b747 fleet or retire the aircraft. the seats are far too cramped and not comfortable the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several times as they stopped working or didnt work at all the heat in the cabin was unbearable at times and very uncomfortable. the only plus points were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasnt too bad. i am aware that around 18 boeing 747s are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the b747 on the phoenix route is not and for me as the route i travel causes me concern and has me wondering if i will travel with ba again.  not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesnt mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move seats that dont feel like they are going to cripple you have an entertainment system that works and has a better selection of moviestv showsmusic. other airlines such as emirates have a fabulous system even in economy so why cant british airways use the same type of technology. if ba want to compete please do something about it.  these british airways flights were undoubtedly the worst weve ever had to south africa in ten years of travelling there. the seats were narrow lumpy and incredibly uncomfortable especially for a long haul journey. i thought initially that we were unlucky and got broken or faulty seats on our outward journey but they were just as bad on the return journey. to add insult to injury wed selected and paid for seats of our preference but when we got to the airport for our return journey we were told the seats were gone and simply told we would have to apply for a refund. the worst aspect of the flight however was the heat. the aircraft was oppressively hot and stuffy for hours on the way from johannesburg to london. many passengers complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning system appeared too old to regulate the temperature. also the entertainment system had to be switched off and rebooted several times because many passengers consoles were not working. there were passengers who had to do without entertainment for the entire 10 hour flight. these aircraft are not fit for flying and should have been retired a decade ago. pity the poor crew who have to work on these clappedout aircraft every day. weve been travelling to south africa several times a year for the past decade and this was our first time travelling with british airways. clearly it will also be our last. avoid british airways or their boeing 747400s at all costs. im starting to go with british airways less and less. i must warn you about bas picky prices which jump suddenly with no explainable reason. for example an lax flight i was looking at went from 200 per person per way to 450 per person per way in just one day my last trip with them jersey to miami wasnt very good. service at jersey airport and london gatwick airport was great but the plane wasnt so good. the seats are quite uncomfortable food is a bit disgusting inflight entertainment is absolute rubbish and the in are just outdated and need replacingrefurbishing. the worst part was as miami where the express bag drop only lane turned out to be slower than the check in and bag drop lane and even that was slow. worse the staff were rude and honestly couldnt care less. sad as this airline is meant to represent britain in a way. flew british airways from toronto to rome via london and have no complaint with our flights or crew which were excellent. but when we arrived in rome my opinion of british airways was formed. none of the passenger baggage arrived in rome and we were all left in the dark. when no baggage came down we all got into the baggage handler lineup avia and wasted time filling out a form. we were given a phone number for british airways but it was out of service. calls to avia went unanswered. we finally went outto the airport 2 days later and found our baggage in an unsecured location. we werd never informed by british airways if and when we would receive our baggage. we did receive compensation for the clothing and toiletries we had to buy but not fod the expense of getting out to the airport. this has soured our opinion of british airways. we paid for world traveller plus premium economy for our british airways flight to london. aircraft was a boeing 777 excellent plane. cabin crew very efficient and friendly. seats and legroom very good. what i find lacking to make world traveller plus worth the money is no priority checkin or security no priority boarding for wtp passengers. in fact wtp passengers were the very last to board even united delta and american offer priority checkin and boarding. i contacted british airways to inquire why and the reply was the usual corporate speak were very sorry you were disappointed blahblahblah. okay british airways you could care less. my issue is the very poor british airways customer relations service you receive once there is an issue it is only then you see what ba really is. following a dreadful experience trying to sort out a weekend in paris i decided to complain to british airways customer relations that was the start of a nightmare and frustrating experience. ba customer service is like the fawlty towers of customer services i have tried many times ringing longest on hold before i hung up was 2hrs  fastest through 45 mins. they only want to get you off the phone as quick as they can and keep apologising that they are so busy i have emailed them and had 5 generic emails back no resolution worst is they are from 5 different people who clearly have not read the notes from previous emails i have had two phone calls following tweets  all they tried to do was sell me something and had no idea that i was trying to complain. they said they would get customer services to call me but guess what no call british airways is an airline with a very mixed quality. i am flying it very often and i think that quality is decreasing over the last few months.  whereas lounges are great and the staff is almost nice the flight attendants sometimes are unfriendly. on this flight one flight attendant hit me twice with his cabin trolley and did not even excuse himself. the aircraft and the seats in premium economy are quite good including food and drinks.  but the worst with ba is customer support and help with problems. on my outbound flight from phl to lhr i had a problem with reserving a seat. although it was shown as free in the map no bassinet i was not able to select it. first time calling the customer support i was told this is a technical error. second time the lady told me that this is not bookable as this is next to a bassinet. then one day later is was reserved. i called again and they told me that i was too late. any hint on my two other calls was answered with thats your problem. you have a seat what is the problem. i mean at least she is right but the attitude is extremely bad and maybe there is a reason why i want to have this seat. my email with a complaint on this wasnt answered till today excet for the automated we will answer asap. if british airways continue with that customer service i might change shortly. dont fly with british airways unless you dont have baggage or dont care about it. we took a connection flight via london lhr to san diego and all our baggage and of many other passengers in this flight was delayed for two days. other flyers told us this problem is frequent with ba. when our baggage finally arrived one of the suitcases was damaged beyond repair. we filed a complaint but so far more than a month heard nothing from them albeit several calls. disgraceful attitude. as a final accord on the return flight we could not check online for some unclear reason while other passengers could. so my wife and i got separate middle seats. nice. british airways from london to bahrain and return. both flights on a very old boeing 777 apparently there are only a few of these left. advantage is that the seats are still 333 and not 343. both flights on time. outbound flight very full cabin crew worked hard but without much enthusiasm. meal was very poor the socalled dinner was chicken in a slimy gravy. there was no sign of either fresh fruit or vegetables. later a cardboard box was issued containing a chicken sandwich. return flight food was even worse but as departure was 1.30 am the initial effort called a snack was again in a cardboard box and contained nuts dry biscuits and a couple of minibars of chocolate. later in the flight breakfast was served. the choice was mixed grill with chicken or omelette. the mixed grill turned out to be an amorphous yellow masspresumably pretending to be egg with a round coin shaped structure which was socalled chicken and four potato discs. it was a disgrace and inedible. british airways has to do something about its catering it compares very poorly with other airlines. if the food is not worth eating then they should not serve it. our british airways flight from helsinki to london had issues with its brakes so the departure was delaytd. original departure time was at 17.15 there were next info at 18.30 19.00 19.30 and 20.45. the captain gave us an announcement of situation at the gate around at 19.00. meal vouchers were give at 20.00 for those who were still at the gate. then after 21.00 an announcement to get luggage and hotel vouchers from the arrival hall. next information will be given next morning at 09.00 which later was postponed until 14.30. requests of rebookings were refused as the flight were not cancelled. they just said come to the airport early enough. british airways failed to provide information about eu passangers rights as it had to be requested separately. lot of fellow passsengers were not aware of their rights. next afternoon local grond handling company only had regular number of checkin desks open even there were two flights chekingin at the same time. so only three desks open and they were not able to start checking us in but requesting us to step aside for the same day flight passengers. great as we had only been waiting around 22hrs for our flights. finally our flight got new departure time which was at 17.30 later to changed 18.00. at the gate departure time came and went and no announcement were made. departure time were postponed until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new delay. when requesting some futher information it was said its the same reason as yesterday but we had been given a written statement saying this aircraft had been fixed. at 18.30 still no announcement and passengers get anxious about mimimal information given by aviator. then 20 min later british airways cancels this flight. now rebookings promised by next morning or then have to contact british airways directly. another hotel night at the airport hotel and we already knew how the procedure goes. next day rebooked for finnair flight to london and arriving london 45 hrs late and reaching the final destination about 46hrs late. the only positive aspect was cockpit and cabin crew effort to provide some information at the gate area at the beginning of whole ordeal. british airways is clearly cost cutting now and i wonder whether they just want to sell off their shorthaul operation. the a319 to and from bologna had new seating which was one of the smallest and most uncomfortable seats i have experienced. the crew were ok but looked bored indifferent and just really could not be bothered with passengers. then came the complimentary food and drink which included half a cup of luke warm tea. hats off to british airways for pushing passengers towards low cost carriers. just arrived back in uk on british airways after a stay in las vegas. on outbound flight the chicken dinner ran out at the next row to me alternative was spinach pasta i declined. on return journey earlier today the breakfast consisting of bacon and  sausage ran out one row from us had to endure veggie option of hash brown tomato mushrooms. for some reason they serve from front and rear and by the time they meet around the low 40 rows you don`t get a choice surely in the days of computers checking everything they would know the ratio of meals that passengers are choosing. tv screens did not work for entire flight steward even advised london were resetting it remotely from ground trip got off to a disappointing start with the british airways lounge crammed to the rafters. we struggled to find a seat. breakfast choice was okay nothing exciting. the second lounge below floor has long been closed and shows no sign of reopening. classic ba thinking regular flyers wont notice  but we do the furniture seats etc are long overdue for replacement. all very tatty. the plane was quite new clean but had the old club europe seats which is neither here or there. we were in 1a and 1c and had decent leg room. took off 40 minutes late due to delays at pisa  and some runway modifications or so we were told. inflight service was strange food first then the drinks. the brunch was a nice salad and some fruit. the two crew members looked and sounded bored. one i dont think knew how to smile. then we got stacked over the mediterranean for twenty minutes due to runway modifications. we landed unusually from the east and i have to say it was a rather spectacular uturn landing which as an aviation enthusiast i rather enjoyed. we were parked on the tarmac like a ryanair flight. we used to have an airbridge when flying british airways  which justified in part the higher costs. now we dont  another obvious cost cutting exercise by the accountants at british airways hq. bags delivered within minutes which given we were one of 2 planes on the ground was to be expected.  i arrived at heathrow after travelling for over 20 hours flying from perth australia to london. i had booked my british airways flight online and as i had not been to heathrow before gave myself plenty of time to get through customs and from terminal 3 to terminal 5. total cost for return flights was 240.89aus 113.68 pounds. i had booked the 8.05pm heathrow flight to belfast city airport but had got through customer and to terminal 5 just after 5pm. i went the to ba information desk to see if i could get an earlier flight. i was told yes there was a flight leaving in about 30 minutes and if i paid for the change of outgoing flight it would not be a problem. i was told i would have to pay 110.00 pounds 232.99 aus so i could get the earlier flight. because i had been travelling for so long and just wanted to get to belfast i paid the money. a flight that would normally cost approximately 80 pounds one way cost me 157.00 pounds one way. i will never travel with british airways again and would never recommend them. a total rip off for just over a 1hour flight. never again with british airways. could not book seats arrived into rome connecting flight to be told there was no lounge facilities no advanced notice was not offered apology or use of other lounge or even a voucher. the flight and onboard service disappointing business class seats are the same as economy apart from a tray secured to the middle seat which made getting in and out near imposable. food laughable 3 finger sandwiches. no inflight entertainment. in sum i will never fly british airways again. this british airways trip was one of the worst experiences i have had. the business class seating was terrible requiring literally stepping over and sometimes on my fellow passengers. additionally i was facing backwards while flying. the service was poor food barely edible the lounge lacking in nearly every way from dirty tables torn furniture and lack of power outlets. i suggest doing everything you can to avoid this airline. their competitors exceed them. check in was prompt but the fight was delayed 2 hours due to unexpected windshield wiper replacements. british airways cabin crew was not the friendliest or most professional. i have never felt attendants to be so indifferent and self absorbed. i was never asked what i wanted to order. i was simply brought what they chose. i asked for sparkling water and was informed they had run out. i asked for more bread and was informed they has run out. dessert was down to one selection. in all the service was lacking at best. the food was mediocre and the selection was subpar. the seats were comfortable and the pod seating was quite good. flight entertainment is reminiscant of american airlines from the 1990s very very disappointing. the most disturbing was the three seatbelt checks all while my belt was visibly around the sleeping blanket. the ammenity kits are of economy class standard on most other airlines. lavs were not kept clean. i can honestly say i will never fly british airways again. this was a waste of a 5000.00. there are so many poor reviews here for british airways and i am just about to add another one. the return trip started in the shared lounge at pisa. its comfortable enough  but forget it if you are hungry. there is no food to snack on  just a few bags of crisps nuts and sealed croissants. booze choice is okay. quite why in italy of all places a platter of mixed meats cheeses and typical antipasti cannot be provided  probably costing about 50 a day is a mystery. british airways dont care. no airbridge so a trudge to the plane. it was an ex bmi a319 and given they ceased trading three years ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show british airways branding and not bmi very strange. old ba club europe. tired seats. fas were fine. food mediocre. funny thing was the cabin smelt of a rather tasty meaty sort of meal. as we took off i was starving and full of optimism. all we got was a miserable afternoon tea dried sandwiches scones and jam. i compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonics. i asked myself is this worth it  the extra for the product. what you get i suppose is a toilet for 1214 passengers compared with two toilets between 120 or so.  wider seats no extra legroom.  a meal over economy but not by much  glasses to drink from rather than plastic beakers and a faster exit from the plane  a few extra avios points  thats it basically not a lot. anyway we left 10 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. nice smooth flight but i could have had that on ryanair. british airways really dont care as the many reviews on here clearly show. london to sydney via singapore in business class. i am english born and have always had an affinity with british airways. i had not flown with them for a while and booked business class seats for my wife and i and have to say how underwhelmed we were with the whole experience and will not be trying them again. they are so far behind other airlines  you expect in business class to feel just a bit special but as reviewed earlier you do not get any special service. a lousy check in herded along with the rest on boarding a lousy inflight toiletry bag. as for the food just awful on both legs to sydney. the crew on the london to singapore were unengaging at least the 2nd leg crew were better. the bad news is that i still have the return leg to lhr with them. british airways from antigua to gatwick. a shabby aircraft my seat was broken it would recline without command the head rest was broken and the seat covers were very worn. the inflight entertainment had to be re set as it wasnt working and when it did work my screen did not display the safety briefing images would freeze in effect i did not receive the briefing. the cabin staff refused to dispose of my wifes drink because it was not finished i had to request another hostess to take it. the food was poor quality in general too looked like a kids meals pasta with cheese. check in was good queues were long but the staff were very helpful and the flight left on time. british airways is not in the league of other long haul carriers like emirates a lot of work to be done to refresh its image. london heathrow to singapore and the business class of british airways is below the standard set by its competitors. at heathrow terminal 5 there is no special check in counter for business class passenger. after performing the self check in we have to join a common queue to drop our checkin bag. i spent 30 mins in the queue. the business class seat is narrower than other airlines. there is also a lack of storage space for small items such as glasses. it is relatively comfortable to sit and sleep on but business class travel is about a total experience and british airways has a lot of catching up to do. in the last couple of years british airways has been refurbishing aircrafts nad has minimized the leg space to ridiculous levels. this not only for economy but also in business class. it is unfair to ask a business class passenger to sit so uncomfortably when they pay double the price of economy. in addition they have this policy for 2 bags but one going under the seat in front of the passenger  this applies even to business class  we flew british airways world traveller plus premium economy on the flight from vancouver to london. the male steward responsible for our section of the aircraft was indifferent to passengers during the night section of the flight he spilt a drink over my wife made no attempt to clean up the resulting spill and when he returned to our area he casually commented did i spill something on you my wife replied yes you did and i hope it was water no he replied  it was juice and walked away. the inflight entertainment was limited and subject to repeatedly breaking down the food was indifferent and the snack we received before landing at heathrow consisted of a dry croissant no butter some jam and a half a cup of tea. i have not travelled with british airways for a number of years due to previous bad experiences where the passenger is made to feel like an inconvenience i hoped they would have learnt and improved this certainly was not the case on this flight. aircraft was fine and journey smooth. staff at airport helpful. the service however lacked shine expected from british airways whilst on board. staff showed little interest in passengers minimal soft drinks offered 2 on a 9 hour flight bit of turbulence so not hot drinks provided bring your own drinks. endured horrible british airways return flights from heathrow to cape town. the plane seems to be from the 1980s. somehow the seats are really narrow so that anyone with remotely broad shoulders spills over onto the seats next to them. i couldnt fit between a larger man one one side and a woman on the other and resorted to leaning forward for much of the flight. thankfully a child was on one side on the way back. there were a number of flyers on the plane who had clearly done the route before as many refused to sit togther forcing firsttime flyers on the route like me to be squashed between them. the seats were also incredibly uncomfortable. the moulding on the back was took narrow and dug into my bag. i only fell asleep through sheer exhaustion but woke up repeatedly with back pain from the seat. other passengers walked around the cabin throughout the flight while some resorted to sitting in the flight attendants seats. also the seats in front of the toilets dont fully recline. the tv controls are fixed into the arm rests which makes them uncomfortable to put your arm on and you inevitably press one of the buttons accidentally. the tvs themselves are about 30 years old small and poor quality. the selection of movies was not great. it was very hot onboard the plane and passengers repeatedly asked for the air conditioning to be turned up. the service was good on the way out but the return flight service was poor. the staff appeared disinterested. one flight attendant responded rudely to me when i asked if i could use the overhead locker above my seat that had her bag in it. another told the child next to me when he asked for sprite with his dinner they had run out. even though i saw a flight attendant drinking a can of sprite 30 minutes later. generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and stuffing their mouths than helping anyone. my call button was ignored twice. another passenger pressed theirs and the attendant simply came and turned it off then walked away. she said shed be back in a moment but didnt return. the food was generally ok. british airways still trade on the you are lucky to be flying with us mentality. 8am on a friday morning at the flagship terminal at home base and there are just 3 business class checkin desks open so queued for nearly 30 minutes just to drop a bag. south gallery lounge more like a refugee centre than a premier cabin lounge. people sleeping across sofas and chairs full to almost standingroom only but managed to perch on the arm of a sofa before giving it up as a waste of time. boarding very lowkey quick and easy. excellent crew and very surprised by the level and quality of catering and looked after well. its the hardware thats so far below par. business class seating is 8 across thats like a lot of economy cabins. a window seat felt very cramped and claustrophobic. the cabin wall curved inwards and the seat is directly underneath where the handluggage bins sit so its quite an exercise to extricate yourself. no wifi and although theres a video on demand system its the same fuzzyfocus bleachedcolour quality that i remember from when i first started flying with ba decades ago. london heathrow to amsterdam check in on line and bag drop quick and easy used galleries north lounge at t5. it was fairly busy but able to find a seat. boarding the full flight orderly and quick seat 2a. cabin crew fine a simple meal served on the 50 min flight. arrival more or less on time however the bags seemed to take forever  50 min. having used the same route 2 weeks previously in economy i must say for the difference in fare i feel british airways have really missed a trick seats are just the same the meal nothing special added to the change in the executive club avious accrual. i really think apart from the one business class ive already booked i wont bother in future with british airways club europe. instead ill look for the most convenient and cheapest ticket when flying in europe. dont ever fly with british airways we went cancun for our honeymoon and on the way there they seated my husband at the opposite end of the plane  only 48 hours of being married. when we arrived in cancun our bags didnt make it there so we had to wait 4 days for our bags and go out and buy some clothes. travelling back they lost them again so not only did they lose our bags once but twice and had to wait 4 days again for them. i advise anyone reading this to not waste your money. do not waste your money. quite simply british airways premium economy from london to bangkok return was pathetic. economy class food is served plastic not glass for drinks. the seats are marginally wider than economy class but i could not eat my food without lifting the plate from my tray to my mouth. i bought a bottle of scotch on return to heathrow and then transferred to manchester flight. the bottle was confiscated by security because it was not sealed by staff onboard. i called ba customer service who said it was my fault because i should have told the purser i was going on to manchester. staff were generally good but never again on british airways. booked a british airways trip from sydney to london via singapore through travel agent not knowing the business class seating plan big mistake on my part. seat plan is 242 . we were allocated seats 15e and 15f. the 2 middle seat in the block of 4 so was flying backwards. seats are too cramped compared to other airlines no storage space apart from a small draw to store a laptop. a plastic privacy screen is all that separated me from the person in the aisle seat and that had to be lowered and raised when cabin crew served meals and drinks. when the aisle seat was made into flat bed i had to climb over person to use bathroom etc. this could be a problem for less mobile passengers. you should not expect to have to do this with the cost of flying business class the cabin crew provided good service and food was okay. this is the first and last time i will be using british airways to fly business class unless they change the seating configuration for business class. checked in online prior to departure expecting to use a british airways online check in desk or fast bag drop on arrival at manchester airport. ba used to have a fast bag drop desk for customers who have checked in online. when i enquired as to where it was on arrival at manchester airport i was directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated we dont have one. you have to join the back of the queue. in that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online it serves no purpose whatsoever. the shuttle down to manchester was delayed by about an hour as was our onward flight from lhr to las. this flight was on one of their ancient b747400 aircraft which was 25 years old and it showed. the seats in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a 10.5 hour flight and there was no legroom. inflight entertainment options were poor. i have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight. the in flight catering was mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service. our return flight from las to lhr was delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from t5 at lhr i received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into t3 at lhr. as we were already delayed into lhr by the time we had crossed to t5 our connecting flight to manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of 26 hours by the time we got home. ba made sure our travel experience was as miserable and inconvenient as possible. i have decided after many issues of late with ba that i can no longer be bothered with the hassle. if the flights are not delayed then they usually manage to lose my luggage. i have finally had enough and will use other carriers whenever i can. san francisco to edinburgh via london with british airways. upon arrival at edinburgh airport we waited over an hour before we were informed only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made that our luggage was lost at heathrow  along with 500 other bags. things happen and can be forgiven its what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. we were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. we were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through scotland we gave them the address of the b&b where we would be the following night essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. we received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. they did not arrive. in the next seven days i spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in india who were absolutely no help at all. the customer service phone line at ba was not being answered and the supposed courier service phones lines 2 of them were gone out of service as well. i emailed both the courier service and ba customer service and did not receive a response from either one. still the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. on the evening of the fifth day it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line in india who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. the bags were continually listed as being out for delivery but they never showed up. we were never contacted and neither was the b&b where we had had them supposedly sent. on the morning of the sixth day on yet another call to india i stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that i was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. then in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there that they had never been out for delivery at all. we would be in tarbert on harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. seven days after our arrival in edinburgh. during the seven days we had to purchase clothes to wear. we missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with ba and the time spent shopping for clothes. when we made the return flight we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. finally a month later we have received a note of intended compensation from british airways  for the amount of the clothing only. not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldnt have needed to buy or to check through and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of british airways. thats completely on them and we should be reimbursed for the charges. one would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience but nothing was offered. my daughter was booked on a flight from antigua to st. kitts on september 5 2015. flight ba2157 the flight left nearly 10 minutes early stranding 30 passengers who had just managed to get through customs. i have no idea how a flight can leave early or how you can leave without 30 passengers. the attendant at the desk merely informed these passengers that the desk was closed and they should return tomorrow. it was 3.00 on a saturday afternoon. nothing was offered to help these passengers get to their final destination. after calling multiple times and sending various emails i was granted a refund. my full refund offer came with a 50 cancellation fee and a 40 service fee. i have yet to accept the offer. we never cancelled her flight nor received anything that looks like service. do not fly this airline. they are inept and have no idea what customer service is. there is no value for money when the flight departs early.  my wife and i recently flew to california outbound on a380 into lax returning to lhr from sfo on boeing 747400. both legs in wt premium economy. the boeing 747400 is very tired aircraft who ba seemingly are not investing in at all. the plastic surrounding the blind was coming away the footrest attached to the seat in front did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old tired and tatty. despite ba insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the a380 it felt far more cramped and much more like normal wt economy. not helped by the multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. the tv screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the a380. on the meal service they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as wt gets the business class entree but only as they had one left over. i feel if you pay for a service at nearasmakesnodifference twice the price of wt with the word premium in the title you should expect a premium product. ba do not offer free preseating unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full priority checkin priority boarding the pretakeoff drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. additionally despite ba boarding by seat row numbers this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board the wt cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage so it lucky that we travel very light as you can tell overall i feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. based upon our experience i would recommend the wt in the a380 but only when departing from the uk you can preorder your meal and they serve wine as a pretake off. in addition wt on the 380 is upstairs in a small cosy cabin light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. these may be small points on their own but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade. my wife and i who are 76 and 77 respectively arrived at terminal 5 in jan 2015 to travel to johannesburg.this was our first experience of the size of this terminal and assumed that this was where we were to eventualy board our flight. however after sitting around for many hours it occured to us that we had picked up any information regarding the flightso we went to the ba desk only to be informed that the flight had leftand that we had been waiting in the wrong part of terminal five and if we had been in the right area we would have heard them paging us. whilst i take full resposibilty not checking the flight boards properly i would like to complain about the way we were treated from that point on it was now 11 pm on a cold jan night my wife and i were escorted to the exit and left to find shelter for the night in an area that we were totally lost in until we returned for a different flight the next day. singapore to london with british airways in business class. very comfortable flat bed but i didnt like the layout at all. poor quality food and an indifferent cabin crew. they were just not interested and serving was a chore. i was hesitant to ask for anything. there are other business class flights out there i am a bronze member of the executive club. british airways executive club is actually worthless since it is almost impossible to use their avios. however one of the few benefits left is the option to choose your seat for free a week before the flight which i did. unfortunately i found out when i tried to check in that i had been moved from the good seats i have chosen to the worst business class seats on this flight. all my efforts to get those seats back were in vain. we flew the a380 for the first time. i still strongly prefer the 747 upper deck cabin. beside the hd screens nothing can beat the quality of the old 747. flew return with british airways from bkk on a 777200 in premium economy. dont bother paying extra to prebook the seats we paid 160 to reserve seats 12a12b outward journey and seats 12g12h return journey and never got what we paid for. on bringing the seat change to the attention of staff at bkk was told sorry system make a mistake. on a positive note the staff were working hard and water and juice was offered frequently on the day flight. the female staff on flight ba0010 looked as if the did not want to be there very abrupt and surly looking. on the other hand the male staff on this flight were very professional smiling and very attentive. british airways need to work a bit harder and update the grubby fleet on this route as the asian airlines offer a better product. blankets shabby in business  premier elite. the inflight films  ancient music very limited. come on ba wake up your losing customers and need to up your game. what was once a great airline is going downhill. i would never fly british airways on londonistanbullondon route again. business class seat is awful same as economy seat no space to work or even space for your legs no entertainment no tv. ba thinks they can get away with making so much profit and ripping you off. definitely going for turkish airline in the future. i am ba gold primarily due to the fact that i fly with qatar airways as part of oneworld. recent flight first class from dubai to seattle and return first class to lhr and business class club to abu dhabi. crew are great in first class on the leg to seattle. the product is tired the call centre is useless on hold for over 45 minutes messed up bookings  not good enough. crew on return over familar in first ground crew at heathrow looked bored. its the business class seat gets me this face to face at a stranger  who designed these i would never use it again this shutter up and down the snottiest crew i ever came across with a steward with an attitude problem. food shocking in club first was good. great wines. overall its tired hardware good crew except lhrauh on the 31st. i suggest willie walsh flies qatar airways  thats true business class and first class. newark to heathrow with british airways. very disappointed that i paid so much money for premium economy and yet so little extra above economy class. was in row 10 on both the outgoing and incoming night flights. seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy. i understand that because of the row both the table and screen were in the arm rests but by the time i had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests very hard on the elbows i felt very cramped. my immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. later i tried mine no one behind me and the same it would not recline. breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge  yuk. the british airways check in staff at newark are so surly and miserable. whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that i could not distinguish what she was saying. on my outgoing trip and arrival at usa customs queue i realised that i did not have the customs entry form. seems i should have been given one to complete by the ba checkin person. i had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. never saw them again. am definitely going back to virgin atlantic where premium economy seats are really roomy and comfortable and the staff friendly  even the ones at newark. philadelphia to athens via heathrow with british airways. the lack of service amazed me since i have flown both first and business on many airlines. the club world menu listed 2 starter items 3 main choices and 4 desserts. i chose the grilled halloumi and portobello mushroom starter. if it was grilled it must have been a long time before it was refrigerated. not too good. the fillet was like a piece of old shoe leather. i will admit that it might be difficult to come up with a medium rare steak but this was bad. i was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. i was never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask for some. i was not offered any after dinner drink. in short the service was rushed and more like a coach class. it appeared that the attendants were trying to get rid of us and get us to sleep rather than serve us. i was very disappointed and would avoid british airways business class. this was on the phl to heathrow segment on october 26. service on the second leg to athens was good. bengaluru to heathrow. my first long haul flight with british airways and i am not at all impressed. the service levels were disgusting. no ear plugs no eye shades even after requests.  drink service only a showpiece. asked for a virgin mary and was give iced tomato juice with lemon. when asked for other ingredients like worcestershire sauce tabasco salt and pepper i was told that this was the airline recipe. my request for some salt and pepper to spice my drink was refused saying that `we do not stock them in economy. when i requested for a talk with the head of staff on the aircraft he was sorry and said the airline was trying to cut corners and the crew pleas were falling on deaf years.  only vegetarian dinner option provided since they had apparently run out. no menus etc. ife selection with dated screens and headsets.  was a low cost carrier experience that takes a passenger from point a to point b without any feel good moments. london to kuala lumpur on british airways boeing 777. outbound in first return in club world business class. flights on time both ways. comfortable seatsbeds and very helpful and friendly staff. the quality of food and drink served particularly the food was very poor. i recommend flying any other airline than british airways. the fare looks reasonable until you get to where you have to buy your seat plus if you have to cancel your flight in my case a meeting was cancelled they wont issue a voucher or a refund. i cancelled my flight six weeks in advance and they refunded 140.95 of a 1003.95 ticket and they wont issue a voucher. i will never fly british airways they are so greedy. london gatwick to cancun and i was disappointed. british airways economy class is incredibly standard in comparison to singapore airlines or even virgin atlantic. entertainment was not particularly varied food was shocking plus the staff were abrupt and snappy. i do not fly often so sometimes i might ask questions that seem pretty obvious but i shouldnt be shamed for that. not flying with british airways again thats for sure. i was among the several hundred passengers whose british airways flight was canceled last night from dallas ft worth to london. no status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate once the decision was made. they were not updated. people were told to call 1800airways for help but were turned away by the phone system and as a result lost their places in line. one woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby she had to go back and wait in line. only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers and each passenger took over 2030 minutes to help on average. one couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. they were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. the couple will now miss half their cruise. no screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights like that couple or myself close to the front of the line. there were two other flights out to lhr that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour but due to the disorganization of the help i missed both even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. it did not help that the british airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line for no reason. i was still in time to make the last flight out at 1010pm but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. people were falling out of line because there was no area to rest or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. the customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. no attempt to take a number and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. the counter staff and how they were managed was completely inadequate. the way british airways handled this cancellation was atrocious things break including airplanes which is understood but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. i am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. i will now miss the first and arguably most anticipated part of my tour to india and my traveling companion coming from atlanta will be there alone which is not safe for a young single female. this airline has cost me time money and most importantly safety for myself and my friend. shameful service from british airways travelling from heathrow to delhi. a problem with seat i had booked and paid extra for ground staff said they had no authority  lots of phone calls nothing achieved suggested i spoke with crew understanding but pretty lack luster. a few crew members just rude. food bad service little better seems to be a problem with allowing passengers a basic such as water. british airways need to be shaken out of their tauper. most other airlines far superior. cabin very untidy washroom not kept supplied. sorry to say but nothing to commend here. i will try to avoid ba in the future. my mothers flight from london to moscow was cancelled. while understanding that these things happen and accepting this inconvenience it is the customer service of british airways that i found outrageous. first of all british airways would refuse to speak to me paying customer as they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase details  despite the fact that i had any proof they may need and all contact details in the ticket purchase data were mine. but fair enough there is more. they couldnt speak to my mother she doesnt speak english they dont speak russian and while i was trying to offer various options to customer service agents time passed. by the time several hours later i suggested their moscow office calls my mother to confirm her identity it was too late  moscow office was closed and all was offered is for my mother to call then next day. needless to say she had to travel next day and it was unacceptable option. so at no point my mother was offered anything required by regulations 2612004 articles 8 9 and 14  so ba appears to be in breach of those regulations. i bought a ticket for my mother with aeroflot instead for a flight at a similar time to that cancelled by ba and asked ba for refund. ba in turn and after my mother travelled to moscow demanded a letter of authority from her otherwise they would refuse to speak to me. they would not for example call my mother in moscow and simply ask her.  my mother sent me letter of authority which i forwarded to the ba. now they would speak to me and promised refund and compensation. this was on 30th september 2015. on 20th october 2015 20 days after  regulations state that refund must be made within seven days i chased this with ba. i was promised a refund and compensation again. as of today 6 november 2015 nothing was paid to me yet. customer service responds with generic messages themed we are sorry for the delay the refund will be with you soon. my requests are simply ignored. so while it might be a reasonably comfortable airline when everything works well i would encourage everyone to very seriously consider how you will be treated in an event of a delay or cancellation. in my experience the treatment was appalling. flight and crew great the problems came when we had to deal with the orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. total nightmare and they just did not care at all. our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. when arriving at orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. we noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. this turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff including airport manager while my baby screamed the place down hungry as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem. the staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby. even though these seats are reserved for people with babies due to the bassinet availability. eventually it was changed back after so much stress and hassle. on returning we complained and 3 times we got the answer yes it was our fault we are sorry but we cant give anything to say sorry for our behaviour. eventually after another complaint they agreed to 3000 avios and 25 voucher. i wont be flying with british airways again as they are so bad in customer relations and check in agents leave a lot to be desired. heathrow to las vegas with british airways and a farcical flight to be honest. 2 hours into a 10 hour flight running out of beer for those who drink is a joke. not having the choice of food by the time it comes to you on 4 occasions over the 2 flights is pathetic  i guess you need to really consider where you book your seats by asking where they start serving from. i thought air stewardesses were meant to at least crack a smile once and again and when asked reasonable questions that had to be asked due to the ridiculous shortages were meant to be as accommodating and friendly as possible hope i never have to fly with british airways again. smooth take off and landing. plane about 75  full mostly business people. the meal was past terrible. a horrible tiny dry bread bun with a the smallest piece of chicken ever and the most salty bacon i have ever tasted. the best part was the sticky bun that followed washed down with lemonade. no entertainment for this 1hr 45min flight. the toilets were barely passable had they been cleaned from the previous flight round trip london to luanda in british airways business class club world. its really below average. british airways seems stand still in the competition with other airlines. the seats are cramped. there are no storage for personal items. the seats and toilets were not adequately cleaned up after previous flight. the food and ife were average for business class. british airways should think about improving the cabin in general or otherwise they will continue to fall behind their competitors. even american airlines and iberia which practically owned by same company have improved a lot. the only positive thing was the fas in both legs were polite and courteous. they were relatively young so they still have motivation to do their jobs.  not impressed with british airways at all. we flew back from denver after visiting family. we flew out with lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the middlefar east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. our return lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at lufthansa. we were booked straight on to the ba flight back to london which left only an hour later. initially we were excited to fly with british airways as it wouldve been our first time flying with them and also they fly a b747400 from denver to europe. i am aware that the boeing 747400 isnt the newest aircraft however lufthansa had redone the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. with british airways the whole interior was very old and dirty the seats hadnt been changed and the tvs in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. the food was of a poor standard  chicken meal i had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. when asked what chicken dish it was she replied some sort of curry thing when it was actually chicken teryaki. the air hostess was rude the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good and cereal bar was rock hard. british airways were double the price of lufthansa when we initially booked however i would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. their boeing 747s are dated which is a massive shame. stick to an airline you know well lufthansa are the best european airline all round that i have used and emirates was the best internationally. i hope this review was helpful  obviously i am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses however be aware when booking with british airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money.  roundtrip with british airways from bangkok to london in club world. really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. the seats are horrid. cramped and you feel like youre in a coffin if you have the backwardfacing window seats. its unbelievably cramped and when i pay more than 4x the economy ticket i expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bedmode. the main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  the preordered beef on the inbound was dry. changed it for the cold king prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. the bathrooms are hideous and theres no distinction between economy and business. blocked washbasin tissue fibres all over the place stained walls and peeling finishes. crew outbound were older and very pleasant. inbound was a much younger crew and only one spanish lady was truly aware of passenger needs. the rest were more intent on getting to bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. boarding at lhr they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin chattering to each other and not one welcome or eyecontact after entering the door. the club word lounge meal offerings at t5 were abysmal. more like a school canteen. if anyone from ba reads these opinions then please do something about your dreadful ife. its archaic and thats being polite. fuzzy small screens and if you choose a movie with subtitles theyre illegible.  awful customer service. my wife and i have flown with british airways for almost 30 years i booked a flight through the executive club which we are members of nine months before travelling. less than 4 weeks later we realised we would need to cancel and after almost 1 hour on the phone on hold i decided to hang up and do it online. this seemed to be a simple process with a final message of we are processing your request.  after no confirmation at all i received my credit card statement to find a refund from ba of under 250  my booking was over 2500. after a call to customer services i was i will not get any further refund or be able to reinstate the flights. there was nobody else to talk to and if i emailed any of the ba executives it would be forwarded to customer services and they would not reply i asked about ombudsman or arbitrators and was informed that british airways does not adhere to or listen to outside bodies. over 2100 down the pan months before take off so plenty of time for ba to double their money on my seats. never again i regularly travel british airways to lcy and lhr and found them to be nothing more than a glorified ryanair in terms of service. i also flew a longer sector kiev to london last week and it was awful. on the a319 they only have 1 toilet at the rear of the plane for all economy passenger. on a 4 hour flight this resulted in massive queues discomforting passenger on the last 45 rows as well as long waits for those actually using the loo. the food was horrendous chicken kiev and the air hostesses were surly abrupt and really uninterested and unfriendly. i dont want them to do the fake smile and friendliness thing but these girls and guys were genuinely unhappy and unfriendly. as for my regular weekly or biweekly flights between dublin and lcy or lhr the e170 service to lcy is ok its punctual and you get a stale croissant for breakfast on it. what really annoys me is how british airways treats its frequent flyers makes it impossible to get any meaningful benefit from ba despite having travelled numerous times with them every other week at least and paid hundreds of pounds in fares that are usually well above the competition. they also have this seat selection fee for their bronze members if they book a hand luggage only fare. they cite that these fares are there to make it competitive but they really are not anywhere near competitive on routes they sell from dublin and the treatment of regular flyers and bronze members leaves a lot to be desired its basically meaningless i would have far better service on cityjet or aer lingus which both server those routes for a lower fare while being able to choose my seat for free at checkin time. as a result i am seriously considering my use of british airways. british airways london city airport to zurich costs double the average. the service is at average or below. british airways loyalty program makes it difficult to reach decent level even travelling weekly and now they reserve fast track to gold only.  cape town to london heathrow. the new british airways lounge at cape town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with virgin however it filled up quickly with passengers for the two flights. our new first class seats 2a3a were already showing their age so the plane was probably one of the first to be retrofitted. unfortunately the crew in first were young and disinterested. neither of us were addressed by our names at any point during the flight. the dinner service was slow and the food mediocre cold and dry or overcooked and dry. ironically they ran out of the south african white wine. the entertainment system wasnt working for most of the flight. british airways should provide an ipad alternative in first when that happens. pjs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep. the boeing 747400 toilets are ridiculously small for changing in and out of clothes. overall the experience was underwhelming. british airways are not the upmarket world class brand they were. fact. everything is about saving whilst extorting. the lounge at gatwick and t5 had no hot food until certain times  like school.  a while back theyre was always superb lounge food and not salty kettle chips people have paid for this and british airways is not delivering which is really wrong. bought sandwich from downstairs because lounge had no decent food. onboard only a tiny amount of club world passengers yet they ran out of preferred meal choices. starting to wonder just how the cabin crew are treated because if they are treated the way passengers are no wonder theyve stopped caring. so sad for what was an iconic brand.  travelled british airways from london heathrow to buenos aires return in business class. business class layout is terrible with very narrow seats which are arrangend in way that almost in any seat you book somebody will step over you during the night or you have to step over somebody else. in addition there are screens between and your neighbors seat which flight attendants have to move up and down when they want to serve passengers who do not have an aisle seat. i cant imagine how stupid the person who created this layout must have been. it is not comfortable for passengers nor is it for flight attendants. very sticky atmosphere due to this odd arrangement of seats. in terms of service this was lousy on both flights. there are about 4 flight attendants for about 40 business class seats. the flight attendants are quite old. it takes them a long time to get you something to drink on the table after takeoff. they move through the cabin twice with drinks before they serve dinner and desert. afterwards you dont see them and they may not show up even if you press the call button. their attitude is by and large correct but very formal and impersonal. they clearly dont display any signs of fun or interest in the customer. food was reasonable. no wifi available at all. i have booked a flight to travel with my wife from the usa to italy. i booked this trip through american airlines and some of the flights are with british airways. in order to select seats on british airways i have to pay about 200 for the both of us maybe more. i will never fly american airlines or british airways ever again. i think this policy is ridiculous. checked in and found the club lounge was landside meaning one had to allow time to get through security after using it. i need not have worried as i spent all of 60 seconds in the shared lounge that british airways use with about eight airlines. as ba have 3 daily flights to hannover and potentially 60 users of the facility i could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around. wrong the meal was a bunch of dried up sausages in a steamer that looked like samples in a medical lab. ghastly. a few bits of cheese here and there and that was it. i quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  only three passenger in club and the plane pushed back 5 minutes early. the meal i was offered was a reasonable looking prawn salad. i declined as i was well fed. a couple of gin and tonics and the flight of 90 minutes passed easily. fas very friendly. landing was in high winds and very well executed. was the return trip worth it for 800 not really but then my client paid the bill. dublin to london city on 2nd november flight was cancelled due to fog queued for 3 hours for a rebooking only to be offered a flight on the following evening when fog was due again in london. refund could not be processed by staff in the airport so i had to phone the call centre. two weeks later and i still have not received a refund. booked ryanair for the following day and even though it was last minute it was still cheaper than my original cancelled ba flight. reluctant to pay a premium to fly british airways again. trip got off to a good start with the club lounge at terminal 3 and i prefer it to t5. decent seating. reasonable food and plenty of drinks.  plane was newish and in good shape. was seated in 1a so leg room was fine. anywhere else in club europe is a waste of time and little space. plane took off 40 minutes late. fas were fine. declined the miserable pathetic looking dried up sandwich which was the inflight meal. had a couple of gin and tonics instead. comfortable flight of about 80 minutes. we were not able to check in online for our british airways flight from bangkok to london. boarding was a shambles with no clear boarding of business class first. i was travelling with my partner and we were not initially seated together. seating together was only confirmed at the time of boarding. it is unacceptable to have to pay for a seat. food selection and quality was poor. chicken tikka dry and the appearance a murky brown colour except the rice. meal was starchy with both rice and potatoes. overall cheap they had run out of our choice for the next meal by the time they reached us. again the selection very limited. meal very cheap and unappetising and left almost uneaten. offered only one drink tea coffee water with no refill offered. staff service very mediocre at best. i could not charge my computer on either the outbound or return flights. i travel quite often to europe and elsewhere but have avoided flying british airways due to bad experiences in the past. however i decided to try the airline again  and a big mistake checked in online and selected a widow seat near the front of the aircraft. on arriving at lgw i was informed my seat had been unilaterally changed to an aisle seat at the rear of the aircraft i am absolutely disgusted by such treatment. no other airline has done that to me ever in 20 years of flying. as a result of this i shall now try even harder to avoid flying british airways whenever possible. oh and the flight was delayed and the boarding staff were slow and inefficient. bad experience all round. british airways online check in policy is now most appalling. four times i have flown with them and three times myself and my girlfriend have been placed apart. this is even though we were on the same booking and once this has happened in business. british airways charge you just for selecting a seat. not a better seat just any seat other than that automatically selected for you the system seems designed to deliberately place you apart even though it knows that you are together. then it charges you 18 per seat to change your seat. if neither you or your partner have an empty seat next to you then you have to pay to move both seats just to be together. they also wont let you checkin until 24 hours before so you have to spend one hour of your holiday going online and paying for the privilege of sitting together. both these practices are archaic even with ryanair they place you together in the system and if you pay to change you get priority boarding. monarch only charge you to get a better quality seat. with ryan air you can also checkin your return at the same time as your outward. british airways have sunk to new depths and i will not fly them again. london heathrow to são paulo with british airways was one of the most uncomfortable business class flights i have taken in recent years. the boeing 747400 is old and tired. ba claim their seat is 60 long. not very comfortable when youre 66. the seats are narrow and very uncomfortable. previous week i travelled to hong kong with emirates from the uk maybe ba should checkout the competition i am travelling back to the uk tomorrow and not looking forward to 11 hours of discomfort. the last time i will travel with ba. flew to kuala lumpur with british airways on an old boeing 777200 in business class upgrade which was ok although choice of ife very poor. crew pleasant but not particularly efficient and since my wife and i were seated together in the middle rearfacing seats it is an odd practice to serve us separately  her meals were served well before mine. flight was punctual and we had a few hours sleep. coming back was in premium economy and might as well have been on a different airline. same old plane with tv screens extremely small. meals not particularly great. the main difference is that british airways crew treat anybody flying in a lower class as lesser individuals and they are bordering on rude. they forget that whatever class of cabin you are flying in that you are the customer and pay their wages. next time malaysia airlines i think. my wife and i flew british airways from heathrow to istanbul business class supposedly on an a320. we found our seats to be both hard and uncomfortable with minimal legroom and the hot meal provided breakfast in our case was dire. the toilet at the front of the aircraft was so unbelievably small as to be difficult to use. we consider that the conditions we had to put up with were quite unsuitable for a four hour flight. i am puzzled why british airways would choose to offer such a miserable business class experience it would be more honest and cause less disappointment if they were to declare all their european a320 flights to be economy only. i think one word sums it up rubbish. the london to barbados flight was passable however the return journey was a joke. it started at grantley adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking we fortunately were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. we sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken so i had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. there were no headsets and only two cots on board in spite of numerous babies needing this facility leading to very fractious and tired little ones a nightmare for parents i would presume. next the food abysmal a choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce revolting. the tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold  obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear. breakfast was an all time low a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. i have travelled with british airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight or in face any flight. many years ago when i used to travel from singapore and malaysia with british airways the food was excellent even in economy menu three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. the cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we the customer actually pay their wages. i asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. i did not feel like a paying customer at all just a nuisance. british airways have lost the plot and are up against great airlines such as emirates and singapore airlines although sadly not on the barbados route.  glasgow to bangkok via heathrow with british airways. we never received paid for seats that we have just had 160.00 refunded back on to my credit card after complaining that we never on both legs of our flights. we had been told that we would not get refund as we had assistance i email them and informed i had my email confirmation of set numbers and payment and seat ticket subs to prove my claim and at no point did i ask for or need or receive any assistance. they back tracked and i was informed my claim was authorised and it would take 68 weeks. british airways need to stop this practice as it does not show the airline in a good light. i would be wary of using british airways long haul again the aircraft are too old and shabby and the female stewardess need to go back on a training course on customer service. spirit of service what happened to that. london heathrow to brisbane via singapore return with british airways. overall it was not a great experience. we upgraded to premium economy on the way back expecting better leg room but i hardly noticed a difference the plane looks old and the food was shocking they advertise that there are great chefs picking the meals but the breakfast consisted of what i presume was a sausage and some type of scrambled egg it was not nice. the flight did not take off for an hour because the entertainment system was faulty. the entertainment was ok however the music could do with updating. the staff were friendly and it was easy checking in. rome to london with british airways. very uptight woman checking myself and husband in made me check my carryon bag that was substantially smaller than other bags taken onboard the plane. when i arrive to london i find i have no bag for my vacation no pajamas no toothpaste no change of clothes no toothbrush and its pouring down rain and cold here.  very disappointed with british airways. very little leg room im only 5ft 7in but i had to sit sideways for the flight. food very basic only a roll on both the outward and the return flight at 5.30pm. other airlines offer a snack. wouldnt travel british airways again budget airlines have more leg room. las vegas to london heathrow in november after the thanksgiving holidays we splashed out some avios points for a first class upgrade. i have never been so disappointed  business class on british airways is better than first as the cabin is much cleaner and modern. the first class section was dirty and cold the entertainment system broke down and had to be rebooted again and again. the service was good but food was nothing special. i must say i am very disappointed as i was looking forward to this upgrade. however there was nothing first class about it. i have flown with qatar airways and emirates business and first and they both beat twice over. london heathrow to las vegas with british airways. online check in and seat allocation facility 24 hours before departure are a con i checked the available flight seats approximately 30 hours prior to check in and virtually 95 of the flight was prebooked therefore i panicked and prepaid the 70 to secure a window and middle seat as seats had not been allocated to me and wouldnt be until 24hours prior to check in. then when i did check in approximately 23hrs and 59 minutes prior to travel i had already been allocated 2 seats one by a window and one in the middle so a total waste of time me paying 70. i got a refund but only have the inconvenience of completing online forms and waiting around a month to get my money back. then when i did get to the airport the seats i had already paid the extra 70 for had been allocated to someone else after i had paid for themand they told me i had to sit in my original 2 seats that had been allocated  an utter farce british airways refused to acknowledge their systems were at fault and had use of my funds for almost a month yet had i been advised of my seats prior to check in i would not have paid them 70. they knowingly do this to encourage people to prepay for something they knowingly cannot deliver. the aircraft was dirty when we boarded as the fight was late the toilets were blocked around 10 minutes into the flight and stank  eventually they were blocked off from use which left 2 out of 4 toilets for the entire rear section of the plane.  the food was abysmal. afternoon tea on a transatlantic flight used to be pleasant with scones cream jam and nice selection of sandwiches. now it is a dried up roll and dried excuse of a cake. i am never going to fly british airways again after the way they handled my complaint  they offered no form of apology that was meaningful or relevant to what i was complaining about and disowned responsibility for the corrupt way their online booking system works.  montreal to rome via london with british airways. boarded the plane on time 20.30hrs and sat for six hours on the tarmac while ba tried to clear a glitch in the landing gear system. they finally gave up and cancelled the flight. i had to get to rome to catch a cruise ship that was departing at 8pm on tuesday evening and here i am in montreal at 1pm monday rome time. british airways ticket agent refused to help me change my itinerary go to the hotel on the bus and at 2pm today  local time  we will have new itineraries for everyone.. i tried to explain the urgency to my situation but she cut me off i cant help you if i help you now i have to help everyone. when i pressed her further she gave me the ba 800 number which was closed due to the late hour. finally i called british airways reservations in london who rerouted me on american airlines. the final kick i put in a claim for a wasted nights guaranteed stay in rome and for cancellation compensation. a month later british airways advised me that my claim was approved and i would receive payment in two weeks. since then nothing for the last 6 weeks. phone calls to customer support involve at least a 40 minute hold. what a horrid excuse for customer service i have flown british airways business class and was pleased with lounge food service elemis spa showers wit elemis products and on request champagne. onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. staff friendly and accommodating cabin upper deck a380 clean and comfortable. my next trip in august was last minute with just first available. i felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. my past experiences with first prior to renovated cabins separate seating cells i felt it was still going to be a lovely comfortable experience with enjoyable food. so with all the changes in first now i thought i would really be in for a relaxing treat. i want to preface this by saying i have always loved british airways and has always been my first choice for london houston jfklondon flights for years. i had a early flight. checked in in ample time before my flight. i went straight to the concorde room to have breakfast. what i was met with was basically a cafeteria style self serve service. there was no table service two people working behind the food counter. i met an english couple while waiting inline to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us and we needed to toast on own bread. it all went downhill from there. the wait was long traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken tables were left unserviced and unclean. i carried some dishes to the front just so i could be seated. boarded plane seated and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. it looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. the the steward came to me and said they ran out of womens toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. he offered a mens toiletry kit and a business class kit. the food was served. i started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing and i am not picky but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. then the entrees were short and i had to choose a second choice. any one of these events would be okay even though they advertised that all is superb but everything constantly occurring had me regretting i paid for first and have sworn for the price differential vs service and quality  business class wins out hands down. the food was far from septacular or tasty  it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. the pilot did come out and asked if ba could call me and he was very apologetic i guess a stewardess mentioned the faux pass   i consented. disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end  no call no email no apology  in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. it left me feeling that ba really did not care about any of it  the service in lounges the appropriate allocation of food kits cleanliness all of it. my flight back to jfk i flew business. it was comfortable. though there was less space in first class seats years ago but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. i am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by  even if it was more simplistic. my review is for first only. recently flew to la on british airways and was thoroughly underwhelmed with the experience on the ba a380. i travel regularly in business class on emirates normally on the same equipment. the ba configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other airlines even to the extent of having to stretch over other passengers to leave your seat. in addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers openly commenting to each other in front of me. the cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired after only a couple of hours into the flight the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash  i dont think crew check them on a regular basis. the window seat has side stowage facilities which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it. when mentioned to crew they did get some paper towels to dry it out but needless to say i didnt use it photo attached. overall poor value for money. rio de janeiro to london heathrow. several weeks after booking our flights online for reasons unknown ba moved us from the flight we had booked and put us on to the previous days flight. i had to phone them it took 20 minutes to get through and rebook us on to the flight we had booked in the first place. the customer service department is totally useless. i have sent several emails asking why they did what they did and all i get is meaningless offtheshelf standard replies. i have asked three times for the name. position and address of someone i can write to about this but they consistently fail to give me this information. i presume the tactic is to make me so fed up that ill just give up and go away. a secondrate airline which is definitely to be avoided. i have been flying to the us regularly from england and have noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its booking process website call centre and ground staff. the british airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse call centre staff do not seem to speak english and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. examples cannot check in online but via the app on a smartphone no problem except i wanted a printed boarding pass. call centre staff in india wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip as she was on a different booking and wouldnt give me her flight reference number for security reasons. no problem with security reasons when i paid ba a lot of money for the ticket. upgrading with points or avios fails in the middle of a transaction. the system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after so you have to call the call centre. ba blacks out so many flights from purchasing with avios its not worth trying unless youre jobless and can fly any time and dont care where you go. in the queue for boarding my passport wasnt open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. on another occasion at passport control after checking in i was directed back to the ba desk id just come from. theres nothing wrong with your passport it must be baa. its not us was the response. it took a huffing tutting ba duty manager to run the visa check again. i advise people to avoid ba if possible. the only reason for choosing ba is flight safety. but other airlines manage that too with a smile. so no excuse. flew british airways from london gatwick to salzburg. agent at baggage drop was rude and off hand she tried to take my well under maximum sized cabin bag for free checkin as hold luggage. even when i explained that it contained valuable items and medication she still persisted. boarding was efficiently managed a pleasant change from the free for all i experienced on my last ba flight. the cabin crew made no attempt to greet passengers or help with stowing luggage. the snack included in the ticket price consisted of a muesli which resembled yoghurt with a few oats stirred in a stale a unbuttered bread roll containing a slice of plastic cheese and a very small plastic cup of tea. service was lacking in finesse. the one plus was landing twenty minutes early. british airways flight from punta cana to london. the food was awful and the cabin crew gave the impression that they were doing us a favour when going about their duties. not a pleasant experience and the last time i will use them. the fact that they fly the flag for the uk makes it even more unpalatable.  british airways cancelled our holiday flights to egypt sharm el sheikh today via text. we went online for a refund which sent us to phone a help line indian based call centre. we were told we have to wait 7 to 10 days for a full refund the flights were booked last march. after waiting on hold to complain to a supervisor for over 20 mins we still didnt get to discuss why it takes so long for a refund i phoned on another mobile and was told no supervisor was available if ever you need help dont bother with british airways.  phoenix to london heathrow and this was our third time flying first class on british airways and after flying this time we are disappointed.  the ba lounge in phoenix is disgusting. we could handle it only for about 5 minutes. from the staff the seats the space the food nothing was orderly clean and it all seemed rundown. walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. the boarding process was a joke. again the staff seemed confused clueless they called for everyone all statuses memberships traveling with children etc...all at once. it seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. there were 3 cabin staff for first class two out of the three were not at all cordial. no greeting they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. they were not well groomed or spoke politely  came across unprofessional. this ruined the experience of flying first class. the meal experience was horrible. i ordered an appetizer salad and an main course. my husband ordered the 2 appetizers and a main course. they came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. first time this has ever happened in first class they brought my appetizer which we had to share and they completely forgot about my salad. they brought the main chicken dish which was cold and dry. i had to send it back and changed to a steak. the steak came after about 20 minutes. roughly 14 of the steak was hot the remainder was cold not even warm. the taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. upon waking up i opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. the menu had assortment of biscuits and a few other bistro type items. when i ordered coffee and biscuits the flight attendant looked concerned and said let me see if i can find some biscuits for you. she came back with a bag of popcorn a browny and a few vanilla wafers. typical items served on a domestic us based airline. my husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. she failed to understand half and half and finally said oh you mean half and half in british accent. how is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an american accent for half and half. normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. toilets were small cramped and dirty with no typical first class amenities available within the toilets. our next leg was within eu to munich on another ba flight where the service on a 737 surpassed their international first class seat is comfortable but thats about it third time flying the british airways a380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a ba amex 2for1 redemption. however to ensure that we maxed out the experience as always we pre booked seats. on checking in online seats had been moved contacted ba bronze and reply was cannot answer why possibly operational reasons more information should be available at check in. check in no response. on board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be normal passengers i.e. no entourage. seats we were allocated lumbar and head rest functions did not operate cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck so onwards and upwards. having flown ba a reasonable amount i have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew despite operating with poorly designed cabins poorly maintained seats equipment we had a similar scenario on a heathrow to la and return last july where we had the same reg plane same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out manage to maintain a brave company face. ba club lounge again food choice poor running out although granted peak hours but if other airlines can cope why cannot ba cabin crew service very good and friendly. food reasonable but nothing that makes you say that that was good. entertainment poor old ish and second rate movies enough said. seats unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. having flown qantas emirates and qatar a380s like everybody else we wonder why ba did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. well we know why  s question does no one on the ba cabin design team wear glasses there is no storage space if it goes in the drawer with the shoes you have to move the seat from sleep position to access so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs or hanging them over the separator. again competitors manage it. the seat itself is harder than the competitors above mattress and apparently i discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried so you have one and thats it. unfortunately we do still have to use ba next march but have booked qatar again for october. additionally the customer service service in india is sadly woefully short in all areas although polite working from scripts and unable to solve  answer simple questions. frustration. a question for ba we really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using ba i do not mean cost. flew british airways from salzburg to london gatwick. check in was very slow. boarding at salzburg involves a bus ride out to the plane. no attempt was made to separate passengers by row numbers onto the two buses used as other airlines do in a similar situation resulting in an absolutely chaotic boarding process. cabin crew were off hand. the in flight snack was thrown at rather served to passengers. the totally inedible sandwiches offered consisted of rubbery processed cheese between two thick slices of poor quality bread. the one consolation was that the flight lasted just less than two hours. london heathrow to lisbon return with british airways. decent aircraft but the service onboard was dreadful. pilot and first officer sounded friendly and professional and kept us up to date with flight details etc but cabin staff were cold and had a completely couldnt care less attitude. why do this job if you seem to hate it same service when i flew london heathrow  lisbon. such a shame especially as when you are really scared of flying you could do with a crew with a different approach to passenger service. i booked a nonrefundable round trip ticket new york to london paris to new york. i showed up at jfk 2 hours before my flight and was informed that my ticket had been refunded which meant i had no ticket. when i spoke to british airways customer service they said they would investigate how this happened which would take 2448 hours but that meanwhile i had no ticket. they would not rebook my ticket. they were entirely unsympathetic even though they had made a huge error cancelling my ticket. i was forced to purchase an expensive 1300 last minute ticket for which i have still not been reimbursed even though finally british airways acknowledged that they had made a big error. i can understand making an error. i cannot understand their unwillingness to help me when they put me in such a compromised position. subsequent to the problem on first leg british airways customer service assured me that my return ticket was not affected and they even sent me an eticket confirmation of my return. but again the morning of my return flight they told me i had no return ticket. only then did a supervisor finally admit that an error had been made and he rebooked my return at no cost. over the course of 2 weeks however i spent at least 10 hours trying to get my problem sorted out first at heathrow airport then on the phone and on email and i was still left stranded for my return flight. i am amazed that british airways was so insensitive to the problem which they created through a huge error and that i have still not received a refund for the outbound ticket i was forced to purchase. london heathrow to vancouver with british airways. it is okay but really for business class you expect more. the lounge at vancouver crowded with noinedible food. plane ancient and cabin filthy  really falling apart  didnt want to touch the storage lockers. service pretty good food good except breakfast was virtually non existent. entertainment horrific. not one good film to watch and none that seemed recent. small range. bed is comfortable flat. phone customer service at ba not usually a good experience. i fly it because theres not much choice on this route but i will try air canada next time. this was and will remain the first and last time i will fly british airways. having flown this route numerous times before with a popular uk based airline i thought i would try ba. i expected a comparable experience at least whilst hoping for something a cut above. on the outbound flight we were offered orange or champagne the return flight was orange juice or water but only half the cabin was served so we didnt get anything. outbound menu did not correspond with the food on offer and the choice of meal soon became no choice at all as halfway through serving the cabin section of 32 seats they ran out. at least on the return flight they managed two thirds of the cabin section before the options dried up again. there was a number of very disgruntled passengers who wondered what exactly they paid extra for. a minor gripe was the toilet was right through the economy section which im sure got on those passengers nerves. seats were ok but the quality of the media system was poor and the touch screen was unreliable and a number of them didnt work at all so more upset passengers. i gave up on mine and watched movies on my phone the quality was far superior. i had heard good things about ba however that was flying businessclub or first class. maybe thats what they concentrate on. cape town to geneva via london return. i was disappointed in my long haul flight with british airways. they squash you in like sardines on a long haul and offer uncomfortable seats and tiny rather blurred screens for movie watching. our flight from geneva was delayed for 40 min whilst they looked for someones lost baggage  making us very stressed about catching our flight home on time. the service and food was ok but the fact that they lost my luggage on my return flight from geneva to cape town was really hugely inconvenient. i expected much more from british airways. having previously flown with british airways on their european routes i thought i would take a long haul flight with them. i arrived 2 hours before departure at heathrow terminal 3 and couldnt quite understand what was going on the queue to actually drop my prechecked luggage was long very long hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour and that there were no signs of ba taking any steps to remedy the situation. even with my frantic tweeting at ba nothing improved. the situation boiled down to the fact that only 4 desks were open for the general public on the day that schools finished. needless to say whoever was in charge that day didnt really know what they were doing and caused a lot of agro for many customers and ba needs to take full responsibility of this. once these proceedings had passed i found myself boarding the boeing 747400 which was tired and not very well maintained. leg room was atrociously tight with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual usable legroom. the inflight entertainment had a good selection of films but was made to be disappointing with the meagre 7 to 9 screens. the staff was very friendly. looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal. the meal was decent not fantastic.  my only note when it comes to food and drink is that more water should be made available. i found myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley to ask for water. all in all i wouldnt fly with ba again using their longhaul services unless i were to fly in business or first. the ground service is terrible. i am left disappointed given how decent their shorthaul flights are and how much they pride themselves on the quality of their products in that market. british airways from london heathrow to mumbai from terminal 5 in coach class. check in uneventful. no boarding priority for people travelling with children a first for me for any long haul flight. five minutes before departure captain announces that someone has checked in a bag but has not turned up so they need to take off the offending suitcase. fair enough. the staff had botched up loading the suitcase by marking it to be in a container in which it wasnt. result they started taking off all the containers one by one and searching for the flight. captain told that he cannot give any estimate. 90 minutes passed after that no announcement a tired and jaded cabin crew literally disappeared. after 90 mins they realised that people might be hungry and started serving juice. finally after 1 hr 45 mins captain said that they had found the rogue suitcase and we will be off in 15 mins. the plane suddenly started a push back without any warning. the aircraft was a jaded b747400 poor seats poor entertainment equipment which had to be rebooted thrice before it worked. once airborne the crew said that people were hungry so there will not be a drink service they will be serving lunch  possibly an excuse to do less work. lunch was ok. second flight service was a snack before landing for which they lost the child meal i had requested and shamefully tried to create one by adding a fruit shot to an adult meal. overall poor airline with tired and jaded aircraft and an equally tired and jaded looking staff. booked a very expensive london to bangkok flight for my wife and i because it was the only direct flight and also we expected to get a decent service for this higher price. the british airways terminal was hopeless impossible to find your way around with no signs anywhere and hideously overcrowded. onboard my entertainment system never worked then a few minutes into the flight both my wifes and my neighbours entertainment systems also stopped working. tried to read but my overhead light was broken. tried to sleep but my neighbours light was broken and on  could not be turned off. complained but it took 3 months to get a satisfactory reply and all they offered was a 100 voucher for future ba flights like im ever going to travel with them again. theyre a tired overpriced airline. my partner and i traveled british airways from gatwick to punta cana on 29th december. after checking in online and paying an extra 45 each way per person to reserve seats after already paying over 4000 for our flights wasnt a major issue and was expected we discovered that selecting our outgoing seats was fine but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin. being a nervous flyer i was not up for sitting by myself for nearly 9 hours so we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage drop off point the gentleman working behind the drop off was as helpful as he could be but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left punta cana and that it wasnt likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers. getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane with tv screens the size of my iphone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. after take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay flight attendants then offered us drinks  once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadnt asked for and we were happy with and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. but then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staffs family were on board and they were all staying in punta cana for 5 days before flying home. one member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class  and walked past everybody else. my partner then asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them. when we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water. 1 hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. all staff in our cabin looked half asleep with hair all over the place. considering this was a 2pm flight youd have thought it was an evening flight. we arrived in punta cana at 7pm extremely disapointed with the poor service and the dated plane we had endured for almost 9 hours.  london to johannesburg return with british airways. this was my first ever long haul flight to see my daughter get married in zimbabwe. i was in for a big shock and not a nice one. the seats and room were not really any different to low cost airlines and this was an 11 hour flight  jammed in like sardines and got no sleep. freezing cold aircon all the way back from johannesburg and again so cramped that when the person in front of you puts the seat back you cannot eat your food. i used a connecting flight to bulawayo which was with south african airlink and even though it was only a 1 hour flight the food was much better and the plane far more comfortable. a very poor experience with british airways and gbp 4000 spent for the 3 of us to get there and back. i will never be disapointed with ryanair or easyjet again. british airways  are trading on their name only. i usually fly on asian airlines ana eva korean asiana and accustomed to their very good service and food. this was my first flight on british airways from vancouver to lisbon via london. i selected it because of price. overall experience was adequate. plane was an older b747 and interior showed its age. ife was outdated. seat comfort was fine. cabin crew not attentive between meals. western food offerings just ok. had several hours layover at heathrow. british airways ground staff good and pleasant. i might fly british airways again if equipment is updated to a380 or boeing 787 and price is lowest to europe. copenhagen to chicago via london heathrow. british airways club world is the worst business class cabin ive flown. tvs are tiny and the picture quality is awful  thankfully i had my laptop with me as the tv was unwatchable. the tables hang at an angle so expect your food and drink to slide off although the floor is probably the best place for their food. i would advise you to eat at the airport and not rely on the inflight slop.  youll have someone climbing over you or youll have to climb over other people to get to the toilet this is business class.  and then theyll lose your bag tell you its going to take 45 days to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime. if you try and call to get answers leave at least 45 minutes time to sit in a queue and then expect to be put through to the wrong person despite selecting the correct option in the automated menu. avoid british airways wherever you can london to newcastle. been a while since i last flew british airways sad to see the same old planes in use and now very much looking their age for domestic use. technical issues delayed departure normal sure but the noise the plane made on taxi lasted far too long and was slightly alarming and not the norm. seat pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely last time flown i got a nice sandwich and drink this time its small bag of crisps and juice its time ba stopped taking its domestic no competition routes for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trips the numbers onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fees now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for how long now kudos to the pilot for landing in monsoon like conditions with very limited visibility  if only the aircraft quality matched their pilots las vegas to london with british airways was awful. we were in first class travelling with 2 young children and wanted to put them to bed on this long flight and we had booked a row of 4 seats so we could sleep one child one adult. we check in at first class which was delayed as they are busy and have moved some economy passengers to the first class line to speed up things. then we are told one of our seats has been moved the staff are unsure as to why and will rectify this immediately and bring my boarding pass to the lounge. an hour later i go to the check in desk as nobody from ba has been bothered to come  i am then told actually your seat is broken nothing we can do and its now my problem. this seat is in the middle therefore it means either one child alone on the otherside of the cabin or the 2 children together behind me and my husband alone the other side of the cabin. no other options and british airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit 2 together on different rows. we kept the children together behind me obviously meaning i could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone. then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake  the attendents were unable to override the light  seriously. they did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat alone surrounded by strangers or to move me to the front which would have left my children completely alone. on out outward flight from london to vegas one of our seats also malfunctioned and the tv etc went down for the entire journey  nothing the cabin staff could do then either. apparently they are old planes we are still waiting for a response from british airways. watch out for fog diversions at pisa we arrived over pisa on time circled for 20 minutes and then diverted to genoa. this was because of fog at pisa and the fact that there was no instrument landing system. we subsequently found that the ils has not been working for some time and will not be working for a good while yet. fog is common at pisa in the winter. we could understand a last minute diversion because of unexpected factors. however there have been frequent diversions yet british airways gave no advance warning that there might be trouble. we had a long wait at a deserted genoa airport and no british airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food. eventually one lady appeared to show us to a bus which took us on a 3 hour journey to pisa. we had a 12 hour day with little to eat or drink. our chief complaint is that with advance warning from ba we would have bought water and food if we had known what could happen. in any event ba should have done more to provide extra refreshments. british airways flight from london heathrow to glasgow. shabby cabin lacklustre cabin crew flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. a crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm and as little engagement with passengers as possible. some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at lhr. on descent into gla it opened again and hung open for several minutes and i was tempted to unclip and close it. i made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. eventually the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. we should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class part of a longer trip but after service issues with ba and a long journey prior to this flight we couldnt be bothered pointing that out. just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointments with regard to service and lounge provided by ba on a long return trip involving two other airlines who were streets ahead in all ways. johannesburg to dublin via london after christmas. was excited as on british airways a380. what a disappointing flight. the service was terrible very young and inexperienced cabin crew. had to wait ages for them to answer my bell when i rang it. food was awful my partner didnt get a bread roll or milk with dinner. seats are bigger in this plane but still uncomfortable. the worst of all is the luggage allowance. 23kg other airlines allow 30kg in economy. what a performance from the airline when we were 3kg over. also having to pay for seats if you want to book them is disgusting. i will never use british airways again. bangkok to london with british airways on 3rd january. this was most probably the worst flight ive had in 15 years. the crew were very poor only seeing them when serving meals. no one came round with drinks or snacks during a 13 hour flight if you wanted anything you had to go to the galley  and then they were unhelpful i was only offered a bag of crisp the seat was very narrow and the remote for the entertainment was on top of the armrest. food was below the the standard i would expect from a national airline small portions. main meal and a pice of cake. no offer for a second cup of coffee. overall a most unpleasant experience i would not recommend british airways to anyone. copenhagen to london on a very full plane with british airways staff not limiting cabin baggage. some people boarding with 4 bags  overcoats led to overloaded bins. crew frantically trying to move bags to any spare space in and around seats. my nicely pressed suit jacket rammed into a gap by a staff member ended up like a jcloth. people using their laptops throughout take off and landing despite announcements to the contrary. ran out of drinks and ice so no drink on a 2 hour flight. where have the standards gone have raised this with british airways but no satisfactory response after 4 weeks. british airways flight from london to las vegas reasonable with just enough service from the cabin crew to satisfy. upgraded on return flights to premium economy. awful flight with crew who spent their time in a huddle discussing their party times in las vegas. dreadful food broken seat and the entertainment system froze. not sure id ever fly british airways unless there was no choice upgraded to business class on our british airways flight from madeira to london on december 28th paying a premium of e105 per person. disappointed understates our reaction. our seats were not comfortable business class as i remember but exactly the same as the uncomfortable economy class seats behind us distinguished only by a curtain defining where economy class finished and business started british airways standards are slipping london to new york jfk with british airways and abyssal customer service. onboard the flight can be great and its the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. however this time the onboard service was as bad as the ground service. food was poor. i was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers and yet my food choice was gone. the tvs didnt work in 2 seats  i couldnt be bothered to try a third and decided to just get some sleep. the staff insisted on forming a cliquish huddle and were speaking so loudly i couldnt even sleep with ear plugs in. british airways from houston from london heathrow in premium economy. the seats could recline a lot and were quite large. however the tv screens were beyond small. it looked like ones from 2002 were better. there was virtually no difference in food to economy except you had more than two choices and champagne was served before and after takeoff in glasses. but after 10 hours the seat becomes very uncomfortable as you cannot lift the armrests away because the tray table and remote are stationed in there. this made sleeping hard. dont fly premium economy british airways its disappointing. avios points flight to london from toronto for christmas in business class. slow queue for check in though given flying just christmas there were a lot of people and luggage to be fair. the ba club lounge at pearson remains well run and clean. too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. onboard the usual slow service taking coats i had to ask papers drink menu amenity kit  very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. the meal service was fast with drinks served first. the evening meal was average at best and overcooked with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. across the piece you can see the cuts and money saving british airways are making to business class. even now  the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger no flower in the toilets no drinks offered after dinner. the list goes on breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible unlike the previous bacon baguette. reasonable entertainment choices. crew were the usual indifferent long haul im here as a favour to you all with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service i think the main problem british airways have is a dated cabin product. the ying yang seating in its day was innovative and one of the first lay flat beds. now crawling over a stranger to reach the isle being bumped by people and carts if youre on the aisle and a lack of storage space mean that the ba product is way inferior to air canada and a lot of the middle eastern carriers. my loyalty is now being tested and with the constant devaluing of the executive club benefits including mileage flight availability and cost i am now questioning my loyalty to british airways. miami to manchester via london heathrow and from the first flight on 28th december until our return from miami on 12th january our flights and issues with british airways were dreadful. zero customer service change of planes awful food rude staff and lost luggage  british airways made a lasting impression on our xmas holiday. my family and i have been fortunate to fly with other major airlines and never experienced anything like this. we spent extra money on upgrading our seats to premium economy and the service was appalling. we would not recommend ba to anyone and felt so strongly about the lack of service we felt compelled to write this blog. bangkok to london heathrow on british airways. i have lived in thailand for 4 years now and try to go back to the uk at least once a year to visit family and friends. normally i fly either emirates to manchester or to heathrow with eva air. this time around ba came up with a fairly competitive price. the aircraft wasnt in particularly impressive shape and inflight entertainment unit was quite outdated and didnt work for the first 2 hours of the flight. once it did work the screen was awful and very dark. i cant fathom why ba are using outdated entertainment systems when rivals such as eva emirates and even thai airways are much more current. inflight service was okay for the most part. regular trips by the staff for refreshments in the first few hours but this certainly died down afterwards. after using the call system to get the attention of a staff member i was abruptly asked to switch it off and asked if i had a problem. no problem just would like a drink please. however alcohol apart from wine had ran out. im not a massive drinker but do have a couple of whiskey and cokes on a flight. also there was no wifi no charge points for mobile devices. this is again in contrast with emirates thai airways and eva. all in all  i have to say it was a disappointing experience. i wont be using ba again on my next flight to the uk. i booked an extra legroom seat and payment was taken and the seat confirmed. when i checked in someone was allocated to and in the seat i had paid for. i was given another without extra leg room. i was advised to refer to customer services which is not easy via phone or online. i filled in a form on line to get my 10 back and i will get a response apparently in 28 days. as you might have guessed this is not about 10 its about the fact that i had taken the time to ensure my journey was as comfortable as possible and the i dont give a damn attitude of british airways once their mistake was discovered.  british airways needs to up its game. late evening departure on ba28 from hong kong to heathrow plane fully booked prechristmas season in all classes. my seat was 2k the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my christian name  i did not object had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. during the flight i found out that the majority of the 14 pax in first class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. the purser offered the champagne welcome drink and i gladly accepted and soon my face turned pale  the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. his apology came prompt but too late. they simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour  or 30 minutes after takeoff  to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. british airways did not control this service process properly. maybe nobody was in charge maybe it was simply forgotten. the plane had arrived in hong kong about 5 hours earlier so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. the remaining flight was ok  cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team food not sensational but it was after midnight so no complaints in this respect. seat was fine had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight breakfast options okay arrival ahead of schedule. so is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks yes we are talking about first class in a leading european airline. the product has to be perfect thats part of the game in first. serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer. for me this means that it was most probably my last long distance flight on ba. no marks on inflight entertainment because i chose the sleep option. just returned from orlando to london via miami that we booked direct with british airways. the outgoing flight was really good. however a totally different story on the return flight. we were redirected to check in with american airlines as we had an internal connecting flight. although we checked in shortly after the check in opened the only seating was preferred meaning we had to pay extra for flights we believed we had paid in full. additionally my family was split up. the aa check in would not allow us to check into the long haul flight from miami to london. after phoning we discovered we had been checked in but not allowed to choose seats. ive spent a week seeking an apology from ba customer services and ive had several stock responses and been left with the feeling that they really do not care about their customers. from their response it is quite clear they do not see aa as part of the same group one world alliance i used to be of the view that i didnt mind paying a bit more for ba as their service was really good but unfortunately they now seem to offer a budget airline service. i post this purely to warn other families to be aware of the danger of booking with british airways but having a connecting flight with another part of the one world alliance. have been impressed with british airways in the past today we had a very different experience on our flight from edinburgh to london gatwick. we checked in online and arrived to drop off our bags 45 minutes before the departure time and were met by an extremely moody check in lady. she radioed another member of staff to ask if we were to be allowed to come on the flight in an extremely moody manner trying to have us not admitted even though 45 minutes is the amount of time to arrive before from their website. eventually we were allowed and with one last scowl from the staff left the desk. we got through security rushing as we thought we must be really late only to find the plane delayed for an hour. gatwick to male and just when we thought the british airways business class offer could get no worse we checked in to find that the ba lounge was shut and the alternative was the number 1 traveller lounge where for both first and business class champagne has to be purchased. needless to say no advance notice of this was given and by the admission of their own staff  british airways management just dont care what impact this will have on customers who have paid a great deal of money to fly premium class. based on our recent flights with ba where we have witnessed penny pinching devaluation of the business class experience to the extent that there is now no comparison with other similarly priced airlines. their cavalier approach to customer care may result in others like us saying last time with ba ever london heathrow to cape town and the british airways bag drop and ground staff service was great. onboard the evening meal was fine but the inflight entertainment choices are very poor. films tv and music choices are limited. cabin crew were courteous and served one drink and then dinner  but no more service after that. overnight no water was offered we had to keep getting up to go and ask and then only got small measures not bottles. breakfast choice was fair but the food was awful luke warm gunge cheap cereal tepid tea  truly not worth bothering with. i believe this is usual as my brother had similar experience a month ago flying business class from mexico. i will think twice about booking british airways again if i have a choice. this was the return leg of our british airways flight on ba056 from johannesburg to london heathrow on 18th january. while the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody petulant crew member. she is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. british airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive enjoyable experience but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. is this really the way ba wants its customers to feel being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills  if you present yourself as a friendly amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part instead of putting so much energy into giving so little. after all isnt it us the customers who choose to fly with you and support you as an airline. check in crew at johannesburg could also do with training on manners and smiling  instead of zero greeting no thank yous and blank faces. vancouver to london with british airways premium economy seat 12a. in flight tv was inoperative and the food was awful. on the way out from london the food was very good  why so bad from vancouver on the way out thre were trim bits loose inside the cabin giving the impression of bad care. i dont think the extra fare for premium economy is justified unless reasonable food is provided in both directions. flights were on schedule but on arrival we had to wait at london t3 for more than 20 minutes for a gate. edinburgh to san francisco via london heathrow. flight was great until i found out my bags hadnt made my 1 hour connection. was promised by customer services weeks before that a 1 hour connection was fine as all flights were via heathrow t5 this was a lie. edi to lhr sector was delayed slightly i made the flight but the bags didnt. i was promised by ground staff the bags would be quicker to the aircraft than i would again this was a lie. 24 hours later my bags havent arrived and are now in some office somewhere in san francisco. other than that i have no idea where they are.  british airways customer service line is next to useless with employees that do not understand english and read from a script.  thanks to a time change from 23.55 to 00.05 which brought forward our departure by almost 24 hours we very nearly missed our flight back from rio de janeiro to london. the checkin desks were crowded out by team gb athletes returning home from a training session and we were relieved to get the fast track treatment. the firstbusiness lounge at gig is one of the worst weve been in. our seats were 1ef and seemed marginally better than the first class seats on a 747 although still far off the standard of british airways competitors. 1ef also suffer from being near the galley and there was one crew member who spent much of the night talking away to her colleagues. 1a and 1k seemed to be occupied by ba employees and there was far too much schmoozing going on. service on the whole was reasonably good although none of the food on the menu was actually available. this was rather feebly blamed on the changeover from one month to the next. the ife worked reliably and the large screen had a much better resolution than on 747s. overnight the temperature in the cabin was set too high which resulted in an uncomfortable sleep under the duvet in the pyjamas provided. the toilets on the 777 are ridiculously small and werent well cleaned during the flight. breakfast was the usual affair with an atrociously rubbery omelette. overall the flight was okay but not a first class experience. london to calgary with british airways. would not let me use avios points to upgrade even though i had plenty. they only allocate 10 of cabin occupancy for this  shockingly poor. you dont expect your national airline to scupper your honeymoon plans. although there was plenty of availability in the cabin the fact that only 10 is allocated and potentially seats can go empty they wont let you upgrade. we paid for tickets regardless in the cabin below but still not allowed to upgrade. i would have used another airline if i knew in advance and will do in future. london to singapore with british airways and the plane left 90 minutes late due to technical fault with one of their aging 747400 that found itself minus two wheels stuck on the runway. first class was full. one would think ba would put themselves out on this route given the competition from singapore airlines. wrong  the champagne was lukewarm as is often the case. the amuse bouche taster was ghastly. some sort of couscous and tasteless. appetiser of sushi style salmon was very nice. soup nice but lukewarm. salad was forgotten by the miserable female fa. mains of sea bass was very good. my wife had the same  but the beef main. she was very complimentary of the meal. white wine was luke warm. solution  the miserable fa came back with a paper cup of ice cubes and dumped the lot in my glass. brilliant. wash bag of freebies was cheap and tacky. the seat  well i am very critical of this design. so much space is wasted with the island console in the middle. the designer of this seat should find another career. seats already starting to show wear and tear. why british airways opted for a canvas material rather than leather is a mystery. in summary the a380 is fabulous. slept for about 5 hours. great flight. fas mostly were fine. terrific landing by a very skilled pilot. all in all  it was okay  but not overwhelming as first class should be. i was originally booked on a united airlines flight from london to boston connecting through washington dulles but this was cancelled because of the snow in dc. united rebooked me onto british airways to complete the flight to boston. without a doubt ba is one of the worst airlines i have flown on. upon arriving at check in i was told that i could only check in one bag despite being allowed to take two bags on united. united said that i would be able to travel on an equivalent service with ba. the check in supervisor at heathrow informed me that i would have to pay 65 to bring the bag. when i complained said its not my problem. i asked if they could call united to clarify the bag issue but they refused saying we dont even talk to united  in the end i didnt pay and will get it sent at a later date. the onboard service was very disappointing. the food was barely edible. the staff were loud and abrupt providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. the inflight entertainment failed multiple times and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem. the maximum volume was also too low so it was difficult to hear the movies over the cabin noise and i am not hard of hearing. it was disappointing that there was no onboard wifi or personal device entertainment. british airways seriously threw away an opportunity to convince me to fly with them in the future. vancouver to daressalaam via london  doha. yet another dreadful experience with british airways why do i travel with them this time ba advised me that my return itinerary was changed because of a cancellation by their codeshare partner qatar airways to the daressalaam leg of the journey which would give me a 24 hour layover in doha before connecting onward to london. in itself that was not an issue but ba did everything possible to wash their hands of any responsibilities for their obligations under ec regulation no 2612004 as required by article 14.2  which they even post on their website. it took a day of calls by my travel agent and 2 hours of debating with an agent his supervisor and the office in manchester before they agreed that it was their responsibility. their solution  a rerouting of my journey through nairobi with an extra flight by a noncode share partner that cost them more than the cost an overnight hotel in doha  something they refused to consider. go figure never again with british airways. london heathrow to dubai and i feel sorry for british airways. i have just flown one of my last ever flights with them as they have fallen into the depths of being second rate against far superior competition. the lounges at t5 heathrow should be great but we arrived last night at 6pm to find almost all the food offer finished so its soup or a jacket potato and beans then so much nicer to spend 20 and buy a decent meal from one of the many eateries in t5 instead. then onto the plane which was tired. as usual bits of all 4 of our seats were broken. my wifes tv. my sound only worked in the left ear. a really dirty blanket and no spares at all. very late food service. but to be fair and for a change the stewardesses werent their usual ba indifferent style but fairly good and certainly polite. but this is business class and it certainly doesnt feel like it any more. i try to support british jobs but emirates is cheaper and better.  i received a message at 3am to inform me that my british airways flight from zurich to lcy will be delayed by 1 hour. travelling with a 5yr old and already staying at the zurich airport radisson i decided to arrive at the check in 2 hrs before the new departure time. unfortunately the incompetent staff at the check in desk informed me that the flight is closed and no more check ins. i knew this was incorrect and asked for the supervisor who knew that the flight being at least 1 hour late departure 2.5hrs as it turned out is not closed we were checked in of course ba  please train your check in staff or fire the incompetent ones. luckily as a very frequent flyer i was not going to accept the nonsense of the first check in who suggested we should fly in the evening london to são paulo guarulhos. british airways boeing 747s looks very old outdated and in need of an urgent update. i heve flown 8 times in the past 2 month always in their boeing 747s and all of them were in the same condition. i just hope that the maintenance in the vital systems are better than inside the aircraft as one can see in the attached pictures taken from my seat in the upper deck in my last flight. also the entertainment system is very limited. vancouver to heathrow and the first and last time i will fly with british airways. the aircraft from the stand looks impressive but soon as we boarded you could tell that the aircraft was at least 30 years old and it was so dated on the inside. my flight home was delayed  yes this does happen to every airline but they allowed us to board the plane and there was an electrical fault the professionalism of ba staff was appalling.  seattle to tel aviv via london with british airways. the food was below average and the cabin staff service was average. the seats are comfortable and are ok as long as you do not have a seat where someone has to step over you or you have to step over someone else. the inflight entertainment system uses a dual prong plug in for their inflight entertainment system so i had to use their headphones which are not comfortable for long periods of time. after going outside of airport security for a long layover at lhr and coming back through the security process ba tried to make my wife check in her carryon bag which she has used in our travels on many airlines around the world without question  and was already accepted on our first leg from seattle. her bag fit in bas measurement gage frame but the ba desk agent did not like how i put it in. apparently it has to not only fit but it can only be placed in the gage with a straight up and down motion only. after complaining that her requirement was unnecessary the desk agent relented in a huff. ba also required that i pay to chose my seats after buying a 7000 usd business class ticket. i am a alaska mvp gold member so i can fly ba as a partner airline and get mileage credit but i cannot book seats without paying. having to pay for my seat selection and the carryon luggage screening in lhr makes it unlikely that i will fly ba again. heathrow to toronto with british airways. fast checkin and security. galleries lounge very crowded poor food offering and the furniture and toilets were not very clean. boarding started on time for a 1705 departure but was suddenly stopped when it was announced that there was a technical problem and a new departure time of 1955 was given. this was later amended to 2100 and later to 1500 the next day  no details of the technical problem were provided. it is extraordinary that ba do not have a better resilience plan for these incidents when they occur at their home base  such a lengthy delay is unacceptable. hotelsmeals etc were organised fairly efficiently but not once was any offer made to reaccommodate on other flights until i made a fuss due to commitments the next day and was reluctantly booked on air canada at 0900 the next morning  it had empty seats in both j and y cabins. several emails to ba customer service about this have yielded the usual stereotypical and nonsensical responses  they have ensured that i will never travel with ba again we do have a choice. toronto to heathrow my last flight with british airways. checkin and security efficient and quick  lounge was fine and the food provided for preflight dinner was tasty and perfectly adequate. departure about 45 minutes late but this time was made up with a 5hr 55 min trip. cabin comfort and service pretty much the norm for british airways business class  no storage around the seat and the ife screen did not work as usual. breakfast has improved slightly  the fruit was varied and edible croissants warm but the bacon and egg muffin was unfortunately cold. arrival processes fine. i travelled from vancouver to lisbon with a connection in london on january 9th 2016. our flight was late  which does happen  however we had a to run to catch our connector flight resulting in our luggage not following us  upon arrival in lisbon no luggage. we were told our luggage by the local luggage handlers who contacted british airways would be on the next flight 3.5 hours later  we were given the option of waiting or have it delivered to our place of residence. we had no option but wait since the keys to our residence were in the luggage. 3.5 hours we came to claim our luggage and only 2 pieces out of 3 showed up. again going through the local baggage handlers they now informed us that our remaining luggage would now be shipped the next morning 14 hours later  again they gave us the option of delivering the luggage unfortunately our keys were inside. we had no choice but stay in a hotel in lisbon and wait. i was disappointed but understand things dont go as planned sometimes. we contacted british airways upon our return to inform them of the experience. the response was less than friendly this is why my review. they replied saying they are not responsible for any luggage. really when i purchase my tickets i got an email to make sure that luggage specification on luggage allowed by the airline in question. my understanding with our ticket purchase in piece of luggage no more than 23 kgs per passenger and 1 carry on. where did i go wrong. first time my partner and i have flown british airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from london heathrow to cape town. i booked the flights several months before and had to pay 40 to preselect our seats both ways 160. on both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. attempts by staff to reboot the system failed so i had to cope with two 12hour flights with no entertainment. on the flight out my table was broken. when i raised this with the crew i was told that a previous passenger must have bounced a child on it. dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. there was only congealed egg and bacon. when asked if i could have a continental equivalent all i got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. the plane looked generally tired. we had to share one inflight magazine between us. the pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. my partners entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat. i certainly wouldnt pay bas rate for premium economy again. british airways from manchester to rio de janeiro via heathrow. werent invited to the lounge at man due to a rather arrogant check in agent. the concord lounge at lhr has seen better days  ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic so left it champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. nuts were pleasant. seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. first choice of food not available which is unacceptable in first. then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. we ended being split up partner on row 4 me on row 2 nice start to our honeymoon thanks ba. cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. staff upgrades are commonplace on ba in first and the cabin had by my reckoning 5 paying passengers and id say about 4 staff upgrades all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate. these mates of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. personally id have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat but ba seem to think its acceptable for staff to travel in first. if youre on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade id say youre chances are pretty remote unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight a pretty poor experience all round which proves that the once worlds favourite airline has become so complacent that they cant even get it right in first class. is it any wonder the middle east carriers are showing the rest of the world how to do it glad i have the option to rate them a zero. their customer service is abysmal.  was flying home from amsterdam with my family. booked on premium economy which was around 700 pp higher than economy. the night before my early morning flight i received a text saying flight was cancelled. went to the airport. no ba employees were there. could not get ba on the phone. woman from another airline booked us on delta in regular economy. have spent since august trying to get a refund of the 700 pp extra i paid for premium economy. finally got the refund. was 149 pp with no explanation. customer service people are very sorry but they cant help me. there is no higher level to take this to. i had to go on a separate form to request the breakdown to see how they calculated the refund. i expect more out of british airways but i will never fly them again. gatwick to cancun return. my first time using british airways and it will be my last. my main issues were the dreadful cabin crew. the were rude and poorly turned out.  i was unimpressed in the standard of the cabin it was dingy and tired looking.  flight got off to a good start with a reasonable dinner in the malaysian airlines first class lounge. i was looking forward to my first flight on the boeing 787   so much so i switched from singapore  lhr to kl when i discovered the 7879 operated on this route. the new plane is very nice indeed  the so called new  new first is not. ba trumpet they have listened to customers and this revised version was to be the new pace setter. wrong. the fas on the route were great and dinner was adequate. the chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad was fine. the wine was also fine. the cheap champagne nowhere near to krug as served by other carriers in 1st class. the usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware  we have to get used to. the seat is definitely more constrained than the 777 and a380 1st class its tighter and smaller. in bed mode  it is like sleeping on a park bench. so hard. the ridiculous island design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the 777 and a380. when lying on your side it digs into your back. the seats narrow profile becomes very obvious. you have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the compartment. i am 6 4 tall and not overweight. i did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the a380 flight i took to singapore last month. the tv screen is larger and fixed  which does not lend itself to a companion dinning with you as on the other aircraft. its on a slight angle as well slightly facing away from the viewer. the av remote is small and overly complicated. there is no wifi. there is no window blinds as on the other aircraft. the windows can be dimmed to black  so you have two black orbs staring at you through the flight. ba seem clueless when it comes to a top end 1st class. i will avoid this plane in future. a jaw dropping disappointment. london heathrow to vancouver with british airways. outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. email was received on the day of travel. it did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. on the first call there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. fortunately we were cut off as i think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. second call was more successful and a direct answer was given no matter how unwelcome. printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at lhr i am not a frequent air traveller. a sign of the times perhaps but i did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. not much to say about bag drop off. it was neither efficient nor inefficient just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. the young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by friday. at the gate i did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area  all of 3 metres away. i suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices because they will of course get there first the flight was just about adequate. my video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified  well i was ignored. fortunate as the film and tv choice was poor.  i do not like airline food that much. there are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. never really drink the wine. beer and spirits hard to get wrong. return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. again the flight was just about adequate. did not eat the food as i had a salad from an outlet at yvr  good value. flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. the seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. the only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit and stand at the back. whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front she did not want to be reasonable. the attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution.  recently flew back from jfk to lhr and not the greatest flight ive ever been on. the seats were uncomfortable poor leg room for long haul  electrical box under seat infront unedible food. poor selection of onboard entertainment. the only good thing about my flight was the staff my outbound flight was booked with ba but operated by american airlines  so much better london heathrow to amsterdam. full load flight 30 mins delay economy pax carry on lugagage squashed in club cabin overhead bins and upsetting a lot of club pax. purser did not care. no flight tracking system on this new looking aircraft. seating in club cabin is more like easyjet nowadays. very cramped. no reason to fly british airways club in the future and they have lost my business until aircraft configuration and service improve. bucharest to london heathrow and the worst thing above all are the british airways business class seats and the shocking lack of legroom. cramped into a space which is less than many economy seats. and this was club europe poor breakfast  one slice of bacon half tomato a few tinned mushrooms and an omelette so overcooked it was grey inside. seat itself was comfortable and staff were good. toilet waste bin had tape around it and so a sack was used for rubbish instead not a good flight overall. gatwick to marrakech. the british airways lounge at the airport has been closed for some time and therefore they are sharing the paid for no 1 lounge. its overcrowded me and my family couldnt get in to use it. the check in staff apologised about it so they clearly know the problem. ba should inform the customer prior to booking that they are not able to provide the full service. british airways customer services response was to inform me of their future plans not very helpful. i would not recommend flying business class short haul out of gatwick. save your money and fly with someone else. flight from heathrow to chicago  delayed over three hours with a litany of excuses for boeing 747400 going tech faulty smoke alarm in toilet catering truck damaged fuselage door engineers couldnt correct fault. ba would not let us off the flight. captain came to first class and answered questions which was a nice personal touch. when we finally got going food and cabin service were very mediocre. ba first class seat is a very very poor product and entertainment screen slow. iadlhr return on the a380 in first class. the a380 is a wonderful aircraft woefully let down by the poor ba first class seats and service the seats are barely business class by modern standards and the dinner service was inelegant and almost inedible. crew on return were impersonal and keen to get the dinner service over. finally ba customer relations based in india responded to the 3 hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. they also dont appear to have a good grasp of english. overall the endtoend experience with ba was poor and evidently they dont care. it is far far short of a first class experience. this is what you get with a quasimonopoly to the usa from london. the only merit was the superb a380. let us hope ba replace their aged boeing 747400 with this aircraft but in doing so improve the terrible seat configuration of first and club class. stockholm to london heathrow was not a pleasant experience. british airways has a good way of reminding you that youre flying cattle class. the interior was tired and worn and the seat was hard. the legroom was inadequate for a shorthaul flight. the cabin service was variable while some were courteous others practically barked at you. one steward even tapped me and gestured me for a refill.  on the bright side there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol. i have had the fortune of sitting in front of three very loud and progressively intoxicated ladies who pressed for the stewardess for more alcohol every 10 minutes on the flight  requests promptly obliged. perhaps i should have taken the advantage of this generosity to make the flight more bearable. london to helsinki return. check in at t3 quick as was fast track security. i visited the ba lounge in t3 which is nice and used by other oneworld airlines apart from being packed there was very limited food on offer at 10am. boarding was slow and done by bus to a remote stand onboard the seated in 1a with a fee seat next to me. i was looking forward to something decent to eat due to the lack of food options in the lounge  unfortunately the food offered was pretty basic to say the least. the crew where friendly which i guess was something. arriving in helsinki on time to another remote stand and bus transfer bags where off quickly despite any priority tagging. check in for the return was quick security a little slow but once through i headed for the finnair lounge which was packed with no seating. i managed to find a seat in a computer booth have a coffee and check my emails. boarding was awful with no priority and once again a 10 minute bus ride on a packed bus to then stand in the freezing cold and sleet for a further 10 minutes boarding via steps. after a delayed 1hr departure service began with a drink followed by another very basic meal of 3 half sandwiches and a scone. crew were okay and kept passengers updated on the delayed arrival. finally arrived 1 hr late but with the luxury of an airbridge. bags off quickly which was good. otherwise a business class on a 3hr flight with no in seat power economy seating with middle seat blocked. standard food offered in economy on other airlines. there is no class in bas european business class anymore. added to the poor downgrading of the ba frequent flier scheme its a no brainer for me.  london heathrow to moscow. i have been flying to moscow with british airways for a few years now today i flew to moscow and the long haul aircraft boeing 747  boeing 767 have now been replaced by the a321 which is not as enjoyable and the seats are very uncomfortable. what disappointed me the most was the meal which was served it is a four hour flight from london to moscow and all they served was a cheese sandwich and a kit kat i would have thought that on a flight of this length there would be a hot meal. the majority of the flight attendants were also very good at not making eye contact either which was disappointing too. as a gold frequent flyer i would expect a much higher level of service it is a shame there there are not other airlines flying direct to moscow as i would be using these in the future. british airways has completely terrible customer service. i paid extra to fly ba instead of one of the cheaper airlines assuming some sort of quality of experience. the flight is more than 2 hours delayed with no reasoning and they refuse to book customers on another flight that has room on it and is departing earlier because it is closed and willing to make the customer miss their connecting flight instead of finding a solution to a problem. people are extremely rude dont provide any information to customers and dont provide any sort of solution to make the experience any better. avoid this airline at all costs if possible unless you have a lot of free time and patience. miami to london heathrow with british airways and not overly happy with the experience. the a380 is an impressive jet but despite paying the extra for premium economy the seats are like torture. it is impossible to get comfortable so sleep is not just elusive but impossible. didnt feel that the premium economy experience was of any great value. staff attentive and food reasonable. my first long haul flight with british airways for some years and what a mistake i flew premium economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially lufthansa or virgin atlantic  not so at all. at the airport it took over 1 hour to checkin there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either perhaps the plane would be a little special no not at all it was an old boeing 777 that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 242 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. stupidly i had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. how wrong i was  avoid british airways on the hong kong route if you are flying on a boeing 777. my advise is to check the plane type before booking or you will suffer an expensive 13 hour flight reminiscent of over 20 years ago sydney to london heathrow via singapore and our first foray into british airways business class club world was not a success. flat bed was made up of a hinged flap and it was over this flap that the inside passenger had to clamber. in my case he was a large passenger who had heavy shoes which had heavy heels. i am sure he tried to be careful his leading heel edge hit my exposed ankle bone hard. the food was atrocious  the breakfast omelette was grey and inedible. as breakfast was served late it proved impossible to request a second cup of tea or coffee. the early morning hours snack was composed of doorstep sandwiches with little or no filling. the staff tried hard and i had water brought to me as i asked for it. but i had to find someone to replace used toilet rolls paper towels and mop up the lavatory floor. not expected in business class. uncomfortable flight and never to be repeated by us. philadelphia to london heathrow and return both in new cabin. british airways has degraded its economy product to the point where us airline companies may actually offer a better service. on the 777 ba has removed the toilets in the rear to cram in more seats causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. the new economy seating feels incredibly camped the food on offer is of poor quality and of increasingly smaller portions and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for lowcost fares  i just dont see any reason to continue to fly this airline. i also find it ridiculous that ba charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance making me have to stress out about checking in on time while on vacation to ensure that i can snap up whatever good seat is left by that time. my next trip to europe has been booked with american and i am already seeing a difference  i was able to choose a regular seat for free at the time of booking and i will accrue the full amount of miles that i am actually flying. although all ba staff were incredibly courteous and competent on this trip that does not make up for the current sad state of the economy product. bye bye ba. singapore to london heathrow with british airways in premium economy and abysmal priority boarding. no pre take off drinks. ran out of wine bottle drinks and also ran out of meal choices. seat was truly dreadful. i had to climb over the armrest to get out. the person behind played games by stabbing at the screen for 14 hours. complaints department dont care and i am still waiting for my miles to be credited. austin to london heathrow. i spent a considerable amount of time in jan and feb booking these seats and i had to pay over 70 for the privilege. ba systems were not working properly and i had to get phone help  to find the cause but at the 15th attempt i managed to book the seats. i like a window seat mid cabin in a number that divides by 3. our flight was called i went to the gate with people behind me. the bar code on the bag drop issued boarding pass wouldnt scan. he asked his colleague who had other boarding passes that still wouldnt scan. his other colleague thought it might be my passport and went off to check. i made the point that i had been in the airport three hours so if there was something wrong surely they could have contacted me the colleague came back. the bar codes still wouldnt scan and i heard one of them say they are already through. i said i had booked a window seat for hubby and hoped the new one was. he said they were but by their numbers i could see they werent. got on board. there was someone already in those seats i found an attendant who went off and found us two seats. no window across the aisle from the loo. so all night we heard the loo flushing and got bumped by people waiting and falling about due to turbulence. that would be why they were free.  i did look to where my booked seats were. there was a family of five in that row that obviously wanted to be together. so though i was in a different bit of the cabin that might have been premium economy as i was offered a hot flannel and some warm fizzy win in a plastic glass i was certainly not upgraded. doesnt matter if you pay for seat reservations 6 weeks in advance. if somebody comes along later theyll turf you into cattle class. and to think i stopped using ryanair    istanbul to london heathrow with british airways. the main reason i pay to travel business class is to get extra leg room. bas club europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in economy which may be okay for a quick hop to paris but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight. it was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1  the only row with reasonable leg room. service was fine and the food quite good but no entertainment at all. from now on ill book economy and pay for exit seats  its a nobrainer. either that or fly turkish airlines an airline which is going from strength to strength.\\r\\r\\n    we have flown with british airways over 100 times usually in business class. on our current ski trip we paid a substantial premium to fly one way in first and home from london to denver in business class. yesterday our flight was cancelled due to snow. this of course is not their fault. after spending nearly an hour on hold to their gold card premium service line we were told that all the flights are full so they cannot help. we are not authorised to help with this on the telephone you have to drive to the airport and ask beg the airport staff to consider using a different carrier to help get you home  for a long planned family easter holiday. the true test of a company is not when things are going well it is what they do when there is a problem. ba.com have been truly appalling. the email cancelling our flight did not even include a phone number to call for rebooking.    gatwick to amsterdam in business class was truly the most uncomfortable flight of my life. i thought that with british airways i might expect something a little better  what a stupid mistake. the business class seats are standard economy class with middle seat empty. food for breakfast was okay although not enough if you were hungry. but luckily they provide champagne during the flight. phl to lhr and return both in new cabin. british airways has degraded its economy product to the point where us airline companies may actually offer a better service. on the 777 ba has removed the toilets in the rear to cram in more seats causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. the new economy seating feels incredibly cramped the food on offer is of poor quality and of smaller portions and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for lowcost fares  i just dont see any reason to continue to fly this airline. i find it ridiculous that ba charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance making me have to stress out about checking in on time while on vacation to ensure that i can snap up whatever good seat is left by that time. my next trip to europe has been booked with american  i was able to choose a regular seat for free at the time of booking and i will accrue the full amount of miles that i am actually flying. although ba staff were courteous and competent on this trip that does not make up for the current sad state of the economy product.  miami to manchester via london heathrow with british airways. the aircraft was very old and dated and too hot with no airconditioning above the seat. food was disgusting  some type of chicken mashed up with potato and peas. these 747 aircraft need to be updated or retired as they are now showing their age. tv screens are so small and have no usb or power points. outbound flight was with american airlines that was so much better. new aircraft good entertainment and food with was good. now that you have to change terminals at lhr when connecting from miami there is no advange of flying ba. so if you can choose a different airline or if you have to fly ba avoid the 747. the a320 on the domestic flight to manchester was very comfy and looked so much better. british airways in my mind is fast approaching a national tragedy. as one who has flown them onoff for 35 years i suggest i am qualified to have a view  having travelled in all cabins including concorde. we flew club europe from london heathrow to pisa and back this last week over the easter break. we have a home in italy and fly the route often. flight out started in the north executive lounge at lhr. it was not busy and was ok. terrible choice of unhealthy bacon baps and similar rolls stuffed with whatever. i had some fruit  tinned fruit. plane was a newish plane and the so called new club europe. three seats  with the middle one as a table. tables are usually in front of one  not to the side. zero legroom unless you are in row 1. last month i flew the regional business class on singapore airlines malaysian airlines and vietnam airlines. needless to say  british airways does not come close when it comes to seat comfort. disgraceful. food okay on both flights. fas on both flights were also fine. the curtain separating the club cabin from economy was broken hence we had queues for the wc stretching into the club cabin.its long overdue  but ba need some serious management changes to build value into their key products. st lucia to london gatwick in premium economy on 30th march and i had the worst flight i have had for some time on british airways. no newspaper inedible curry chicken no wine no coffee. breakfast again was inedible and no coffee. inflight entertainment awful with old films on very small screen. oxygen levels very low with many passengers complaining of headaches etc. staff not interested yet as usual british airways employees sneak into business class and seemed to get a reasonable service as usual you say never use them again on this route but very little choice as only competition is virgin and they are not that good either. compared to airlines like emirates qantas air new zealand etc ba have much to learn. have used thomsons to barbados and mauritius in premium club section on the boeing 787 and it was a fantastic experience. great food service comfy seats and super in flight entertainment.    riyadh to dusseldorf via heathrow with british airways. check in at riyadh was terrible broken baggage belts and staff explaining to passangers that there is an issue instead of fixing it. flight to lhr was smooth and with good service. lhr however was a disaster. priority security took forever and the gate agent was even worse. i have a trolley and handluggage as specified. first she started complaining about the trolley  surprise it was within size  then she looked at my laptop case which was 1 cm too large and made me check in the trolley  worst of all was her attitude in this. i feel that her customer bashing behavior definitely did not comply with the ba image and expectations from businesses class passengers.  i will search other options before choosing ba again.    british airways used to be better than this. i spent all afternoon in the business lounge waiting for my gatwick flight at 7pm. my boarding card said the gate closed at 1840 and when i hadnt heard any announcement by 1830 i asked the ba man at reception if there was a delay. i was very dismayed when he casually said yes about 1 hour 30 mins. i was very unhappy they had not told us earlier or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner. there was a time when ba would have tried to reroute its premium passengers but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this. he told me that if i wanted to switch to an earlier lhr or lcy flight i would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights. onboard i had my first experience of bas new club europe wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray to give the perception of more space without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom. from my experiences of ba business class in both long and short haul over the past year it is very sad to see that ba is focussing on making changes which make it more money rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience. my meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was and it wasnt at all tasty. but a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into so that i could hold on to it on approach to lgw. that was a very nice touch i hadnt been offered before on any airline ive flown with. marseilles to montreal via london. what i got from british airways so far 3 flights 3 delays for a cumulated time of 5 hour and 15 minutes. because of a 2 hours and 35 minutes delay in montreal they made me miss my connection in london. they booked me on another flight which made me wait a further 4 hours in london instead of 2 hours. now back to montreal from marseille my flight is delayed one more time. i am not what you would call a happy customer.    this flight from copenhagen to london heathrow was british airways but operated by jet time who are operating some ba services on the lhrcph route this summer. the aircraft was definitely not up to ba standards  old very worn inside. cabin service i cannot comment on as fortunately i had 3 seats together so slept most of the flight. i really hope this is a temporary move on bas part as this really is not the standard i have come to expect from them on this route. manchester to los angeles via heathrow with british airways. pre paid for emergency exit seats for our flight and was allocated these at check in. 45 minutes later when trying to board flight we were stopped and told we were now at the back of the plane with our tickets given to ba staff who were sitting comfortably. it transpires we have to contact ba ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. this sums up british airways now as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they arent provided with and then ba making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money customer service is non existent. other than this all 4 flights we took were late our son was given child meals we hadnt booked the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting one of the seats was broke on a new a380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats. an internal virgin america flight we took had more space and more comfortable seating than bas a380. i cannot find anything positive to say about them.    cancelled a british airways flight to gibraltar within cooling off period they advised refund takes 24 hrs. many calls later still no refund. promised on 11 april would get refund within 72 hours. as of 15 april ba cant say when will be refunded. payment due 17 april  for replacement ba flight booked after first flight was cancelled and need refund to pay balance. ba dont care holding 353 and wont say when it will be refunded. loyal customer for 28 years. appalling customer service and ba say if payment due on 17th april not made for replacement booking it will be cancelled and i will lose 150 deposit despite the fact they are keeping 353 of my money and have lied repeatedly as to when it will be refunded. ba flights are now a nightmare last 3 flights travelled on were delayed due to hand baggage only passengers marauding up and down the aisle trying to stuff oversize hand luggage into overhead lockers with no care or consideration for other passengers possessions. captain had to announce unless people sat down and allowed hand baggage to be placed in hold plane would be further delayed. british airways needs to decide whether it wants to be a no frills airline or not it is now worse than ryanair or easyjet. not a pleasant experience to fly ba anymore. despite having problems of one type or another on nearly every booking made with ba in the last few years continued to be loyal to them but they do not appreciate customer loyalty despite their recorded customer services message claiming they want to maintain high standards after travel and wish to ensure a passenger flies with ba again they fail on all counts.    amsterdam to hong kong via london with british airways turned out to be one of the most exhausting trips i have made. i had high expectations of the a380 flight with new aircraft. the opposite was true. seats were very uncomfortable service was very poor attendants rushed and food was horrible. leg space was poor. it was the last time for me to travel with ba.    london heathrow  nairobi kenya. boeing 777 not new but clean. departed on time. food was very average and was served at 11.30 am as a lunch  bland and uninteresting. cabin crew very quick and efficient but then ran away for most of the flight so that they could get the service over as quickly as possible. an hour before landing they reappeared again with cardboard boxes with a chicken sandwich a drink and that was it. you sometimes wonder whether british airways check the quality of the offers made by other airlines or whether it is just customer loyalty that keeps them flying. nairobi arrival was a nightmare as my electronic visa had a page not dowloaded and this resulted in an extra hour and a half with immigration before it was sorted out.\\r\\r\\n    left nairobi more or less on timehad to wait for a thunderstorm to pass before take off. premium economy seat is better than economy in that there is more leg room. flight was packed and the 777 was subdivided into first club business premium economy and economy  not sure whether all these subdivisions are really necessary  it would have been better to provide customers with a more modernnewer aircraft instead of an older 777 with all these seating alternatives that look rather dated. food was average choice between grilled steak and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out cake as a dessert. cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way as quickly as possible. it was a night flight and they disappeared until 1 hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast  a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful dry cereal bar. arrived on time and immediately went for a coffee and a snack at the airportwhich of course should have been served as a breakfast on the flight. british airways needs to wake up and check what other airlines offer on the same flight.    vancouver to barcelona via heathrow with british airways. i would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews ive taken time to write in my life were positive ones choosing to ignore negativity. this however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that im taking time to write this before weve even completed our round trip with british airways to be more direct im writing this on our final connector flight to barcelona. on february 24th 2016 i purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from vancouver canada to barcelona spain. this was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a barcelona fc match. even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  april 16th 1 day before our trip i receive a email labeled updated travel itinerary. when i opened the email our flights no longer included our flight from vancouver to barcelona actually they only had a return flight from barcelona on april 27th. as i had got home late on april 16th from cuba i couldnt contact anyone until early morning of april 17th my fiances birthday. convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been cancelled. we tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and i follow on the 18th which as an engaged couple makes no sense. we decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. this began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read submitting for roughly 3060 minutes each time never one actually submitting. we decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at yvr. the agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. she put a note on our file that an agent from jacksonville ba had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. we asked for an upgrade on our seats that wasnt available to us. we asked for access to the ba lounge while we waited we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. after a very uncomfortable flight to heathrow we spoke to an agent there who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses which unfortunately still wouldnt get us the day we missed back. she went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. that was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. while we snacked on a 14 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats. we are now trying to make jokes out of the fact of if we will ever get home. doha to london via bahrain with british airways and a very poor lounge in doha. even flying first class on ba there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent qatar airways lounge. instead there is a lounge for all other airlines. on boarding my wife and i were ushered to our seats. and to our amazement our individual lockers were opened by the flight attendants who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coats or jackets as is standard practice on even business class. no hot towels before take off or landing very average menu and as we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast. told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not be prepared both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the crew were delivered without spoons to eat the very soggy muesli. orange juice tropics a quality. we had to ask for marmalade with our toast. all the crew displayed little perception of customer needs made the more marked by qatar airways business class crew who were absolutely excellent on the earlier sydney to doha flight. poor food very poor crew awareness or attention to detail who seemed to be going through the motions. slightly aloof. way below the 3 gulf majors in flight attention. however bed was very good as you would expect. amenity kit below the qatar airways business class kit and a joke in comparison to qatars first class kit. very agreeable cabin and seats but crew performance at economy class performance. would avoid again. london to johannesburg and i decided this time to fly with british airways given they fly there with the a380. i was quite looking forward to the experience of flying business class on the upper deck of the a380. i neednt have bothered. following an uneventful few hours in the galleries lounge it was time to board straight onto the upperdeck. my business colleagues before me passed through the gate without problem however i was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card  just a moment sir oh it looks like youve been approved for an upgrade to first which is on the lower deck  no sorry my mistake  youre still in business upstairs but im afraid weve had to move you from your selected seat the one id paid the not inconsiderable sum of 80 to reserve in advance by the way  but not to worry its still a window seat. except it wasnt  it was seat 50a a windowless seat next to the toilets. the journey itself was uneventful. the food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. the wine was very good. entertainment system not bad though not a patch on the likes of emirates. the staff friendly and efficient enough and i managed to sleep a few hours. i wrote to ba to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadnt. i had to chase up twice for a reply. the one i eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change peoples seats for operational needs the biggest issue for me with bas club world however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each others legs  i dont know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves ba well behind the competition. although not my favourite airline ba could do worse than take a note of their partners iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. the situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. cant help but think that ba have missed a real opportunity to shake things up with their new fleet of a380s. whilst some airlines have been creative and had onboard bars lounges and showers ba has just packed in as many seats as possible – there are 7 abreast in club world upstairs and 8 downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. i should have known better having flown on one of bas other new additions to its fleet last year a boeing 787 to toronto which also was extremely claustrophobic. i returned home from south africa upstairs on a boeing 747 from cape town to london. the plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant. this journey ironically took me up to silver membership i wont be choosing to fly longhaul with ba again however unless i have to. there are far better alternatives out there.    i am writing to complain about my deeply distressing british airways flight from london heathrow  cape town with a change at johannesburg. the flight was badly managed throughout. when i arrived at heathrow i was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. she eventually found it she then said oh im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight. i was obviously distressed by this as imagined i would have to return back to dorset however after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat. i arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to johannesburg. however we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport. in this time there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane. once on the plane again we waited and waited and waited  and eventually we were told that sorry for the inconvenience but ba did not have enough time to the the engineering works or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day. so we were extremely late in setting off from heathrow. i think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. i was concerned about catching my next flight from johannesburg to cape town. the flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of ba ground staff to help us all when we arrive at johannesburg. however this could not have been further from the truth. once landed there were no british airways staff present  except for one lady in a high vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to run to the next gate for the flight. she then pointed at a man he was wearing no uniform saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. we literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip i gave him 5 but was extremely suprised that i would have to tip someone who supposedly ba advised me to go withonce getting to the gate and just in time the lady at comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets and rudely shouted at me as to why did you leave your luggage by this point i had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. she then told us to just go back with no further help. luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the ba check in desk to ask for new tickets to cape town. once at the ba deskthey were not helpful in the slightest. they simply told me to go and get my luggage from a menzies which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. i ran too and fro the menzies lost luggage to the comair and ba office  back and forth for around 2 hours. no staff were helpful even though i was crying and feeling completely bewildered.     rome to london heathrow with british airways and the flight itself was efficient and ontime. comfortable seat nice entertainment. but the ground service was terrible  we were the first flight of the day and the clerks at the counter arrived to find 2030 of us standing in queue. they got their stuff ready to work sat in their chairs then just sat their and ignored us for 15 minutes or so. the cabin crew didnt win any awards for friendliness either  they did their job but i wont say much more. the food served was adequate at best. this was my second time flying british airways and i have not been impressed either time. there are better choices.    i usually do not have a problem with british airways but my flight from london heathrow to toronto on 23rd april was the worst flight i have been on. they said a 10 minute delay which turned out to be a 6 hour delay and they also kept changing the gate number. they only gave us a 5gbp which you had to spend in the same shop. and on top of this our bags were lost along with 90 of the planes. this was very inconvenient as we have no clothes and arrived at 400am.    travelled british airways from manchester to dubai return via heathrow with family. the outbound flight was a night service and dinner was served at 1am. the children didnt eat as they were fast asleep but the food was nothing special – supermarket ready meal standard. leg room was horrific and it truly felt like cattle class. on the return flight the seats were worn and old screens were old and scratched the children werent given their choice of meals as they had run out my three year old was given snack a box containing nuts my husband sitting next to her was asleep i was in the row behind and quickly took it away as shes allergic. i could go on but you get the picture. the man sat next to me didnt get any food on a 7hr plus flight – he was vegetarian and they had run out of pasta. from my experience i wont fly or recommend british airways anymore. the days of glory are long gone.    london to philadelphia. having booked business class and paid the non refundable fee british airways would not let me check in on line. when i reached terminal 5 they bumped me due to overbooking. they offered me a downgrade that i could not accept for health reasons. if they had told me they were overbooked when i tried to check in online i could have rerouted via new york and still arrived in time for an important meeting. as it was i arrived 7 hours late and missed my meeting. british airways only cares about maximising its profits. it cares nothing for its passengers. i have been a loyal customer of ba for over 50 years. for many years i was a gold card holder and this is how they treat me. they sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after i had paid the full and non refundable fare. they used to be good. their strapline the worlds favourite airline was not far from the truth. no longer they are rapidly becoming the worlds least favourite airline    berlin to philadelphia via london heathrow. ive traveled with british airways many times and always thought it was a decent airline and preferred it for my trips back to philadelphia over some of the other airlines. however this last trip has changed my mind and i will no longer fly with ba. we were given misprinted tickets for our connecting flight in lhr which led to us missing our flight  despite showing our tickets to several ba employees. we rushed to the gate printed on our tickets where the woman at the counter informed us our flight was departing from a10 the terminal where we had just come from. we had to run with all our carryon luggage and winter clothing the distance the train normally takes you upon reaching a10 we saw its actually subdivided in sections a10 a b c etc. this caused even more confusion  at first it took us the wrong way. of course when we finally found the correct gate the flight was already gone. the ba employee at the gate apologized and told us to require to be rebooked because the problem was the fault of his colleague. at the customer service counter they also admitted the mistake and pointed it out to a colleague who also agreed they had never seen this kind of error before. another woman in line behind us had the same issue and missed the same flight for the same reason. the customer service woman did her best for us and gave us new tickets but for a much later flight and advised us write you in order to follow it up. when we did try to follow it up i was sent a response that was clearly cut and pasted with errors and typos and did not address the issue of my complaint. i tried to call a few times to speak to an agent in person but ended up waiting for close to an hour and having to pay several euros. customer service was terrible and i cant imagine how it would have been if there was a more serious issue. aside from this the flights were cramped and the entertainment system was outdated  small screen with a poor selection and you have to hit your finger hard against the screen to get it to work. not to mention the beginning of our flight way back until after the food was served the system was outoforder. the last complaint is about the airline food. as a vegetarian normally i like bas food but this time it was a joke. my special meal consisted of considerably less food than my boyfriend who had the regular meal. the pasta was one of the worst ive had on flight and when breakfast came around i got a recycled fruit cup from my dinner while everyone else received a full box of food it was so bad it was comical. completely unimpressed with british airways. they lost my luggage on a  flight from dublin to london. when i informed them they did not apologise but assured me i would have my bag by that afternoon. i was lucky my air bnb provided me with a towel and toiletries. i had not heard from them by 6pm and was told to wait until they contacted me. i then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. so i specifically stayed home that night and finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep. i woke up and called british airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as i got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. they said to call the courier company. i then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that late at night. they then said the driver had a late night so wouldnt arrive until lunch time that day. so i went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. i then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. i called to see if i could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way. they said no and that i would have to wait at my apartment for two hours and to call at 6pm if my bag had not arrived. this was ridiculous. i am so lucky my air bnb hosts supplied me with towels and a toothbrush and that i had money to go out and buy clothes for the day. so unimpressed with british airways and their disorganisation with my bag.  i understand bags are lost but to be told that it was coming at three different times and also the fact that british airways decided it had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company was a joke. they were the ones who lost the bag in the first place on a 50 minute flight with no transfers. i flew to lhr t5 on british airways with a connecting flight on avianca to bogota from terminal 2. the staff at paris airport refused to checkin my piece of luggage on the continuing avianca flight because i had not booked that ticket with ba. i had bought 2 separate tickets. i realized that this would result in having to collect my luggage at t5 go through passport control then go to terminal 2 by underground as there was a problem with heathrow express. when i pointed out to the ba staff the impact this would have they said it was my fault for booking 2 separate tickets and avianca are not part of oneworld like ba but in star alliance.    i was looking forward to trying the new 787 from british airways flying from kuala lumpur to london. the economy seat was a bit tight and the main niggle was the entertainment box at the base of the seat which hampered me from fully extended my legs. as a result i had a swollen ankle as a result of the awkward position after this long flight. cabin crew service was lacklustre and when i asked a passing crew to fill my water bottle her reply was i am busy right now without offering any followup. food was unappetising and presentation was awful. there was no rounds of drinks offered during the long flight other than the 2 meal services. entertainment system was adequate but selection cant match what is offered by other competitors.\\r\\r\\n london gatwick to amsterdam. i was bumped off this british airways flight as a result of a change of plane to an a319 i gather. the process was not well handled and it appeared that some staff andor standby passengers were given priority although others also missed out i understand. the main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was lastminute confirmation of offloading which left us short of time to take another flight a poor process for transferring airports i had to bus from gatwick to heathrow and poor followup when i queried matters afterwards. ba refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised repeatedly citing privacy. i checked with a friend whos a uk privacy legal specialist and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby so it appears to be a refusal by ba to respond. i also raised the transfer with ba as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket which meant i missed a transfer bus. better to issue a ticket or a voucher that can be used on any service that day with ba to arrange it so with the bus company. on the positive side i was compensated per the rules and did make a ba flight later that day which was ok. nonetheless this could have been handled much more smoothly and im afraid british airways customer service on the ground and in followup let them down.    accra to london heathrow. sadly british airways has gone downhill. to start the plane was dirty excessive hand luggage allowances meant delays to boarding the food was awful leg room was non existent im only 56 subzero temperatures during the flight and an inadequate ratio of toilets to passengers left me very uncomfortable. the positives were that staff were friendly and courteous under difficult circumstances and they didnt bother forcing us to endure the safety walk through. for a 6 hour direct flight at just over 500 this was the cheapest i could find. provided you eat before you fly restrict your water intake wrap up very warm and take your own tabletereader then it will be fine. but its more a no frills airlineservice and id rather fly with easyjet any day. london heathrow to miami return with british airways. delay outbound and back with poor communication of both. told of a delay which was extended once we reached the gate and on the return journey and then again once on the plane. service on the return journey seemed like stewards were going through the motions rather than worried about the level of service. i does seem that the british airways flights to miami and back to london heathrow have very poor punctuality when alternative airlines dont have the same issue. inflight entertainment on inbound flight not fully working after a reeboot which was done because some passengers had no service for the first hour.    oslo to london heathrow. check in was chaotic and ground staff had no idea about check in no information about lounge access transfer etc. im emerald frequent flyer with british airways. seat is usual economy seat its a joke they sell this product as business class. no entertainment and a disgraceful meal on business class. service was very fast. overall experience in this flight was no any better than economy class  its a complete joke they call this product business class  you just waste your money.    london heathrow to newark. two evenings prior to my flight i used british airways android app to reserve extended legroom seats for my wife and me. at the time advance reservation of regular seats was 51 and 59 for frontsection extended legroom seats. i had no interest in reserving a regular seat i could wait until 24 hours before checkin for that but i was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats. so i paid the 118 for the two frontsection seats. when my wife and i boarded the craft lo and behold the seats were not frontsection seats at all i was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my android phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely apologizing to us offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of postflight. however subsequent to the flight british airways has been positively nasty in their response claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued true enough and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as frontsection when they were not. the fact that i received zero goods or services for my 118 beyond what i was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them. they have managed to bilk me out of 118 and having gotten their hands on my money they intend to keep it. well see what my credit card company has to say about this but it would be a lot smoother if we could simply settle this amicably rather than forcing me to dispute the charge with my credit card company. suffice it to say that my wife and i will not be flying ba again.  gatwick to funchal. what has happened to ba club europe you used to get wider seats and more leg room than economy. not any more. same seats as economy but with middle seat blocked. breakfast ok but not brilliant. staff were good and i enjoyed the champagne but was it worth paying for club class no it wasnt. we were lucky and got row 2 by the food galley which meant extra legroom but that was more luck than design. i wouldnt fly club europe again unless i was guaranteed this seat but to get it i would have to pay 18 per person each way on top of the club fares. total rip off ba. before we flew i was going to book british airways to bangkok. based on this experience though ill stick to eva air. additionally the club lounge at gatwick was dire. no seats available on arrival cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to ba and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge. the tables were also filthy. second time in 10 days on this flight from london heathrow to basel. what has happened to the leg room on british airways at 1m 80 my knees were against the seat in front. there used to be a good 34 inches of leg room. the food which ba proudly advertise consists of a very small sandwich. as usual the onboard staff are the saving grace. going downhill ba.    british airways have seriously gone downhill. there is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines  i would actually prefer easyjet and ryanair as at least they are transparent. this journey from lyon to london heathrow was chaotic and stressful. thanks to ba charging 30 to check in luggage one way every passenger takes cabin baggage. this means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. the boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out  i have honestly never seen anything like it. once on board they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldnt fit. passengers were arguing with one another 3 separate fights were witnessed and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. the meal service is a joke  a pathetic barely edible sandwich. as always with ba flights to and from lhr this flight was late. we ended up flying round and round over london for 30 mins. the worst thing is bas new policy of charging to select a seat  even at online check in opening 24 hours before. this means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay 12 just to change it to any normal seat and even more if extra legroom. bas new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way and charge more than other airlines in the process. a shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost. i will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible.   nassau to paris via london with british airways. flight was delayed 3 hours from nassau to london. no refreshments offered while waiting. boarded at 1100pm to leave at 100 am. 2 hours waiting in the aircraft with no entertainment available. staff were very polite and helped as much as they could. then arrived in london with 3 hours delay almost impossible to get information from rude staff at heathrow airport. were able to be put on the next flight to paris. then it took over an hour to go through security and we almost missed our flight. luckily flight was delayed 45 minutes so we caught it. when we arrived bags had not arrived and were delivered home the following day. since the connection took over an hour i called british airways to change my flight in 2 weeks since i have 1h10m to get to the second plane chances are i wont be able to catch it. i was told i would have to pay 150€ even though flight is 200€ cheaper compared to when i bought it and that i would most likely be put on the next plane to los angeles through american airlines. so i havent taken my flight that im kind of feeling i might be missing it. not very accommodating.    london heathrow to seoul incheon with british airways. good service from fas and a high quality screen for ife. but what a shame that otherwise british airways business class seats badly need updating. once a trail blazer british airways is now an alsoran. why didnt they ensure that the company took advantage of its new aircraft to bring its facilities up to date to make up at least some of the ground on the gulf and leading asian carriers flew british airways business class from london heathrow to santorini. the seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. no leg room and ba attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration ac and de. the problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. at least if the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. flight was full in business 9 rows taken up and quickly became stuffy. since this is an economy seat at a business price it is almost impossible to work out bas business strategy. will not fly on this leg again with ba and will take my custom to an alternate airline.    flew british airways london heathrow to warsaw for a long weekend. departure from lhr t3 was smooth although the terminal is crowded and dated. flight left on time and arrived on time. return 3 days later with a delay of an hour. on both lags of the journey the service was efficient and professional. a small pack of food and a full bar service was provided. the food was not of high quality. planes were clean and have the refitted interior. seat pitch was extremely tight  similar to that of easyjet. as i purchased a hand luggage only ticket ba charged 12 to change my seats even during the online check in process. i find this unacceptable for a full service airlines as i can even choose my seat with easyjet. i used to prefer ba for its service and seat comfort but nowadays it seems that ba is no different than a budget airline. its a shame as the service is always good milan malpensa to london heathrow with british airways. my return flight did not start well. 45 minutes queing to checkin. after that though the flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. thankfully there were seats by one of the overwing exits which were empty so i was asked if id move forward. i was happy to do so. like most european airlines food is minimal a small bun filled with chicken and bacon plus a dry cake with mocca flavoured icing. exactly the same snack was provided on the outbound flight. i avoided alchol and stuck with an orange juice. the aircraft was an old ex bmi model which id been on twice before so it lacks the new seating which is no bad thing. my checked bag arrived on the carousel 20 mins after landing just as i got there which was a bonus. all in all an ok flight but id seek alternatives in future if the prices and timings were similar. there are many negative reviews on this site  its almost embarrassing to admit to flying ba. i am adding another one. i have flown ba onof for 37 years. i guess that makes me qualified to write a review. my main gripe is the total lack of value for money. the erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. this flight from heathrow to barcelona and the return  accentuates the lack of value. barcelona flights operates out of terminal 3 at lhr. quite why ba use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. you walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point as we were  you end up running a panicked race to the gate. its worse on arrivals. immigration and passport control was a zoo.  the t3 business lounge is mediocre plastic tables and chairs. the most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. the seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. there was plenty of booze. flight left on time. the meal inflight i could not be bothered with. fas all fine. on the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. more comfortable than t3 at lhr. ageing plane. mediocre afternoon tea. frumpy fas who forgot to hand out our fast track tickets to help speed up through immigration. we got held up for half an hour.  on both flights we had to endure the silly club europe seats  basically two seats  with the middle seat closed down into a table. cramped leg room. definitely no value here. i only fly ba when i have to. it really needs a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make british airways a world leader  which right now they fail miserably to achieve in all their cabins. british airways from gatwick to catania sicily return as part of package tour of sicily. outward journey was very cramped staff were unhelpful and the light afternoon snack was served in a cardboard box. one round of drinks very hurriedly served. return flight was very similar but the staff were even worse snack literally thrown at us and passengers told not to move until rubbish collected. no inflight entertainment provided.    family of 4 adults flying british airways from bangkok to londonand i wished i had done my homework first regarding aircraft type. the only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but thats where it stops. the seat was old the footrest would not operate correctly. as a oneworld gold frequent flyer was able to get 1st row in premium economy. 2x2 by window. the pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long time. the food was probably the worst ive ever experienced the main meal comes from the business class menu not sure what happened in the galley but the steak was like concrete could not be eaten hence left behind noticed other passengers did the same. mid flight snack ok. light meal prior to landing was inedible a lasagna that just the look of it put me off. hence left behind. 12hrs 30min flight the catering is very average. we have now rebooked at a premium cost to fly back via kuala lumpur on the boeing 787 with the new premium product. interesting to see how that compares. would i recommend british airways crew wise yes actual product catering etc no. advice check which aircraft you are flying on.    every airline which offers business class travel will assign seats when booking the flight. the exception is british airways. in january 2016 i booked a flight for two passengers on ba in business class from san francisco to london and back for travel in mayjune. seats in business class are not assigned until 48 hours before flight time. however and here comes another ba first if you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee. i ended up shelling out 484  for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight. this on top of the steep fare charged for travel in business class. i dont begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactics as described in order to further maximize profitability i rebel.     london city to glasgow with british airways. outrageous red tape. flight delayed to glasgow so asked if i could go on the earlier flight no baggage etc. sorry madam there are empty seats but the time of sales has passed so we cannot put you on the earlier flight that leaves in 30 minutes. other airlines let you fly standby except for british airways. they delay a flight and wont switch you to an earlier flight that has space due to ridiculous red tape. this isnt the first time that this has happened. worst customer service ever  just pure laziness. anytime i have the option i will be flying a different airline.    my partner and i were flying from london heathrow to bombay in march and were due to catch an onward flight to goa. unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. the redirection meant that we arrived in bombay 3 hours late and wouldnt make our connecting flight. when we touched down in bombay the flight attendants said that ba ground staff would help us with missed flights connections etc and we should speak with them when we disembarked. on this advice we sought out uniformed ba ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. they advised us to exit the hall and find an airportbased travel agent and purchase new flights to goa. when we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that ba would definitely cover it and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. armed with this advice from ba staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. big mistake. since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. here is the reply we received from ba customer relations weve received a reply from mumbai whove investigated your case. the agent you spoke to cant specifically remember speaking to you personally. he did mention hed advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. he also mentioned ba wasnt responsible for any onward travel costs. this is an outright lie. i can only conclude that the ba staff member we spoke with in bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. either way british airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up. my husband and i flew to st lucia from london gatwick on 5th may 2016. this was the first time ive flown with british airways and it will also be the last. are british airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible this is certainly how it seems with the awful cabin service we experienced. our food was literally thrown at us with not a hint of a smile. the gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink to which she replied if you want another drink youll have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself as i have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drinks for you. strange as i thought they were there to help passengers. we thought we were just unlucky with this journey but sadly not as the return journey was pretty much the same. miserable unhelpful and downright rude cabin crew. very disappointed as i thought british airways would have a bit more class than this.    after a hiatus of almost 20 years the heathrow to inverness route was reinstated in may 2016. for the last few years travelling to inverness from geneva we have been using easyjet via gatwick so i thought it would be interesting to see how ba compares to its budget rival when travelling to the north of scotland. overall i would say not particularly favourably. bagdrop i checkedin online so just had to go through bagdrop. however with only one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passengers versus 3 agents for business passengers ba bagdrop in geneva was a slow and painful experience and slower than i have recently experienced with easyjet in geneva.  boarding in geneva was fairly smooth no better or worse than easyjet. inflight staff were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast of a ham and cheese croissant could best be described as awful a croissant in name only. given the price premium my overall opinion is that ba are not providing sufficiently better service in comparison to easyjet considering the price premium between the two airlines.    flew with british airways on a 7 hour flight from dubai to london in economy with the tiniest tv screen i have seen in the last 10 years. it was so small you had to squint most of the time to make out what was going on and the resolution was terrible and irritated the eyes. the screen had little crosses in it. this must have been an ancient plane. the movie selection was old given that i watched the same movies 2 months earlier. nothing that is currently in the cinema. we only had one meal and when we asked for additional food there were only snacks in form of chocolate bars and biscuits. we were also not allowed to have any sparkling wine which is ridiculous as they have it on tap in business class. the staff seemed irritated most of the time especially the lady in business class who welcomed us. very disappointing experience.  warsaw to heathrow and the check in is only open 2 hours before and i wanted to shop and eat. british airways is the only one that i could see that had such a late check in. dont bother with business class you wont gain much time on this flight making the lounge a waste of time. they need an earlier check in. wish id never upgraded. milan malpensa to london heathrow with british airways. 1.25 hrs standing in queue to check in due to new system installed last month running slow. so why no extra staff to cope with this plane then cancelled 30 mins after time due to technical issue. no systems in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done. everyone had to reclaim baggage exit via passport control and queue at service desk to rebook. unbelievably desk staffed by only one person. people with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be replanned but each of these took 10 to 15 mins to process with a line of 100 people waiting behind. thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue meaning that the queue was effectively not moving. over 3 hours later a third of the queue was still standing in line waiting to be processed. it was only the selfdiscipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos. why not two terminals so the onward travellers could be dealt with separately from those with simple needs why no seating and no queue management system pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem. then had to represent to recheckin again via their slow new system and go again through security mercifully top class and passport control for evening flight. those whod queued longest stayed in hotel to travel next day. no meal vouchers offered. no compensation details offered tho given when asked for.     we arrived at gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to st lucia. check in was fine and although security was tight we were airside just after 08.00. before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. after tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. the on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. at this point i did venture down to the british airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people i gave up and sat down again. at 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. during all of this time i should add that at no time was any information other than the screen made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. despite numerous announcements from easyjet and other airlines ba was conspicuous by its silence. we were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. despite the rather cramped departure area everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. eventually we boarded just after 14.30. when everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadnt been completed and a further delay was likely. we eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. now i know stuff happens but lets not forget that we were departing from one of bas home airports and why they couldnt have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybodys guess. various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from gatwick being dumbed down by ba in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of heathrow. i have no idea whether this is true or not but i would ask one question if this flight had been a morning flight from heathrow to jfk would ba have found a solution quicker once in the air the flight was fine nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay. a mediocre service on this airline flying from london heathrow to stuttgart which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. checkin process was fine at heathrow. after security i went to the first class lounge on the south side of heathrow terminal 5. the lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside  this made it quite uncomfortable. the hot food selection was poor  everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. there were a few bland sandwiches available as well. while the lounge itself is in a beautiful large room it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. boarding process was seamless at the gate. the plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. there is very little legroom available and if youre taller than 511 youre knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. flight attendants were courteous but didnt really go beyond the minimum. no inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever was available which is really a disappointment given that so many other airlines are now installing this. overall the trip was fine but the onboard and lounge experiences could be improved. london to bucharest with british airways. the flight was slightly delayed. i wasnt impressed with the boarding process. it was a full flight and most of the passengers carried more than one piece of cabin luggage. it took some time for passengers to find space to store the luggage and this slowed down the process. this also had an impact on the speed of getting off the plane when we arrived in bucharest. they should have been stricter with the cabin luggage allowance. as it was a more than 3 hour flight they served a hot meal. the food was not that good but enough to survive the 3 hour plus flight. booked flights with british airways rather than a budget airline as thought they would be more reliable. we were returning from an overnight flight from the dominican republic and transfering to a domestic flight with ba. we arrived at bas check in desk at 6am for our 9am flight hoping to just drop our bags and relax until take off. when we arrived at check in we were advised the flight had been over booked and we would have to go on stand by. when we asked how can this be we were advised by a manager that all airlines do this and check the small print. we stated as these flights had been bought and paid for over 6 months previous so wanted to know how ba could re sell our seats manager just kept repeating company policy. manager stated we had to stay on stand by. as things turned out we did get stand by seats at the very last minute. i am appalled with the way this was handled and will not be using them again  buyer beware. london heathrow to miami with british airways. used my husbands miles plus money to book our flights to miami. no kids packs given at all. plane was very dated entertainment system was shocking. very small screens and all the films and programmes advertised on the website were not in my flight. kids had just 3 films to choose from. forgot to load our previously selected kids meals so my kids went hungry no apology offered  food was awful. service was not good not at all friendly. i found my flight with virgin atlantic the previous year far superior on their updated 747s. overall very poor indeed would not chose to fly ba again. they have let their standards slip considerably. london gatwick to lima with british airways. this is a recently introduced nonstop route  offers a reasonable price for club class until you add the seat reservation charge which added a further 68 to each seat each way to the overall charge. we sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours at gatwick while we waited for someone senior to sign off the repairs  fault. on the return journey the flight took off 1 hour late  no explanation and then when we arrived at gatwick we stood for 1 hour for our luggage to appear while other flights around us arriving later collected theirs. there was little advantage if any to using ba on this route and we could have gone the existing routes through madrid with little more hassle. the flight was comfortable the staff pleasant and the food mediocre.    london heathrow to miami with british airways. awful experience. changed our flight from a morning flight to an evening flight on the way out and refused to refund the difference as we were put on a cheaper flight. then cancelled our return flight without informing us so had to spend an hour of our final evening on holiday speaking to an advisor. the plane on the way out was very old many tvs broken and very uncomfortable. staff are extremely unhelpful and will never use ba ever again.\\r\\r\\n    every flight we took in british airways for our two vacation 4 flights had huge problems always delayed from ny a 5 hour delay in line computer glitch they were handwriting boarding passes. another leg check in was botched their issue and we had to stand with the very rude employee who botched it all up and kept trying to call his manager who never picked up  for 30 minutes which held up a very long line of checkins. we are here at heathrow tired and ready for our way home. already a 1 hour delay no explanation just read that british airways had to turn a plane around this morning due to engine issues  after my positive post of the outbound journey the return from philadelphia to london heathrow reminded me how inconsistent british airways has become. before boarding was told just 5 f passengers but actually the cabin was full presumably upgrades though supposedly no other cabin overbooked  this really does downgrade the experience for fare paying passengers. good greeting though csd never did speak to passengers as far as i could see. sleeper suits and amenity pack on seat before we boarded rather than the usual personal offer to each passenger. pre departure warm champagne served and that was the last drink i was offered other than a bottle of water until breakfast. did not eat as had been told that since this is a sleeper service i should eat on the ground. very little crew presence in the cabin during the night and i was awake for a good part of it. very poor value for money on this occasion. flew british airways from singapore to sydney. unfortunately it was the poorest seating arrangement we have experienced in six different airline business class flights. we were face to face with a stranger and though the seats went flat for sleeping they were too narrow. in addition the flight attendants seemed to be disinterested. the ba business class lounge in singapore was excellent. very decent flight in business from barcelona to heathrow with british airways. extremely helpful and pleasant crew served a decent breakfast on this two hour hop which arrived terminal 3. no transfer service for first class passengers to terminal 5 where the security screening was insanely chaotic. due to delays at security and the fact that all a380 flights leave from the bc piers i had 10 minutes in the lounge. first class a380 service was fine but underwhelming compared to other carriers. nice crewbut just decent food and service and no wifi.not worth the money at all.    we travelled on ba 633 from athens on 12th of june 2016. the flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at london. nonetheless we only got in 15 minutes late. what went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. we had showed up early but was refused check in at club europe. the ground attendant at athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. if they had explained it to us nicely we would have been fine with it. the result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. when we finally lined up it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at club europe because for half that time there was only one counter open. eventually a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long lineup. eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. the middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. british airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldnt properly enjoy it. we were placed on the last row of business class 14 and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. it was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. to be fair i think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. furthermore when asked for a blanket i was refused one on the basis there was none until i walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. how is this fair what principle of seat assignment did they use the last few ba trips to europe have been nightmarish from boarding processes this one in athens was chaotic and unsystematic they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the preboarding process. we were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our exec club the online checkin keeps breaking down and when we tell ba that they tell us to call in laugh out hysterically here. in fact the more frequent you are a flyer but not high profile the worse treatment you get. i also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered later on the cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing. i cannot blame the crew they work with what they get.  if we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy we would have booked economy. in april my husband and i had booked business class seats from bermuda to london on british airways. the flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next day in premium economy and to date two months later no refund or compensation. we are gold card members and fly to london business class about 1214 times a year. the service from customer relations is absolutely unbelievable. last september i had glass in my foot on a flight from bermuda to london as a result of flight crew dropping drinking glasses and not cleaning up properly. no compensation. british airways has the monopoly on flights from bermuda to london and the service is simply terrible. what really bothers me is that no one cares from british airways and i have no idea of where to lodge a complaint.    i think that british airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going but that is their only achievement. having booked our flight from alicante to gatwick i immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of €23 each. when i came to check in online 24 hours before the flight i found that we had been moved to row 30 the very back of the plane. when i selected change your seat row 4 was not even displayed. i am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. for this reason i am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines i did not and have not received any notification from ba to tell me they had changed the seating. nor have i received my money back. while waiting to board the plane i received a text message survey on my ba experience so far. i participated and gave a summary of the situation. i also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. when i got home i gave ba one day to contact me but when they did not i submitted a complaint through their website. after some days i got a reply saying would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge well be more than happy to see if youre eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight. i cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money failed to deliver and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. but with ba you have to claim a refund and then wait while they check your eligibility. my family take many flights each year including long hauls to asia. needless to say that none of these will ever be on british airways.    at the beginning of the year i booked 4 first class seats londonkansas usa for myself husband son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. at that time i also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. at check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. after some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. at security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. when i complained the supervisor told me i would not be boarding the flight if i didnt keep quiet. once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and i requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. it arrived but i was told i could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. the flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. the staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. on talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. i had spent thousands on the flights i had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didnt care and saw mum as a nuisance. in the usa the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and i was allowed to accompany her all the way. to add insult to injury on the flight back half the tv sets didnt work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. my mum refuses to fly ba again and if it wasnt for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to virgin and other carriers. i have complained to ba but as of yet no response.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    for those who have alluded to there being haves and havenots on ba flights in terms of customer service i can assure them this is not the case. i am a gold executive club member and can confirm that i have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins. my last experience was with my wife flying from london gatwick to faro on the 18 may 2016. checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful ba employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight. the lounges that are available whilst the ba lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. the ba lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldnt access the clubrooms that were full. the flight was late and chaotic. a group of loud boisterous men were virtually running the economy cabin roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits. this resulted in my wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic. it turned out to be a lie when the purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a g&t on a tray. returned home 10 days later and complained. received a jumbled response. cancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced  they didnt seem to care so good luck to them. british airways have randomly cancelled a flight two weeks before departure from athens to london that now means i miss a wedding that i booked 3 months ago. i as a gold card holder have a connecting flight to buenos aires on ba. regardless they put me on a flight that would have missed this connection. subsequently they have put me on a flight that now actually is impossible to connect from the island i am on. now they have said that to rebook i need to repay  thanks ba for looking after your gold card holder so well  i highly recommend book with anyone but ba for shortfall  better with easyjet ryanair cheaper and better. if they treat gold card holders that have 5 confirmed business bookings this way  good luck to economy travellers. i am embarrassed to be called a gold card member. you cancel flights for commercial reasons two weeks before and do not care the consequences for any long term clients. las vegas to london heathrow return and we did not have a good experience with british airways. both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy unlike anything ive ever experienced flying on any other airline. i tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes but i was uncomfortably hot the whole time. my husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. the staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. i definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline and if youre a have not then dont even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. the people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. on our return flight we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldnt be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. i thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats but what was even more odd was that some passengers didnt know theyd been downgraded until they got on the plane a group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they werent the economy plus seats theyd paid for and reserved  they were regular coach seats. they had all the paperwork showing that theyd paid for economy plus so this wasnt an error on their part. they were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. a couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. this poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. the boarding process in las vegas was smooth but boarding at heathrow was a joke. the staff only made one announcement and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. as a result no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. it made boarding take forever. the entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. a few decent movies but not much else. i thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.    london heathrow to atlanta. a delayed flight was made worse when the pilot assured us that arrangements were being made for our connecting flight. the reality was standing in a line for 6 hours causing us to miss flights with other airlines. i will not fly british airways again.    flew marseille to london. absolutely terrible service. flight delayed four hours. checkin staff rude and arrogant and didnt explain the delay. plane was not that clean. the one consolation was the pilot coming out of the cockpit to apologise about the delay and offered the opportunity for passengers to view the inside of the cockpit. for the money they charge you can get better service elsewhere. i would recommend using other airlines personally.    los angeles to rome via london with british airways. our flight from lax to rome was on time and generally good. we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for 382 each. we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through costco costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco. boarding was not well organized. our flight from london was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. one ba associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad. we had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. when we arrived at that gate we were told we would be bussed to our gate. we waited another 25 minutes for buses. seats were fairly comfortable. food was just okay  the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. we arrived in rome almost 2 hours late. coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. our flight from rome to london was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from rome. boarding was chaotic and you couldnt understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff. everyone seemed confused. snack on board was small but tasty. we had to be express serviced through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight. no time to catch a snack or use the toilet. boarding was inprocess when we arrived at the gate. then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat the back of the seat was very close to your face. you had to go horizontalin order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. food was pretty good. on board entertainment was good. service was slow forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in london. we arrived 25 minutes late to lax. i also take exception to the 90 luggage charge per leg of the trip for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but 380 round trip charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.\\r\\r\\n    my wife and i used avios to get two return tickets from london heathrow to johannesburg. after having done this and once our business travel plans were clear we later booked a separate ticket using cash for a return from edinburgh to london heathrow. when we checked in at jnb we were told we could not check our luggage through to edi because the two sectors were on different but still ba tickets. apparently this rule was very quietly introduced by british airways on 1 june. the flights themselves were very good but if they want to encourage two gold card holders to use other airlines they are going the right way about it.    flew british airways from london heathrow to bangkok. standard of food was very good with lovely wine. seat comfort and leg room okay. on the downside very small tv screen on the back of the seats. the service terrible. these people represent the uk i have travelled with every other airline to bangkok and back british airways is the worst.    flew london heathrow to bangkok via kuala lumpur and return. we resented having to pay 66 just to reserve our seats but that we did and on our way back we decided not as a principle. i would suggest british airways should not behave like a no frills airlines your name and brand mean much more than those cheap airlines. so please stop charging people extras when they have booked and paid. i will come back to fly with you when you have decided to realise your reputation as a honest airline and not like other cheap rate greedy airlines. i might be just one customer but one customers review cant be read by many.\\r\\r\\n refusing to pay 73 pp to reserve seats in business class a stunt more worthy of ryanair i checked in two passengers online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row 7 and the other in row 11. there was no option to change seats and no phone contact given. i tried to phone the british airways kuala lumpur office but the number given would not connect. i then went to the ba office listed in kuala lumpur only to find it had been closed and moved to another location in ampang park. still having asked several people no one knew of a ba office. arriving at the airport i was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board which proved to be the case. but i then found myself next to a family with three very small children. although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight. it was a long night and a very difficult flight. the sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what i expected in business class. all in all it was a flight in flying nursery which i would rather forget. i now know why other reviewers on this site have used the acronym ba  better avoid. business class beware. having flown on an emirates and thai a380 i had high hopes for a great experience on british airways. not so. the lounge in johannesburg was packed and the space in general was claustrophobic. onboard i am used to personalised greetings and warm smiles with a glass or two of fine champagne within minutes of arriving. it took ba cabin crew until the final seconds of boarding to offer any drinks and they certainly disappeared before a second drink could be requested. business configuration is far from personal with someone sitting directly opposite you. seats are extremely uncomfortable for what is business class. at meal time a member of cabin crew came and kicked closed a drawer that was part of my seat. no decorum at all. i have had better service on easyjet. very difficult to sleep as the person adjacent to the seat in front of mine had to climb over my legs to get out into the aisle. terrible. no way ba.    absolute appalling service received by british airways i had a morning flight from amsterdam to london which they cancelled for fog the flight was for 10am and even though the weather was clear by 9.30 am they refused to book me on another flight until 10pm  not even a meal was offered to me all that time. i was in the airport from 7am till 9pm that is for over 14 hours and was told it was weather and out of their hands even though they had over 10 flights to london over the period. i was shocked by the treatment given the way i held the airline in high esteem to the point that i have now refused to purchase any flight via them or related to them since that time even if the have the cheapest tickets and only direct route.    cannot believe how bad british airways was. we arrived very early at the airport in kuala lumpur to catch a flight to london in premium economy. they would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. the flight was massively overbooked. there are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. there was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. this is utterly irresponsible. very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. we were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. not a single employee of british airways was there to manage the situation. it was left to the poor malaysia airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. they have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. they refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. it is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers. british airways has lost my business forever. zurich to london heathrow with british airways. the lounge at zurich was fine. reasonable selection of food and booze albeit a shared lounge. given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why ba could not have a small personalised set up. but we are talking about ba where nothing is normal. flight was rammed. i doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full. the plane left 25 minutes late  but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way i could not care less. seats the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to ba regional business class. a lousy set up. fas were very friendly and provided great customer service. i complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the club europe wcs. i am not a snob by any means  but given i paid about 450  one way for the ticket surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable. fas were sympathetic and i filled out a complaint card. all in all not bad apart from the miserable seat and not being able to get off the plane quickly.    \\r\\r\\nflying in club europe from london city to berlin tegel returning in economy with british airways. the outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. however the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. the food offered in the ce cabin was delicious. flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. everything went wrong from checking in lounge access baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. i had done my online check in on my return flight. just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. the check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later i discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. she checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. after i dropped off my luggage i went to the business lounge as i am a silver member. i provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. however i showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. she didnt even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didnt investigate anything and asked me to call up ba which i didnt bother. when i was queuing up at the passport control i noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. i approached the ba staff at the gate immediately after i had cleared through security. ba staff were shocked that i was checked in under someone elses name. wrong name wrong flight etc. they asked me to go to the correct gate immediately but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and i might not have it back upon arrival at lcy. they gave me a new luggage tag. after arriving at lcy waited for 20mins bag didnt show up. i approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. i explained the situation which she didnt really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt insisting my luggage would arrive. again no investigation rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later  no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.     british airways flight from baltimore to heathrow was good. connecting from heathrow to amsterdam was a disaster. they board passagers onto the plane just for them to later find out that the plane was defect. the pilot and engineers tried fixing the problem and let us sit inside for 3 hours. finally discovered that they couldnt fix it took another 30 min to let us back out to the terminal for us to find solutions ourselves. no food after 7 hours of searching for a flight to amsterdam. got to amsterdam and my luggage had never been loaded onto the plane.   basel to london heathrow with british airways. at 11.30am i recieved a text telling me that flight ba755 departing 1810 had been cancelled. 70 minutes later i recieved a second message telling me that i was rebooked on flight ba749a departing 2155. on arrival at basel airport i discovered the club class check in doubles as a general enquiry point. after a wait of 30 minutes whilst a stream of economy passengers queries were dealt with a rude and unhelpful agent checked me in. i asked if the seat 2c i had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no i had been allocated seat 3c and the allocation could not be changed. seat 2c remained empty. the business lounge was at least superior to the ba one i used on my outward journey being independantly run. our incoming flight for ba749 was delayed leaving heathrow finally landing at 11.25pm. at 1030pm passengers were informed by the business lounge concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by 1100pm as the airport closes at midnight so a rapid turnround was needed. the flight eventually pushed back from the stand at 2350. i wonder if this was a ploy by ba to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delay. on board we met by profuse apologies from the captain and cabin staff although no no reason for the delay was given. certainly not bas finest hour.    london heathrow to boston. my complaint is about the service and rudeness of the british airways boarding staff. priority boarding lane had over 50 people waiting while no one was in line for the general boarding. when i tried to attract the attention of the attendant he addressed me with such rudeness and disregard. his words were you are not the only first class passenger and kept ranting even after i left his station. this is not acceptable in any situation. i cannot believe this just happened. will never set foot in another ba flight.    sadly british airways business class london heathrow to geneva is no longer worth any extra cost. im only 185cm and cant sit comfortably and relax without being sideways. in addition to chamonix we have homes in london and telluride colorado and ba lost us as customers for quite a few years on the lhr to den 777 service again because of the ridiculous seat forwardbackward seat configuration in business class that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight. therefore we flew air nz much much better flight if a little inconvenient to lax 68 return flights a year and suffered longer on united to get to our destination as ba business was so bad. fortunately they now have a 747 on the lhr to den service where we can fly first class which we are using but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service.\\r\\r\\n british airways flight from amsterdam to london in an airbus 320 nothing special about this club europe seats and legroom are similar to economy class but they do not sell the middle seat in business i would not buy a business class ticket for only club europe it is not worth it. i do not understand why everyone is so excited about the lounge at t5 this is the third time i have been there it was packed with families with screaming kids and you almost have to fight for a seat that can not be the purpose of a business class lounge. onboard we quickly found out that this was a very old plane dirty carpet and torn upholstery on the seats. food was poor dirty cutlery that we had to keep if we wanted a dessert. i took a glass of wine with my dinner when i asked for a second one i was told that they were out of that one finally after fifteen minutes he came back with a new bottle. the crew did not make us feel that we were valued customers in business class. ba club world is not value for money. im extremely disappointed with british airways and how their service has diminished. my daughter arrived at milan airport today to catch a 6am flight to london heathrow and then connecting to mexico city. she is still at the airport after 12 hours. the fligth to london was cancelled. there was only one person at the counter in milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. customers were furious screaming at the lonely representative because british airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. my daughter missed her flight was not offered a meal a hotel room and only given the option to fly with iberia through madrid and then connect to mexico city. her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage. this has been a total disaster. i had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to mexico city and now i will have to write and complain and wait for a refund. british airways was an excellent airline until suddenly everything changed. on my last trip my bag never arrived at heathrow i was given a short connection time therefore i lost my next flight. i encountered a very rude lady at the customer service counter and i had to stay at heathrow to get the same flight 24 hours later. i will never use them again until they improve or change their service.    london heathrow to budapest with british airways. i did not choose ba for this flight. it was arranged by my cruise tour operator. online check in ok. bag drop agent surly and unhelpful. terminal 3 lounge chaotic. tables grubby and cluttered with dirty plates and glasses. at 10.00am in the morning the only food available was stale croissants. servers in the lounge unhelpful and reluctant to produce champagne when requested. boarding process was the ba chaos i have come to expect. why do ba gate staff show so much resentment towards premium passagers. new club seating is atrocious. no better than economy with centre seat empty. no drink offered on boarding. economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage. late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. seat very uncomfortable. little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front. the only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew. where do ba recruit such useless staff and are they specially trained to have no customer focus ba is certainly not my airline of choice. many lessons can be learned from their no frills competitors.    \\r\\r\\nthe british airways club europe business product is dreadful value for money. the lounge in geneva airport was fine but busy as previous flights had been delayed. boarding wasnt done by priority just a free for all at the gate  fine but nothing special. my real issue is with the offering onboard no special seats just the middle seat of three left free. we were then served a meal of a few lettuce leaves two tomatoes two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken  really ba to top it off we were on a remote stand at heathrow and it took a long time to get the transfer bus to us. just not worth it on every level.  british airways standards have dropped dramatically. my flight from heathrow to new york jfk was awful. passengers were not given a hand towel or a menu before the dinner service. i was only given one choice of meal. the interior of the aircraft looked worn and shoddy there was litter on the ground when entering the aircraft with the onboard entertainment system on the aircraft outdated to say the least there were limited choices available and the screen which was scratched kept flickering throughout the flight. even the blanket and pillow looked as though it had had too many washes. the exterior of the aircraft was also dirty and unkept. staff on board appeared far from athletic. british airways are falling far behind the level of service provided by the top tier far east and middle eastern airlines. not impressed at all. bengaluru to london heathrow with british airways in world traveller. started badly  at checkin and gate boarding world traveller passnegers are made to feel secondclass citizens but this seemed worse at bengaluru choatic than heathrow. the plane itself was packed to capacity probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. world traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. i had chosen an aisle seat in the centre seat 38d at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. seat width is ok. the adjustable headrest is better than that in premium economy world traveller plus although the seat base is hard. for a 10 hour flight i recommend sitting on the cushion. service was variable  the vod in my seat did not work all i could get was the map and one of the staff reset it quite grudgingly i felt 3 times without success. thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. to be expected to put up with a seat without vod for 10 hours is ridiculous  why do ba not check them after each flight plenty of food breakfast after 2hrs in then a snack box after 5hrs then lunch after 8hrs but unfortunately while i thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first that was not the case and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone. no connectivity in seat only earphone socket. vod choice quite limited compared to other airlines. unfortunately i think that british airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the middle and far eastern carriers in future.    flew bangkok to london. its been a few years since i regularly flew business class with british airways. i always used to look forward to the big seats a boozy afternoon watching movies and being treated a little bit special. fast forward and the lounges are generally borrowed from other airlines that make you feel like a second class citzien the planes are tired with worn out interiors and all of this is reflected in other passengers dissapointment in a generally lack lustre flying experience. for better value and added smiles ive found the premium economy offering must better value for money. on our recent british airways flight from mauritius to london we decided to pay for an upgrade. only to find when we got on the plane that the seats given to us were not functional. we had no entertainment on the 12 hour flight no power to the seat so could not even read. british airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade as they advise their responsibility is to get us from a to b. the entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price. even though looking at their website they state personal entertainment system with noisereducing headphones as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy. the fact that we did not even get to watch the security video is not a concern to ba. as someone who flies ba a lot they have just lost a customer and do not care. i would avoid flying ba now. terrible service. glasgow to lisbon via london heathrow with british airways. checked in on time but informed as we were about to board that there would be a delay of 1 hour. once on board the delay became over 2 hours and we missed our connecting flight to lisbon. were booked on the next flight but could not get seats together in club europe despite the high fare paid. the meal comprised 3 sandwiches and a stodgy cake. arrived in lisbon several hours late. pathetic. no one in london to tell us what was happening until we arrived in the terminal 3 lounge.    british airways ruined our holiday. we had a flight from edinburgh to prague via heathrow booked and the flight was 70 minutes late in arriving at lhr. therefore we missed our connecting flight and when we approached the ba customer service desk for help the customer service advisor was disinterested smug and extremely unhelpful. he even said he was doing me a favour by booking another flight.     we travelled from aberdeen to heathrow and on to san francisco with no issues other than very poor legroom. even less legroom than on a local flight to europe ryanair on a 10 hour flight. on the return journey the first flight from san francisco to heathrow was delayed. once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy. so they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were. very scary in view of the security situation. then our row of 3 seats had no inflight entertainment row 28 the first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it. then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink. so we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment. on landing at heathrow our next flight to aberdeen was also delayed for one hour. on complaining to ba they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds. not much use if you intend never to fly ba again. shocking customer service. avoid heathrow and particularly ba at heathrow. we spent extra to be upgraded to first to fly from london heathrow to dallas fort worth. it was definitely not worth it. the 777 has smaller first class seats they have expanded the number of seats too. there are now around 20. cabin crew were young and clearly without enough experience. quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals  they have been taught to do everyone individually. that doesnt work when they have expanded the number of passengers. cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. they disappeared after lunch for many hours  until it was time for tea. which is now a meal less adequate than it used to be in club. further first class food is far from first class. fewer choices and what is provided is not good. very disappointing. first class in ba used to be restful and the food was decent.    flew london heathrow to washington dc. the business class cabin on a british airways a380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per row. most other international carriers ive flown limit themselves to no more than four or at most five seats per row in business class. in the ba configuration passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed. also the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes and the seats are claustrophobically narrow. by far the worst business class seats ive ever encountered.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    i fly this route 34 times a year unfortunately there is no competition other than air canada. ive had occasional problems  rude staff freezing planes poor service  but generally been satisfied. on this last flight a week ago the plane has been internally reconfigured and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 13 of the space and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normalsized adult. i have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space  i offered to send ba this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint see below. the discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours  for which i did not blame the airline  meaning i spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. then on arrival we in steerage learned that the prelanding snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar approximately 2 inches in size. as a result i arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm and would have brought food on the flight had i known of the miserly costcutting measure in advance. i wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration as this cant easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. i ended my complaint saying i had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers. ive just received a response which is clearly a cutandpasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint indicating that it was not even read and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy. which is particularly shortsighted as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances and we wont forget how we were treated.\\r\\r\\n    outbound heathrow  frankfurt on ancient british airways 767 with old business class seats etc.. aircraft was filthy dirty with wires hanging down. why do they fly such wrecks inbound frankfurt  heathrow on a319. british airways have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal tray club europe the seats were narrow and uncomfortable economy seats. the flight attendant was grumpy rude and sullen. i accept this was a short flight but how british airways get away with calling this business class is beyond me. they should be cited for trade descriptions. i wonder if any ba senior executives bother to fly their socalled premium classes \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    dublin to san francisco via philadelphia. my international ba business class return flight was rebooked by ba to american airlines. instead of the second leg of the flight being the fully reclining seats with movies electronics and lots of space as advertised and paid for like my first flight the second leg was a domestic flight which had a business class seat which reclined about 4 no movies no electronics etc. as it was an older plane. it would have been fine had i not paid top dollar for all the amenities. i submitted a complaint and asked for a partial  voucher but to no avail. the customer service personnel told me things in conflict to documented conversations. the final straw was when i contacted my travel agent and had them call ba on my behalf. ba told them they would not refund anything because it was a voluntary upgrade. really ba changed my flight and rerouted me with less amenities.  what is so irrating is the cost was over 4000 for each ticket and i was not provided the service or flight i paid for. false advertising.    mexico to amsterdam via london with british airways. awful experience. my baggage is delayed since tuesday 2 august they told me that my 2 pieces of lugagge were going to arrive the next day. i´ve been waiting and nothing has been received yet. i even paid for the upgrated seats to ensure a good care with my luggage will be given however everything has been very dissapointing. my first experience with british airways has been awful.     i was flying zurich to baltimore via london with my cello and had booked one seat for me and an extra seat for the cello. the booking was made online and then verified over the phone directly with british airways.  i asked the ba customer support agent if the cello booking would be okay and he told me there is no problem  you have the additional seat booked simply turn up at checkin and you will have no problems.  ba denied me boarding because their system required not only me but also the cello seat needs to have an esta visa they were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system. after 3 hours of stress at checkin they denied me boarding and quoted me over 4000 to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journey. i made an official complaint and they replied basically confirming no refund. i am appalled my their total lack of customer service and will never fly with them again.    the british airways experience has really declined over the past 5 years. i often fly business class and at least premium economy. the boeing 787 is awesome. clean spacious and excellent technologymedia options. however the staff and service has declined. rarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs  they are on automatic pilot. we travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problem. firstly they gave a 5 kg maximum on weight. try getting a 5 kg stroller that works in canadian weather so we bought a new light stroller  however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends. try travelling with a 23 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller. with a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller the only reason we got it ground staff forgot was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it the younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waiting. they could learn a lot from the pilot. also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 14 hours late a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it. the good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well. anyway they have to improve. i fly with 5 family members every year to italy  this time we are using klm or lufthansa  and another bonus us we can avoid heathrow terminal 5. flew malta to london. first the plus points. generous luggage and hand luggage allowance even more so by being one world sapphire member which also allowed prebooking of seats including emergency exit row at no charge and lounge access. so far so good but new style leather seats whilst smart looking are hard after 3 hours flying without the ability to recline. no entertainment apart from ba in flight magazine and inflight shopping magazine. what really lets british airways down though is the food and beverage service. one albeit fresh sandwich and a drink. no tea or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal had been served. the flight was crowded too meaning that overhead luggage space was at a premium as the negative effects of a generous hand luggage policy came into play. on the basis of this trip ba has declined significantly since i last flew with them offering a very basic level of service. philadelphia to london heathrow with british airways in first class. same issue as my last post. i buy a first ticket to relax after a hard weeks work and ba has upgraded a family with small children who eat takeout food in the lounge and disturb the cabin on the plane. this situation happens repeatedly so travelling paid first class on ba is a total wate of money. i can do the same trip on other airlines that value their premium passengers. we booked the return from our honeymoon with british airways from naples to london gatwick and due to the occassion we upgraded to club class and also paid extra to ensure that we were seated together. two weeks before travel they decided to split our seats without informing us. i found out when checking the advanced passenger information that needed to be provided online. i obviously complained explaining exactly what the trip was and how we had specifically paid extra to ensure we were seated together as recommended on their website. their response was simply that they could not guarantee seats due to operational or safety reasons  but wouldnt tell me why they had chosen to change our seats two weeks before only that it was an operational reason. the customer services representatives were unhelpful refusing to look at moving any individual travellers staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful. my wife is a nervous flyer as well so the stress and anxiety actually really ruined our honeymoon with my wife being reduced to tears the day before we travelled. ba couldnt care less and wouldnt even give me an address to write to to complain. awful customer service.    abuja to london heathrow. this flight took off and landed on time. the jack on the new style headphones didnt fit in the socket so if i wanted to listen to anything i had to sit and hold the jack in place. there was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customers. the meal served before landing was a choice between a mini kitkat or a mini mars bar. a far cry from the scone jam and cream of a couple of years ago  and even worse than the bruschetta mini breadsticks tomato salsa packet of mixed nuts and 2 celebrations of a couple of months ago. dont even get me started on the disgusting muffin that has replaced the salmon and egg roll as the meal before landing on the outward journey the toilets were not checked as often as they should have been and i had to inform the cabin crew that there was no toilet roll left. very disappointing.    london heathrow to istanbul return. the outbound flight was delayed approx. 2.5 hours which was very frustrating. boarding the flight was another hassle in so far as we were bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and then there was confusion around seating arrangements once we were finally off the ground the onboard entertainment was great and the flight was quite smooth. the food was terrible tomato and egg sandwich with other little tit bits return leg was on time but the check in queue was horrendous the flight left on time on board entertainment was a struggle as we did not have individual monitors and we were offered tomato and egg sandwiches again as a meal. i hope that this experience is not repeated in october on our trip to the caribbean but either way i will come back to give an honest opinion. we will be flying premium economy so will expect to have far fewer complaints. lets wait and see    i was booked to travel british airways from heathrow to dublin airport in ireland. i arrived at the airport within the permitted checkin times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue. i went to a checkin bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. i was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt. the woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments i asked her if there was a problem. she nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass. after 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help. it was bizarre. i joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person i dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings. he made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate. boarding was not efficient. one would expect better from ba. the queue was poorly managed. the cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional. one cabin crew member an older lady was superb and i saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 japanese people with limited english. this member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline. my seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor. the captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice dropdown screen to show the route of the flight. a cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered.  my bag did not arrive into dublin with me and so i had to join a queue for swissport. this is where my nightmare started. a uniformed woman who said she represented ba told me my bag would most likely not arrive until tomorrow. i asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that i leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where i was staying. i took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight. over the next few days a nightmare began. i spent many hours calling swissport and their courier dpd. to be fair the dpd staff were helpful and told me the reference number from swissport was wrong. swissport insisted the reference number was correct.  flew british airways from phoenix to london heathrow. im trying to research whether this is just the phoenix route but this plane was ancient. the business class seats are dirty and ripped the entertainment system is terrible and the lounge for first and business customers is embarrassing. ba are the only airline to fly to phoenix direct from lhr but they need a serious rethink about the poor standards and condition of this plane. next time i will fly a different airline and transfer via chicago or dallas.    gatwick to marrakech with my family for a 7 day holiday. first timer on british airways. pros flight on time comfortable seats generous luggage allowance. easy online checkin 24 hrs before. pleasant flight. con meal  i thought they would provide proper hot meals i.e. rice and curry. however route london to marrakech and vice versa only one type of cold meal sandwich is served. also small chocolate dessert biscuit and the usual tea coffee or drink is provided. unfortunately i could not have the meal as i do not eat anything with added sugar. toilets  only saw 2 toilets which was rather over used and busy. entertainmenttv  none. i expected seats to be builtin with tvs so that kids could be busy and entertained. this was like a no frills airline. thankfully kids had their tablets with them. staff  okay but could be bit more friendly and approachable. a smile would make the difference. return flight  airplane was bit dirty. i noticed crips bags tucked under the chair. overall a 3 star airline in my opinion.\\r\\r\\n heathrow to belfast with british airways. boarded about 12 noon for 12.55 take off. after some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called. we were offered water or soft drinks initially. we finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. it was quite disgraceful for ba. once airborne we were served tea  coffee  alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. is this what ba has been reduced to this airline definitely no longer lives up to expectations and i will not be flying with them again. at least with low cost airlines you can at least buy some food.    \\r\\r\\ni have to be upfront and say the flight from london heathrow to boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. over the years british airways first has gone so far downhill im afraid it just cant compete anymore it neednt be so as the issues as i see them are all resolvable. however the return leg was like flying with ryanair. there were only 13 people in the cabin. there were no slippers 2 of the menu items i requested were in the words of the crew invisible and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. the chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. my father waited the entire flight having asked on 3 seperate occasions for a headset convertor. we were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast which i then missed assuming i would be woken. there was a palpable tension between the crew which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. once we had disembarked the aircraft it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. finally we collect our suitcases which i have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. ba have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. when comparing the service  food to virgin uc for usa and etihad first for east bound ba just doesnt cut the mustard any longer im afraid. such as shame as the seats  bed are great but why pay the extra  for service and food that just isnt forthcoming or varies from flight to flight \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n   berlin txl to london heathrow with british airways. after purchasing ticket i could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status. i called ba 3 times. the first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system. after the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be made. at checkin i spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junkfee for a single piece of luggage. again i had to call ba 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junkfee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. the second call was to get a refund and rebook the junkfee. the third call was to complain about spending 2hours checking in and correcting bas mistakes. i spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. the ba lounge at txl is small and does not have a toilet. there were no warm food items on offer. i did find the service to be good. boarding commenced at the farthest point at berlin tegel from the ba lounge. flight was okay with minimal amenities. ba not only does not compete on price but amazingly no longer competes on service.    warsaw to london heathrow. i fly the route regularly and i have noticed decline in the ba level of service. boarding in warsaw is chaotic. no priority boarding rules enforced basically boarding started for everone at the same time no matter you fly premium or are a frequent flyer. new ba short haul seats are  not really comfortable fine for 1h flight but get uncomfortable for any longer. same concerns meals provided. crisps and drinks with no possibility of buying further food is not enough for 2.5h flight. i would rather cut on free alcohol and have a decent sandwich or a possiblity to buy further food if necessary. on the plus side cabin service very well trained and attentive. the waw to lon route is served with other carriers including budget ones and i will have hard time justify paying a premium to fly ba on this route in the future. manchester to new york via heathrow. we were bumped off a ba connecting flight from manchester to london heathrow and put on an american airlines b777300 via lhr. whilst i would agree that the staff on aa see passengers as a necessary evil particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging ba b747 aircraft. the food  drink served on the aa flight was also better than that served with ba. at least the coffee on aa came in coffee shop style cups not the feeble paper cups that ba provided with its 2 sips and its gone drinks. im going to be booking a trip for our anniversary early next year to boston which i think ill book with icelandair as this would avoid the 20 mins taxiing to the runway and 20 minutes circling time that.    the many problems i had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return. on arrival at t3 from another carrier i went to the ba baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet ba cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal t5. the agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble. fast track security was woefully slow and incompetent. when i arrived at the gate boarding had commenced. though i had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service i had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite managements false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of the most generous despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty i was forced to check my bag carryon compliant bag. the flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agents unwarranted behavior. the flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering. in all a waste of money for bas vaulted business class experience. the recent economist article about bas race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about managements hostility towards customers and especially ba and ow elites. the asterisk on the oneworld baggage page singles out ba as the only carrier in the group who will not allow its own elite fliers and those on ow to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare ba offers. as the economist article stated loyalty is very easy to lose but extremely difficult to reattain.    london to moscow. i was supposed to travel with ba 233 today. i had a previous flight coming from dallas which was a little late. as soon as no one met me at the arrival i assumed that i have plenty of time and did not rush to the gate. when i arrived to the gate 5 mins before closing the lady said that ba moved me to another flight because this flight was full and my previous plane delayed. i was really surprised because there were a lot of passengers still at the gate and i was not the last one. i asked if the company will compensate me for the cancellation because i will miss another connecting flight in moscow. she said that the company will not compensate me anything because it is not the companys fault.  after what she said that i am not listening and she will cancel my next flight that ba transferred me to  ba 235. i asked why and she said that i should listen and then ill understand. i listened again but could not understand few things still. why no one met me at the arrival if there was a risk of me being late. why she admitted that the plane was full so my place was given to someone else without asking me. why at least she didnt say sorry even once and continued to insist on her version that it was not fault of the company. is it really something that ba treats as a normal practice    munich to cape town via heathrow. the aircraft was very old with outdated tv screens uncomfortable seats and an air conditioning system which settles dust on air vents.  food was ok nothing exciting but when breakfast was served it was started way too late so by the time the food was served there was no time to serve any tea and coffee.  we booked a flight from london city lcy to geneva gva for our summer holidays. the flight was early at 710. we turned up at the airport to be met by a huge queue at check in. after waiting in that for half an hour we headed to security. the airport was packed with hardy any where to sit. after two hours it was time for our gate number to appear but it didnt. a mere 5 minutes before the flight was scheduled to depart with still no information we where panicking as we didnt know the gate number and we thought we were going to miss the flight. we found out the flight was in fact cancelled due to technical issues with the aircraft which was in fact flying to venice a few hours prior. chaos followed after as we where met other passengers travelling with ba who also had their flight to frankfurt cancelled. a huge crowd of people appeared at the help desk. luckly we were rebooked onto a later flight which was also delayed by an hour. i flew british airways club europe from london gatwick to malta international airport. i dont know why we paid double the economy fare per person as the seats are exactly the same as economy class apart from the lavish table in the middle of the 2 seats. you get a blanket a cushion and nicer food than economy and access to the lounge which comes with my barclays travel deal anyway. i enjoyed the food on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only eats fish and not meat so the crew said thats no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato but she didnt like it and there was no other choice for her. complete waste of money but i loved the chocolate cake  the best ive had. to conclude the ba club europe is a waste of money because the seats are exactly the same as economy class and your paying to travel in more comfort and luxury. the club europe seats are a joke.    flew british airways from london heathrow to larnaca. cabin crew excellent. cheerful and helpful. food and drink good. let down by aircraft. business class seats are identical to economy. little recline. ife was not working for the whole plane for the whole flight. in any case ife was one small screen in the bulkhead with no choice of content. business cabin is normally rows 1 thru 9 but was extended back to row 14 meaning we had to share the two lavatories with economy section. flight left late but arrived almost on time. an ok flight but the business offer is not worth the extra cost. would recommend ba but not on this route. boarding on outbound and inbound flight chaotic with priority going to families with babies of which there were very very many.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n prague to singapore via heathrow with british airways. not a good experience flying ba. will never book again. website allowed me to book a connecting flight with only 1 hour 40 minutes to spare. this is not sufficient time if you have to change terminals and especially if you have kids. we did not miss our flight but we had to run fast to make it with 2.5 year old toddler. there are no airport strollers available so be prepared to carry your child. crew below average food was terrible and not enough of it. at both destinations they didnt deliver our stroller.    no online check in is available from dubrovnik so everyone checks in at the airport. lounge in dubrovnik is ok but refreshments poor but better than being in the busy main departures area. the in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing. no priority boarding. cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay no newspapers available when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing ba could provide them in the premium cabin. so called brunch was served which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato lettuce leaf and cucumber. very poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flight. this to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how ba expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets. cabin crew did nothing to stop economy passengers coming through to use the toilet in business is it that difficult very poor show and think we will look at alternatives next time    took a domestic flight from knoxville to atlanta for onward british airways flight to heathrow. went to ba to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so i needed to resolve it with my travel agent. check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude. finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. lounge in atlanta was mediocre at best. flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals werent anything special. id say ba first class is average at best when compared to emirates or singapore airlines. my baggage didnt arrive at heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with ba lost baggage  it was finally delivered almost a week later. overall not the kind of service that you would expect when flying first class. raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks and four follow up calls to customer relations who said that since my agent had booked my knoxville flight that was due to land in atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to heathrow their system automatically took my booking off  i dont know whether this is normal but ive never come across this issue before in all my years of flying. absolutely awful customer service. ba have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isnt good enough not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins which is atrocious. needless to say wont be flying with them again if i can help it.    london heathrow to hong kong. very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for ba 31 service to hkg on september 10th. i was buying my ticket in april so early. as ba executive club gold member i had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type 51d on upper deck at time of buying the ticket. in ams when checking in for that flight this seat was still granted 2.5 hours later at gate i was reallocated to 14g on main deck. first no explanation then that they could make a family happy to sit together but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not. no other seat available due to a full flight. just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13b a seat a little further away from the restrooms. but still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck.  i have gotten already 2620 ec tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. i am so regularly flying with them they know my preferences upper deck aisle seat and as much in front as possible. i am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person but upon their reaction i guess this was not the case.  communication is marketing and this was very bad done by ba this time why should i be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits especially concerning their reservation policy that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together the flight itself was aside from odor and noise uneventful the cabin crew very pleasant.    porto to london. third time flying on this route with ba and always boarding with a minimal delay of 1 hour. poor snacks on board despite comfortable and pleasant flight. ba recently started this route some months ago with low cost flights but the service does not meet the standards that should be expected for a company with its dimensions. naples to london gatwick. the aircraft was fairly new which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes weve flown on with ba. well ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane. as we didnt land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. we were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts we complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of august. what a disgrace. we regularly fly ba and are silver card holders however weve decided to fly our next two long haul flights with emirates. the ba planes weve flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality. what other airline expects you to climb over a strangers legs or to have a stranger climb over your legs to gain access to the aisle you cant keep waking people up and have no alternative but to ungracefully climb out the older i get the harder this is becoming.    gatwick to bilbao. british airways migrating to southern terminal and it causes a chaos. everyone is used to flights being constantly delayed in gatwick however with silver tier membership or flying business one expects to wait in a ba lounge. ba does not have a lounge now instead they are using no 1 lounge subject to capacity. and when 5 flights are delayed there is no capacity even for business class passengers. does ba ground staff care about it the computer says no attitude prevails together with the usual ba familiarity and sorry that means nothing. try to be more professional and show some respect. now the customer service is non existent and no one cares about anything. if i want no frills i fly easyjet.    madrid to perth via singapore. so disappointed with ba. really useless airline. flight delayed on arrival to london 3 hours and no reason given. missed connecting flight to perth from singapore. was given payin lounge access and this was better than nothing but i wonder why they couldnt have just given me access to their lounge. i decided to give them a chance since avoiding baqf flying between australia and europe but i never will again. pay to reserve seats pay to request meal i guess ba is positioning itself as a budget airline but its price doesnt reflect that yet. its a shame as i enjoy the transit through singapore rather than the gulf states. meal service was alright food good and the service also okay but they chatted in the galley most of the flight and didnt serve drinks. they were quite a cheerful bunch at least. check in process was smooth all in all.    miami to london heathrow with british airways in first class. the boarding process at miami was chaotic with the staff member inviting world traveller plus club world and first class to all join the queue to board. despite flying first class it took 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue and a further 10 minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard. the crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats. the hot towel service before take off was a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water. the hot nuts were served 10 minutes after the drinks. the meal was dry and of poor quality. the cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served it was cold and inedible. when the crew member made my bed up i was informed they had run out of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after i complained about the poor experience to the csm. based on this experience bas penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for first class  save yourself some money because united airlines economy class is better than what i experienced on this flight.   we flew as a group of 4 from heathrow to krakow in club europe. the aircraft was clean and newish so had the new economy seats in the club section. i would like to know who at british airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in club i know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but i would prefer a bigger seat to sit in  maybe ba should have a look at turkish airlines biz cabin the service outbound was just adequate  one drinks round then a dinner service ba872 which was edible but slopping  dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger in all the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. now for the return  what a joke nn lounge at krakow  thats right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet the flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours so by the time boarding started it was a scrum priority boarding abandoned to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. british airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. once on the plane the same tiny seats although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1a and 1c so at least we had some leg room. the meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. the steward offered a shriveled chicken salad leg meat skewers or get this a boxed sandwich. i actually had to ask if that was it he replied yes to which i replied so whos eaten all the food he laughed and actually said we were lucky and if i had any food with me could he have some and im not making this up. once at lhr it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the pod service to the parking had stopped and that turned into a complete drama but i wont go there on this ocassion. so  what did we get for our club fare to krakow in my opinion very little and what we did get was rubbish. if anyone is thinking of going to krakow with ba my advice is save your money and fly economy with another airline and spend the saving having fun there. in fact choose another airline since ba on this route are just a joke. i have been club europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once i have used up my 300k avios itll be bye bye ba for good. i will only use avios to get first long haul as that gets you the best return on them. london to denver. seat space  poor im 6ft 2 and really struggled.  film selection poor screen size  poor temperature control poor food.  drinks infrequent nothing in comparison to emirates qatar turkish etc  on par with ryanair at best ryanair doesnt have films but is almost as comfy but 8 hours of this ba flight is just painful. better to find another airline and route if possible.    flew london heathrow to miami return with ba then onto bogota with avianca. british airways have gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactory. not only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight i only just boarded the aircraft on time. on both flights they ran out of one of the food options leaving only the vegetarian dish. they onboard entertain system was low quality  a small screen with poor resolution. seats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines ive flown in economy their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowance. i had connected from mia to bog with avianca  they are a much better airline. seats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality and they had usb charging in economy. shows how far ba have fallen when theyre being outdone by the colombian national carrier. if it wasnt for the better price i would have preffered direct flights with avianca. london to johannesburg return. still waiting for a reply after 6 attempts via email post and phone to make contact. on flight ba 0055 to johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. we took off around 19h30 and were only offered a drink at 21h30. this was the only drink offered that night. dinner was served at 22h30 no drinks accompanied this. we were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. we did not have a choice of meals as they had run out all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto which was inedible. it took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30 waking the entire section where we were seated then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. coffee was not offered at all  the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. when we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip no waste had been collected during the flight the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. prior to this flight we tried to avoid the back of plane issues by paying an additional 56.00 for exit row seats. the payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. when we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. when we arrived at johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. no apology or explanation was given. not the way we wanted our holiday to end. the service on this flight was as to be expected regular drinks offered water throughout the night the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. cabin staff were very good. we have not received a refund for the 56.00 paid for the exit row seats and i await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. even though we were flying economy we expect a level of service and edible food. if the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. this is unfair and bad business practice. upon speaking to other people who have flown with ba the general consensus seems to be that only first  business class passengers seem to be valued and our experience confirms this. ba were not the cheapest flights by far we opted to fly with them due to reputation which was sorely let down.     british airways is getting worse. online check in whats the point if you cannot choose seats  no warm food on any of my recent flights except transatlantic yet the prices still dont reflect this. moreover when i asked for a warm tea as well as a can of coke on board the flight attendant looked like he was doing me a favour for giving 2 drinks as opposed to just one at least i didnt take the crisps offered to me. always late when flying in or out of gatwick which might be due to the airport.  london heathrow to new york jfk. very poor service from beginning to end. cabin interior is tired and the media screen was tiny. food was ok but we had one beer and were then told there was no beer left on the plane asked three flight attendants for a drink later in the flight but only one attendant bothered to return  and that was to say there were no drinks left. service on the return flight was no better. i am planning a business class trip to thailand in november and i note the emirates price is 550.00 less than ba. the british airways plane is again a boeing 777200 which are now old and outdated and the emirates are all a380 or 777300er less than 5 years old with the most up to date entertainment and excellent in flight service. and they send a chauffeur driven car to take you to the airport  why would anyone fly ba if they had a choice    abu dhabi to heathrow return. probably one of the worst flighttravel experiences me and my family have had to endure from what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the uk to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly british airways again. first when checking in in abu dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new boeing 787. of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in. the actual flight time was 1400 then the plane was delayed yet again. british airways staff were no where to be found eventually a supposed british airways manager arrived. we then couldnt check in because the system was broken after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in uni. arriving at heathrow two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for uni was missing apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. again no communication from british airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. sad thing is that in the move to uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag when we explained this to the ba phone operator she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. thank you ba for the great advice. now sitting on the plane returning to home to abu dhabi same plane 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine. great you found the leak but a new plane all these problems seriously british airways should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world.\\r\\r\\n    gatwick to malaga. aircraft on remote stand at gatwick north terminal requiring a shuttle transfer and  boarding via steps without cover  not bad this early am as just overcast but dark and chilly waiting to board. aircraft in poor state of preparation with stains on back of seat leather and generally dirty. pushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle. 40 minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that lead to csd threatening to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved. well dealt with by cabin staff. very noisy group of males on golf holiday in seats to rear of row 21 who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language  spoken to by other passengers and told to desist. the food just gets worse each trip i fly with them  muesli high in sugars and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard  is this really the best they can do finally to round off flight a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flights i have ever taken with ba . cabin staff great but product is poor.    on a flight leaving at 1855 the advertised snack consisted of a choice of crisps a two biscuit pack or a very small packet of nuts. these and a drink in a small plastic cup were served with no finesse possibly the cabin crew were embarrassed by the lack of anything more substantial. british airways need to decide whether to improve food offered on short haul flights or to have reasonably priced good quality snack available as do their low cost competitors.    \\r\\r\\nflew from london heathrow to seattle. poor boarding procedure at t5 with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not. econ seemed about 75 full. sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about 3 hours of taking off. cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers. travelling with 3 children who didnt like the only option offered so much frustration with british airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price. complained to customer service after arriving home and was told the caterer at lhr was to blame and they didnt want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals. seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said. crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated. hard to recommend ba but given the competition on this route and the desire to stay with one worldba ffp its a poor choice.    london heathrow to budapest. it seems british airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that its turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices. i only fly with them now when tour operators give me no choice. ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths refusing to change my seat because thats what the computer has allocated. boarding was the now expected shambles. the no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premium. on this flight several were removed from lockers and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front thus severely restricting leg room. cabin staff were rude and uncaring. again now the norm for ba. the in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea. the seats are very narrow allowing minimal room a no space between neighbouring passengers.    i am a regular traveller on many airlines and a one world emerald ff. british airways flight ba632 from lhr to athens on 11th september was by far the worst cabin crew that i have encountered in 45 years of flying. the crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in business class and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. after 1.5 hours in the air we were offered a drink the champagne was undrinkable and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. after that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. that was all the service we received on the whole flight of 3.5 hours. no top up of drinks no offer of water and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking. i even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft and received no reply    bahrain to boston via london. first time flying ba after flying qatar emirates and oman air business class. check in at bah was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. ba uses the dilmun lounge which is basic but adequate. the flight from bah to lhr was on a 777. the seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow similar to premium economy seats and marginally larger than the economy seats though reasonably comfortable. when fully flat there is not much room and people over 6 feet will struggle. there was hardly any storage space and the ife screen was very small and of poor quality. the food was very average i had the carrot and pumpkin soup. cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. the lounge in heathrow is large but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. the bathrooms in both the main ba lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. the quality of food in the lounge is average though the wine and spirit selection is decent. the flight from lhr to bos was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777  old and tired with cramped seating for business class. cabin crew were a bit better on this leg though still disengaged. the food was of average quality though the wine list while small was good. overall ba has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. the lounge is sub par particularly when compared to the qatar lounge in doha or even the qantas  one world lounge in lax. the business class ticket was reasonably cheap though i can now see why. given the choice i would not fly ba again.    my husband and i flew from atlanta to london and it was a nightmare experience. first the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in london to go to geneva we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare. no one to helped us we had to run like crazy in the airport. we had to pass security and immigration one more time we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to geneva as it was about to close is door. i was shocked that british airways did not provide us with any assistance obviously they do not care about their customers. on our way back the flight from geneva to london was late by more than 40 minutes and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to atlanta. we flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom when you are in premium economy there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and it is a shared one with people in economy. the food is non existent one ounce of salad and four once of a socalled meal  dessert and watery coffee. you will be left hungry so dont rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment. we paid 3800 for this trip and i regret choosing this airline. premium economy is not worth the extra fee you only get 7 inches more than in economy but thats it. you will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy. thats it.  i will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in london heathrow please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and british airways flights are late. the only positive thing i must mention is that employees on the plane were very gentle polite and nice to talk to but other than that everything else with british airways was off. not worth the price nor the headache.    we flew from hartsfieldjackson atlanta to london heathrow on september 2nd and i have to say it was the worst experience i have had flying. when we got onto the plane there was no room for one of our bags at all so we had to put it under our feet keeping in mind this was a 67 hour flight. as uncomfortable as it was i said i would try get some sleep when i opened the blanket there were long black hairs stuck to it. the seats were ripped too. when the meals came out i didnt get offered one 2 hours into the flight i asked the lady for a mineral. i am still waiting    new york jfk to düsseldorf via london heathrow. the online checkin was fast and easy. the choice of seats free of charge was very poor even the plane was halffull. the checkin baggage organization in jfk was a mess. long lines with no priority for members. you should arrive min 2hours before the boarding otherwise you will miss your flight.  the staff in the plane more less accabtable. my hand luggage got misplaced in the plane i think somebody just remove it. i asked the staff and at least they found my hand luggage. recommendation to ba staff behaved partly unacceptable. beverages and seat comfort in total okay. quite simply next time we fly and where possible we shall use any other airline with one exception being south african airways rather than british airways. flew from johannesburg to london heathrow. the seating in business on the a380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels as if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate. the staff were just about acceptable but they appeared indifferent and just going through the motions of serving the food and beverages whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job. oh and my tv packed up and froze so i was unable to watch or listen to any music for half of the journey. the qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the a380. shame they dont fly to south africa although if they did it would be impossible to book a seat as everyone would choose to fly with them and not british airways.    london gatwick to mauritius. i never in my life had a flight as bad as this one. my husband and i were flying to mauritius for our second anniversary from gatwick airport. the staff were rude and inattentive. i pressed the flight attendant button so many times and after waiting 20 mins they just switched it off. however that was not the worst of it  the flight was so cold. we asked if they could please turn it up they didnt care multiple passengers asked for extra blankets not that it would help. i was literally shaking the whole flight through even though i had multiple layers of clothes on. i will never fly direct to mauritius with british airways. i paid more for a direct ticket than a indirect flight but thanks ba for letting me realise paying more doesnt equate to better service.    paris to bangkok via london. what a mistake to choose ba for this business class flight. the experience of the seats with their weird coffinlike configuration sliding screens and people climbing over me almost continually was enough to say never again. the service was very patchy with some decidedly longfaced and sizechallenged cabin staff. coffee undrinkable and forget having a choice. main course near to inedible but the portions were thankfully miniature. the wine selection was good but my unsmiling stewardess told me there was no bordeaux only merdock. i should have explained that medoc is a bordeaux region but really. this simply comes nowhere close to thai emirates or cathay. singapore airlines is in a league way way ahead. i should add that the lounges in paris and london were great. paris was a share with cathay and londons terminal 5 lounge was excellent. shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating tight face to face with a complete stranger noisy and hard. absolutely dire. they were installing a new check in system which failed. huge queues at check in and we had to ask to be taken out of the line or we would have missed our flight despite arriving well in advance. they then lost our luggage both mine and my partners and they didnt even get it on the glasgow flight. the luggage took 2 days to arrive in zurich thats 2 days from a 6 day break that we had to stay in waiting on luggage. their online information service didnt match what we were told verbally on the phone and the people we spoke to were irritable rude and unhelpful. we submitted a formal complaint on our return via ba website. it took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in london. totally irrelevant to the problems in glasgow. an appalling company and gone are the days where they had a good reputation for looking after customers. unlikely we will ever fly with them again unless there is absolutely no other option.   here i am again after my previous review 2 weeks ago of specifically the british airways online check in system. i am currently in cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to london this evening with my elderly mother. we sat next to each other last night at 1930 and opened our ba apps on our phones at the same time. my mother had a choice of 12 seats on a 300 seat boeing 767 and i had a choice of just 4 seats. again. so clear evidence of passenger inequality at ba even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class. this happened 2 weeks ago when flying from london heathrow to larnaca. firstly why do i who flies several times a year with ba only get 4 very poor location seats to choose from and another ba economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from secondly why do ba offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose when i fly with aeroflot you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets. as it should be with every airline. but ba appear to suffer from some kind of seat hoarding issue for some reason. i presume they would rather people pay the 15 to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets something i personally will never ever do. san jose costa rica to gatwick with british airways. i was very unhappy with this flight. the seats were uncomfortable. the plane was old and the tv screens were scratched and appalling to watch. there were 2 drinks services the whole 10 hour flight not including the 2 meals which were worse than usual. we couldnt get up and walk about as the seatbelt sign was on for extended periods. i didnt think there was much turbulence ive had worse. the crew disappeared for extended periods of time. british airways are obviously running on the cheap whilst trading on its previous good reputation. this is unacceptable. compared to the dreamliner which also has games usb charging ports new films and drinks on demand  this is vastly inferior and i will never travel ba again. heathrow to bangkok with british airways. fast checkin by friendly staff at lhr. the galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through l2. unlike most of the middle eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. aircraft was an older 777200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart the ife screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. very much like virgin atlantics upper class seat these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. and the yingyang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. starter and dessert were ok but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. also there is no dine on demand facility you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. the crew were friendly but painfully slow. it also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. it was a quick and efficient service a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. breakfast was not great but edible. we landed at bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. it is clear that ba have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the middle eastern 3 the asian airlines and even the us airlines. they could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product seats and cabins and improving their soft product food service etc especially given their current price point. based on reviews here i had set my expectations of ba low and i was still disappointed.    london heathrow to geneva return. appalling airline. the booking process is dreadful  they charge if you want to change seat in economy i have been told they will be charging for food and drink from january and the website very difficult to use. their customer service via phone or email is abysmal they are extremely rude give completely wrong information and i have been cut off given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages. whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely many are extremely unhelpful. this week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker the bag was not oversized but i have a bad back at present and i asked him very politely  yet he outright refused though he helped other people. i flew club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scattered everywhere and i had to actively ask him to clean it. which he did but with very bad grace. i avoid british airways if i can but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs. and every single time i do fly with them i am reminded why i dislike them so much. london city to malaga return. things started badly when my 2 year old son was out on a separate booking reference. the call centre in india refused to help fix it saying i couldnt manage his booking because it wasnt in my name then we had a three hour delay at lcy  something to do with them miscalculating the weight allowance. during that time ba didnt give us any food or drink and gave us no updates as to what was happening. we landed just under three hours late so couldnt get compensation. return journey at malaga another one hour delay. after we got back tried to collect avios points on website but kept getting system error. then tried calling ba customer relations and after going through the menu system was told that due to disruption your call cannot be answered.  thats the last time i fly this terrible uncaring airline.  the only upside is that london city is a great airport on a weekend being a gold exec member and this was a redemption flight one should not really complain. but if i was paying 4000 uk for this i would be out raged. the aircraft at b777200 well past its sell by date. the crew whilst personable and very pleasent look bored. the food is a disgrace wines white warm reds cold so bad as when i asked for the business class menu to compare it with first was superior in every way. example being first  soup versus business crab tian the csd just apologised and said i know its a disgrace but we keep telling them. aircraft was so old the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing its grip and some foam plate hung out. it really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates. overall i find ba moving to a 3 star its overall product is lazy apathetic inconsistent and tired. the crew are fantastic in the air as for the ground well its like a tube station or a civil servant job for life atitude. my advice stay well well away for premium prices their euro business is laughing stock. i hadnt flown with ba for quite a number of years so after seeing their new fleet i was expecting something modern. instead it was like being in a time warp. the aircraft had seen better days in my opinion and judging by the ife equipment and the inner design damaged lights and uncomfortable seats it showed. our nearest toilet was out of action not good. the crew were okay the service was okay it was just a convenient way of a to b in my opinion nothing else. only until this airline manage to update everything they offer utilise aircraft wise and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers i may consider them again. value for money is negligible and after using other forward thinking modern airlines the experience made the end of a great holiday feel somewhat sour. toronto to lisbon connecting in london outward and stopover in london return with british airways. a mix of premium economy and economy. easy check in at toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge as usual was clean welcoming and well run. ok boarding with juice and water offered on boarding. bizarrely no sparkling wine offered sir  we only offer sparkling wine on flights from london no hot towel after take off but menu card offered. one round of drinks followed by dinner. steak was overcooked dry and with a greasy gravy  the worst meal to date. the biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the muffin or nothing to a basket of smaller muffins chocolate and cereal bars plus tea  coffee and juice. just when you thought ba couldnt stoop any lower they manage to find something else to nickel and dime. good club lounge in t3 with decent showers. the flight from london to lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for me. a younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service  a tasty roll 2 bites and a desert 1 bite with second drinks provided on request. returning from lisbon a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks shameful that ba are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate. the ba lounge on the b gates at t5 remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet. onboard one of the old 747s with the old configuration with pe in front of biz class with juice water or sparkling wine offered on boarding. my ife had frozen before i sat down and even after reset had a mind of its own. the safety video was abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo as there were clearly ife issues across this aging 747. i finally gave up watching tv as the channel kept changing. no hot towels again. one drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels i was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew at around 10p a bag  really a vile coleslaw starter a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which i had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. the chicken was tasty but not a business class entree as claimed by any stretch of the imagination. tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks had already been cut. the biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal. the sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea  coffee with clearly embarrassed crew again. this constant reduction in the pe product with the small stuff cant go much lower  theres only the seats and space left ironically whilst in lisbon the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy. ba are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering  yes theyre asking because youve cut the service back so much in the first place. id pay for a decent m&s sandwich but i enjoy my free drink. charging for tea  coffee and juice  even air canada havent stooped that low. i really worry for bas future. the drive to improve the bottom line has gone too far. i dont see fares being reduced to reflect the reduced service. the board of ba  iag group and their shareholders should be ashamed and embarrassed with themselves as the demise of the uks flag carrier continues.    flew british airways tofrom heathrow recently as first experience. have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service. i absolutely agree and what a shame. but ba if you actually read some of these reviews you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly. when boarding rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down actually have your cabin staff positioned even in economy to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others. many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer 777s. perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance on long transatlantic flights cabin stewards disappear for at least 45 hours mid flight. perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything or are they fearful of the extra work. i cannot believe that british airways have such a meagre seat pitch on such a great aircraft. i have been on many short haul flights that would have been far more comfortable let alone a 12 hour flight to seoul. i am not overweight but i am 6ft2ins tall and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there was absolutely no space remaining. the total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future. seattle to prague via london heathrow with british airways. checkin took about an hour online checkin was not available. the catering onboard is the worst from all european legacy airlines. the breakfast on the long haul flight was a bad joke bread with cheese and a muesli bar. on the 2 hour flight only little chips or biscuits. i talked to the cabin crew on most of the 4 flights they encouraged me to write reviews because they do not agree with the company catering policy too. also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality. the aircrafts were new that is of course more important that food. singapore to heathrow. british airways gave me something i wasnt expecting  probably my worst longhaul flight experience ever. clearly bas costcutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine cattleclass experience. they really need to up their game to compete with singapore airlines and emirates  who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. ba  where do i start cramped seats  even felt extremely small to the children 6 and 8 and little leg room. that feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel let alone 12. the food was laughable  yes it says on the marketing blurb there are 12 menus to choose from but it fails to mention that they are inedible. i thought the childrens meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet  the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. the entertainment system just about kept the children entertained  but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack quality kids treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.if you have a choice go with another airline. go with emirates.   london heathrow to budapest with british airways. yet another abysmal flight with ba. the majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups. perhaps thats why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight. the cheaper no checked baggage tickets allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage cause chaos on boarding with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers. consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place. all semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned there is no welcome on board only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage. the seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable. cabin so called service was nonexistant. the packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea. the cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through meal service to maximise time available to chat in the galley. the one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. i was only on the flight as part of a tour group. booking independently i would have opted for a rival low cost carrier.    manchester to san francisco via heathrow. first time flying with british airways and will most certainly be my last. 11 hour flight from london heathrow to san francisco on a very very tired looking boeing 777200 was not what i had expected. ife system was sparse in choice and colour pixels on the screen. couldnt sit with my partner as unlike most leading carriers ba opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens when check in did open we were assigned seats miles apart and the plane was fully booked  so 11 hours of no real ife and the option to talk to my partner involved a 5 minute walk across the plane. we could have opted to go with virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with ba. who as far as i can work out are on ryanairs level of additional charges. never again british airways never again    washington dulles to nairobi via london. was excited to fly first class on ba from dulles to nairobi since its about 15 hours of flying time i decided to splurge on a 1st class ticket. things started off poorly at checkin when bas computer system went down  a seemingly constant problem  . after 45 minutes of waiting they were finally able to get a back up system going and i was checked in and off to their lounge. great meal and service there. my flying companion didnt want to splurge on a 1st class ticket so she was in business class. it wasnt long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst shes seen. ba has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when youre asleep. well i sprung for an 850 upgrade for her and all was well. until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. heres where bas systems again breaks down and their computer isnt working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. we land 3 hours late at heathrow and miss our connection to nairobi no one to assist you head off to another terminal to customer service wait 3040 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a kenyan air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on ba. we chose kenya airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. on our return flight i had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since i couldnt use my 1st class ticket. no cant do that and youll have to apply for a refund. meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis i was told later that that is promotional and to hell with a paying passenger. the bottom line is dont fly ba if you are going on to a distant location they are unreliable and assistance is negligible. if youre just flying on to the continent where there are multiple flights you may make it.    after many years of flying on ba being a gold member for the last 6 years i have finally lost my patience with ba.  there is no point ba even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong. i recently spent over 4000 on a flight to singapore outbound being first and inbound in club world. the plane was a fairly new a380 and on the outbound journey the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly. the crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasnt a very pleasant experience from the passengers and the crew might i add.  on the inbound a few days later we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane must have been the same aircraft as the outbound. the ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didnt feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets. it meant no running water to flush the toilet although the suction system still worked and not running taps to clean ourselves and of course no tea of coffee facilities. 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey they had to get the plane to land back at lhr just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 eur under the eu compensation policy the plane landed back to lhr 2hr 54 min late. to top things off after landing back to lhr the ground crew from ba forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min. so in summary i get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it. everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in  the answer from ba customer relations was 15000 avios points whats 15000 going to get me surely i ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me couldnt do anymore as the supervisors decision is final. can i speak to the supervisor i ask i am thinking as a loyal member spending so much on ba heshe might have the decency to speak to me the answer was no they dont speak to anyone.     flew malaga to gatwick. although a better flight than two weeks ago the service of a small packet of crisps peanuts or biscuit is a disgrace. at least with other airlines you can purchase food. passengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering. for our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of to flyto serve. we will choose any other airline over british airways in future  human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the ba management although the cabin staff did their very best. no doubt ba management cant wait to get their hands on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge. truly shocking values and not customer focussed in any way whatsoever.    bari to gatwick. yet another abysmal flight from ba. no wonder the majority of passangers flying short haul these days are on package tours. anyone making individual booking obviously travels with other more customer focused airlines. check in at bari was resonable smooth unlike on my outward flight but the boarding process was the now expected chaos. the decision to issue hand luggage only tickets is a poor one. unlike other airlines no attempt appears to be made to regulate the size or weight of bags carried on board. on this flight i witnessed several arguments over locker space. the cabin crew greeted us with bored zombie like expressions. meal service costed of a barely edible sandwich hastily delivered with no finesse. the drinks arrived a good half an hour later than the food it seems the the one aim of ba cabin crew is to provide minimum service as fast as possible to maximise the time available to gossip in the galley. do ba executives never sample their economy short haul product we were very excited about our club world journey to mauritius and how disappointed we were. the food wasnt great the wines werent either and the foot part of my flat bed kept on collapsing so i hardly got any sleep. the cabin staff were good and very helpful. we have travelled virgin upper class and it is much better as your bed is made up with a duvet and sheets. all we got on british airways was a sort of rather nasty blanket and no sleep suit either. very disappointed in all of it. our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to gatwick was struck by lightening which is not bas fault i know but i would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past. maybe they just dont have spare planes any more long haul. we have travelled british airways europe several times in the past 3 years and think this is wonderful but long haul just does not do it for us and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we wont have to travel british airways unless they pull up their socks. flew jnb to ath via lhr. really disappointed and expected so much more. after reading previous comments have to agree that british airways standards have slipped dramatically. having flown first on same routing a while back its very evident to see the cost cutting in all aspects that its definitely not worth it to pay that sort of pricing. food not at all up to standard and can honestly say have had a better experience having flown business with gulf and asian carriers. its a real shame as when you speak to staff on board all agree and are quite embarrassed. on a positive point staff on all legs were really nice and helpful just let down by a poor product. return journey gatwick to dubrovnik. outward journey seating was basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink. return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps. i think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshments being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flights. staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on british airways. bangkok to london. first time flown with british airways and the last. service was slow ife is poor to say the least compared to other airlines and to be honest the last time will use them. check in was fine as done most of it online myself boarding ok. on value for money i would recommend another carrier.  we recently flew british airways business class from calgary to rome via london and returned the same route. like previous reviews we too will avoid british airways at all costs. although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet  even worse is what british airways sells as business class within europe. they are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. my husband is 64 and im 510 and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped my biggest complaint about british airways is having to pay to reserve my seats they are the only international carrier that does this. even in business class. when i logged on 24 hours in advance there were no seats to choose from  and to my utter surprise my husband and i werent even seated together. shame on you british airways for being so cheap we are flying to europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere on the plus side food and service on our flights was exceptional but your customer service leaves much to be desired. my wife and i have been flying british airways short haul in club europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. noticeably this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to malta ex gatwick. departure time was 0750 and we arrived at premium checkin at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving first and club. there were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue some of whom defected to economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the checkin lady left much to be desired  robotic unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. it would have been good to have been informed that the no 1 lounge was available in the absence of the ba offering but no mention of a lounge was made at all. the no 1 lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load but that is another story. boarding was fine but the inflight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. the meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. clearing the meal was even worse. the flight was in final approach to luqa when returning from the toilet i saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her ipad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the captain announced cabin crew to seats for landing. should i have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this ladys games session appalling  and such a contrast to several lhrprg early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly ba. this may just have been a bad flight but i fear that this is the future for ba unless somebody at the top reads these reports and takes remedial action before its good name is lost forever. flew with british airways for the first time from sydney to london return. very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines. had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding the world traveller plus customers in fact were the last to board. there were only 6 rows of premier economy yet was told that the meal choice has ran out. the meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. the starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. the fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. the dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. there was no other service no offer of water or snacks between the meals. toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. the toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in singapore. the seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines. ba world traveller plus is certainly not value for money and i will not travel with them again. new york jfk to london heathrow with british airways. please bear in mind that this complaint concerns a business class ticket. customer service is non existant. i could not choose seat on line. called for help and was told it was not possible for them to do it over the phone. suggested i use another browser. i called a friend who could try using her pc and another browser. same story. unable to choose seat. called airline again and was told that it could only be done by airport staff. after pressing them for the number and being assured i was being given the contact info for ba at jfk i called only to discover i had been given the general phone number for jfk. absurd. i hadnt used this airline in years and never will again. its a shame. they used to be such a class act. i havent flown british airways for quite a while but this journey to nice drew home to me that ba is no longer the premier airline i thought it to be. trip was okay no major problems but my point being is that it is no different to some of the many other airlines i have flown such as easyjet turkish airlines flybe etc. cabin interior was a bit tired i asked the air hostess for a diet coke and didnt receive one. one toilet between 120 odd people in economy isnt great on a 1 hour 40 minute flight. cluttered galley of people waiting for the one toilet congestion in the aisle blocking the flight attendants trolley not ideal. dont get me wrong the flight and airline was okay but no different than the other lower cost airlines when comparing ticket prices ba no longer has the edge for me.    london heathrow to kuala lumpur. very poor service. this is their much vaunted boeing 787 first class. could not book a massage in their lounge despite trying to book 3 weeks in advance. the cabana in their lounge was smelly and had no clear partition from the toilet shower. nobody bothered to check if i needed anything.priority boarding was a joke. outbound service on board was mediocre. cabin crew slow to anticipate passengers needs. no wifi. one toilet and the same size as in a low cost airline. food ok but not great. on arrival i asked the chief stewardess about fast track only to be brushed off with we dont do fast track here. return flight was equally poor. rang the bell and no one came. rang again after an hour to order breakfast. stewardess came and said of course but we start serving from the other side. so much for first class dining on demand. the only great part of the trip was the first class lounge in kuala lumpur thanks to malaysia airlines as it is their lounge and not british airways . ba lags behind air france la première as far as first class service is concerned.    i am tall 196cm to be exact. thats why on a recent flight from london to brussels i couldnt face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat. instead i decided to pay 385 to fly in british airways business class. what a mistake on arrival to heathrows terminal 5 i tried to enter the queue at zone b as directed by one of the information signs. i was told that the staff had decided to close that so i had to go somewhere else. i joined the queue at c instead but was told when i got to the front that business class checked in at h. i made my way to british airways business class lounge which was crowded dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a rundown bus station than an airlines lounge. the place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. it was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where i waited for my flight. the gate was announced and i made my way to gate 10c where the flight was being bussed. i was in seat 3d. it was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. the whole point of spending 385 was legroom and i didnt have any. i asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  ba would not have been my choice anyway but i do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment. in that case dont make the same mistake as me. british airways.    athens to heathrow. i cannot believe that british airways want to embarrass flight staff so much as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served which we were never warned about. we paid over 700 for our flight two of us. it is so sad for loyal customers if we wanted to go on easyjet or ryanair we would but to receive the same treatment is a great shame.    flew from bangkok to london heathrow. once again the 3 cabin b777. crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so i never got a welcome drink. the seat was the standard club world seat which is ok for lying down or sitting full up right anything in between feel awkward. the food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition. as always bas lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing the club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems. however the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight. the inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall. prelanding snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about. crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings. if i had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price i would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided. british airways needs to step up their game to get my money again.    london gatwick  pisa return. another less than satisfactory experience with british airways. i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany. when i first flew this route as opposed to ryanair on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience. now as a cost cutting exercise  you dont. which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. the ba lgw club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the north terminal. it was fine. very busy  but the light lunch was better than bas own set up  the last time we used it. plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. i settled for a couple of g&ts  and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. on the return the club europe lines at pisa check in were used by just about anyone. it was a zoo. the ba airport crew didnt care and given the management at ba dont care about customer service and quality why should they lunch was quite pleasant some sort of chicken dish. we got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. on both flights i got the front row which gave more legroom. the seats well the usual abysmal so called club europe. a disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale. fas in both directions were splendid. they get very embarrassed about talking about ba cutbacks. who wouldnt flying 1st class next week to the middle east. not holding my breath that it is going to be an eye popping experience.    had prebooked seat 14k and on taking seat noticed rubbish piled at back of seat empty plastic bottles and paper etc. overall the cabin appeared dated and untidy. also the inflight entertainment screen did not work. on arrival in uk complained to british airways but got a somewhat stock reply apologising and received a derisory 20 evoucher as compensation. when flew back to thailand flight no ba009 27 sep at checkin member of staff advised he was unable to print of boarding pass for onward flight bangkok to chiangmai but assured me this was quite normal and would cause no problems. with luggage booked through to final destination i was advised by bangkok airport that without the second boarding pass i would have to go landside to check in at bangkok airways domestic checkin. a complete fiasco ensued highlighting the ineptitude of british airways staff. ba motto to fly to serve  i think not. i was very disappointed to find that british airways are now a very middle of the road airline compared to a decade ago. why firstly compared to my only other flight in an a380 qatar airways there are more seats crammed into the ba business. on the outbound flight only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my inflight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position. the only possible solution the steward could find as there was a critical bolt missing was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very flintstones for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view very annoying when you are half way through a film. the flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough tasteless and quite inedible. i gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it. they did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine. the staff did well enough. i used to fly ba a lot and am a silver card holder but it is no longer my airline of choice.    tokyo haneda to london and british airways is cost cutting all the time i was extremely disappointed with the onboard catering. for a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food. the tuck box vanished from your offering. we got served a small breakfast at departure 9am tokyo time and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. pretty much 10 hours with no food  so not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed.  it looks like despite bas good profits they are cost cutting to extreme levels. perhaps the ceo could try out this sector in world traveller or world traveller plus rather the the first class he probably uses on a long haul flight and see how he feels at the end of it maybe he will turn a little skinnier certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience    vancouver to london heathrow. i was booked on air canada but rebooked onto british airways as i was unable to make the ac flight since ac cancelled an earlier flight from yyj to yvr. having flown british airways in the past i was looking forward to flying them again but my trip was somewhat disappointing. seat on the boeing 747 not the most comfortable but still a slightly bit better than on air canadas 10 across boeing 777300er. meal served after takeoff was chicken with rice  it was fairly tasteful. cabin crew seemed approachable but after the meal service cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to london. i wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button  then waited over 15 minutes until a cabin crew walked by. before landing breakfast was served  consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar. it is very evident that bas service standard has slipped considerably since i last flew with them in 2013. how the mighty have fallen.    san francisco to manchester via heathrow. marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey. a 2 year old a380 the seats were much nicer than the 777200 outbound flight  seat 82a i did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor cant say if thats a good thing for ba or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first a380 flight. thats the positives out of the way. no sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gate. cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding. 7pm departure so i was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as i could. at 930pm meal arrived no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals. i got a bread roll she didnt she got a dessert i didnt neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty i had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a diet coke woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it. a folded omelette 2.5 potato wedges and a cherry tomato breakfast of kings. the final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long i had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives. the 20 minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing. my quick connecting flight to manchester was pretty much the same too. if i could rate things as 0 stars i would. im ashamed british airways is my national carrier.    silver card holder with british airways and pps card with singapore  singapore to london leg  average  when called for service staff had a bit of an attitude like it wasnt their job so doesnt do ba any favours. 1.5 hours late and they sent the baggage to the wrong part of the airport so 45 mins delay at the baggage area. barcelona flight average. worst bit  ba codeshare. booked ba 2190 find out its vueling. ba have not got their act together on codeshare at all as silver card holder booking ba i had zero ba rights  tried to charge me for second bag  free for silver card holder. get to the lounge ba have explicitly asked for vueling codeshare to be excluded so no ability to use lounge. had to pay to select my seat. ba trying to save money. because the vueling flight was third leg none of the check in online to singapore on ba leg worked so i had to go to the ba desk to get checked in before dropping my bags message to ba  i have close to a million miles on ba  i chose ba for this trip  i could have chose sq star alliance  your lst couple of years focus on cost control and being cheap and not sorting out a codeshare process for both standards and your poor it interaction that doesnt treat me as a cardholder and works just put me in the will fly sq next time i come to europe bracket. you can cost cut yourself out of business.    first time using british airways as always flown virgin but routes from orlando to gatwick were full with virgin. the flight was cancelled with no reason for 24 hours. no apologies a text message sent to my phone 4 hours before departure with no telephone or contact number. after an hour of ringing everybody i could at ba i ended up being passed to an offshore call centre. if you deal with ba this will be where you call for everything  cut off three times and completely incoherent. i was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in club world seating. the plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable it was in a dire state. my daughter commented this is like a dustbin with wings daddy when we got into the cabin. on arrival to my club world bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere. i handed it to a stewardess who said that bit isnt important whilst looking down at me and taking it away. the inflight system was a joke the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything. all the pixels were broken. the charging for laptops etc was us only and the remote for the entertainment system didnt work. an announcement came on before we left we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy. please do not eat any nuts at anytime. once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut i am proud to be british but i am incredibly embarrassed for british airways to represent my country in such a poor way. fly with anybody other than ba. trust me they are nothing short of a joke.  london to geneva. im not sure british airways are committed to short haul business anymore and can see them going high density economy seating only as some others do. business seat same as economy everyone now knows about but the downgraded food  lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham slice of palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll. and that was that. not even butter with the roll. guess the value of food was about gbp1. crew did their best with a poor product. flight on time. not worth a premium over economy ticket.    wed booked to fly club world 4 months ago. turned up at st lucia to be told british airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded  this is on a 1700 ticket. according to the duty manager they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers. we were given 300 each travel vouchers as compensation so it means we have to use british airways again. we ended up in world traveller plus premium economy. seats were ok but its the standard economy menu. breakfast was a croissant which had come out of a fridge and was disgusting. our flight from london to boston was okay. disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10. annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. the return flight was different. staff not particularly helpful. person in front reclined seat fully and i wasnt able to fit food tray in. crew member said i was causing problems for the man in front when i requested he put his seat up to eat. also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning i was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency. we had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later. staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight. will not use ba again. delta and virgin flights offer much better service.    london heathrow to bangkok with british airways and they operate some of their oldest planes on this route so the screen is only 6 with square lines across the screen. the food is very poor on quality compared to other airlines covering the same route only two offerings of water on the outbound flight. usually fly this route in business class and british airways offering is far inferior product on this route also. despite being silver member will be voting with my feet and using other airlines when available on all future travels. this was one bad trip too many with british airways. london to seville via madrid. if you want budget airline service but decent airline prices look no further than british airways. i used to fly a lot with ba for both business and pleasure. but lately they really started dropping the ball. in 2016 i had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours. but that is not the worst. recently i booked a flight to seville from london. after a few weeks this flight got cancelled. it took me 3 different operators to find a solution via madrid on the same day. no i dont want to fly the next day. but guess what 1 month later my outbound to madrid got cancelled as well. again it took some time to find an alternative. ultimately i had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 2.5 hours. also i need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in seville. after complaining to ba about this process i expected to get some sort of compensation after all im an esteemed silver member their words. but none of that. a few phone calls later i am stuck with an automated email service replying to me that no compensation is possible. i didnt ask for any money or anything. all i asked for is to waive the rebooking fee if i ever have to change a flight. this seemed only fair after ba cancels flights willynilly and doesnt take the customer into account. if this is the service extended to a silver member then i really dont want to know what they do to customers not part of their frequent flyer scheme. london gatwick to barbados return. british airways is a terrible airline and i will never use it again. paid extra for premium economy and another 192 to make sure we could sit together which i have never had to do with airlines on long haul. we were told there may be a small charge when we booked the holiday. the plane was very dated and dirty the floor was dirty my tray was covered in coffee stains. on the outward flight one footrest would not stay up and inward the foot rest and leg support would not work. the crew gave us a champagne welcome then vanished until the food came tough if you would have liked another drink. it seemed the crew were very tired or just fed up serving people i suggest they change jobs. british airways state that you can check in for free. when i checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight there were only three seats available for the three of us. i also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in c or j. due to online check in i had only the option to select an aisle seat. at t5 at lhr i spoke to ba customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat only certain seats will appear available  in short the less you pay you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. this is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. the aircraft was a 747400 reg gcivv built in 1998. the aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and led lighting. however the aircraft tables were not clean leg room was poor and the 747 is an embarrassment. these are the words of a cabin crew member not me. true  the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners. cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen only towards the start of the flight. food was ok  veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse. however only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee. ba wake up  look to see what the competition is doing aircraft wise and sort out your unfair check in policy. london heathrow to bucharest with british airways. to fly to disappoint. after my arrival in heathrow t5 the checkin area for club europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the checkin lounge and a host was guiding you to the checkin line. after saying hello to the host making my way to the checkin line i was stop with an unpleasant excuse me this is business class. like a naughty school boy i returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the exclusive area. checkin was smooth and i was airside in under 20 minutes. enough time for some dutyfree shopping in an airport already decorated for christmas. being a little bit hungry i was looking for the light meals or snacks especially prepared for you and drink from our world wine bar as ba promised again on their website. the only  i made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display i found some warm french white wine. therefore i decided to cut my time spent in the comfortable private lounge and treat myself with some costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. waiting for the promised menu which features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight. couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in club europe. in the londonbucharest flight i was offered the eternal option beef or fish with indeed a nice polite smile from the purser. the tray looked like an economy tray on a tarom or klm flight to bucharest. no salad an overlapping endof meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food i ever had onboard. when i was still looking for my very british experience the tray was taken away. coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. i couldnt stop wondering where that smooth stylish service from my last flight went. of course the crew was polite and nice as much as they can shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. and another odd element no other drink service you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the club europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley.    scheduled to fly out of johannesburg on ba on 27th october but due to aircraft delays a380 managed to get onto another flight boeing 747400 to ensure i caught my connection to charlotte from london. this particular boeing 747 had clearly had its day but was infinitely better than my return flight on the a380. i paid an additional fee for my seat but irrespective felt packed in. the seat was very uncomfortable slow service from section cabin staff and  in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraft. chaotic boarding did not help matters. will in future use one of the us airlines for this route.    london gatwick to mauritius return. our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable but new to british airways we were prepared to wait and see. the inbound flight commented upon here was much worse but with many facets of the earlier experience.  we paid two supplements for the flights. a substantial fee to upgrade from economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients  on overnight flights  we could sit together the combined cost therefore was significant. the benefits were not. firstly upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. a lady ahead of us had a headrest problem she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  throughout the flight during waking hours passengers seemed to be a nuisance. food  as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines we were expecting a menu to select meals. how silly. here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice  chicken or veg a bright green risotto. so no choice no bread roll no cheese and bikkies a choice of one red wine and plastic cutlery. this was served after the attention in economy and may account for the absence of choice. whatever it was awful. it was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. what a waste of resources. significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. the premium economy wtplus cabin had no provision for toilets. it was necessary to go forward to club or back to economy it became clear earlyon that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin so back it was during the night with passenger debris in aisles this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags from headphone containers to slip on. is nobody in british airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential  on arrival in uk we read that ba is to put even more seats in economy class on this type of aircraft. goodbye british airways  not even nice to have used you.    athens to london heathrow in economy class. the food for a 4 hour flight is only a sandwich for lunch. 1 drink service instead of 2 in the old days so you better order everything you need for the whole flight. british airways service keeps on getting worse and worse. its a shame because the crew are actually generally friendly and nice people. i will only fly getting worse and worse if they are cheaper than all the competition which they almost never are. what a shame to once upon a time being such a good airline to now budget service at a high price was such an old tatty plane each way very uncomfortable. entertainment was old and tired. had to keep pressing many times just to change the channel. food was like mush on the way there and on the return they served me a vegetarian meal as thats all they had left. the cabin crew service was very poor on the return flight. the crew looked miserable as if they didnt enjoy their job. asking for anything was like a chore for them. one of the crew looked so untidy her hair was all over the place. i asked to buy a bottle of perfume when they came round with the duty free. the steward said he would come down with it soon. i waited and waited then approached him an hour before landing. he apologised and said he forgot that he will bring it down now. again i waited and just before we were ready to land i asked again he returned with a bashed in box of perfume and said sorry but this is the last one. i couldnt except it as it was very badly presented for a gift. after all that if i knew it was the last one then i would have chose something else but it was too late as we were landing. terrible 12 hour flight.    larnaca to london heathrow and wow british airways has gone downhill. very grumpy and abrupt staff and the meal if you can call it that was a sandwich and a small coffee in a paper cup. this is on a five hour flight. british airways needs to take a look at the likes of qatar airways etc.    barcelona to london. has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to spain according to a british airways gate agent at barcelona airport i supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave spain. i drove across the border from the states to meet a friend in canada and flew out from vancouver on the same day to london for a week and then from london to spain for two weeks. all along the way of going through customs of canada uk and spain i was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when i was leaving spain. all of a sudden this gate agent asked me where are you going  where do you live  are you traveling alone i thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me you have to wait here i need to talk to someone. there were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why i cannot get on the airplane.  i am a permanent resident of us however i am a citizen of the country participates in visa waver program which means i dont need visa to enter spain and definitely not when i leave. so whats wrong my name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my us permanent resident card does not match with my passport. of course i just got married so that i have different last name from my passport but even that what kind of right does she have to ask me for my us permanent resident card and stop me at the gate like that so when she asked me if i have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name i jokingly answered marriage certificate next thing i know was i cannot get on the airplane because i didnt have marriage certificate with me and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone she said to me you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you. it was beyond ridiculous   london to lisbon with british airways. very bad flight when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick up. my luggage was taken during the boarding procedure because they said the flight was full yes it was but there was enough space to all to have the mini trolley that i had in the plane and people that i must say had bigger luggage then my own. once in the plane fast exit from heathrow and once on flight a bag of chips or peanuts very healthy. on the arrival at lisbon plane parked near the military aerodrome on portela figo maduro and 10 minutes bus ride to the terminal and more 10 minutes to wait for luggage. long time ba customer but do not know if i will fly again.    recently flew a return trip with ba to miami onboard one of their a380 aircraft and what has happened to this airline outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the a380. we were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. from the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldnt hear it. this went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was normal on all their a380 aircraft. the food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. i chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. the return flight was a different a380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. the food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the breakfast it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. the standards have dropped so far it is incredible. im certain if i sat in row 31 on emirates or the like i wouldnt be issued with ear plugs. im booked to miami once more in early 2017 fortunately on a quiet 747 and after that i will no longer fly with ba.    the flight started in the first class concorde lounge at t5. it is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. the seat cushions need refilling. the general ambiance is quite good. a refurbishment is long overdue. the food quality and choice is generally quite poor  although the crab tortellini was good. nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. i had to walk the floor and find someone. all sloppy. the menus also were worn and scruffy and someone a child i think had scribbled on the inside some funny cartoons. we boarded and the flight departed to the minute. all good. the boeing 787 has a small 1st class and i realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. the 747 alternative is a total disaster and i go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. food was ok. very little wow factor. the meze was fine. they ran out of cod  and at this point i dont think we had hit the cruise. seven from eight passenger  and only one cod apparently. i had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights i prefer not to have meat. my wifes allocated seat was  broken hence the vacant seat on the flight. so she sat one side of the plane and i sat the other. brilliant. the plane was only six months old. given the competition on this route you would think ba would want to impress. was it a coincidence i wonder that there was no arabic or asian passengers on the flight with emirates on this route  why would there be we landed on time and then had to walk miles. another underwhelming experience with ba. i wonder what those who spent 3000.00 one way thought.    the flight started badly in the so called new concorde lounge at dubai. i have reviewed this in the lounge section. the situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. on the 777 the first seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served the entire full cabin of 17  by one fa. he did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. the boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options 747787747. mine was starting to show signs of wear. no amuse bouche. as announced last month ba have cut back this cost. wow a 3 saving on a 300o one way ticket. well done ba. champagne was lukewarm as is often the case. lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. horrible in fact. the soup was the usual butternut squash soup do they offer anything else or am i unlucky and was lukewarm but okay. the apricot chicken was pleasant enough but i could not taste any apricot. a bistro product at best. later in the flight i had afternoon tea  sandwiches. all dry and tasteless. watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. landed without being stacked for a change. as one comes to expect with ba underwhelming due to the bean counters at lhr cutting back  as well as increasing fares. id like to see the entire ba board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier.    london gatwick to antigua. having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in antigua at a cost of 350 to british airways world traveller plus and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade better choice of meals and beverages. what we received was a polarisation of this  we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. having flown long haul with ba on numerous occasions in the past i am completely shocked at the service we received  it was more like a budget airline  we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off this was quickly followed with a drink service one drink per passenger we then received our meal service. i asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice  about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee. this is not the type of service i expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded world traveller plus cabin. after several hours when no other drinks service was offered i went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine  which neither one of us drink. as the flight wasnt full i cant believe there would be a problem you just dont expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours  certainly not what i would expect from an airline such as ba. our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasnt full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us. the service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie. same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant. i was looking to book a long haul holiday to the maldives next year with ba but after this flight and the appalling customer service i received when i complained about the service on the flight when i was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger tv screen and bigger seat  which i certainly dont think that justifies 350 upgrade fee. if you are thinking of upgrading i would think twice about what you are paying for. ba have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday i am not alone in making this decision and therefore i have booked my holiday next year with virgin atlantic. ba can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route. if that is the case they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid.    london gatwick to barbados with british airways. ba now stands for budget airways. having flown ba for many years in all classes from first to economy i could not believe how everything has declined so drastically. i was offered a drink no snacks were offered as in the past. there was a choice of 2 meals a pasta and sausages and mash by the time it got to me there was only one meal on offer i was refused a second bottle of wine with the meal. before arrival in barbados afternoon tea was a mini twix bar i took 2 and was ordered to put one back. the earphones for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears. the return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun. having recently flown on oman air virgin atlantic and turkish airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantastic. mr cruz should realise that he is running a once proud national airline not vueling ba as our national airline is a total embarrassment.   flew british airways from johannesburg to london heathrow. travelled several times in business class but booked first class this time. outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped centre seats food not great and entertainment options poor but great bed made up for this. yesterdays flight on a380 also disappointing but seats much better centre seats. entertainment better. food quality very poor. my starter of vegetable tart had uncooked pastry on the bottom. i returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potatocheese thing uncooked. the chef told me all meals arrived in packs and were just heated up. he could not alter the cooking time for the steak. i had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead. the sweet was just two slices of madeira cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something white. the breakfast muesli was horrible and the french toast was inedible. the wine didnt seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton. the first class lounge experience was very business class at the most. will not travel ba first again. felt very rushed in the morning with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and get dressed.    sofia to london heathrow and the flight was on time. however cabin interior is awful seats are cramped and uncomfortable. on board service quality has declined on ba flights and this flight was not exception. offered food was only a sandwich compared to hot meal recently  its a joke. economy class complimentary service will end soon. cabin crew was just ok but im giving 2 stars because they cant be much greater than the level of services provided. our luggage was delayed 45 mins at heathrow terminal 5. ba now offering lowcost airline standard  the only difference is price its more expensive which makes poor value for money. im still using ba regularly and i can see the obvious downgrade in standards during the last 23 years and even more dramatic decline in 2016. shame on british airways for sliding down to so cheap and so poor image  montreal to london and return to toronto. ow leg from montreal was the most average club experience to date. poor third party lounge with little food choice disappointing wines and little ambience. boeing 787800 aircraft was substituted by boeing 787900 which was good on the face of it except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets  annoying as gate staff unable to move me. with the air bridge withdrawn the plane went tech due to a power issue. two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. excellent updates from captain. however cabin crew were absent during the delay with biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. bizarrely first was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. drinks and dinner served promptly. my choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. no croissant offered left in oven in error and the orange juice has been downgraded to uht out of a carton. on the return leg from heathrow t5 the club lounge was very disappointing. shabby condition poor food and drink service by the third party provider with dirty  scruffy toilets which i had to queue for. worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. prompt boarding on a 777200 with the first entrance blocked off. the cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class.  friendly crew prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. ife had not changed since my flights in october which was disappointing. the amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. average menu with the usual suspects of beef chicken and cod but were cooked and presented really well. the promised cheese plate had already run out  only 4 loaded. seeing a theme here and so cheese was fetched from club. afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. in the race to the bottom ba continue to cut service  especially on the food front. i dont find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. this may save money and wasted food but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. in fact the crew were the only saving grace. ba dont seem to get it. even in premium cabins they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the uks flag carrier. biz and first class products are dropping at an alarming rate. wake up ba and iag  before its too late.    the space provided for business class seats on this flight is just ludicrous. i have flown budget airlines that offer better leg room. this carrier is aware that they have exclusivity on business class on this route as there are no alternatives. for the price paid for these tickets versus the value received this is daylight robbery. next time i need to travel to ct i will fly saa through jhb.    first leg dus to lhr was club europe. while business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. it was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. crumbs on the seat. table was sticky. asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. next leg from lhr to bos very similar experience business class was upgraded with an outstanding new ife but seats are still old. the housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. in general the 747400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the ife and some smaller details e.g. carpet should be replaced  extremely dirty and roved. lounge in lhr very outdated. boarding in lhr was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people dont listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. crew on board once again very friendly and effective. meal choice was ok. but my impression is that quality is going down e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. club kitchen  long time an outstanding feature of ba is a joke nowadays. selection seems to go down every time i fly. worst of all one of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. this itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. after identifying that my bag seems to be lost i went to the counter even if finding it is not that easy in boston. i explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that i did not checked another bag  although i had my tag that i could show to her. i had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. no apologies for inconvience at all. last year i had one bag that was delayed. this handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. summarizing flying ba for business for many years and on a regular basis now. the changes under the new boss can be seen. while in the past british airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. this time flight was one of the worst i ever had with ba. i assume that if there is no change in the near term i will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. if you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that i am not the only one thinking like this. i cant any longer recommend ba as especially the value for money is no longer given.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    london heathrow to delhi return. i thought air india was the worst until i traveled by british airways via premium economy.  prices are not at all comparable thus i assumed they must be charging more for nicer services but not all. british airways staff at delhi airport were rude and unprofessional. i have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin baggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle. another small camera pouch they consider as a separate bag. i was forced to give my cabin bag to my father in law and left with a normal handy bag with all stuff in it. coming to the aircraft food and staff  equally poor. food was horrific seats were torn headphone socket not working food tray was broken i was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs  tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches. staff was not able to help at all. nightmare experience.    marrakech to london gatwick with british airways. baggage allowance is a joke. doesnt matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff. apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane. however on boarding the plane there were people that had 3 or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours. these items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in. other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken. when we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on. when contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight. absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline. we will certainly never be using ba again.    i booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from bangkok to london angola london nigeria london and back to bangkok. before purchase i called the british airways service number on website and asked if i needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that ok  was told yes but have to pay a 150 fee and nothing else a little steep but ok. i further checked extras would be against the visa card used to purchase the ticket of course was the reply. ba make you pay to book a specific seat now. the trip started okay but the aircraft used on the bangkok flight very worn and old  anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting nigeria for 12 days business and looked like i could arrange to come home earlier  fired up the ba app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to rebook on the app as indicated  not given any local number to call  search out possible ba numbers  to find they no longer have an office in nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in india. operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of 1000. i decline this option and explain the 150 as advised actually app says change cost is 0. later ba call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost  hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market  however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by visa. it had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in abuja during bank open hours  some 6 hours and 300kms away. by now i had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with ba over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. taking this up with ba complaints  takes 2 month to elicit a first response  to be dealt with on one sided website. they do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their app refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their nigerian flights. my return flight to bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of ba cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off  and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former flag carrier but a worn out and low cost discount carrier. never again. heathrow to houston with british airways. worst travel experience of my life. firstly the seats were so bad and uncomfortable with poor cushioning  i couldnt relax or go to sleep for the duration of the flight. the movies were good but how am i supposed to watch it on a screen thats smaller than my ipad. the food was absolutely atrocious never in my life have i had such bad plane food. i wouldnt recommend for anyone to be quite frank.    chennai to london heathrow with british airways. ok service and flight but sunlight through the tinted windows was an issue as there are no blinds on the aircraft. i understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the 787 on a long daytime flight you cant cut out the sunshine just lower its intensity. seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over someone or have someone climbing over you. not up to standard. the lounge in chennai was also poor.    it was a horrible experience while coming back from sydney to singapore on british airways. our baby stroller was marked for some other airline en route to france so we now have to wait long way if it will finally come back to singapore.  we ordered special hindu meal. as per their staff hindu meal is a vegeterian. however we were served rice and lamb. after that there was no alternate arrangements made. even the refreshment meal was provided with the leftovers bread which was hard to eat. the cabin temperature was very low and worsened during our 8 hrs journey. i pledge not to take british airways ever. amsterdam to london. as a member of their executive club and someone who has flown with british airways 3 times this year i now regard them as the airline of last resort. the service on ba is beneath contempt. ryanair used to be the source of most complaints when flying but in my experience ryanair service and punctuality beats ba with their reliance on a long lost reputation. every ba flight i have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption. from disruption in the cabin the like of which i have never witnessed on any airline other than british airways to delays on nearly all ba flights i have taken in 2016 rude surly staff that act like ba was still a 1970s state enterprise. now when i search a flight and ba appears i shudder. it is even worth leaving the uk so you get a different national airline. there were even problems with the booking process. what makes matters worse is that british airways accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matters right.   london heathrow to san francisco with british airways. ba was once a classy airline for their first class service amenities and food. but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. they even hijack you for an additional 1000. or as i like to say you cough up 200k in points and the 1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 61 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. second the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers. a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. first class was maybe 50 full. when it was my turn i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu  she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. at the average price of 10000 for a first class seat ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. way to go ba you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. third when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first ba is always hit and mostly miss. finally what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba. i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience yes i say and not once has someone called. i am waiting for the day when ba announces all passengers including first should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale.   british airways from london to bangkok return. if you are thinking about flying british airways to bangkok. dont do it. thai airways or eva air for the same price offer a much better service for direct flights. if you want the best go with emirates but its a stop over flight. i fly this route 20 times a year. here are the key reasons why you should not fly with british airways. from my experience i believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying. the aircraft are very old. if you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you can you wait service is in 20 mins this has been tested a few times. they hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers. the next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins. entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm. no phone charger and no usb port. no wifi. seats are very old very uncomfortable    singapore to sydney in business class. the price was lowish so we booked—never again. seat comfort was almost nonexistent with appalling ergonomics. the inflight service hit a new low for me absolutely shambolic no team effort aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers. food and drink were cutprice and worsened by late wine and bread. no water offered and meal items forgotten. entertainment choices were subpar. no noisecancelling headphones. no cosmetics in the dirty toilets. a dollarshop amenity bag. i have had better economy experiences than this sector. shame on you british airways. \\r\\r\\n    hong kong to london seats 22k and 22j. it was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail. my other half who is 63 was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90 of the flight. the small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort. he couldnt even watch the inflight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. as a shorter limbed person at 54 i was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight. placed in the middle i barely had any where to put myself seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build. my headphone socket was crackling and the film i wanted to watch cleopatra with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time wasnt working it was just a black screen with audio. after travelling long haul last year to tokyo with another european airline i could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on ba. within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers. on ba we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink. on this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers. would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with ba long haul ever again.    london heathrow to zurich return using their business class. online check in and easy access through security at heathrow. lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminal. seats onboard a321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom  seat pitch. food also shows reals signs of cost reduction and ba is very much closer to lowcost carriers than airlines like lufthansa or swiss. staff service was best described as perfunctory  they provide f&b and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their christmas plans. return flight no different except that cabin staff did manage to say hello as we boarded flight. ba has become a very expensive and disappointing way to fly. what a disappointing experience flying british airways from london gatwick to mauritius. flew club class and the service was merely adequate they did what they had to do and no more  at no point we were made to feel valued customers. a request for a cup of tea after dinner resulted in no tea brought it was allegedly given to another passenger when we had fruit as a dessert it was given with no plate bread at breakfast was also given without a plate  had to be put directly onto the tray. on the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine werent available to view. given that we paid a lot of money for these tickets the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly. ba now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price. flew emirates last year to mauritius and there is no comparison. emirates wins hands down. ba needs to get its act together as it will loose customers.    absolute disgrace. they cancelled my flight 1 hour and 45 minutes before the the flight and put me on the next flight with 3 hours 15 minutes delay. i do have vip access to the lounges however non of the lounges in t5 accepts my lounge access cardcompany. when i asked the ba staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting 5 worth of voucher. surely they can do better than that. it probably doesnt mean anything to ba but i am not a happy customer.\\r\\r\\n    bassinets by british airways cater for newborn only. my 10 month old son could not fit in it. the only option was a child seat however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat. the only option is to sleep on you. however the arm rests are fixed in and hard. couple that with the need to breast feed your child with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat either his head would get banged on the armrest or hed kick the armrest at the other end. it was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from london to hong kong. other airlines offer bassinets up to one years some even 2 years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours. imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he cant fit in the seat. and every so often you fear hell fall off your lap. to travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and british airways refuse to do anything about it.    i have been a loyal ba frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well change. on my recent long haul flight to nairobi from london i was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free  like some cutrate budget short haul airline you have to pay. however unlike a budget airline ba fares remain higher than most. i returned from nairobi in premium economy  yet instead of getting something for the substantial extra fare i paid to be in premium breakfast consisted of 1 muffin  literally 1 muffin only  no juice no fruit no nothing. it is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have as i have always done accepted the higher fares for better service. even the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regime. it is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free. note that ba never cut fares when the price of oil halved making the current cutbacks about pure avarice. disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula. and i wouldnt blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated. the final insult was the response i got when i tweeted my above complaints. i was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast  while paying the same fare. which as is apparent to all a complete lie and insult to injury. i am flying again next week lon  nyc and hope not optimistically for better.  flight from lgw to st lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in. no priority tags available and i had to ask for them. i need not have bothered as the bags came off the plane last anyway. the ba 1st class lounge was still closed pending refurbishment. i do not think ba have any intention of reopening the lounge at lgw. the no 1 alternative is okay. boarded and shown to seat. noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight. all scruffy. flight took off on time to the minute. fas throughout were fine  but no personal address by name. seats look a little old  i suspect this plane was one of the first to have the new 1st class. the ife was certainly dated. meal was sort of okay. no amuse bouche anymore as ba want to cut further costs. had to settle for some motley peanuts. they soon run out of the premium champagne  i suspect they only had two bottles on board. crab appetizer was alright  nothing special. the usual butternut squash soup. this was my 5th 1st class flight this year and my 5th identical soup. i suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at ba hq. main course of sole was dry and tasteless. wines were fine and for once nicely chilled. another disappointing experience from ba  but to be honest over time you get used to a business class product in ba 1st class. i noted when i selected my seats that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a one way price was a staggering 4500. the flight was full  and if i paid 4500 for this  i would be in despair. i was asked recently why fly ba 1st class at all. its down to cubic meters of space.  and thats it. the alternative is bas business class  club world and that is an industry joke with the ying yang seats. off to perth in the spring and flying first. guess who we are not flying with.    british airways was known to be a quality airline but that does not apply any longer. my first bad experience earlier this year was to be told that my seat has been sold and they could not take me onboard. i had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so i could wait having a refreshment. but this 10th december was just not acceptable and my last trip with them. i had three flights lined up. san diego to seville all three operated with british airways. their first plane was late by two hours. by the time we arrived into london i had lost my connecting flight. they said i was on my own because i booked them separately so i had to buy new tickets and pay for my own stay overnight. their behaviour is one of a cheap airline that cannot be relied on and in case of delay does not help you to get to your destination.    london to philadelphia. we paid for the premium economy upgrade and the flight attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because the people behind us were complaining. that was not our problem and we did not get what we paid for full comfort of the upgrade. i have reached out to british airways several times to no avail. in fact the one time the british airways rep told me to falsify a travel insurance claim to get my money back.  london heathrow to cape town with british airways. paid extra to book 2 particular seats. both were broken. i had to sit upright for 11hours and my husband had to sit partially reclined to eat his meals. i had veggie meal which was served half hour before everyone else  no drink until everyone else served. choice of meal for husband was chicken curry or chicken curry. he doesnt like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal. same at breakfast  served half hour early so had to eat alone. when other breakfasts came out guess what no meat. on complaining to ba customer services told could choose another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra. been offered the insulting and derisory compensation of 20 off our next flight as if there will be a next flight  not even offered a refund of payment we made for booking broken seat. both airline and customer service disgraceful.    dallas ft worth to mumbai via london heathrow after a reroute due to lufthansa strike. overall british airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience. ground staff at dfw were ok though there was no agent in the lounge till about 3 hours before departure. on board the seat if flat but very narrow. food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china no flair and was unimaginative at best. crew on both flights were fairly mediocre  just went through the motions but didnt seem particularly interested in passenger service at all.the second meal on lhrbom was the worst meal i have had on an airplane  literally a deep fried potato and thats it. lounge at lhr was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection sad display for their main hub. overall i would not fly on ba by choice given their mediocre product. the still have 8 seat across in business compared with 4 on af aa and ua. shocking. there is nothing good to say about this trip  people with 3 pieces of hand luggage were allowed to board. business class seat pitch is tiny there is insufficient space to work. catering at this 15.30 hrs departure was a plate with 3 finger sandwiches that was it for a 2 hour and 10 minute flight in business class. moving map did not work. plane parked far away from the terminal amongst cargo planes bus only departed once all people had disembarked. no priority business class bus. altogether a terrible experience. going forward tap  you have my business. london heathrow to hong kong with british airways on theirn a380. i have had more legroom  seatspace on a 2 hour holiday charter flight to spain. dont know why i had to endure such a cramped position for 12 hrs. then to top it all im sorry sir we havent got any breakfast left. not a happy chappie. return journey same cramped conditions. for a long haul flight i would not recommend ba.    manchester to heathrow connecting onto virgin atlantic to shanghai. i arrived at manchester terminal 3 at 0800 and checked in to my booked flights. my outbound transfer flight ba1389 was delayed by over 3 hours schedule 0955 actual 1310. at manchester airport the ba service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers. after a 2 hour queue they refused to help me rebook any flights to shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the heathrow ba service desk. i boarded the late flight to manchester hoping that ba heathrow could help me with the connecting virgin atlantic flight when i arrived at heathrow. this delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to shanghai. my flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 schedule 1105 actual 1406. upon arrival at heathrow 1430 i proceeded to go to the ba service desk at terminal 5 to find the next flights to shanghai. after a 1 hour wait in the queue the ba service personnel were not only unhelpful but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. they refused to help me book another flight to shanghai they refused to book me on a flight back to manchester they refused to help me retrieve my luggage they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the 1814.60 air fare. i explained that i was now stranded in heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further. when i pleaded with the ba staff to move my return ba flight back to manchester forwards to allow me to get home the ba personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that i was no longer blocking other customers. at no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that i was in.  i was left outside terminal 5 with no transport no accommodation and no luggage. eventually after asking several helpful members of airport staff i retrieved my luggage from terminal 2. i organised myself a hotel in heathrow at 2000 after an exhausting 12 hours and now need to figure out how to get home.    flew club world from chengdu to london last week my first time on ba long haul for a few years. how they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery with the onboard product being simply awful  and this on a newer boeing 787 plane the cabin was tatty  tables loose problems with seat recline mechanism ife clunky and slow. the food was not even to economy standards and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving. amenity kit second rate the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish and whilst the flight was quite empty in business the service seemed to be on a goslow. staff when they appeared in the cabin were quite friendly but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that ba now provide. i will go back to using my preferred asian airlines and i can only assume other ba loyals will also start switching as the management seem intent on driving ba down to low cost airline levels. appalling food especially on the orlandogatwick return leg. choice of a horriblesmelling curry and a vegetarian pasta the pasta was as if it had been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory. there was a roll but no butter instead a tiny pot of spread that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered. for breakfast we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick. no juice etc. the attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when i asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. the amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable. the flight attendant suggested that i should recline my seat as well and couldnt understand when i refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite. eventually the passenger in front of me must have got the message because she put her seat back off her own bat. i felt very sad that my national airline of british airways has lowered itself to these standards of food and customer service. the seat was ok but nothing to write home about.    kiev to belfast via london heathrow. my last two flights on british airways have been a nightmare. the first flight ba informed me at the airport i no longer had a ticket as they had oversold the flight. they then explained i would have a free hotel stay as if i had won a prize. i avoided them for months after that one. then i slipped back into a bad habit and booked them again for a work trip to ukraine. on the return trip they asked me if i would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day as my outbound plane was delayed. i said no thank you as my ba connecting flight was delayed by the same amount. i arrived 90 minutes prior to take off for the connection all in the same terminal suddenly the boarding pass on my phone disappeared and was replaced with a ticket for 9.45am the following day. they ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought i would not make it. here i am is my reply. sorry sir the plane is now closed. so you sold my ticket on. no sir but the plane is closed. it cant be closed there is plenty of time. yes but there are no seats. i debated the point. i wouldnt debate the point sir a lot of people have been pushed off flights today and hotels in london are being booked out if i were you i would jump on the internet and find accommodation. because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in london ba cover rooms up to 200 fine though if you have kids they give you a mere 12.50 to cover breakfast lunch and dinner for each child  in london good luck. get a hotel arrive back at the airport the next day wait in line for 2 hours luckily i arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight get to the check in desk. guess what i am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away. again of course its my problem. go to the special management desk sir. at that desk they tell me it could be today i get home it could be tomorrow but its hard to say given the xmas period. but all in super surly tone and it was clear this was all my fault. you can try another airline sir but they are all booked out at this stage i began checking car rentals and ferry times. absolutely disgusting attitude. every other airline i have dealt with in these type of situations booked me a hotel and had a bus waiting or a taxi with a return boarding pass for the next day. its a shame as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch. a team that is utterly let down by corporate with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies. so i would love to fly ba for the crew and pilots but given their utterly terrible customer care its just not worth it. bangkok to manchester via london. i used to fly ba on this route on a regular basis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering. more recently weve been using emirates or etihad. we travel the route two or three times a year to visit family. ba were offering a good price on their premium economy seats so we switched. what a big mistake. never ever again. despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a 40  50 surcharge. reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together. in the end it was ok but we cant get over the cheek of charging to book a seat  emirates and etihad dont charge. the seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable. leg room was ok but the seats were very narrow. nothing like the comfort of emirates or etihad in economy. inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent. picture quality was like watching a tv in the 1950s. food was appalling. little choice insipid starters and mains swimming in water. other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil if you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane. cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful. the plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places. certainly on this route ba have not invested in their fleet and are a decade behind emirates and etihad when it comes to comfort and service. the return flight from st lucia started well. to my surprise the business class lounge for 1st and club customers at the airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the british airways flight was the only one leaving at this hour. it was very nice  considerably better than the dive at antigua. it was light and airy very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped bar. we enjoyed our stay there. it was some trek to the plane. as i entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1a a lady fa almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass  we have to see it she said sharply its a security process. i was startled at the aggressive tone as if i was trying to sneak on the plane. very strange as i had passed three boarding pass checks anyway. pre flight drinks was the usual lukewarm champagne. plane left on time to the minute. there were five empty seats in 1st. i found my miserable looking ever thinning pillow they get smaller with every flight to save money and went looking to sneakily find another. can you believe this five empty seats. four empty overhead bins. one remaining pillow in the fifth bin which i grabbed. even with two  on lie flat i had hardly any head support. my wife asked for a 2nd pillow. sorry madam we have none to spare. dinner started with quinoa salad and smoked trout. it was alright. cream of broccoli soup likewise alright. balsamic honey glazed chicken for mains was a disaster. dried out. unedible. fas made up my bed. it was hard as rock and very uncomfortable. i slept not for one minute. nor did my wife. nor did the lady in the adjacent seat. i flew the a380 in 1st last spring to singapore and slept for 5 hours  but it was far more softer to sleep on. i can only surmise the seat about five years old  was worn out. the side areas were also very grubby. we both embarked totally shattered. the plane generally was very tired. worn carpets that really should be replaced. the usual cheap amenities bag rounded off the usual poor experience with ba 1st class. the ife was very dated. one wonders if the ba board every think of flying with an asian or middle eastern carrier to discover what true 1st class should look like. fas  apart from the rude one  were great. the landing at lgw was by a highly skilled pilot  and in 35 years of travel the softest touchdown i can recall.    flew from heathrow to buenos aires. i havent flown british airways for around 10 years and with work i usually fly either middleeastern or asian airlines what a contrast i doubt ba have changed anything in that aircraft in the 10 years since i last flew. the tv screen is just 6in low resolution with a very small number of ok films available nothing of interest with the music either. food was quite tasty but small portion no side salad. drinks other than water were only offered at meal times. seats are so narrow  i paid extra for the emergency seat 85 after reading how narrow the seats were a wise decision but i shouldnt be paying extra as all middleeast and asian airlines i have flown have bigger seats better food choice better entertainment  how can they offer such a poor service    flew london heathrow to bangkok with british airways in premium economy in an old tired plane. the tray table didnt work in fact broken and the screen was dirty the colour was going. white wine was warm starter was a strange red cabbage in mayonnaise dreadful. main was a good piece of beef with unpleasant veg then what appeared to be a piece of cake. the staff then disappeared. the trays werent then cleared for an hour. when i went to the back for another drink all the staff were there having a coffee besieged by people wanting things. they had lost a grip of the service. in economy people were working round the uncleared food trays. the breakfast was english better than dinner but no bread just awful danish pastry. poor thinking of what premium economy costs.    disappointed. almost all other airlines will have same or better leg room definitely better meals and cost a lot less so dont choose british airways unless you are getting a good deal. no choice of meals only veg or non veg and the quality and quantity was extremely poor. they dont even contain any salad. no snacks with the drinks. delhi  london was approx 10 hrs but served only one meal. was informed by the steward that only veg meals left and the meal was just dumped without even bothering to ask us if we would like to have it. same on the leg from london to washington dc. not that it mattered because the meals are not at all good. to top it all my luggage did not arrive on return to washington dc.    my family and i were flying from dubai to london on 19th december. we had our 4 children including our 2 year old twin girls who were flying for the first time. after an hour into the journey the twins started to cry. we tried comforting them walking with them etc but couldnt stop them. i went to the galley and requested for a snack for my daughters and was told the meal will be served shortly. however it took an hour at least to serve the meal. the twins continued crying as they didnt eat the main meal. i went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored eventually a steward came to collect a trolley for business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help. i explained the situation to him and he gave me a packet which contained two biscuits. i thanked him and left. the cabin staff would rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated tired hungry children. has lost my custom and i wont be flying with ba ever again    baltimore washington to london heathrow. bad start for my first trip on british airways. extra cost for decent seat meant nothing. bought a midcabin seat for my wife and i. flight delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical problem. so for the insult of paying for reasonable seats my wife and i were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft  no refund just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft. this caused us to miss our connecting flight to venice thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at heathrow. overall a loss of a half day. thinking that ba would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights was wasted. a couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. a suggestion that access to the british airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment. no real remorse matter of fact responses like gee this happens a lot and good luck. no customer loyalty sought. dispassionate professional but not really friendly. staff seemed tired and overworked at counters.    this was a much better flight than our outward lhrbkk with british airways. the staff were on the ball worked hard and always around. a nice plane good ife with wide modern screen. seats were fine although storage lacking compared to a380. food still a letdown . chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggy. white wine good red poor. breakfast scrambled eggs and steak spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible. i got a decent sleep.    dubai to toronto via london and i tried to checkin online. however this was blocked and upon enquiry to bas unhelpful customer contact centre i was told it was a random security hold by airport authorities. when i questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing eta for travel to canada. when i informed her that could not be the case as i was a dual ukcanadian citizen she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of bas control. the second joy i had with lovely ba and staff was at heathrow during transit. as i had a 6hour layover i elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at t5 arrivals. upon entering departures i was stopped by one of ba senior managers who forced me to check in my carryon luggage despite it being cleared by ba in dubai but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. perhaps she is the model random manager ba aspires to for future leadership. in any case this manager was so eager to check by carry on in that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the checkin agents location. such is the competency and class of this manager but then again one can expect no less from ba either. finally at toronto the checked in carry on came halfhour after the already delayed regular checkedin luggage – adding salt to wound. i flew to london from dubai several times last year on emirates and on klmdeltaair france to toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carryon from any of them. finally i called the uk customer relations center from toronto but i gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. they are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too. i wish i could give this rotten airline 010 but the minimum is 110 and i am happy with that.    london heathrow to hong kong was the most disappointing business class experience. the bottom line is that ba had 8 business class seats in a row on this boeing 777 from lhr to hkg. the seats on ba are narrow lack privacy the face of a stranger next to me facing in the opposite direction was about 2 feet 60 cm from me and dont even dream about any storage space i couldnt find a flat surface to place my eyeglasses on and i kept my water bottle on the floor under the seat. the footrest had to be operated manually. the entire experience was so irritating that i didnt know whether i should complain or just laugh at it. i have no idea how ba can get away with this. they certainly wont see me as a customer again.   london heathrow to copenhagen. after many horrible experiences on ba i am convinced this airline has total contempt not only for its customers but even for top tier elite frequent flyers. i am aa executive platinum and i am being treated worse than cattle  forced to check in carryon bag which is within the ba limits on multiple occasions denied boarding zero upgrade policy zero flexibility when being forcefully rebooked recently i had to pay 300 in addition to an already expensive 400 ticket for a 2 hr eu flight. i live in london and im a loyal american airlines frequent flyer clocking around 200000 miles a year. i will avoid british airways even if it means an extra connection flying a low cost carrier or not flying at all.    london gatwick to antigua return. the charge to reserve your seat is extortionate the check in staff at gatwick were miserable to the point of rudeness. the inflight meal was appalling and the pre arrival mealsnack was a joke. british airways is run by bean counters who want to charge  extricate the maximum amount of money for the minimum expenditure. no wonder british airways are slipping down the ratings lists.    on my way home on 1st january 2017 athens to lhr the flight ba633 had 3 hours delayed departure. despite the fact this ticket costs 220 and an addition of a 20 for a seat which later came down to 8 and an astonishing 70 euros for luggage the only thing that we were offered inflight was a sandwich. no headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and  i had a fault on the lights above the seats. this airline is going down fast and i will be happy to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputation of ba. i will try not to fly them again. they are worse than ryanair. at least with ryanair you know what to expect. ba has the logo to fly to serve i think it should be changed to fly to rip off and make your lives a hell on the air.    stockholm to denver via london heathrow. the boeing 747400 was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolution. the movies were quite limited. the seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated. there was limited space for storage both bags and stuff in the seat pocket. a blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good. all and all not a bad experience  but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experience. i flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features entertainment food and comfort.    london heathrow to tehran return. the check in staff could have been a little more flexible although a few friends and my baggage were overweight and eventually due to a friend getting an upgrade we managed to sort it all out.  i was disappointed with the lack of food provided by british airways on this flight. gone are the days where you get a pack of peanuts with the drink early on in the flight. the muslim meal was really not nice at all and i should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice i was so tired however outbound and inbound i found the seats to be decent. inflight entertainment was quite good too did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phones however. british airways just dont seem to be in the same league as others such as qatar airways emirates virgin etc.    cancun to london gatwick with british airways. the worst breakfast ive ever had. i was looking forward to my first flight with british airways thinking that they were a leading airline. in my view they are nothing special. i was looking forward to a nice breakfast before landing back at gatwick from mexico. we were given a cheese roll yoghurt and a cereal bar. i couldnt eat the cheese roll as it was so bland ate the yoghurt and saved the cereal bar for my 2 hour drive home. okay i got a good price and flew economy but thats exactly what i got  a flight that seemed to focus on economy. i would be happy from now on to pay more for another airline.    madrid to montreal via london heathrow. coming back from my honeymoon me and my wife had our luggage misplaced and is missing over the holidays 3 weeks of clothes in our suitcases and no one is able to give us answers to where it is or why its missing. i cant even get a hold of anyone in their offices to speak to in regards to a claim everyone says to do it online sure and how long is it going to take for someone to get back to me this is not a way to handle customers. i will make sure to never fly on british airways again.    london heathrow to miami with british airways in economy class. two hours late and terrible service when able to board. the flight attendants seemed too young and they did not care to anyones concerns. i now see why british airways has lost it class they really dont care about the customer. i can honestly say i will never fly british airways again no matter if they are the lowest priced carrier.    london gatwick to barbados return. we were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to barbados. after take off we were served complimentary drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been abolished but wasnt unduly concerned. dinner was served shortly afterwards which i was good although cheese and biscuits had been cut too. the flight time was almost 9 hours so we were feeling hungry 4 hours after the main meal. i was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat a small bag of crisps or 2 small biscuits the cabin staff told me it was the new policy and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles  there were not even any sandwiches for sale fortunately for us soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and i noticed she was carrying a sandwich i asked her where she had got it and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it  no one advised us that there was only one meal in 9 hours if so we would have bought a sandwich with us. i looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut backs. so if your planning on travelling with british airways economy to barbados make sure you pack a sandwich. return flight we was prepared as only a biscuit was given out. will be travelling with virgin next time    travelled british airways from london to kuala lumpur return. had a painful 13 hour fight as i had a window seat with a metal box in the leg room areas which meant my feet were slanted to one side throughout the flight. on my way back the inflight entertainment didnt work. after numerous attempts to reset by the cabin crew it still didnt work for my partner and i. for the price of the ticket this was not acceptable.    manchester to los angeles via heathrow. im always reminded that british airways is one of the worst airlines every time i fly with them. the check in service is as bad as they get. they have sent my bags to heathrow even though im going to lax. i expect them to know check or at least ask where im going. to make things worse the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because i booked two separate tickets which i know for a fact that i didnt because i booked a roundtheworld flight. staff have attitude across the board. poor food on long haul flights. struggling to think of many ways they could be worse. a real embarrassment that british airways is my countrys main airline.    manchester to las vegas via manchester. i went to the trouble of checking in online printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my bag at the airport to be told that is not allowed i was told i had no option but to queue up with everybody else checking in. after 1 hour in the horrific queue i am told there is no space for a bag drop at manchester t3. the agent said this with 4 empty checkin desks next to her. british airways disgust me with this hoopjumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feet. thank you for the complimentary microbag of crisps on the delayed lhrman leg if i never see baaa ever again itll be too soon.\\r\\r\\n    well ive checked in online hoping that it would actually speed things up when at the airport. silly me. the queue was ridiculous for bag drop and i had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag the queue for assisted check in was far quicker – i think that things got inverted now. maybe quicker to check in at the airport so i was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight. british airways were completely under staffed and disorganised. there were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues. total fail. i felt i was flying with a low cost airline. i kept checking the flight details for any planned delays  it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow etc but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 10.22 instead of the planned departure at 10.00. well that was the case until 5 minutes before 10.22 finally we got updated. i doubt that this was only known at that time. why wasnt there an update before anyway new departure time scheduled for 11.59. we only started boarding at 11.00. then inside the cabin we waited for another hour until taking off. at no point did ba offer vouchers. we only ate inside the cabin after 2am. the flight was terrible but thats another story. i see no point at flying with ba for a few years now. staff are old and entitled. when you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft you are presented with filthy dirty seats. food getting worse and worse and in board entertaining – almost nonexistent. a few years ago you could actually slowly save miles nowadays you get almost nothing. ba used to be good not just an ordinary lazy airline living from its glories.    miami to london business class. living in london and flying international long haul flights throughout the year i have once again been disappointed by british airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins. our family of four were travelling home from the christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when i was ready to sleep i attempted to recline my seat in the flat bed position. my seat would not recline. the flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. these are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. i notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. sadly he did not. i was informed that the headpurser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half. hopefully his accommodations were better than mine. prior to landing 20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of ba and said he could compensate me with either 50 or 10000 avios. i informed him there was a far greater price point between premium economy vs. business class. understandably he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing. i received a call from a ba representative and i was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation  50 or 10000 avios. i currently have 588500 avois on ba that is nearly impossible to use. i requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from heathrow to atlanta from a premium economy seat to a business class seat. the ba representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the business class experience  the food individual flight attendant service and comfort. sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a business class seat  not the food. my comfort was not met. the flight attendants on ba have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin the point was to sleep.    i paid almost 300 to fly from london to frankfurt. the flight took off and then was rerouted back to london because of weather and german air space closing. the communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room only to learn they still hadnt rebooked my flight. while waiting in line i tried multiple times to call their customer service number and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell phone costs. the rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning. which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare london heatwave. i landed almost a day later than planned but my bag didnt make it from london for another four days. british airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses theyd reimburse yet then denied portions of my claim. the delays lost baggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holiday. i complained to their customer service team and after a lot of back and forth they offered a 20 pound travel voucher. such a horrible experience with this airline will never fly them again    ive flown this route sydney to london many times with other airlines and british airways is the worst. they changed our seats during the fuel stop at singapore  without notice without explanation. the food was terrible  no fruit or green vegetable to be seen. cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy  bumped into numerous times. toilet locations on board are terrible  those poor people seated right next to the wc door. paid extra for reserved seats  no confirmation. inflight entertainment was awful  really really old movies. this airline trades on some nostalgic image as if they were in the 1950s. other airlines are far superior. dont risk it  youll be disappointed.    flight from athens to heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the norm for this flight with ba. however a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight no explanation as to the reason. fortunately i was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices. this was a 4 hour flight by the way. i had no idea that ba are now charging for food and drink even for water they kept that one quiet. i rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring. how long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as ryanair. will they be selling lottery tickets next payasyou go toilet british airways still refer to themselves as the worlds favourite airline. based on who`s opinion exactly see no point in using ba now. they usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route. they have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers. i fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid ba. with this latest money grabbing scam i will change my scheduling to avoid them. there are plenty other quality carriers who like ba are struggling to maintain profits. all have the same threat of terrorism fluctuating oil prices adverse weather airtraffic control strikes etc. but they are not punishing the very people who keep their planes in the air.    paris cdg to bangkok via london heathrow in business class. it was my first flight with ba and probably my last one. ba is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cutting. in business class each row has 8 seats never seen that in a recent business class and you can forget any privacy. the seat is comfortable in sitting position but becomes not comfy in bed position as you have to open a second tiny seat to put your feet. not convenient. the ife screen is tiny smaller than in economy in recent airplanes. the movie selection was very poor. the meal was bad and quantity was very poor. 3 tiny toilets for the business class not enough.   we had the pleasure of flying back to the uk on the first day of bas fantastic idea of starting to charge for drinks and snacks a la sister company iberia. someone please explain to me what the difference is with ryanair easyjet and norwegian now its become a budget airline and i for one wont be using them anymore if i can avoid it. they cut the avios for flights made it more difficult to go up tiers and now this joke im not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a 4 hour flight i expect ba to give me a drink. then when i wanted to buy a sandwich i was told that there were only 3 for the entire plane and they sold out. salad then sold out. some crisps unfortunately the person in front of me got the last bag. ba you arent iberia or air lingus. stop this nonsense please. take an example to klm. the week before ams  mad hot pasta 2 rounds of drinks and then cake with coffee or tea and that was economy also. i will avoid ba like the plague now sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until they become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits.   flew london gatwick to cancun in business class on a b777 that looked in need of a major refurbishment. the cabin was drab and dated the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited the food was for business class not particularly good quality and poorly presented  in particular the second meal on an 11 hour flight was a packet of sandwiches and some cake. i am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class id have thought ba could make some effort to present the food better. in summary the experience compared very badly to asian or middle eastern airlines ive used.    \\r\\r\\nthis latest british airways trip from london heathrow to dallas fort worth just confirms how standards are slipping. background family living in usa  regular leisure transatlantic flyer in the last 10 years consistently booking for 23 travellers on each trip regularly flying business for eastbound transatlantic leg. to date transatlantic travel over 30 years has been exclusively with british airways. service has been almost consistently good or very good. we may not be gold or silver members but we dont deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1 original booking for outbound lhrdfw leg was booked by ba agent over the phone in the wrong categoryclass even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade cash or airmiles at a later date. subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce with consistently inconsistent responses  when we eventually managed to get through. the executive club customer service link just sends you round in circles a formal emailed complaint through contact us resulted in were sorry to hear youve had problems  but no solution offered. teeth gritted and traveled. 2 9.5 hour flight lhrdfw departing 1030. refreshmentsdrinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry no nibbles. when asked steward responded well thats cutbacks for you. preordered childs meal arrived 1230 before standard adult meals. no problem. juice and water were available during the afternoon. no snacks available for children for 5 hours cutbacks. luckily i had a packet of shortbread as a gift for friends in usa. at 1830 cabin service tea started. when i asked for daughters preordered childs meal conversation with stewardess went thus  why didnt you order one i did she didnt have a childs meal at lunch yes she did oh well ill check when ive finished serving the main cabin really we were only in the 3rd or 4th row  would it have been too much effort to check then clearly yes it would. and when she did check some 20 minutes later there was no childs meal  so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused childs lunch very ungraciously. no hint of an apology. customer service customer satisfaction result continued loyalty for transatlantic flights what do you think    london to hong kong return. through no fault of our own very laterunning bus major road accident and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and i missed our 18.30 flight to hong kong on december 12th. we thought we would be rebooked on the later 20.50 flight especially since we had business class tickets. instead we were told by the ba official at the misnamed ‘customer services desk that we had ‘voluntarily missed our plane i assume that was code for ‘its your fault not our problem that was certainly what his attitude conveyed. we were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of 1478 to take the 20.50 flight take a downgrade to premium economy without a guarantee that ba would reimburse us the difference in seat price or wait four days. the ba official couldnt have been less flexible or sympathetic and ba has responded to my complaint via twitter with the same disinterest. my travel companions business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday. any pleasure she might have got from it and mine in giving it to her were ruined by the way we were treated. on the halfempty flight back on new years eve the crew obviously didnt want to be there was barely courteous and when my friend a diabetic enquired what would be in her special meal she was told noone knew. they clearly didnt care either. they did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege she was being granted. i would have thought and expected a little more courtesy and grace especially in business class. god knows how the poor souls in the back were treated. i have given my preference to ba for years in order to support my home airline. sadly i dont think they deserve my custom any longer so the next time we fly to asia we will take one of the gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom. bas only concern these days is profit at any price their customer service is as poor as any ive ever come across and their corporate motto ‘to fly to serve an embarrassing joke. ive flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years but i wont be doing it again unless it cant possibly be avoided. the saddest thing of all is that i dont think british airways will give a damn.    london heathrow to prague. ive been commuting to and from work for last six and half years. the only airline that takes me to london heathrow is british airways. sometimes i fly there and back up to two times a week. i do not eat on flights so i thought bas decision to charge for food was not gonna upset me too much. however theyve managed. i always bring my own good quality tea and a cup and ask crew for some hot water. drink my tea and go to sleep. to my surprise i am not allowed to get hot water anymore in fact i am not allowed to get any water on ba shorthaul flight unless i pay even if i bring my own cup and tea or unless its medical emergency then i could get cup of cold water for free. so not only they didnt lower the fare but they also sucessfully joined budget airline bunch by charging even for water to my great regret they are the only airline that takes me to heathrow so i cant take my custom anywhere else unless i change job. but if i am to fly on holiday british airways will not be my chosen carrier ever again.    never again booked a round trip from to london from paris return with british airways in business as had a separate ticket from paris to johannesburg with af in business class and cape town to paris with qatar in business class. on the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in london t5. checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which i found strange being a business class passenger. the reason i chose the ba flight was that it was from the same airport cdg as where my flight from cape town via doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing i wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to london. the plan was to get refreshed in the lounge rest for few hours and get on the flight. unfortunately my plans were trashed when i arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that i had been rebooked from orly which is an hour away. it didnt stop there no transfer was provided and when asked how do i get there the unfriendly reply was well get a bus. no indication of where. the woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. tried to get some more information to which the reply was go online. she gave me a paper which i thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. thought ok at least something. the next shock when i arrived in orly. the check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy as i was very tired and just wanted to get home agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. oh no not possible at this point i was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. was told that it was not possible and that i could go online and complain. gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating go online i dont care about ba. when back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. complained again as had the paper from the cdg ground crew about compensation. generic reply after 5 minutes was no compensation. needless to say i will never fly with ba again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who i frequently fly with in business class and am a ff luckily not of ba.   not fair for the fare. flew bangkok to paris via london with british airways. not allowed to choose our seats. the cabin was not clean lot of dust. 8 seats per row in business no privacy 50 of the seats dont have direct access to the aisle. bad meals in small portions. not enough toilets. tiny ptv screen and poor movie selection. crew was very friendly and helpful. we had to face the bad mood of the ground staff in london who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the london to paris flight. we explained that we were in business class and that we flew with the same cases at the beginning of our vacation they didnt care and refused us to bring it on board. after 30 minutes i showed that they were of a size allowed by ba. they recognized their mistake and let us take it. 30 minutes of stress because they didnt do their job properly. wont fly ba again except for the cabin crew everything was bad and looking like budget airline.   glasgow to london gatwick with british airways. absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flight. i arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin. i struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight. no idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight. pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly.    london to cape town. galleries lounge at t3 tatty and overcrowded. takeoff delayed by an hour because of weather issues but we were kept well informed while waiting for push back. seats 62jk on upper deck excellent for a couple although the plane was looking its age with patching up wherever you looked. ife long past its due replacement date with small screen and poor resolution. cabin crew friendly enough. meal the usual substandard ba fare with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains. hotel chocolat chocs have now disappeared. arrival at cpt only 30 mins behind schedule. cape town to london the galleries lounge at cpt spacious but quickly became packed with pax from two flights. food options dreadful with the worst hot food weve encountered in any business class lounge. cheese prepackaged. mcc available but no champagne. push back 15 mins ahead of schedule. same seats on upper deck. meal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast. arrived ahead of schedule. overall the flight itself was the usual ba service. onboard was another matter with seats and service way below bas competitors and at inflated prices.   in september 2016 i flew with british airways in first from london to kuala lumpur on flight ba0033. initial impressions were positive. the checkin was efficient with polite and friendly staff. the concorde room was a nice place to be. my first suite 2a offered a good amount of comfort space and privacy. fast forward 12 hours. would i fly in british airways first again no. would i fly with british airways again no. this is why on the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the first cabin with 8 passengers. the 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. the 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. the supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. i had to ask twice for a replacement set. it took over 40 minutes to receive this. once airborne i ordered a cappuccino. i had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. there were multiple issues with my dinner  i was the second person to order my dinner yet the last person to be served. it took over 2 hours to get my dinner. someone who had ordered after me got my dinner option i was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available. it would appear that this passenger had a higher executive club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. i was only given the option of a club world main course which was delayed further as i was initially given the wrong order. this delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and i was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. there were issues with my breakfast despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. i ordered a cappuccino the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. when i enquired again some 40 minutes after i had placed my order i was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore i could not have this. i was extremely disappointed as at the material time i placed my order and for some time after this there had been no seat belt sign displayed. the first cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. formal complaint within 24 hours of landing in kul i wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the ceo of british airways alex cruz. the ‘you first department at british airways confirmed receipt of my email. subsequently i received a very generic response from british airways customer relations. no attempt was made to address or even explore the issues that gave rise to my complaint. this was disappointing. i was simply offered 10000 avios points. i responded by return rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why i had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by british airways to address the issues that i had outlined in my formal complaint. the response from british airways customer relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10000 avios points was because british airways have to be consistent so were fair to all our customers. i found this statement somewhat ironic.    st petersburgh to london. i dont know where ba got this market research to say stop complementary meals we prefer to pay for it  ive yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion. if you want to buy something different you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding. i suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true though i suspect the real reason is cost cutting ba just doesnt want to admit it. ba would be better off to admit it customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good. to tell me that charging 1.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when i can buy the same thing in tesco for 63p insults my intelligence they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market again a great image to promote to the world. where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a ba passenger where any alternative exists. pay extra for checked luggage pay extra for drinks pay extra for food im sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a budget airline.    british airways is a budget airline at premium airline prices. flew from gatwick to cancun. however if you wanted snacks on a very long flight you have to buy them on board and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry. you do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight. there was also nowhere to plug in laptops which you expect on a long and expensive flightespecially when you have work to do. the plane was also so cold too cold to concentrate on work. it would take a great deal to choose them again.    shanghai to zurich via london return and british airways is absolutely appalling. i have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline. i booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and i to go from shanghai to zurich via london. on the way there the flight to zurich was cancelled due to french strike not bas fault so that part is clear. however they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled furthermore they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours after a 12 hours flight to go through customs thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers find a hotel arrange our own transport there and back. so the first leg already left a terrible impression. then on the way back to shanghai they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and i to economy for a 12 hour flight. i booked premium economy for a reason my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy did ba care no. told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat then at boarding told us sorry its either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat. because i had work the next day we had no option but to fly and ba ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap. three months down the track i have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbersemails to write to only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole. needless to say i will forever boycott ba for its incompetence and insincerity towards a paying customer.     we travelled business class from gatwick to barbados return for christmas 2016. the outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all  food crumbs around seat area stained carpets wet toilet floors etc. the cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we hang it up wherever you can find space  we collected our own coats prior to landing. when the food was served we had been noted as not eating  when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess the two hot options were unavailable  i had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without. the quality of the videoaudio was very poor  the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable. on the return flight the executive lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal. during the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum  not a very professional image on our return the only response by ba to our complaints was additional avios points  an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of.    london heathrow to cape town return. having previously flown ba first class on the boeing 777 and a380 this trip on an ageing boeing 747400 from heathrow terminal 3 was disappointing. the sooner ba replace these aircraft the better. i had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats which looked more like bas dreadful club world seats. the first disappointment came after prebooking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying we would get a club world meal instead. why there are only 14 first class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few avios as compensation the ife screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good. the good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabin. ba need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition. priority boarding is a joke anybody with a bronze executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate. priorities need reassessing and controlling. special needs and first class passengers first and then trickle down from there. they also need to maintain the aircraft to a better standard or replace them more quickly.    london heathrow to chicago in first with british airways. it was better than my last trip in club world but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around asia not with ba one quickly realises how subpar most of the ba experience has become. airport service at heathrow distinctly average and economy style. onboard some staff friendly some surly and frankly lazy. loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight. while i dont fly to dine this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines and cost saving is clearly evident. ife was okay. trouble is there is no proper competition on this route as us carriers cant be classified in the first class league.    we flew from heathrow to larnaca return. the aeroplane was old and tired uncomfortable seats overhead tv screens which can hardly be viewed from the seats we had chose. my headphones did not work in the seat either. but apart from it being a somewhat ok ish journey the offering of food and drink was shocking. we can only choose food and drink from a marks and spencers booklet believe me the food is not up to m&s quality they should never have put their good name behind this ba endeavour to cut costs. whilst i accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit card which had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shameful. what on earth are ba thinking about british airways are seriously letting themselves down badly. we felt like low budget airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets. indeed if we had flown with easyjet or ryanair we would have saved ourselves hundreds of pounds. i will certainly be seeking out other airlines for our frequent bookings to cyprus which amounts to at least 5 or 6 trips a year.  m&s dont spoil your good reputation with this venture.    london to phoenix with british airways in premium economy. possibly the worst customer service and flight attendants ever both outward and inward flight. the plane was dirty old and smelly. the cabin crew were rude unhelpful with their customer service who simply ignore your complaints. british airways should stand for budget airline.    flew from gatwick to tampa business class on 7th january. the experience can only be described as appalling. the business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal. we had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay 37.50 could use. this meant it was overcrowded and dirty through no fault of the regular staff. they just could not keep up with the number of passengers. we could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised ba staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free. the ba ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end. the flight was mediocre to say the least. the food was average and the service satisfactory. having paid 2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service. we formally complained to british airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future we were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided. this is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with british airways we will be travelling virgin even if it means we have to get several connecting flights to our destination.\\r\\r\\n    flew british airways from miami to london heathrow on 15th january and the aircraft was filthy in economy class. pulled out the tiny tv from under the armrest and there was hair attached. opened the armrest to retrieve table and the dirt was disgusting this has been an accumulation over a long period of time. tv didnt work and after 3 hours into a 8.5 hour flight and the attendant trying to reboot it 3 times i finally asked what could be done. i had paid extra for a seat that had extra leg room seat 29a as there is no seat in front and you could stretch right out. there was a seat free in business class but the manager on the flight made it clear that he was not allowed to move me. i traveled business class on the outbound flight on 3rd jan but did not feel that it was value for money. i will stick with emirates or virgin in the future as i know the aircraft are clean with good customer service. i logged this complaint onboard at the time but a week later still heard nothing doesnt surprise me.    london heathrow to dubai and a delayed flight. poor communications from lhr british airways staff. horrible food. crowded flight and a mars mini bite size for breakfast. unmotivated crew. all the money they have made seems to go to senior management. a disgrace and sad to have experienced and will avoid them.    london heathrow to milan return. how british airways have fallen in their service and product  they are no better than ryanair now and frankly unless lhr is convenient to you i would seek another airline. not even a drink offered unless you pay although another passenger stated water was free but it was not offered. seats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anything. i checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that i immediately ripped off. the only benefit was my frequent flier tier meant i got early boarding this is my last trip through lhr as the connection procedure is so awful. american airlines are now better than british airways and that says it all.    flew british airways from london gatwick to bridge town. flight good staff attentive. inflight food shocking. second year running no choice just a pasta. the whole meal was economy with a big e. i doubt the whole tray cost 1gbp. the only other food was a coffee and the worlds smallest kitkat. for an eight  hour flight appalling. ba should be ashamed andor put another ten pounds on the ticket and give a proper meal. have flown virgin thomas cook etc outstandingly ba the worst. fly virgin.     how the mighty have fallen or should i say continue to fall. my partner and i booked tickets from london to johannesburg back in september 16 we paid approx 1700 for the 2 economy tickets slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats. it was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new a380 our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft  not life threatening just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag we were surprised about the lack of space. our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced here is your vegetable lasagne rather than explaining that for our 1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal chicken or beef as they had ran out of these they made no effort to remedy the situation whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know all i can say is that i am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasnt happy with a vegetable lasagne so i had no meal as a result. as i left the aircraft i received a text from ba asking for feedback on the flight i took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. whilst i was in johannesburg i tried to contact call johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at ba is like trying to get an audience with pope francis i eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didnt qualify for any redress i then challenged this i explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1 would i have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight no and 2 would ba if they were reasonable expect me to pay the full cost. in summary i eventually was offered 15 credit off my next ba flight  totally unacceptable as i dont fly that often even 15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient i felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and its onboard service and the same for its customer relations which arrogantly doesnt give a damn. looking back the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me.    london heathrow to zurich. because of fog in morning at heathrow i have called ba and checked online for delays of my late afternoon flight. i was told several times that the flight was on time. after a disorganized boarding the door of the aircraft was closed 15 minutes late. then the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure because of fog in the morning at heathrow airport. at the end we arrived with 1.5 hours delay in zurich. when airborne we were informed about the new catering concept  of british airways for economy class passengers on european flights. you have to pay for food and the drinks. thanks to the delay we spent more then two and a half hour on a ba plane and we did not receive a free glass of water.    madrid to london. fairly chaotic check in largely down to the iberia staff. boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew. seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards cabin was reasonably clean. flight crew gave good information. inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales and this was where the chaos started. the time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. i was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. before landing i spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. this was not a cheap fare that i got and british airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service buy onboard etc. what a lie i have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before ba stopped any complimentary service. sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of lufthansa and air france.    the decline of british airways. my review is primarily on ba euro traveller in economy. up to two years ago one felt good when travelling ba. they were miles ahead of budget airlines. yes they were a bit more expensive but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage checked in cases of 20kg all part of the service. today ba provides no free food or beverage and require extra payment for check in luggage. today within europe ba has absolutely no advantage opposite easyjet norwegian monarch or even ryanair. why should anyone pay extra for ba they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. incidentally coming back from malta to london gatwick in ba in business class there is nowhere to hang coats. previously ba flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. and now no cupboards extra seats instead. the decline and fall of a once proud ba. in future ba will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines.\\r\\r\\n    i was returning home for my wedding on december 27 2016 connecting to british airways from london heathrow to abuja. the seat i had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet. i never got an explanation for this action. however i wasnt very fussy about this as i was very excited to be getting married. also the flight was dirty the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place. our flight arrived at the abuja airport and i was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within nigeria. i went to claim my luggage at the carousel i waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and i couldnt find my luggage which had my wedding items in it including my wedding dress. as you can imagine i was devastated i had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue. i spent the night at abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one ba flight arrives from heathrow to abuja each day. my luggage never arrived the next day. myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items. the ba staff at the airport werent helpful at all they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was. my luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape. up till this day ba has refused to acknowledge my claims and they havent refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them. ba ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and i have vowed to never fly with ba.     aberdeen to paris via london heathrow. british airways has stooped to its lowest level of penury by introducing a wellmarketed and poorly executed scheme of m& s tieup on catering in european and domestic routes. ba is where a passenger has to remain thirsty for even a 3 hr flight to far europe destination without a credit or debit card. leave alone any complimentary drink even a cup of water is charged. no cash accepted. stooped to lowest levels of customer service from being a renowned airline. i will evaluate all other options before travelling ba in domestic and european routes although i am a bronze member.     london heathrow to copenhagen. my first time experiencing british airways buyonboard service. this must be brand suicide at its worst. how ba can go from a fullservice carrier to low cost overnight is astounding. the brand is now cheapened the offering before wasnt gourmet but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit now you cant even get hot water for free. even sas offer a complimentary coffee. what ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by british airways in every single class you travel yet you dont see a decrease in ticket prices. the positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly  but i do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them.    heathrow to hong kong in business class on 3rd january as part of a holiday to new zealand also involving flights with cathay pacific and malaysia airlines. the flight to hong kong with british airways showed up all that is bad about british airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. the continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. checkin at terminal 5 was chaotic there having been a computer glitch which greatly slowed the checkin and bag drop processes. there were too few ba staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. business checkin was better but still very busy. ba needs to speed up bag drop urgently. other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. the lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture used dishes not being cleared too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and i would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. compare this to the other home lounges of other carriers such as those at hong kong and kuala lumpur. took a shower whilst waiting and that was ok. the flight was not good at all. cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. gone are all the small and not so small touches that made flying with ba a pleasure such as hanging up coats hot towels a second round of drinks a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. a comment about the seats how can ba justify 8 across in business class when the yingyang seats were first introduced they were a revolution but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you dont have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. i had a window seat and i felt very hemmed in. there was no storage space for the things you need during a flight glasses tablet computer water bottle etc. all were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. sadly ba is no longer my airline of choice. i spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the union flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. i saved a considerable number of avios points for my retirement which i am now using up but on other airlines within the one world alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. sorry ba but youve lost my loyalty. club world is now very poor and also club europe now and youve lost the plot to the bean counters. never thought id say this but ive joined the abba club anybody but ba.    flew from los angeles to nice via london heathrow. 2 words travel nightmare. every leg of my british airways flight was delayed including one which was delayed due to a paperwork issue that would take 10 minutes. 2 hours later we took off. late inbound flights caused me to miss my connection which british airways charged me exorbitant fees and wait in a 4 hour line to rebook. inflight entertainment audio system did not work properly which was not resolved and offered no compensation as a result. by far the worst travel my wife or i have ever experienced we will be avoiding this airline for life.    zurich to london heathrow and my first trip on ba since they scrapped any type of complimentary service onboard for us lowly economy cabin travellers. this is now some weeks on since they introduced their buy onboard snack options but cabin staff acted like it was their first day and that they had no training. okay it might not be easy for them but they all appeared very bad tempered with customer questions about the new ryanair style service and a lot of tutting as they served those who decided to buy something. i am sick and tired of the ceo of ba telling us everywhere this is what their customers asked for. be honest and accept that this is a ploy to enhance your personal bonus at the end of year and keep shareholders happy. that said it seems the ba reputation is on the slide across many markets and thats where shareholders should be truly worried. and no i sold my ba shares many years ago.    gatwick to barcelona return and just dreadful pretty much sums up this british airways business class experience. since ba moved to gatwick south terminal their new lounge is still not ready. theyre currently using the clubrooms and the old virgin atlantic lounge now called the speedbird lounge. gold card holders and passengers travelling in business or first class use the clubrooms. what a sorry state this lounge was. full with limited seating a forty minute wait for food no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets. i left as hungry and thirsty as i arrived. no to worry though british airways will feed me onboard. once onboard for a two hour flight i was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches a scone and a really small slice of cake. this meal was completely insufficient. there was one drinks round offered and one top up offered. given that ba use the smallest glasses possible coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade you will be thirsty. i found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend. after being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight. staff were indifferent and spent most of their time chatting in galley.    sofia to london heathrow. the flight was on time but british airways has slipped to low budget airline standards.  ive been using ba for many years but my next holiday is booked on another airline. i cannot score more than 1 even for cabin crew as i didnt receive any service onboard. almost 3 hour flight and not one question or moment of attention from the cabin crew. you receive attention only if you ask to buy something from them  food water etc. crew is not guilty they are victims of the new airline policies. ba just lost its class.     gatwick to barcelona. unimpressed with the new m&s on board service. boarding process badly organised and the cabin crew cabin bags quite a few were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their bags overhead. i had to put my bag much behind my row. its not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines but sadly i booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard.    london heathrow to rio de janeiro. 45 minute delay on the tarmac. air conditioning wasnt working during delay  would only work once engines were on. the cabin was therefore unbearably hot. the foam in my seat 30b had deteriorated to the point i could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone. i informed the cabin staff of this  but due to the flight being overbooked i couldnt be moved and so i was given an extra pillow. this is a 12 hour flight and i dont think this is acceptable. i was very uncomfortable during this flight. in flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelatingblipping. in flight snacks now have to be paid for. considering the price of flights i think this is very poor. british airways is not a budget airline. in fact airlines currently rated lower than ba in the top 100 airlines eg virgin atlantic and malaysian airlines still provide complimentary on board snacks. there were two in flight meals on this flight  on both occasions i was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out. once i could forgive  but twice when i complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when i had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours  the steward informed me that i was travelling to a poor country and i should be grateful for the food i was getting. how rude i do not book flights with ba to get lectured by your flight staff. the quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. no crackers or cheese no fruit. what is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake both of which i intensely dislike. this is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting. id had no choice in your menu and what was served up was unpalatable. i have to take medication that needs to be taken with food  i had no choice but to purchase food on board. an additional charge on an already expensive flight is a hard pill to swallow.    london heathrow to new york. paid 250 to prebook my seats as my wife is a nervous flyer and likes a window seat. before we even left ba changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying us. luckily i spotted this on the booking portal and changed them back to a window seat. to cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo on complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund. i was told they are always doing this. on returning back to the uk on christmas eve i contacted customer service and was told i would receive a refund i took the customer services operators name and id number  no refund. i completed the online complaints form  i received an acknowledgment  nothing happened. i wrote to the chief executive no acknowledgement nothing. i wrote to the refunds department no acknowledgement nothing. i chased customer services again and was told the refund department is so busy. i will never fly with ba again. to quote british airway customers service response i completely understand why youre unhappy you didnt get your preferred seats. i apologise for the inconvenience caused to you. i hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon. my response was that i dont think so.    my mother who is 79 years old who is not too well and myself booked business class tickets on ba676 to istanbul on 7th jan 2017 and requested disabled person assistance for my mother. the flight got cancelled due to bad weather at ist this is understood  but when we tried to reschedule the flight we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who did not know how or what they should do as istanbul airport was shut due to snow. we nearly got rebooked on a flight to munich which we refused as ba ticketing agent did not know that the turkish incoming flight to munich was cancelled  i had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to munich where we would have got stranded. in total we were stranded at heathrow for 15 hours and managed after that to fly to istanbul via athens on aegean airlines at 2230 and the next day from athens being delayed by nearly 21 hours. when finally we got the option to travel via athens we had to go and collect our luggage when we asked for the prearranged assistance for my mother we were told no assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed help. we had to walk the very long distance back through immigration from bas lounge at t5. we went to what was marked as luggage desk club word were told to go alone to collect our luggage out of nearly 2000 pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled. when asked for transport to t2 a train was offered which links the terminals  had to take a taxi at a cost of 20.00 to get to t2. i asked for a refund of part of the ticket i received a general reply without any joy british airways need to look around you and learn from other airlines i was surprised with the standards of aegean airlines so pleasant staff clean aircraft the comfort of the seat and quality of the food. all which are missing with ba.    gatwick to barbados outbound on 19th january and returning 2nd february. over many years and travelling to many parts of the world our last flight was a eye opener to see what bean counters can do to ruin a airlines reputation. please british airways you need improve.    the quality of british airways has most certainly gone downhill. on short haul from london heathrow to rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet. online check in was quick and easy and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in 30 days prior to departure. that was the only good part of our journey. we boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat e so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight. we were in row 13. without notice we had to go through deicing which meant a 45min delay to our service we did however catch up 35mins. our inbound flight was on a newer a319 which had better seats and a skymap. due to slot restrictions at rome and london this flight was also delayed. during both flights the new buy on board was poorly done taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products. i therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service. what a shame.   my partner and i flew dublin to seattle via london heathrow with british airways. heathrow to seattle was on a b777200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped making it impossible to sleep on a 910hr flight. online checkin wasnt possible and we werent able to select our seats as our booking had an iberia flight number even though it was operated by ba. made lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airport. arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and i didnt get our seats together  ground staff could do nothing about it. luckily we were able to swap with another passenger once on board. food was bland to say the least  possibly the worse on any carrier ive ever flown with. however service provided by cabin crew was excellent. would only fly ba again for this.    the whole experience was poor flying from london heathrow to athens. ancient aircraft 767 poor inflight entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food was very slow and lacking some of the very limited range of products. on short haul and athens at 4 hours is classified as this ba is now a low cost carrier without the efficiency of the more established low cost carriers. the sole advantage is that they fly tofrom major airports. this airline is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time until a largely loyal customer base deserts them for alternative airlines.    doha to london heathrow. having flown into doha with qatar airways the flight with british airways was a shock. for a start the club world seats are not comfortable. there is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces. the cabin crew were indifferent. we departed at approximately 9am. immediately on reaching cruising altitude we were informed that they were now serving lunch. at 10am. we were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent this on a 7 hour flight. a cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early. i dont know what timezone lunch was in possibly bangkok but certainly not doha or london time. after 5 hours i rang the bell. the female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously did you ring the bell yes once the entire flight. i asked for the sandwich and she told me that i would have to wait. no i want it now. not a five course meal a sandwich. having just flown on qatar airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time apparently a preprepared sandwich was a big ask. in business class. i was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight. i did complain immediately to ba and to their credit i received a response  basically they were sorry i felt this way. never again. pay a fortune for this basic service.    will never touch british airways again. having flown ba on this route from orlando to london heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill. when i went to the back of the plane to ask for a snack i was told i had to buy them. having paid over 1000 for my tickets i replied im not doing that ive paid enough for this flight already. to which the cabin manager replied well thats just the way the industry is going people want value for money and this is how you get it all the airlines are doing it if you dont like it tough. i have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life as well as this the seats were old and the screens didnt work. other airlines namely air new zealand singapore airlines even american in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money you even still get snacks on long haul flights i guess all the airlines are doing it right.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    leeds bradford to heathrow. service is equal to ryanair and easyjet. ive been flying with ba regularly for last 4 years and i cant get my head around what is going on. complimentary drinks replaced with a buy on board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now  really just appalling. there is no competition on the lba route but i certainly wont pay anything extra to travel with ba from now on if there are alternatives available  ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually    vienna to los angeles via london. on 123116 at 5pm the night before my flight i received an email saying that my first leg to london had been cancelled and i needed to call to reschedule. on the phone the rep told me that he had a flight out later in the day i could take on the 31st. i said great book that. he did and i received the conformation and noticed that the flight was scheduled for 13117. i told him and he said oh yes that was an error on our part. however to book this he gave up my other seat. i told him this was his mistake and he needed to fix it. he said the only thing he could do was give me a partial refund which would be useless as it was 2k to buy a new ticket or i could fly out on 1417. i asked if british airways would comp my hotel for their mistake. he said no and i asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for 4 more nights. he had no answer. he refused to book me on any other airline. i asked for a manager he said there were none available. i fought with ba from 5pm until 1am no exaggeration i have screeenshots of the phone calls. i decided to get up at 6am go to the airport and talk with a ba rep  only to find out they have no ba reps but a rep representing a ba rep. she told me at first she could do nothing either and i told her i did not care where in the us she got me just get me to the us. she managed to get me a flight to philadelphia the next day. she compd my hotel for the night and all meals. as a business who has inconvenienced me should. however she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and i had to individually check in to each one. the checkin associate also failed to do so. therefore when the stewardess for airberlin was 30 minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit i had to run to the next gate only to find out i wasnt checked in so they gave my seat away. i begged and pleaded and cried and they somehow by the grace of a higher being found a seat. upon arrival into the us i was so grateful until i found out my bag was left in dusseldorf. it took another 2 weeks to get it back. at the end of it ba left me in a 400 deficit had to get home to ca from philly . i contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear back and all they had to say was that they couldnt do anything for me. next time i will spend however much more it costs to fly with an airline who has some form of management overseeing their employees and i know will not screw me over. lufthansa for example treated me so well and i wasnt even a paying customer.    london heathrow to innsbruck. i have been a loyal customer of british airways for 30 years. if ever i had a choice between them and another airline i chose british airways but no more. the new food and drink service is appalling. the crew on our flight never made it to the last 8 or so rows so my children sat at the back went thirsty. this was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere  clearly that is not bas fault but it is their fault that i couldnt then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane. next time i will fly ryanair. i doubt well notice any difference.    los angeles to london heathrow. starting with being charged 180 to check my hold luggage despite on the outbound sectors being able to check in hold luggage for free. the onboard service continues to decline for passengers in ba world traveller  terrible food minimal drinks and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wine. you get the feeling that if you so much as ask for anything other than the bare minimum you will be restrained and arrested on arrival at your destination. seat was okay  better comfort than american airlines i have to say but the movie selection and tv selection was poor as usual with random selections of tv programmes which are interrupted continually by onboard announcements. the new ba ceo is doing a great job of turning a once great airline into their low cost subsidiary vueling.    london heathrow to rome return. race to the bottom. my first time with the new buy onboard service. i was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. basically it does not work. i can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. i would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. even soft drinks are chargeable  i dont think this is acceptable. however despite the extensive menu there was an extremely limited selection available. one crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. there was a 2025 minute wait time for this. the crew then came around with the drinks trolley. this was extremely slow. the payments could only be made with credit cards or avios points. the payment added significant times to process. despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin we didnt get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. there was only the one trolley and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. ceo alex cruz and british airways  your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom  more rows in economy 10 abreast in some 777s and other cost cutting measures mean that even though im a silver exec club member i am now considering my future travel options. i live near manchester airport and klmair france and lufthansa are more attractive options.    edinburgh to london city. despite having a confirmed booking when i attempted to checkin with a prepaidfor bag at 1535 at the edi airport for a 1655 flight to lcy domestic flight i was told i couldnt as the flight had been oversold. i accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldnt be authorised so i had to ‘wait. i then stood around for 10 minutes being asked to ‘move out of the way at one point because i was blocking others. i was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details despite what the ba website claims should be done and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. i was simply ignored until i approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. none was available nor could be contacted apparently. i wasnt allowed to transfer to the flybe flight in case a seat became available on my original flight so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. i was told to wait for another 20 minutes. i argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given i had a confirmed booking in the first place but i was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and its not their problem that other people had checkedin before me. i was treated as a nuisance. at one point there were 5 members of ba check in staff doing nothing nobody else to serve whilst i was just standing silently there ‘waiting and being ignored. after 20 minutes of not knowing what to do my original flight closed and i was approached by a supervisor who suddenly was available to talk to me and given a seat. i asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier i had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. he explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in and as the checkin was closing they could give me the seat now. i informed him that i resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. i had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily like a problem rather than a customer. i then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure i was not denied boarding at the gate for being late even though i had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally especially for a domestic flight. as i told the supervisor if the airline treats its customers with such contempt do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. under their current policy of overbooking passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all even though they have a confirmed booking. some would call this cheating. the saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual and unlike mainline ba this route is run by its subsidiary ba cityflyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient. i rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in.    accra to london heathrow on ba is a 6 hr 50 min overnight flight. sleeping on overnight flights in economy class is an ordeal in itself bit i was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing  we had just entered french airspace  all cabin lights were put on bright for the breakfastsnack service following the dinner after takeof in accra the more since this service consisted of a cup of tea or coffee or cold drink only. not even a biscuit was offered. i was shocked.    this a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to business class passengers. we were flying to mauritius on holiday and i felt given the flying time we should spoil ourselves and fly upfront with all the comparative comfort of business class. the british airways flight itself was okay the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine. however i was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the gatwick lounge a small issue for some perhaps but for me its all part of the business class experience. to illustrate my point i attach a shot of what walshs policy of putting shareholders first actually means for farepaying passengers. with the very confusing layout that greets one in the south terminal now that ba have moved in the serve yourself checkin you even label your own bags. i was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the lounge. but then to be greeted with this was totally unacceptable. so willie rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders this sort of display of overt costcutting has now lost you revenue for the future. shortsighted management or what take a lesson from emirates who i decided to fly home with so disgusted was i over our experience. they put passengers first   bangkok to london with british airways. im a frequent flyer. for a change we decided to fly ba to london from thailand for our 12 hour journey. when we were seated we realized that the seat cushion was coming away. underneath there were lots of litter. we then realized that we cant watch movies etc due to fact that there was no sound. i informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc. our other complaint was the food  it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times. in short i would not recommend flying with ba.    chicago to london heathrow. dont waste your money buying ba seat assignments in advance i did that a month ago at the same time as i made my booking and paid for an aisle seat of my choice. when i went back one week before my journey my aisle seat was gone and i was placed in an undesirable middle seat. there was no remedy for this. five calls over three days to ba connected me to people in delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately sorry and just no. i have been deceived lied to and put off. i have flown british many times this is absolutely my last time. it is acceptable to make an error but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it. take my advice choose another airline. i am a oneworld emerald flyer on aa flew 200k miles last year and i can tell good service from bad. british airways has unfortunately declined badly.    lisbon to london heathrow. now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. over the last few years leg room across european flights business and economy class has decreased to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. that said it is in practice worse than budget airlines because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button eliminating further discomfort. even without the seat in front reclined anyone taller than 5 8 will be packed in tightly on any european shorthaul flight. the staff are friendly and polite. however they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinksfood sales service especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. this does not only result in thirsty  hungry customers but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. business class which i sometimes use is offered a free meal and drinks all of a reasonable quality. however in terms of legroom  seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me. otherwise i get little in the way of added value. the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it in monetary terms particularly if one mostly flies within europe. it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership many are valid for most european  and beyond  airports rather than remain loyal to ba these days. i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now on a monthly basis. my sympathies go to the staff because i fear costcutting will get them next which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.    istanbul to london heathrow. i am a frequent flyer between turkey and canada. i got first time flight by british airways. i feel it was the worst airline so far compared to others. can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 3.5hour flight from istanbul to london.  they explained it by economical concerns. what is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water also from london to vancouver we delayed almost 2 hours because of luggage issues and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane which could be understandable this part. but the plane was old boeing 747 the screens were very bad quality and small. the name of the company is big but quality of the service is far below than average. cabin crew are professional though so this is not their mistake. it was enough trouble for me not to select ba in my flights in the future.    filthy dirty tired boeing 777200 to chicago. british airways first class seat is barely a business class seat on other airlines. food absolutely terrible and service from crew hurried and disinterested. ife movies limited selection and slow. this is an airline in decline. they dont care because of limited competition across the atlantic. in summary not first class but rather no class. finally their first class lounge at heathrow was dirty and worn.\\r\\r\\n    london heathrow to bangkok. as you walk into heathrow t5 you have the feeling of a world class airline  and thats where it stopped 20 minutes late for boarding then only after they had got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up  it took them 1 hour to fix the plane didnt tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags i gave up my seat 38d for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so i got 40d  big mistake seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down. upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above  when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and i heard her say to a coworker thats the last of her problems. it was the coldest plane i have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets i was that cold i took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet. toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight. they had to manually reset everyones screens they were very old the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired. not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag. the interior on the seating was old and lumpy im sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw they dont even have usbs to charge your phone  so they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any usb charge points around the plane. going to email ba and ask for a refund on my return ticket as i can honestly say out of the 20 or so airlines i have flown on over the years this is by far the worst     toronto to london in premium economy. easy check in and fast track security meant i was in the lounge within 15 mins. unfortunately they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight. poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on its last legs. i let the front desk know and the staff made me a fresh sandwich. also beers had changed with 5 lagers and newcastle brown. the manager fetched some ipa from the first lounge  some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge. the most disorganised boarding ever with few pas. onboard juice or water offered. i asked for sparking wine but its only done on flights from london  crew explained it cant be chilled at outstations  poor excuse given they do it for club and first. fast service after take off with an ok entree. poor salad and a nasty dry piece of cake. ife was the same as my trip over christmas so it seems the ife is updated less often. tea coffee and juice offered before landing. but no muffin or even a biscuit  really poor. prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt. return a week later was a better flight. easy check in again and no fast track queue. north lounge was an average experience ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh. bused to aircraft a boeing 7879 with premium economy only half full. a half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten. fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service. an ok meal with a rancid coleslaw ok steak and a tiny pot of desert. generous with the drinks. unfortunately the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by ba. i was offered t&cs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger. the crew were genuinely embarrassed a couple of sandwiches i liberated from the club lounge made up for it. fast off the plane and despite slow immigration the bags beat me again. overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors. the meal is nowhere near club standard and its the cutting of the small things  nibbles breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most. be competitive but dont take it out on me i wouldnt mind but the prices dont go down with the reduction of service. despite what the ceo maintains  it is not in response to customer feedback. ba need to listen to what were saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as bad as the budget airlines. eventually the hardiest of us loyal ba customers will give up and move airline  alliance and that would be a shame.    london heathrow to stuttgart. fly in comfort and style is the slogan of british airways but there is not much of either around these days. not willing to pay an extra 8 i was allocated a middle seat right at the rear. at the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their handluggage at no extra cost. within a minute a burly employee told me i had to check in my cabin bag saying you should not believe what is said on the companys website. how very true some ten other passengers equally perplexed suffered the same fate. i know there were ten because another employee kept counting us and saying we need ten. the burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags. all in all a demeaning experience. the seat rows are now more tightly packed than before. although of average slim build i found the seat a tight fit. only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink the deceptive upgrade we were sold at the beginning of the year. but still did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing. not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers. on the return journey i noticed part of the reason for this new policy the stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff. ba is now no better than the no frills competitors but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices. a loyal customer of many many years i will choose their competitors in future.    i am due to fly from tehran to vancouver via london heathrow. i prepaid for my seat and their system assigned a wrong seat. i called customer service 6 times and no one helped me the get this fixed. british airways customer service is the worst airline customer service ive seen. i would be happy to pay extra next time not to travel with british airways.    malta to gatwick. my friend arrived at the check in desk it was a long queue as the system was down to be told that she had just checked baggage in one way. she had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip. as for the food menu the food is so expensive and its easy to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices. an airline should not represent a country when its based on profit above its people. at least ryanair etc are honest and cheap british airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole \\r\\r\\n    london to larnaca. sadly british airways is now a very poor quality budget airline that still thinks it is a top end carrier. the aircraft are generally old shabby and dirty. the staff are surly and abrupt the seating cramped and uncomfortable. i am a business travelled and would prefer to fly club europe but i am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economy. it is a joke  if the person in front reclines i cant work  so how is this in any way business class.    mumbai to seattle via london heathrow. i dont know why i chose to fly ba  a sense of nostalgia i think. going to india this time i decided to go east via lhr and ba seemed a good idea. i will not do so again. i specifically booked all the flights through ba so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. the non ba flights were arranged i discovered subsequently with nonpartnered airlines with no instructions or pnrs  trying to find out what the pnr was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as ba checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. we cant give you a boarding pass  its not a ba partnered airline  but ba did all the booking. blank look and total nonhelpfulness. try in heathrow. i eventually phoned and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass. similarly on the way back there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my bags in mumbai before getting on the lhr flight. when i got to the gate the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. the fact that noone told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. essentially despite ba being the travel agent here it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. the flights out were not too bad  fairly empty business class and staff were accordingly attentive aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. on the way back  forget it. firstly  no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff  it wasnt the for airline use only at the front  it was row 11 when i asked them to shift that i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane. i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat  and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. done with bad grace. they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight  an overnight request for a cup of tea i skipped dinner to sleep took 20 mins. the breakfast was truly awful  one of the worst airline meals i have ever had. the seats are tight  i endorse all the concerns of the 242 configuration. im 6 ft 5 but keep myself fit and im not fat. i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. yes its flat  but its short and tight and lumpy lufthansa ethihad emirates singapore eva thai cathay pacific  all do much better than this  even delta and american airlines internationals are much better. generally the ba experience is unhelpful uncomfortable and shabby. im embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. its not because they are so much cheaper than others. finally im now sitting in one of the ba lounges at terminal 5 and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns porridge and muesli. what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago the last time i flew ba. overall  its sad.    phoenix to london heathrow. due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to heathrow which i may add both my wife and i checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th march instead of 12th february. we checked in or tried to check in whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention. we couldnt prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home. the staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers no nothing could be done. we enquired the cost of two economy seats home whereupon we told the two economy tickets would come to an eyewatering 5092 or 4243 economy. to add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be rebooked to the 12th february no chance. we had no choice over a barrel scarcity value i hear you cry no. we boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. my wife and i were beside ourselves with anger not to the flight crew it wasnt their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves. to cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedible. we will never fly ba again. british airways  the worlds biggest rip off.     london heathrow to mumbai. ive been a loyal ba customer for several years but this was a journey of disappointment. i was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. called customer services while on my way and after 15min of wait i was told they couldnt do anything about it but gave me the number of the airport. it was incorrect. at terminal 5 i asked the attendant for help given the rush. he was quite rude and said i had to join the queue unless i was flying business. at the gate we had a late boarding because the computer wasnt working. i was flying premium economy and let me say on this flight ba0199 it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. my headrest was hanging down the seat the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldnt stay in position. the flight attendant who i never saw smiling for the entire flight said he had reported it on the way in. i asked to change my seat. in my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops it wasnt the headphones i tried mine too. the entertainment system was poor. it started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing plus the noise cancelling headphones are not noise cancelling  try pulling the jack out and it doesnt make a difference. overall a very poor experience crowned by a terrible breakfast. sorry ba but you are stuck in the 80s and youre slipping further down my list of preferences.\\r\\r\\n    san jose costa rica to london gatwick. we were firstly unable to get two seats together at online checkin. the next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. i argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. after about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. i later found out the two ba employees travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually after a great deal of argument moved. i have complained to ba and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesnt in the future. next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. my ife didnt work they offered to move me ironically to swap with one of the ba employees but i declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. dreadful stressful experience for people whod paid a lot of money. have been called by customer service who have offered us 10000 avios as compensation enough for a night at the holiday inn express awful company to deal with totally dismissive of customer need. on the plus side business class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive. ba need to do better though far better if they are to compete with the good middle east and far eastern airlines.    amman to london heathrow. staff were very minimalistic in their service. they were not rude but not willing to be helpful or go out of their way to make a good impression. . i fly very often not often with ba so thought id try it and now realized they do not compare with other major airlines.    london to chicago. in my opinion british airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within europe and internationally especially as an economy passenger. they are moving more towards being a budget airline. there is no option of a free seat selection they charge for food on board on short haul flights. on long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. avios and tier point awards have been slashed. i will not be flying ba any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.\\r\\r\\n    london to vancouver return. british airways is no longer good value for money. the cost of premium economy compared with the quality of service food and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. the plane in both directions was old and shabby staff are fine but dont really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened of course you have the opportunity to pay an extra 4055 each way to choose a seat beforehand. the food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the premium economy cabin. the tv screens are dirty and small the system had to be reset on the flight out took quite a while. for almost double the price of economy i dont think it makes sense to fly world traveller plus on this route.    flew london heathrow to gibraltar. this is probably the last time that ill book a short haul with british airways from heathrow for anything other than a long holiday  no matter how cheap they make it they cant overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates delays for takeoff slots long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. willie walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports  slightly hollow laugh. ba are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers in economy are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. on our flight of well over 2 hours this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. i have no objection to paying for food and drink but ba have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. seems like a structural flaw in their offering. the other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed  it took me back to the early days of easyjet and ryanair before allocated seating. so unless im lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows i think ill use regional airports and the better general service and available loos that come with a single class cabin  no matter who the carrier is.\\r\\r\\n    this is my first time flying on bas a380 daily service between london heathrow and singapore. i chose a seat on the upper deck of the a380  seat 70a an exit row seat. located just behind world traveller plus this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. the inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. the classical music selection was severely limited though. bbc news was on the menu but ironically it was not available for some strange reason. inflight service was basic. there was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. in other words you would have to order your orange juicecoke and wine at the same time. cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. throughout the night of this red eye flight i did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. the lhr  vce route was operated by the a320. british airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its european routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and m&s snacks. on the whole ba will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist i would choose another airline.\\r\\r\\n    british airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. i recently flew with ba from gatwick to marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of easyjet. the catering with the new m&s food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. on the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a kitkat cost cutting includes removing toilets. is one toilet for 200 people realistic ba    london heathrow to cape town return. this return journey was the worst longhaul flight that ive ever taken. british airways boeing 747400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. there was hardly any legroom and while its good that the seats recline quite a way its impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. the seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep im not a large lady only 53kg and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. i gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face i couldnt focus on it. the inflight meal was also very poor unlike the food we had on five internal flights on saa which was excellent. british airways have lost the plot  fly with someone else.    oh dear costcutting on british airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment. flew kuwait to edinburgh via london. aircraft are still comfortable timekeeping is good and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. however most of the cabin crew were mature and the food and drink offering is now minimal. breakfast from kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables no not the omelette we used to have plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. lunch was a mars bar or similar. i did not bother with the buy on board stuff on the flight to edinburgh  i get a better choice in the terminal when i get off the aircraft. the domestic flight back from edinburgh to heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew i have ever seen on ba giggling at each other during the safety demonstration  very unprofessional. the evening meal out of london back to kuwait was more like a snack with a smallish steak three snap peas three baby carrots i counted the things and another babyfood potato thing. breakfast was a muesli bar. sorry guys a comment on this board that ba equals budget airline just about sums it all up. i have other choices from the gulf back home and next time i will be thinking about taking one of them the only attraction with ba is the extra legroom in premium economy the choice of entertainment and the direct flight to heathrow rather than having to fly down the gulf and return. otherwise the epitaph how the mighty have fallen springs to mind.    london heathrow  pisa return. i fly this route often as i have a house in tuscany. i fly british airways club europe only because the fas are better the lounge is a welcome benefit  and if you book far ahead enough  you can get a reasonable deal plus avious points. that aside there is little benefits to flying say ryanair. the trip started at t5 and the northern lounge was not for a change to busy. had a fruit and coffee breakfast. the options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps  dripping fat all over the place. some years ago  ba provided some nice scrambled eggs. now they dont. flight left from the a terminal and we boarded downstairs from the lounge. the plane was half full. it was clean and valeted. we pushed back 10 minutes early. my wife had a sort of brunch thing cheese and ham  rolls. she said it was ok. i had a couple of gin and tonics. the fa said she had never seen such an empty flight  and neither had i for that matter. the now chargeable food and beverages in economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. i read the ba brochure on the now chargeable food and as a sales and marketing professional  it was the most patronising piece of rubbish id ever read. it read as if ba were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. and goodness me  the products are not cheap  over a 1 for a kit kat. we landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like ryanair customers. several years ago you had the airbridge. now you dont. the return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. this in part is due to qatar airlines operating out of pisa and their business class customers use the same facility. some booze and snacks  nothing edible. flight delayed by 30 minutes. plane was rammed. very pleasant fas. afternoon tea  with horrible dried out sandwiches  scones that didnt look like scones. on both flights  the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. no legroom. hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as 600 return. docked at the b terminal and had to walk miles to the trains  that took us back to t5terminal a. all in all  another disappointing experience from the worlds most frugal airline.    flew british airways from london heathrow to dubai. i do not normally write reviews but i was so disappointed with the service and flights from ba for a recent 4 night stay in a dubai with my wife that i had to make a comment. some of the staff not all were rude and they had run out of food when they came to serve me. will try and use other airlines in the future wherever possible.\\r\\r\\n    amsterdam to gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class. onward flight to st lucia paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft. tired worn interior and the food reflected this too. outbound crew were helpful and energetic keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used. inbound flight was the same tired interior unappealing menu and indifferent service. the only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when i travelled home. 1010 to british airways staff in st lucia for managing this so well. i hope that ba will be renewing its fleet soon it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made.    my last few experiences with british airways have been extremely disappointing they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy. on my most recent trip from london to toulouse i booked using my avios points. i then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so so i ended up spending more on 1 flight than i had for 2. they now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights i even had to purchase a bottle of water. this is akin to a lcc such as easyjet but the fares are still much more expensive. in addition i received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could i contact british airways about my booking. i had received one missed call with no message during working hours. having eventually dug out the right customer services number these were not provided on the email i tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long i eventually gave up.    edinburgh to luanda via heathrow. british airways has started charging inflated prices for food on a flight that is already highly priced in comparison to other airlines the standard is pathetic and it is no surprise that the flight was empty. they are just a very expensive easyjet  ryanair.    london heathrow to las vegas. never had need to write a bad airline review before now. british airways was the worst airline i have ever flown with. old shabby and dirty plane. tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when i arrived. the only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me. the seat i then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back old food stains and on the belt. no drink served with meal except water. when i eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. i had a white wine. when i asked for a second yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight i was told they had run out of wine also. i had to have orange juice. awful and rude staff with exception of one. worst airline by far i have ever flown with.    gatwick to bridgetown. firstly couldnt book myself in online  my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but i couldnt move him his seat was fixed. so we had to leave mega early so i could sit near him luckily got the seat behind him. food and seats terrible. tea time snack an insult 2 small cookies. breakfast was a muesli bar i already have booked with ba again for tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct however my annual flights to barbados will be with virgin in future. i have complained twice re check in meals and the broken tray table on the return trip and have been offered 5000 avios points 40 that just ties me into flying with them again especially as they expire every year so will disappear before i might want to use them the cutbacks are a cut too far ba. tip buy a sandwich in boots on way out and buy something to eat on way back before you go to the airport.     orlando to london. i had booked business class and i wanted to be comfortable. unfortunately with british airways i paid all these money and at the end i was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. i checked in 24 hours before the flight as soon as the online check in opened. the system gave me only a single seat opposite to the direction of the airplane with no possibilty to be able to change it. i called british airways main office to try to sort this out initially i was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to british airways at the airport as airport keeps some business class seats. i called again the main office to talk to a different person in case i was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the aeroport. as soon as i arrived at the airport at the check desk i was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me however they were going to fix it at the gate. when i arrived at the gate i was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. i do not feel that it is worth paying for business with british airways and then getting all this chaos. it was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. finally my lagguage that was priority came out last.    newark to london heathrow. this was the first time i have flown longhaul ba for sometime although i am ba goldcard holder due to my travels on other oneworld carriers. the lounge in newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate first section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. super views over the airfield. boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. this was a new boeing 787 however the yingyang seat configuration no air vents high density poor quality food and very little of it very basic toilet facilities compared to american business class on the same route a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. the product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. i asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. the arrivals lounge is grim  tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. overall very poor and i will not fly with them again unless no other options.    hyderabad to london. i have travelled ba numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when i was returning from hyderabad to london from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. while the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem the manner in which the ba staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. i have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. in this instance with british airways i was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. when i asked if i could be put on another comparable flight i was shut down and told no this is not possible without any explanation. when i then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline i was told again and again no this is not possible. after realising that british airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation i asked what could be done given the circumstances. my answer was a to be handed a 75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing i could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service ticket class i had purchased. after the flight i filed a claim with british airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience but i have yet receive even one response only adding to my understanding that british airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. i am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline.    london heathrow to dublin. booked business class expecting extra legroom but seats are the same as in economy. i was and still am disgusted what a rip off how do they get away with it answer people like me pay excessive air fares to fly with them well not any more disgraceful they should be ashamed.    london to dublin. i had not flown with british airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to dublin from london heathrow terminal 5. it all started again i had downloaded the ba app from the apple app store and i tried to check in the night before using the app but i was getting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time i thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when i was sat in the taxi to the airport. on the app i noticed that the flight had been delayed by approx. 1 hour and some minutes considering it is a local flight and i was flying with hand luggage only i decided to stop so that i can get some food as having flown multiple times in the past 3 months at least once and sometimes twice every week i was under the impression that as long as i am at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues after all thats the whole point of flight updates. when i got the ba self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing and almost 2 hours before the actual flight time i had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to zone e to get a boarding pass printed by the counter staff after waiting 20 minutes in the queue bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off i was told that the flight has been closed and as i was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and i ca not fly on that flight so i will have to take the next one from 8am flight i was moved to 11am flight. after discussing with the check in manager i was told that there is nothing he can do as he doesnt make the rules. needless to say that i had to book onto the next flight despite being through security and in the waiting area over an hour before the actual flight took off. if this is how the ba customers are to be treated i.e. they have to be there on time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then i for one will most definitely not be flying ba again the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it seems in this case they are not putting any value on my  other customers time i.e. we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late .    london to barbados. having used avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advance. the crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal available. british airways policy of offering a fun size mars bar instead of a second meal is unacceptable. in our opinion the airline are offering a budget experience at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them.    london heathrow to bangkok. first time flying british airways. i had heard all the bad reviews about them and they did not disappoint. tired old aircraft seat would not fully recline unlike the person in front of me. entertainment system is dreadful and flickeered most of the trip  i did not even use it much in the end. food was good i will give them that. check in very fast and efficient plane pretty much on time. no wifi or charging facilities onboard.    flew british airways from beijing  london heathrow emerald member so a one minute checkin with a dedicated counter was appreciated. the bgs lounge which ba uses was a welcome surprise owing to the fact that there are many japanese food options at that time jal also shares the lounge. business section almost the same as first albeit more people. boarding seamless. here is where the value ends. two meals for 11 hour flight but if requesting snacks in between you are directed to a copy of highlife where there is a sweet treat menu with sugar family items priced around 23 each. i declined that and stayed hungry. the meals served were carbrich pasta tasteless and a rice meal dry tasteless. i have minimal needs but i do know ba has cut back so much now that it really is drink  meal  drink  meal on transcon flights. crew were friendly enough. free exitrow seats for friend and i emerald benefit.    flew from london heathrow to geneva. fast track through security at lhr terminal 5 is a misnomer. if you want fast track choose an airline departing from t2 or t3. boarding aircraft a nightmare. no priority boarding. at gate herded onto a bus in conditions that resembled a cattle truck. line up on tarmac and steps to board. on board seats arranged for benefit of british airways flexibility and not the convenience of passengers. three seats each side of the aisle with the centre one blanked out. no extra seat width or legroom. knees against the sear in front unless one sits with a twisted spine not good. similar arrangement on newer british airways a320s. overall not what one expects from business class and negates any positive aspect of the flight.    montreal to london heathrow. flight and service was cheap except for the price. i expected better and this was not value for money. advance seat selection is expensive just plain gouging on top of ticket price. it is complimentary on air canada. even with boarding pass prearranged there is no bag drop in montreal just one long line british airways ba staff. air canada next time.    gothenburg to san francisco via heathrow returning from phoenix.  ba now charges for snacks and drinks in eurotraveller a move that surprised me as ba is now nothing but a very expensive ryanair or easyjet. after arriving in london we started out with a 5 hour delay due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn boeing 772. planes were swapped and we left on yet another shabby and worn b772. seats were comfortable but the aircraft was dirty. ba has cut back on the amenities in world traveller. it used to be a sleeping mask socks a tooth brush and headphones now only headphones were provided. returning from phx on an even older b747. overall i was disappointed. a couple of years ago i switched to ba from lufthansa as i find london a more convenient transit airport while both airlines offering the same high levels of service. but what has happened this used to be a great airline which now sadly is nothing more than a low cost carrier charging premium prices. will switch to lufthansa from now on.    gatwick to mauritius. 12 hour flight delayed 1 hour due to no cleaners. advised by first officer that cabin crew had to clean the plane crumbs on seat and greasy windows. otherwise fairly average flight until woken up 2 hours out of mauritius to be advised that toilets on plane were full and no further use please just after waking up most people like to visit the toilet surely anyway seatbelt signs then illuminated though little if any turbulence. one hour out first officer came on again with further abject apology re toilets not working as apparently the toilet tanks hadnt been emptied at lgw before departure. two hours with legs crossed for over 200 pax surely flight should never have departed without emptying tanks. trust they maintain the engines better    london heathrow to hong kong. the new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat but i was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering. for a 13 hour flight in a premium economy i would have assumed it would be similar to others offering meals mid flight snacks and other bits. i was very wrong. we had a bar service and meal there was then nothing until breakfast exactly the same as the economy offering. this is appalling british airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering. i went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft they completely understood customer frustrations they just have nothing to give. ba was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with. not so much anymore. the crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had. for anyone flying ba bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids.    frankfurt to hong kong via london. this will definitely be my last time with british airways i have already changed my return ticket to cathay pacific. the business class experience with ba has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. short flight to heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful  probably worth about 3 at most. seat legroom is awful and not far off the 29 inch size that economy is being cut to. staff onboard were friendly and that is all. lounge at t5 was again very poor  crowded food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. the toilet was disgusting. evening departure to hkg and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. onboard the ba club world product is lousy  cheap low quality amenities a very poor meal choice and standard washrooms unstocked and quite dirty the cabin worn and scruffy. as an expat living in germany i have remained loyal to ba until now but this is the last time i will waste our company money using them. it is quite clear that ba are abusing their monopoly situation at heathrow cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation and profitability of the airline. if you are undecided about choosing ba over another airline quite simply do not consider ba  you will be very disappointed and feel cheated.    \\r\\r\\nlondon heathrow to edinburgh on british airways domestic economy check in at t5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. i used the ba galleries north lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. boarding through a8 on to a clean looking full a319. i had seat 25a which has no window. crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on ba. not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. the footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards ba. in order to maintain my executive club silver status oneworld sapphire i have to take 4 ba flights each year which i can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so european and international flights i take each year will be either with other oneworld carriers or others and not ba. the management at british airways are making false claims when suggesting its what our passengers asked for. i travelled with ba 16 times last year and i wasnt asked if i wanted a devaluation of the ba executive club  or was i asked if i wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats  i most certainly was never asked if i wanted the simple snack and a coffee on uk and european flights replaced by buy your own food  neither was i asked if i mind paying for snacks on international flights. unfortunately british airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease its shareholders.    toronto to berlin via london on miles in a mix of classes. first class check in at toronto was good with friendly staff. a fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. unfortunately first lounge was full of gold card members and so had to sit in the biz lounge. good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2a. excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. a weird but tasty starter of a cured  dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. good cheeses and all courses selected were available. after some decent sleep a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. t5 north lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. decent breakfast selection of hot rolls fruit cereals etc. quick board for the flight to berlin. ridiculous leg room at 30 inches max. very cramped. dont like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. an ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. on time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. returning to london in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever including low cost airlines. a full a321 was cramped insufficient bins with one out of service and the now infamous terrible leg room.i understand this is to get even worse when ba moves to 180 pax on an a320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. slow food and drink service with little take up. some couldnt buy as no cash accepted. not even juice water and coffee offered for free. this penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the us and canadian carriers look high class. the only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. the whole plane looked fed up subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. final leg to toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. poor lunch of roast chicken weird mash and overcooked greens. not biz class food and pretty average. more like economy food. afternoon tea was fine with a fast deplaning and bags. on the long haul legs the ife was identical to christmas poor choice little new material  clearly even the ife is now down graded. the biz class product  once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. how the mighty have fallen experiencing four classes on four legs showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul. the short haul legs to  from berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what youre getting and its reflected in the fare and extras. with less leg room fewer toilets reduced quality andor no refreshments and a general downgrading of service the only thing not reduced is the price. this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios. its only a matter of time before this final nail in the ba coffin hits the customer at which point  im off hello star alliance    this will be my last time to book a trip with them. i booked a return trip for april 2017 from london to istanbul a few months in advance they ended up cancelling my 1100 flight and moving me to the 0700 flight which would not work for me. after the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan i left it for a few months. on calling yesterday they told me that i had accepted the changes as it was months ago i told her that the other agent suggested that i wait and decide later. this was followed by the fact that i had purchased a cabin bag only fare but i travel with a ipad or laptop with the recent electronics ban ba were going to force me to pay 50 for a bag to check my device. although this was not my fault. to add to this everything is paid for now reduced legroom pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in i can see no reason to fly ba any longer. i called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty. i have rebooked with turkish airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute they include food checked bag drinks and seat selection and sometimes a boeing 777 on this route.    heathrow terminal 5 is a great airport dedicated to british airways the checkin service was not as fast as they say it was normal. the ba staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help. i was very excited to fly on the new dreamliner from london heathrow to dubai but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard. first the ife felt very old and not clear at all something youd expect on nonrefurbished b777s. choice of movies and tv shows are pretty good so i cant fault ba on that. the seats are nice the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay. cabin crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us i was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head. the food is okay your first meal its hot and options were good two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane. however and this is a big however your second meal we were given a breakfast bar that was disgraceful how much of a budget are they on now i thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us breakfast bars instead but on the return journey we were given a cookie for lunch people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace. i just cant believe how downhill ba has gone. its incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too i think theyre running out of money. unfortunately i booked my flights to marrakech before this expereince and i promise that would be the last time i fly with ba.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    british airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from london heathrow to johannesburg. every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. they make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. seats are narrow seat cushions are hard and i had a large person next to me both trips. i paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. food was passable and no more but there were two meals on the long flight. cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training  polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. both flights on time. these ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been revamped they looked tired but clean. the alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft. it is tiie that ba started to compete and not be so complacent.    i am 73 years old. was scheduled to fly from montreal to heathrow on january 30th and from there to athens on february 1st where i would catch another connection to cyprus. i was delayed in montreal for 5 hours never given a reason why stuck in the aircraft from 9 pm until 3am cause customs was closed. had to wait another 6 hours at heathrow. missed my connection to athens and my connection from athens to cyprus. was never offered accomodation or compensation. had to book another flight on february 2nd and book a stay at a hotel close to athens airport. contacted british airways they replied with the usual vague comments. i followed up and never got a reply. clearly i am being ignored. i will never use british airways again.    belfast to gibraltar via heathrow return. i fly british airways when i can and have always been impessed and satisfied  until now. the flight from heathrow to gibraltar was uneventful clean aircraft no delays no issues  apart from the lack of drinks  snacks. id love to know who thought this would be a good idea. flying short haul there is nothing to differentiate ba from easyjet or other no frills airlines. add to this the lack of choice on their menu. there are only a couple of sandwiches and if you dont like mayo or cheese youre out of luck. well done ba youve alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones. the flight from heathrow to belfast is my main gripe. the flight was meant to depart at 1645 but was delayed to 1720 hardly a big deal right wrong the gate only went up at 1650 this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft. it was 1730 before everyone was boarded again hardly a big deal except that we didnt take off until 1830 which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as i was back too late to pick them up. the flight itself was full which wouldnt have been too bad if there hadnt been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank. i wont go into details but she smelled rancid. i was a few rows back and so didnt get the worst of it but i could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all. needless to say i didnt enjoy the flight at all. i would go so far as to say that its probably the worst flight ive been on and ive flown monarch and easyjet. i did email ba with my concerns but they didnt bother to reply. so again well done ba youre squandering customers good will toward you like youre burning fifty pound notes.    flew from gatwick to cancun. british airways have lost their way front line staff are still excellent but behind the scenes customer service is now at an all time low. the quality of aircraft and seating is below other airlines they need to sharpen up their act before even more passengers desert then.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n   british airways has got it wrong on short european hauls. malaga to gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class the food  drink trolley will block access to the toilet. seated at the tail end of the plane the food is very likely to run out. on my flight the promised m&s was limited to snacks 1.80 water 1.20 kitkat. creditdebit cards only no cash and this meant a very painfully slow service. one working toilet for the economy class the other one was out of order  but the business class toilet at the front was out of reach for the cattle class leaving me wait for over an hour. i was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about 80 minute a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle then of air turbulence. the cabin crew seems desperate to get the 1 trolley hence the slowness to the end of the cabin. people needing the toilet was obviously not a priority. they certainly did not let me pass during the 40 minutes or more without air turbulence. ba has gone cattle.   london to new york. it has been a long time since i have been on a british airways flight and time has not been kind. t5 at lhr is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where things are. it just feels a bit hit and miss compared to changi or hk. the flight itself was on an old b747. new seating and ife but very old. the boarding process was chaotic. extra security checks at the gate itself hardly surprising. seat comfort was ok albeit very tight and narrow. the ife was great and that was the highlight. the lunch served was so so but having eaten at the lounge it was left largely uneaten. the biggest problem is the staff morale. they all seemed to be keen to get the service out of the way dim the lights and disappear. evidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for any wine was by the glass very cheap cutlery etc. ba is a premium airline but looks to be offering a ryanair standard. compared to the me or asian or my usual ride qantas ba have slipped significantly. shame as it was a great airline to fly with at one time.    flight from gatwick to grenada return with british airways. lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good decent food and the plane was clean. what i struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights ba then expect you to pay an additional 77 per person each way to reserve seats. there were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of 600 to our flight cost. ba will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had gone. i would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together.\\r\\r\\n    flew from lisbon to london and return. british airways never fails in terms of being on time but i will end my business with them after more then 30 flights and having said very good things about them in the past. they seem to be cutting corners with everything passengers are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub just goes to a remote stand and takes forever to get to the terminal. not worth the money spent.    amsterdam to cape town via gatwick. on our 13 hour night flight i discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline. spent 13 hours sitting upright while everyone around me was in a reclined position. complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when i returned home to amsterdam. this is exactly what i did. ba replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a gbp25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more. what an insult its unfair that i paid the same price as the rest of the passengers thats unfair. they do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter. very arrogant and not customer friendly at all. i feel cheated. british airways obviously does not value their customers. a gbp25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day but for a long overnight flight its an insult. sent 2 emails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore.     i was scheduled to fly ba208 from miami to london on january 18th. boarding and departure went normal but than close to takeoff the ordeal began. captain announced a technical problem at approx. 0915 pm and thats when the horror started. overall we ended up sitting in the plane until 0100 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane any attempts to fix the fault failed. we were given accomodation but that was a 45 mins drive from miami airport. checkin took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers and the place was like a freezer. was rebooked for a flight the next day but downgraded from premium economy to economy. old tatty 747 very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone. worst of all the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in london and cancel my connection to munich. total additional expenses not counting the difference between premium economy which i paid for and economy was ~500. including the gap between economy and premium economy probably ~900. now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference. submitted my compensation claims incl. proof for the above expenses as per protocol online  no confirmation. followed up with a call had to wait approx. 45 mins to talk to a human and was told that most expenses are not refundable but i would be compensated for the remaining. no further confirmation email etc. was paid a mere 50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for the expenses were 900. decided to do some research and it appears that under eu law airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours my delay was 21 hours.  absolutely atrocious customer service lousy product. how on earth ba deserves 4 stars in beyond me.    london heathrow to los angeles. worst flight ever with british airways you can see why they have fallen out of the top 10 very lazy and oblivious staff members. they ran out of food during both meal times. we were promised a replacement but nothing came until they cleared away the trays. all we got was oh sorry and a rere heated meal. after leaving the service light on for 15 minutes looking for some water i went to the back of the plane to find 2 members of staff reading the paper. even after complaining to customer service after the flight we werent treated much better. if it wasnt because for the avios program it was enough to put me off for a life time    i have never had such a bad experience with british airways before. the cabin staff were rude lazy and obviously did not want to provide a service. the flight was from mauritius to gatwick on sunday 26th march 2017 landing monday morning 27th march. no second cup of coffee offered at breakfast we had to take our own plates back before landing and on two occasions the steward pointed to a cloth on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks. food was good the staff were absolutely appalling. we pay good money for business class and this chaotic and rude service is not what i expect from my national airline.    well where do you start. this is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand. the ticket price was in excess of 5000. the lounges at lhr t5 need work. yes british airways are investing but long overdue. the small lounge for b gates needs to be rethought and offer better food options. to the aircraft  its been refitted apparently but should be scrapped. the seats remain tired. the vanity screen was not working properly. the entertainment system is past its best with smudges and scratches. the carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. the toilets are old. overall the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. regarding the crew  they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. sad but true. too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. on this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. waitrose fruit and yogurts. they have also stopped the icecream. food served was not good  saving grace was the meat platter but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. blankets are faded and ragged. the toilet bags are a joke. cheap and nasty. this route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. ba need to invest in a new fleet. reenergise the crew. change the catering and get a few more choices. upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an olympic pole vaulter.    london heathrow to singapore. business class flight from heathrow to singapore. flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why and we were not kept informed. it seems ba is these days later in taking off. during the flight i felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset. the main meal we were served was absolutely awful. it was supposed to be an asian meal of a curry with prawns but was just like gunge and was not edible. i really dont know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed  which seemed totally unnecessary. as i was hungry between courses i went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason. i have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years. i have been a ba silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew. i always try and fly qatar where possible when going to asia now as the service is better and often the price too. there is nothing redeeming about ba.    what was i thinking flying this airline for the second time travelling this airline our luggage has been lost. two years ago london to dublin our bags were lost for two days. so this flight our bags are left in london again now im stuck in dubai in winter clothes missing the pools and beaches at our resort waiting for our bags to turn up. its only been 3 days now in the same clothes. upside  service on board ba559 was excellent. however business class on ba europe flight is no different to economy so dont pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat.    just got off the flight from heathrow to new orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights i have ever had to endure. the legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight  first time i have ever been unable to open my laptop to work i now understand why they dont offer wifi on board. the seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say then it is a dreadful experience. in my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight. i have travelled a lot over the years first business and economy and had a gold british airways card but this was just terrible and i dont really know what ba hope to achieve in the long run  i can guarantee i will seek other airlines first before considering them again. anybody contemplating going to new orleans from heathrow  fly with somebody else and get an internal connection  you wont regret it. as for ba they have about as much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul as trump has of winning the nobel prize for oratory were it to exist\\r\\r\\n    the cabin crew bar one lazy individual were excellent. t5 feels like a monopoly  galleries lounge food is simply appalling. between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food. unused hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. why not leave it  so all you have is bread and stodgy croissants. the upstairs of the a380 was in need of a serious clean. cabin crew friendly although you can sense lower morale. ba flights are often late now in my experience. the club world a380 seats arent comfortable. despite everyone knowing crossing over someones legs too get out is still a nuisance. there is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing  i had one bloke shout at me when id been waiting long before him and hed just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.  many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued let down after years of loyalty and serious spending. were not getting what were paying for although charged. thats the sad bit.    i am just sad to have to write this review. i changed from lufthansa to british airways more then 10 years ago because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. mostly flying between berlin the us and in recent years very frequently cape town. ba had more modern planes innovative products like a great rather new first class lieflat seats in business class a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. flying from cape town to berlin in january to keep my silver status made me realise that none of my initial reasons to choose ba still exists with the exception of the great cabin staff that i feel really sorry for. the owners hired álex cruz last year a very experienced lowcost airline executive and he is doing the best he can turning ba into a lowcost carrier. unfortunately. the result is a pity. no more service on short haul flights reduced service only paid snacks on longhaul worn 747s to cape town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777s with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. british airways as a premium airline is lost. realistically for year to come. even with my status renewed i dont think i will fly them again if i dont have to. meanwhile i understand that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes. i do hope ba will do so in the hopefully not to distant future  and keep their great staff on ground and on board.   no no no british airways. youve messed up. someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights just like many other airlines do and they said lets provide food from m&s that will make our offering classier than the rest. the problem on my 1855 flight from marrakech to london was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink so the service was inevitably snailpaced. a piece of friendly advice ba you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight or you merely annoy your customers. sitting near the back of the plane my wife and i got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight by which time our tongues were hanging out. but whats this only two sandwiches left and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. youre promising things you cant deliver ba. there is such as thing as advertising standards and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. the 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someones payment card failed to register on their machine. hint for frequent flyers if your card just doesnt work you get your food and drink for free. meanwhile behind the service trolley a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves a very appropriate expression in the circumstances. other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m&s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. the process i call ryanisation of british airways is almost complete. you now charge for checked baggage yes i know thats indirect but only idiots cant see through the scam you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats and now youve devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on short haul what even ba used to call medium haul flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. oh and by the way why dont the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress too costly perhaps i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan but with a minor revision british airways the worlds least favourite airline.   having only flown easyjet  ryanair for all my shorthaul journeys over the last 10 years or so i was pleased to see a relatively lowcost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome. in hindsight i wish id booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation. to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. i expected at the very least an equivalent service to that of other lowcost shorthaul airlines certainly not worse. narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. regardless of this there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that at a relatively small 58 my knees were grazing the seat in front. lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m&s supplied food. i am more than happy to pay for this on a shorthaul flight and dont expect anything for free. it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. sadly being sat in row 22 this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. no sandwiches no fruit salad no yoghurt. i asked what they did have. their response bottle of water or a kit kat. after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. they never give us enough food. its mad. they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight. needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation. they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the lowcost carriers. sadly they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. id say id give their longhaul a chance but after this experience i wont bother. what a shame.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    london heathrow to munich return. it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba. sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore. the loss of the free barfood service on european flights is a real step down. even worse is the cynical way in which it happened downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an improvement to offer paidfor m&s food on board. oh and how replacing my free drink with the same drink only now i have to pay is an improvement in service is beyond me. not even a free tea or bottle of water i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying only to find it tasted of chlorine  wouldnt recommend you do the same. the cardonly payment system is chaos as well it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance. not wishing to pay this by the time i checked in for this flight the maximum 24 hours in advance there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from. i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane which is far from my first choice of seat. other carriers let you select seats at checkin for free and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance and if you pick one of the preferred seats with easyjet you also get priority checkin and boarding for your money  not so with ba. checkin at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first checkin machine wouldnt work at all and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldnt let me print a bag tag. so i couldnt use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the checkin desks wasting time. there was a minor delay due to fog but that wasnt bas fault and didnt have a hige impact. flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. on the way back our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real pro to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares  the ability to switch between flights for free ontheday. could we no the earlier flight was full. rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon we rebooked on lufthansa instead. in summary if flying ba on european routes these days be aware that ba is now a nofrills carrier. lower your expectations to this level and youll probably have a pleasant flight.    london to nice return. british airways has gone down no more food on board arrived in nice and it was 1 hour before we foudd our babys buggy in another section altogether no one informed. when returning no buggy arrived at heathrow  my two year old is now without a buggy and no one knows anything. i was told three different messages we have the buggy we dont have the buggy terrible service all round the airline has gone down and staff really dont care  especially in heathrow baggage office. they simply dont cater for families or care.    baltimore to nice via london. my ordeal started when i could not check in online. i called ba and they said the flight is under airport control and i have to check in at the airport. fair enough but i should have known something was wrong. when i get to the airport 3 hours ahead i wanted to get a good seat i was told that premium economy was overbooked and that i was involuntarily being bumped to economy. never mind that i bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago. the staff were not even nice about it. quite beligerent. they offered me a compensation card for 94. where they got this amount i dont know. i would have preferred the seat. then they tell me i need to contact ba for a refund of the difference in price. why should i need to contact them they moved me they know they moved me shouldnt it be automatic so i am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake. i did send an email on their refund form and have yet to hear from them. it has been a week. i had a horrible flight. i have severe back pain one reason i booked premium for the extra room which was made worse by my economy seat. my screen did not work for movies although the flight attendants did try. it is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip. fast forward while in france i tried to use the compensation card declined.  so i tried to use it on amazon and nespresso online. also declined. really ba i sent another email telling them the card is not working. nothing. i have flown ba in the past and have been happy with the. not anymore.  i have had it with ba. i will not fly with them again because when there is a problem they do not come through.\\r\\r\\n    london heathrow to larnaca. british airways used to be a good airline. now it is just another expensive airline with low cost service. the ticket prices are still very high but they dont offer any food or drinks any more for short haul flights. also they do not let you to choose a seat unless you pay. really dissapointed.    flew london gatwick to san jose costa rica. we have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in british airways. the service on this flight was appalling. travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. on too many occasions we had to request attention. chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. collection of waste items had to be requested. the galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. toilet bags are cheap. ba have totally lost the plot. they are no longer a premium service and willie walsh and co. need to take a flight on emirates qatar etc. to realise their failings. business seating configuration is ridiculous. passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. as part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. again service is in reverse but the costs arent. if ba wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. i dont think they have a clue what they are doing. in future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary. the only positive of the trip was the lounge at gatwick. the lounge at san jose is a joke.    the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow was extremely uncomfortable although the entertainment was quite good on the tvs the food was horrible plasticy tasting and above all not tasty. the flight from heathrow back to jfk had many delays although this was out of anyones control it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane 5 hours. at first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about. the other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new plane. i wish the discomfort of the plane bad food and time of delays were reduced dramatically. so far not a good first trip on british airways.\\r\\r\\n    very very poor customer service from british airways. myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of oman. while upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to oman. when we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in oman to get our boarding passes. on arriving in oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full. we were left there for 4 hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments. after pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination new delhi. we were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day. to say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    i had to change my flight back from san diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital. id flown out first class and had a business class return. i do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable but ba were absolutely no help at all. they flatly refused to change the flight so i had to buy a ticket in the only available class  world traveller plus. which cost 3300  one way. the first class fight to was ok  nice cabin crew and good food but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting  no snacks water etc in the galley like there used to be. absolutely no help on the return trip  despite requests before the flight  because i was walking with a stick. id requested an aisle seat had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as i tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick. really poor value at 3300 and rubbish seats uncomfortable and tv screens that arent great. the food was awful  clear that costs are being cut massively. maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful its a pity really. its obviously bas call if they want to be a nofrills airline but id rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines. but they keep trying to say that ba is a leading brand with strong values when clearly theyve decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices. might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but i suspect people will vote with there feet and fly with someone else.    philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january 2017. ive always enjoyed flying british airways and usually make my yearly trips to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united. the long haul flight was ok  food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was ok for an economy class flight. however it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning  so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. i wasnt too fussed about that until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food by this point i was pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll which never happened because the trolly never reached me to top it all off we left heathrow late because of a computer problem meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh  but i understand that these things happen at times. however recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive. furthermore the headphone jack on my ife was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight which was disappointing. on the up side the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always. considering i got the flight for a good price it was ok. although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future. im indifferent in recommending flying with ba  if they suit you best then go ahead. but dont go out your way to fly them  if there are cheaper or direct options just go for them instead because there isnt anything particularly outstanding.    malaga to gatwick. the seat had barely any legroom and it reclines only 1 or 2 degrees  impossible to relax. food and drinks including coffee and water are now being charged and the airline only provides one trolley for whole plane. we were sitting in row 28 of 30 and it took us nearly 2 hours to be served and only cards are accepted which makes things worse. appalling. if you want to fly like this fly ryanair for a fraction of the price.    flew with british airways from london heathrow to moscow return over easter 2017. the plane was old seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpet. on the way to moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. the food itself was miserable  stonecold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as i noticed while queuing for toilet and there were only two for a fully booked economy class. on the way back to london had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that i literally could not even cross my legs as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. seats were not reclining either. the food was even worse than on the inbound flight  stonecold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stonecold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight. do not fly ba to russia. it employs tactics of easyjet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service.    gatwick to rome return. outward flight the plane was full. booked and paid for an aisle seat but no legroom and narrow seat. did not eat on the aircraft. landed on time. return flight left rome late again full. this time i booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit  more leg room. food on the plane was from m&s. chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. the food bore little resemblance to the photograph  dry and not filled. i feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food receive payment you cant use cash and then clear it all up. passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served. british airways european flights are nothing more than a nofrills airline. so much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service. this is not good enough.    prague to london heathrow. british airways have lost the plot. ba is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare. checkin is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed such as gold members bronze members families business class silver members. they do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then its a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane. seating is fair though leg room is tight. the flight left a little late but arrived almost on time which was fine. there is no food nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snails pace with a trolley. i cant believe ba now make passengers pay extra for food and drink. ba shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past. i wonder what has happened to ba for it to have fallen so far this will be my last flight with ba unless there are no other options available as ba is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore.    london to istanbul. i am ever increasingly disappointed with british airways the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. the seats lounge food aircraft cleanliness on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. my most recent flight back i took an aisle seat for a change. the flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. this is really quite irritating especially during meal service. no attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. i find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. i think ba dont care on the flight from istanbul electronic devices are banned other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. british airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment or even extra magazines on the flight. they really dont appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.    paris orly to new york via london. unlike some american carriers and some other european carriers there is no beverage service on short haul flights. tea costs 2.30 pounds.  economy overseas is a joke too they bring the premium drinksservice from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had. they replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options cookies snacksized kit kats and snacksized mars you may only have one. i asked to have an extra snack i was told no only one. onboard media is decent but nothing to write home about. i classify this airline as slightly above a budget airline you do get one meal after all and entertainment but not much better than that.     los angeles to london heathrow. i have to agree with all the other reviews on here. ba have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling. theres just nothing positive left to say about them. from the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats to the disgusting cheap meals. the flight attendants were pleasant but you can see theyre embarrassed and have nothing to offer. all this would be fine but british airways still charges premium prices and for what i just took a flight on the same route with virgin atlantic and what a difference all the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper. im afraid to say i wont be flying ba anymore unless its to use up avios id acquired    buenos aires to london. i was warned that ba had gone downhill but i decided to give it a try on this long haul flight. to start with you cannot reserve your seat prior to checkin unless after paying over 2000€ for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90€ per leg to have your seat reserved. i call this insane to be honest. so i waited and waited and waited till checkin opened and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat. latam lounge in buenos aires was nice food average but connecting from santiago i had the time to take a shower with ground crew extremely nice and attentive. boarding was sort of a mess as ba let frequent flyers not flying business board through the business class door so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane crew simply unable to handle this process so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding. aircraft was a 3class boeing 777300 and looked a bit tired. seat was the absolute worst part of this flight as it is narrow too hard to have a nice sleep and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a wall on one side and being exposed to peopletrolleys passing through the aisle on the other side once flat it is a little short too even for me im 180cm high no giant here and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible therefore you have literally no space to store anything not even your glasses if you wear them. food was just ok i still cant understand how ba can run out of entrée options in business class crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working. entertainment system made me smile a bit as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier economy class ones. to sum up it was an average flight if it was not for the lieflat seat i would call it more a premium economy experience than a business one. ba needs to improve business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all european carriers not even to compare the middle east airlines.     gatwick to pisa. check in at gatwick a breeze. chaotic boarding process though. flight took off approximately 10 minutes late. the cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that ba have going for them. middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room. as for the catering. ba are getting this wrong. why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standards. i hardly call cheese on toast a satisfactory meal choice. despite calling it croque monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it  i hope mr cruz reads these reviews. it is not what the customer wants. ba are turning into a high cost no frills airline. so much for their motto to fly to serve. remember mr cruz and mr walsh there are other airlines offering a much better service.    flew british airways from london to dubai. to start with awful seats. i felt like i was being squashed by both passengers on either side of me. need more room. then it was rude staff i was shocked. to top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and was working his way back. when i interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with me. when i moved my seat back after they had removed the food trays a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me. im a female travelling alone and i felt frightened by that. just shows how little space everyone has been given. im really disappointed with ba.   stuttgart to london with british airways. how things have changed. passengers now queue at gate as with easyjet or ryanair rather than sitting and waiting to be called. unsurprisingly boarding in stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic  unsure who was entitled to what. cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of british airways to a budget airline. how visible this was few people bothered to purchase the overpriced snacks and drinks on offer. once that was out of the way the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley chatted and munched away at the spare food from the business class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear. at the rear i noticed that one of the two lavatories for economy class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy  not least because of the constant queues alongside them. everything about british airways now is shabby telling passengers how little they are valued. and this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations. my ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat but at the appointed time there were only four choices left. so no i wont be flying them again unless all other options fail.    flew nice to gatwick. 3.00 for a sandwich in club class. we travel in business class whether long haul or in europe for a better experience. this is even more important now since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the stewardship of señor cruz. it started badly when we discovered once more that the flight was not at the terminal but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus just like a charter flight. i asked a staff member why this was so to be told that the terminal was too small to cope but i noticed low cost carrier norwegian was parked on a jetty. we had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal  those at the rear of club often have no option due to catering limitations. passengers were offered a choice of a curry i think yum or salmon yuck. by the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. this is high in potassium a fish i must avoid. i asked why the other dish had run out by the second row only two were loaded was the reply. what two only for the whole of club. yes. i asked what else was on board only to be told that i would have to pay 3 for an m & s sandwich from economy. before some help from our avios the tickets cost 500.00. it was beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way. the very nice cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. ba should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard pun and migrate to other carriers. id rather fly easyjet and spend the 300 change on a nice meal.\\r\\r\\n    punta cana to gatwick return. i would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with ba but can find nothing. the layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them. in more than 50 years of traveling i have not been in a worse business class. the selection of films and music is limited and the screen small. the food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk. i do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary i have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and i wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold. i know that many former ba customers have been bemoaning the fall in standards aboard and i regret that i join that group that will if possible never fly ba again.    washington to london heathrow return. british airways seems to be having an identify crisis. are they a full service or a low cost carrier the meals have been cut back to almost nothing. seat selection fees abound. and checked baggage fees may apply depending upon the the type of ticket purchased. united airlines now has a better transatlantic coach product than ba. food on the outbound overnight flight breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar. on the return flight dinner was tiny. small amounts of food in halffilled bowls presented on a large tray as if to emphasize the lack of food. and the prelanding snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar. given the lack of food ba should just switch to buyonboard so at least fewer people would go hungry. flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food. seat fees i dont know of any other full service carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket. just assume it will cost you another 40 or more per ticket on ba. luggage fees completely opaque policy. on our outbound trip we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item. on our return we were told checked bags would be extra although the kindly baggage checkin attendant waived the fee for us no doubt he too is as much a victim of bas indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers. entertainment boeing 777200 outbound with good modern ondemand ife system. on the return a boeing 747400 the system was an older ondemand system with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable. cabin crews were generally friendly. in fairness both our flights were on time and nothing went wrong. but ba just feels cheap and stingy. will likely fly the competition in the future.    london gatwick to pisa. i fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the south terminal. its not as user friendly as the north  and meanders around up and down  all over the place. could also do with a refurbishment. we approached the new ba lounge which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the terminal with reservations as everything ba does nowadays is cheap and skimpy. pleasant surprise  its pretty top notch. good food and plenty of booze. nice and airy with spacious seating. we wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. all good so far. then the flight was called and our new found love affair with ba quickly receded. the walk to the gate was miles it took us 15 minutes  and needed a bit of a run as well. arrived all nice and sweaty. plane was busy and we had the front row the best seats. usual disappointment with the lousy seats  economy masquerading as business seats. plane old and dirty. the wc was disgusting  dark and dingy and the bowl  well i dare not even try and describe it here  save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it  leaving a permanent effect. took off on time. my wife had the sandwiches  which she said was dry and tasteless. i settled for a couple of gin and tonics. you dont expect much nowadays from ba and therefore you are disappointed  before you get a chance to be disappointed. crew were fine  and dont like the ba cost cuts. as one said we spend half the flight apologising to passengers. they also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon. i did notice during boarding two passengers bringing their own food and drink on board. disgraceful.    london heathrow to phoenix. i have been flying with british airways for years although i havent used them recently. i was surprised at the service or lack of service. our national carrier has turned into the worst. the crew are nce and friendly so no real complaints apart from on a 10.5 hour flight during the day they were nowhere to be seen until about 1.5 hours before landing. the food was absolutely appalling. for dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian. i had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless.the chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purée this was the only thing edible on the plate. a tiny beetroot salad. the obligatory hard as rock bread roll. for dessert a small piece of chocolate brownie.complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didnt realise they could ask for wine etc. a small container of water was on the tray.this meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. at which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box a packet of crisp and popcorn all carbohydrates and a small container of water. i tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.so i left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.then teacoffee was served.  i am not expecting a gourmet meal but there was no thought given to the food provided on british airways. there was no fruit no salad or proper vegetables. there were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. the flight entertainment did not exist. a couple of new films the rest were old or unheard of. the musicradio audio was the same with no new music or unheard of artists. my daughter booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the us. i have asked her not to book me on british airways again. i would rather travel on virgin or delta indirect. this by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly i just couldnt wait to get off.   singapore to london heathrow  after reading the negative reviews and the press about ba of late i was not expecting much at all from this trip. terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with ba we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. we secured seats on the upper deck of the a380 which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. ba cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft no hello from her or acknowledgement. once we got to our seats there was no space left in the overhead lockers no help from cabin crew but didnt expect any either they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast nothing in between. i was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. we got more food and snacks on our qantas flight from singapore to australia which was much shorter at 7 hours. i still cannot understand how ba are considered a 4 star airline qantas also a 4 star airline was much better in all i was not disappointed with ba as i prepared myself for the worst. i would only fly them again if i can score cheap seats.    london heathrow to stockholm arlanda. ba is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. im a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly ba primarily to maintain it. not any more. its not worth bothering with the galleries lounge at heathrow now the hot food has been replaced most of the time with sandwiches and cakes. the small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc. have gone too. and im now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights  even 6 weeks ahead. its hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staffstewards  they dont seem to care anymore. the last time i flew premium economy the food was inedible. just about to book with another airline on principle. i have to say i hope ba ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave. if youre going to be a low cost airline charge low cost prices.    bangkok to london heathrow. boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. the flight was packed full. the inflight entertainment system didnt work for the entire flight  this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. i have noticed that ba dont seem to care about ife not working on ba0009 and ba0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. the captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasnt the cabin crews fault they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. he explained that the system had overheated  well that calms things i do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous ba0009 flight i never want to experience again so i was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available however i was told they had been withdrawn  i was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. i managed but remembered how well eva air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals the cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. i have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors i also experienced sinus problems pain and congestion which is i believe due to the air quality on boeing 777 airplanes the air being very dry with little humidity. i do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches sinus pain and congestion. i only experience this after flying on 777s and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. the captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. i complained to ba and also emailed ceo alex cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. my email to the ceo was forwarded to customer services no surprises there. customer services who replied quickly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. i was advised that the lack of ife would be investigated by their maintenance team. they would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but i didnt expect them to. by way of compensation i was given 3000 avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where avios are accepted frankly i am disappointed in both the flight and bas level of compensation i have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. the only way to check is to fly that route again with ba do i risk it  therefore i will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change    istanbul to london. i am sad to say british airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one. it hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and british airways except the ticket price. my disappointment is so high because i had high expectations i paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins. i havent flown british airways for years and i shocked by how much it had gone downhill. it is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers save you coins for something else you dont get what you pay for with british airways.    belfast to seoul via london heathrow. pretty poor. short haul connection to london was good before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. flight from london was very cramped im slightly above average height but by no means a giant and i really struggled to get comfortable. seat was too narrow very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what i assume was the processor for the ife system for the seat in front. the seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. the food was ok nothing special. not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. as a child i remember the food on ba flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. staff are one of the few things ba has going for it at the minute one of the few things left from the ba of old when it was actually worthy of the name. friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. flew the same route with qatar airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. one last note you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be world class. firstly there is no smoking area although were constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. you expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we cant even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as youre normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. i am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a rolex and a gucci outfit like most people. i recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop.     paris to london heathrow. i am a ba gold guest list member with 75000 tier points. i cannot believe what is happening to ba. the attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product. cramped seats chaotic boarding every flight announced our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags. in other words they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage. now you pay for food and even water. two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. how can they let a costcutting ceo with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. it is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service  a shame to be called british. this airline is in terminal decline and i need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline. dont pay for ba shortfall use cheap alternatives its the same service.    dublin to london. 421 euros for the worst business class flight you can imagine. business class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked off. outbound from dublin around lunchtime. i was hungry and all they had was some ham dish and nothing else. i was told i had to order a kosher meal if i did not eat ham. so i practically had nothing to eat. the stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snack. however i was looking forward to a decent meal after forking out for a business class flight. so i ordered a kosher meal for my return flight. i got the kosher meal but it was vile. some sort of salmon that was tasteless. very poor experience. ba should not call this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier.    british airways from aberdeen to london heathrow. the service was what you would expect from a budget carrier like easyjet or ryanair. the only difference that the price was 150 more expensive. easyjet offer a service from aberdeen to london gatwick for around 50 return. this flight cost myself and my girlfriend 160 each. there were no complementary snacks offered we had to pay 60 each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the hold. the only reason we flew british airways was because we had a connecting flight from heathrow with another airline. british airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the fees they have to pay at heathrow. i dont buy it though. our connecting flight from heathrow cost 420 each and was a 14 hour flight. yet a 1 hour and 30 minute flight with ba costs 220 each. how does that work    london heathrow to toronto. british airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations. recently as the director i have been getting complaints about service cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff which i have listened to but have been too busy and really hadnt listened properly exactly what ba seems to do based on my personal experience. this recent trip to toronto summed everything up for me. firstly after paying around 1000 extra each for a premium economy seat for each of the three of us travelling unlike competitors ba does not provide priority boarding you line up with all the other economy passengers. when on board you are met with smiling staff some immaculately dressed others who look as if they have had a bad night so who manages quality and standards. premium economy offers a little more space than economy however that is about it. service levels in the cabin are minimum food is unexceptional and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and a biscuit delivered with all the fanfare of a gold bar being delivered however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in premium economy was both palpable and vocal and staff could not have cared less. other companies such as air canada offer a superior experience for the same price. ba management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completely. familiarity definitely breeds contempt but ba really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products. the marketing image does not match the reality. ba ground service and management at toronto is appalling staff sitting around passengers bags missing delayed no one to help staff being openly rude and dismissive. a thorough review is needed.    newark to london heathrow. you have to be very careful when choosing a flight to new york. most of the jfk flights are 20 years old boeing 747400s  prone to breaking down on the tarmac. the 747 new 1st is so cramped and i avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. i deliberately choose newark as it is served by a new boeing 787. coming back we were on one  with just 8 seats in 1st class. its not bad a bit better than the boeing 777  but nowhere close to singapore airlines emirates etc. the lounge is a shared one with cathay pacific. its ok but apart from a 1st dining area 1st class passengers are bundled in with club passengers. it is a nice set up though. boarded on time and had dinner. tasteless starter of prawns and fennel. horrible soup. chicken mains was ok. wines ok. the bed was made up and i slept for a few hours. we were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule. plane seemed pretty empty and club was very empty. club is a lousy set up and the seat is appalling. as we walked through the cabin i was reminded how cramped and daft the ying yang seats are.    london heathrow to newark. we had heard a lot about the ba first class wing at lhr and after checking in we made our way through it  directly from the check in area. the security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the first of the ba 1st class lounges. if you did not know about the more exclusive concorde lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here  as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge. the first one was rammed  end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place. the concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area. it was okay. the lounge is long long overdue for a refurbishment. the boeing 777 was parked at the b terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly fa. champagne was served and for once it was chilled. the cabin looked a little tired and i suspect the plane was one of the first to have new first. we had the new liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last december. no amuse bouche  and no flowers in the wcs. there were nine passengers in first  and with an average spend 3000  one way the total revenue would have been circa 36000. well done ba you saved 10 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x 5 for the amuse bouche  grand saving of the operating costs a massive 55. lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus pizza express is better quality  and my eyes popped as i read the lead appetizer and i quote loch fyne kinglas smoked salmon with oscietra caviar burford egg shallots creme fraiche and chive cress. oh my goodness  caviar. my excitement was short lived. i had caviar alright  but just five eggs. yes folks 5 eggs not 5 grams you had to laugh. the soup was horrible. the salad never arrived. the main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed. wine ok. fas all fine. we landed ahead of schedule  and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilot. i did not feel the plane touch the tarmac.     pisa to london gatwick. started return flight in the shared lounge. all very pleasant and not busy for once. walked the tarmac to the plane as ba are too mean to pay for a skybridge anymore. plane fairly new and a lot better than the old crate we flew out in. took off on time. we had the front row of the business class. for once i had the meal  as it looked nice. it was a salmon salad  and i have to say it was very good indeed. my wife had a hot cheese sandwich which she said was ok. champagne was served from the bottle it was nice. we landed on time and closer to the terminal. not bad for ba for once.    berlin to london. what an embarrassment our national carrier has become a laughing stock. german passengers with us were amazed that all items of refreshment had to be purchased. each transaction took a long while being paid by card. two elderly male flight attendants were barely able to service a full flight within the time available. the refreshments on offer were limited. british airways used to epitomise service and quality  it is now just like any other cheap carrier.    london to male. i booked a flight for my wife to india but before paying for it i called the ba executive club to make sure that the fare was fully refundable. they told me that it was less an administration charge. i then had to cancel the booking and instead i booked a flight with ba to the maldives.to my dismay i was not refunded what i expected for the fare to india. instead they only refunded the taxesinsurance etc. for the cancelled booking. i called ba at the beginning of march to find out what had happened they told me that they would get back to me within 30 days. two months later i called them again and was told that the refund department would call me. this they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they would not pay me back. either the executive club of ba are lying or they are incompetent. i was asked the time and date when i called ba but unfortunately i do not have it because i did not think it necessary to log the call. it is obvious to me that ba do not honour their commitments and i will no longer fly with them. i have been an executive member for 40 years and this is how ba treat their customers. an absolute disgrace.    they abandon you on a return flight. rude and aggressive customer service department. both ba flights in the morningmidday and the only flights to heathrow were delayed by up to 3 hours. no clear sign on boarding gate screen of delayed flights and big mess up of mixing the delayed flights on the screen. resulting in being stranded in rome airport with ba customer service not willing to take any responsibility for their mess up and no compensation or even refund let alone minimum of trying to help a client.\\r\\r\\n    keflavik to london heathrow. this time i was among the first few passengers aboard the aircraft. i was travelling with two companions so i had to find the space for 3 trolley cases. i discovered a suitcase was already in the overhead compartment above my seat and it belonged to a cabin crew. . it was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process ba on short haul is simply a budget airline and worse than their competitors in the hand baggage management. i wasnt impressed by their on board service either. they were so greedy to earn money from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers even though they were complaint by other passengers.    glasgow to chicago via heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to premium economy at an extra cost. what a disappointment the aircraft was an old 747400 badly in need of a refit. cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work. this took until 40 minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight. staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy. in fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight ba 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg. to be honest ba had a cheek to charge for this supposed premium product this was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on virgin. to make matters worse the ba customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort. with no regards for keeping future business. to be honest a poor service all round from our national carrier    i have always given fair reviews to any airline. with ba and being a gold emerald member i have lost my patience. i have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade. whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error it has been 7 days of this. i have contacted ba through their twitter account to be told to call their bahrain call centre which of course does not work but have been told to call the indian centre. 4 times i have called at my own expense to get people with poor english have no idea how to manage the upgrade quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price. social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some one take control. it has got to the point like so many other reviews i will use the avios and move to qatar who appreciate their loyal customers.  my advice the ground as well at the air service is now budget.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    london heathrow to edinburgh. almost hilarious had i not just been handed my debit card back when the plane was advised to put their tray tables back in the upright position. i was in row 12 the first 7 were business class. i was the last to be offered food or a drink. i had the sandwich and wine when i got home. it would have been easier to buy the sandwich bigger choice at m&s at edinburgh airport. the budget airlines could show british airways how to do a proper operation. the remaining 10 or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink. ba could not even be the acronym for budget airline. absolutely useless.    flew london heathrow to vienna. wow who is running this company in over 30 years of flying ive never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as british airways has recently. i can accept that i now have to pay extra if i want to check in a bag but to sit on a fullservice airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water really did i miss something have they lowered their prices no they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was and still is at their prices included in the fare. ba now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time wed almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger whod ordered a hot sandwich but because the payment machine wasnt working they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without. the atmosphere was pretty grim its been a few years since ive experienced such a miserable economy flight. that was probably ryanair but theyve really raised their game. british airways was a great carrier even a year or so back but now its really overpriced rubbish and they dont make me feel welcome anymore. there are so many other options in europe.     heathrow terminal 3 to budapest in april 2017. busy flight before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being taken off passengers. seated in row 12f which was the 6th row of economy class. after taking off ontime it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows. service was an absolute shambles 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class. instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows one steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the ipad payment machine. instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows. the senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left british airways have really let themselves go downhill  will not be going out of my way to fly with them again unless theyre the cheapest option.    although they indicate its against their policies they apparently waited for a passenger to get on the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow causing a 20 min delay. as a result we missed our connecting flight. for all the other connections that were missed they had arranged for alternatives and announced them before the flight landed. however they did not announce any arrangement for out flight even though we specifically asked the flight attendant to check. this is the second time in two years i had poor experience with british airways. their service is consistently unacceptable.    these are words you may not read often but i actually enjoy the british airways flights from london city. the staff are friendly and for now they still feed you and offer extra drinks. after flying ba for several decades i have decided to cut my losses on air miles and tier points for long haul because of the costcutting. but for shorthaul ba is my first choice out of city.    travelled to bangkok recently for work. tired old plane with vintage entertainment system. drinks were served before dinner no nutscrisps available followed by a passable but small dinner. as it was around 20.30 uk time i pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. after a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service. incorrect drinks were then brought. my colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait. eventually the correct drink was brought. ive written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from british airways. ive flown ba a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so its disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going. the company i was working for paid for the ticket so i dont know what it cost but dont imagine it was cheap. in their defence i flew back with them from delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff.    i am one of those crazy people who still until recently flew edinburgh  london heathrow weekly paying nearly 400 with british airways as its the key airport. now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight boarding 6.15 for 6.50 flight is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late. holidays in madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for 5.5hrs. i wrote to ba and got the big fob off. add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane so game over for me and any trace of a relationship. its now tedious & you have to put in all the effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection    return trip for me and my wife using avios flying from london heathrow to miami. staff were very friendly and professional on both sectors. flights on time. food and drink choicesquality were decent but not on a par with some other carriers. its clear bas cost cutting affects all cabins. on the outbound leg my choice of main course was unavailable as they had already been given to other passengers. having said that i could have ordered in advance via the web site. on the return leg its worth noting that access tofrom the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming. so it was a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife we are both gold card holders from the lounge and put us on the aircraft first as the boarding gate was chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend. overall very enjoyable flights but not any better than some airlines business class.    flew nice to london with british airways in economy. wont bother again. moving most of my travel to klmlh now where i can at least get a complimentary g&t. ba nice flight had minimal legroom only 1 lavatory at the back with aisle blocked however by crew selling buy on board. so low cost. so over them.    london to santiago de chile. surprisingly pleasing flight onboard boeing 787 decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the b787 is  or looks  far lighter and wider than any b777 ive been travelling on could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the cocoon look less cramped. even the seat looks wider while the ife screen is wider with a higher resolution. the odd yingyang layout is slightly better on boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats therefore you wont share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. so first impression better than usual unfortunately the soft product remains way below par i preordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available but the beef was overcooked and chewy i will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous  sort of a blue shoe bag too small to fit shoes though. the crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. overall the experience was better than usual  mainly thanks to a newer quieter aircraft  but ba is not improving where they should in those details that make business class something worth eur3000 spent. still no wifi on ba. not commenting the yingyang layout which remains a mystery to me who approved such a nonsense.    gatwick to amsterdam. as a regular flyer with ba my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image. beyond that they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry. they have no solution for the slightest problem we were scheduled to fly to amsterdam on the 1st of feb at 07.45 there was a radar problem in amsterdam. easyjet etc were informing their customers of development nobody informed anyone at the ba desk until it became a confusion at almost 09.30 we were rescheduled to the 11.40 flight with another further 2 hours delay. before this i have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the 11.40 flight. i now had two sets of ticket for same flight. up to now getting a refund is a nightmare    how far ba has sunk flew london heathrow to nice and back last week  surly and unfriendly cabin crew food and drinks for purchase. does ba stand for budget airline now i never thought id see the day when i would say ba has sunk to and below the levels of ryanair service yet still around 7x more expensive    i was very disappointed because on my flight from athens to london a 4 hour flight no food or drinks were offered for free. we even had to pay for water this was not a low price flight and everyone except business class had to buy any food or drinks. very very disappointed as other european airlines provide free food and drinksnacks even from countries such as greece aegean airlines. will not choose ba again.    i flew london heathrow to cape town to board the queen elizabeth cunard had included a flight via the middle east which at the time did not make sense so i paid the additional 120 each to fly direct with ba the airline i knew and trusted for 30 years. the checkin was smooth which encouraged me that i had made the right choice. however onboard the ageing boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than i have previously had with ba. the space available was tight for me an average sized man  i dont know how a larger and or taller person would manage. ba has lost two loyal customers but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remain. on my next longhaul i will regretfully opt for an alternative airline.    british airways from rio de janeiro to london heathrow. i booked premium economy to get more legroom as i am 6ft8 however this is nonexistent. the crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her 2year old and i asked the crew to help with the situation they told me that its the passengers right to do whatever they want. so no common sense there. despite having other seats available in the business area they refused to move me even though they were seeing the issue i couldnt fit in my seat for a 10 hour flight. they even told us off as they were getting aggravated by us being nosy i had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is 05 stars. this is not the ba that people once knew. its under iag and new leadership team that aim to cut expenses at any cost one of them being customer service. avoid like the plague    london heathrow to edinburgh. awful awful company. my randomly allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats. im not too bothered about the lack of drinks  meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles  no cash payment option not enough stock etc etc. on arrival back at heathrow t5 we were parked on a remote stand by t3 and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal. the staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low ba had sunk how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape save your cash and go with a genuine budget airline would be my advice.    london heathrow to brussels. disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight. regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshmentssnacks to be provided given this isnt a low carrier airline. however ba have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rates but give low carrier service  certainly on short haul flights.    london heathrow to las vegas. paid 116 for extra legroom 51c as they show the wrong type of plane on my booking and there is no difference to any other seat you would get for free. no refund given as it states it may be different aircraft used. problem is this route has always used the same type of aircraft so its basically a con.    london to reykjavik. i cant really review this flight as british airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested i reduce a 4 day family holiday to 2 days. ruined xmas. i can review the total lack of customer service the contempt for customers  all in all ba are not just the worst airline but the worst company i have dealt with. my rating has to be the lowest given the total service failures of ba.    antigua to gatwick. check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient better than gatwick and although we had a slight delay at immigration we were soon airside. the new lounge was really comfortable and although we didnt use it it was dark when we were there they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofas etc. the bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. boarding was on time. on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wifes tv nearly falling off its mounting. fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. push back and departure was exactly on time. within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. unlike the flight out where there was a more relaxed atmosphere the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. i can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say i want you to go to sleep now and i dont want to here a sound out any of you until the morning now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc but at the end of the day or night they are working and are getting paid to do so. in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers it would improve the flight considerably. breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful i understood why. in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i was eating rubber bands. we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim our cases were waiting for us. overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba.    london heathrow to amsterdam schipol on ba434 landed at 1430. luggage did not arrive. contacted ground agent  they could not be less interested. was given some toiletries but no essentials such as cleanser or moisturiser. as it was a sunday all shops at amsterdam were closed at 5pm so was not able to buy essentials like make up. called the luggage call centre 3 times. the first time the agent put a note in the system to say that i needed my luggage urgently because of a customer meeting the next day. then received message on phone that the luggage would be on a flight arriving at 2020 subject to conditions. called again to check if the luggage had left heathrow. agent could not tell and rudely told me to wait. called again at 2100 and finally got through. agent said she would get someone to call me to let me know if it was possible for me to pick up the luggage at schipol. no one called. called the next day. all the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage would be delivered. message to ba management you can do better by having a truly on line tracing system and fulfilment system by employing people who do care about your customers and forget about telling your customers that 90 of people get their luggage back within 72 hours. for business travellers that offers zero comfort. take a leaf off qatar airways one of your one world partners they tell their customers if their luggage follows them during transit. and qatar airways ground service staff show that they do care.    london to hong kong. the avios system is now a complete joke. they are impossible to spend. they release a minuscule number of flights and wont allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability  theyve just quoted me nearly 2000 to upgrade a flight this evening so i know theres availability  but they wont let me use avios. their concept of customer service is shocking and smacks of an ex nationalised carrier. more modern airlines with easy to use air miles booking systems like emirates deserve to be successful over this relic of an airline.    flew british airways from heathrow to geneva. cheapskate airline now. only tap water available everything else needs credit card. american family with hungry young boys couldnt buy anything for them as their machine wouldnt take us card. return flight cancelled after 4 hours on tarmac with the it crash. staff brilliant including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he could. then ba ticket desk unmanned in geneva airport so queues just standing. we were lucky to find swissair flight home or i think wed still be there    london heathrow to santorini. we flew with 6 of our family to santorini the business class seats are a joke i am 63 but i just could not move in the seats they are so tight. we then learnt from the steward that its a new configuration that hasnt gone down very well with customers. this once great airline thats gone from the best to the worst in 5 years and on european routes its no more than a budget carrier money is the key driver for ba with customers very last on the list. we all felt we had paid for a service we never received.    london heathrow to bilbao. i fly british airways a fair amount mainly for pleasure. but recently they are beginning to slip. my last flight was with two friends for our annual outing this year to bilbao. cannot fault the staff or flight crew. however the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid. there is now no reason to use ba for short haul when there is a low cost alternative. this cost cutting may well back fire. probably initiated by the same imbeciles who caused the computer outsourcing problems recently.    madeira to london. i was always of the belief that british airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but i realise now that they are no better than budget airlines. in fact i have experienced far better service on easyjet. we waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and i ordered marks & spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours. on top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took they make it very clear that economy class is just that but its shame the price doesnt match the standard of service. all in all a very disappointing experience and i will certainly think twice about choosing ba in future.    edinburgh to gatwick. booked the ticket on the last minute due to missed train and tight schedule. this was my first time flying with ba and probably my last if i have other option. it didnt feel like a national carrier felt more like budget airline with no snacksdrinks and fare class that doesnt include checked baggage. flight was smooth enough efficient but boarded 15mins late in edinburgh. no service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee.    rome to london. thursday may 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730. this caused missed connecting flight to los angeles. very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants. no one took charge of our situation information filtered through italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from iberia airlines. ba staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. no one from ba was seen or heard from at hotel. multiple calls by passengers to ba resulted in little to no assistance. friday may 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at ba counter. after 1 hour in line i obtain a boarding pass on a flight to london with connection to los angeles however the ba desk attendant informs me that the flight out of rome is late due to technical issues and i will once again miss the flight out to la. im appalled at the lack of educated experienced ba assistance ba abandoned us at rome airport. in addition there web site is of no help. flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact.    london heathrow to miami. i was looking forward to this flight  it was saturday so no work the following day and 62k on the upper deck used to be such a treat i have read many reviews recently of ba falling behind the competition so my expectations were low  but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. firstly i have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. i should have given my ba golden ticket to one of them but forgot. however no matter how good the crew it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. the seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. not a nice start. the aircraft was very very old  a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. the ife didnt work properly. amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. the toilets compared to aa were small unpleasant. seat is not up to most business class standard. food was awful and the club kitchen almost nonexistent. these days i would choose aa or delta united virgin any day over ba. it was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience.    rome to heathrow. having used ba business  club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holiday. its been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from rome was the decider. the cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats. no nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now. there was a choice of meals but you werent told unless you asked. the meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away. altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline. the advantages of booking club have gone the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks the priority labels mean you bags come off last and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue. add to this that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at security. it should not be allowed to carry our national flag.   it was the fist time i traveled with british airways and i believe it will be the last. i had to reschedule my flight from tampa to tirana via gatwick from december 2016 to march 2017. first i couldnt change it online as the manage your flight option didnt work they told me it happens some times and i tried it a lot of times before contacting them so i had to pay 25 for changing it via phone they took the money even though it wasnt my fault. i made more than 50 calls from november to a day before traveling to reissuing my eticket. after a long wait to get connected they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the eticket and sent it to my email for nearly 6 months it never come until 1 day before the flight. every time i called they said they didnt have my cvv which i reconfirmed every time. when asked when will i get the ticket they said after 10 days which only came on 27th of march and i was to travel on 28th. once they nearly set me to fly to charlotte nc while confirming my data and cvv during one of the 50 calls i made. besides this the food was ridiculous but never mind that the anxiety time consumed and the distress they caused cant be either bought or excused. how can a consolidated serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible unconcerned for the customer not complying to the minimum standards i expected soo much from them it was a total disappointment    chicago to london heathrow on british airways much vaunted sleeper service in business class. be advised this service is a joke. never mind the terrible dated seats facing one another but the ba sleeper service mandates you eat in their awful biz class lounge at ord and then suffer no dinner service on the plane. this is a monumental con. also imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria and that is what you get in the ba lounge at ord. the food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog. i used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by transatlantic airlines. the british airways business class product is the worst by far. old aircraft old seats disillusioned crew and simply the most terrible food imaginable. british airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt. what happened to english class and manners    gatwick to funchal. british airways has won the race to the bottom. leg room on this flight was appalling  worse than ryanair. i can understand why no free food on short hops but this flight was four hours. i wonder just what we gained from a full service airline. our previous british airways flight was on a gatwick 777  they are adding an extra 50 seats to these planes. with the recent it debacle they have reached the bottom and dont need to do anything else    i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were limited. to cut a long story short this meant that my partner who was the last to be served was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. this is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. for breakfast prior to landing we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. the presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering. we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting  apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident  even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become. i fly regularly long haul with klm & their new business class offering is now far superior to bas first. how can our national airline with whom we should be proud to fly compete with other superior european & gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 may. almost a month later although immediately acknowledged ba have not responded probably due to more administrative cost cutting. i should add that the ground service at heathrow t5 & the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.    absolute cheapskates. business class flight in club europe from luxembourg to london heathrow is beyond a joke and clearly on a shoestring budget. no premeal drink offered. limited selection of drinks with wine served in plastic screwtop mini bottles warm with no nutsnibbles. meal selection consisted of a chicken saladprawn which looked reasonably nice however im allergic to seafood or a toasted cheese roll. the roll was dry tasteless and completely unsatisfactory could have easily bought something better at greggs. crew could clearly be heard bad mouthing their ceo over the airlines recent it problems. friendly crew though  cant help but feel sorry for them.    geneva to dallas via heathrow. i checked online and confirmed i had two bags of allowance to check in with my premium economy seat purchased. however when i went to the airport to check in the luggage ba insisted that i only had one bag allowance and i had to pay. i had no other choice so i paid. i checked with ba in heathrow and they confirmed i had two bags. now i will have to go through sending the customer service a letter to get a refund. not happy that their system is not in coordinance with each other.    choose a budget airline the magic of our national carrier has gone. we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now its on par or lower than other low cost carriers. firstly we didnt get any priority boarding with our two young children. easyjet provides this. secondly we reserved seats as travelling with our two children they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. on boarding we were told the plane has changed therefore we now had assigned seats. thirdly after paying over 10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo first class was out of bounds. so the only option the rear of the plane however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many  so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority. after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 40 but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof asked the crew  cabin crew seats for landing. the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with that landing. all minor points but they were the points we enjoyed with ba points that made us choose them small points that made the difference. the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get id rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline. perhaps cost savings are needed but for now although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead. for me their usp was their service without that there is no longer a point.    london heathrow to seoul return. i booked my return flights back in january when ba were having their annual sale for around 1700. thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around 3000. london to seoul flight was very pleasant. didnt get to use the business class lounge in heathrow as my connection from manchester was delayed by 40 minutes. cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive. food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of highquality menu choices. the seat layout of 232 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped. the seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some however there is a folddown seatstep in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully. im 60 and found i was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable. inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases. toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that ive flown business class with before. the only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this. seoul to london was what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in korea. in the days leading up to the flight bas massive it failure and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely. luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight. the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so takeoff was delayed by 30 minutes. i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as i had just over an hour after landing to make it. the flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job. the pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. however due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park. this meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free. this was time i could not afford to lose. we eventually disembarked at 1445 which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim. really wish i hadnt as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane. by the time i had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 1515 and the gate was closing in 10 mins. talked to ba customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the iom where i live from london city but they could only book me on the 1450pm flight the next day. wasnt at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay over 3000 when not on sale it really wasnt worth the hassle for me personally.    los angeles to london. british airways has one of the worst customer service you can find. flight attendants were rude. seat and food are ok but i find them worse than competitors flying this route. they dont have wifi.    heathrow to bilbao. boarding of the flight at heathrow was very good  the flight was on time and the plane was clean. frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed. from then on the service was very similar to a easy jet or eurowings flight. the 3 crew members in economy passed through the cabin selling m&s sandwiches  snacks and coffee. the flight out of bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent. however the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. the flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too. however the service onboard is similar to eurowings. both flights were safe and competent. but the actual flight experience was lacking and in future i will consider easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money.    kalamata to london heathrow. no priority boarding at kalamata. drink and food service poorly synchronised with no predinner drink no nuts and bread served with main course. lactoovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu. the special main was yet again a bland overcooked pasta dish. overall a pathetic vegetarian offering. cabin crew did the bare minimum in club europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the m&s stuff in economy which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing. the club europe toilet was grubby. flight landed on schedule but there was a long wait for baggage at t5.    london heathrow to krakow. i am a one world emerald member on aa so i get certain perks when flying british airways such as free seat selection lounge use and priority boarding  that makes this airline bearable  just. they are obsessed with carry on bags much like ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes  not sure what it does for them as it only increases their bag handling costs. their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight. what used to set ba apart was their inflight service  even in coach a sandwich or something  this has degraded to nothing zero  even a soft drink is charged. so i asked for water i was offered an evian for 5  no thanks just plain water. ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else. of course he never came back  2.5 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water. ba are listed as a 4 star airline  aa are a 3 star yet aa now have better inflight service than ba by a country mile. ba are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier.    london heathrow to abuja nigeria with british airways. departed on time paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door don0t bother as it has no pocket for documents glasses etc.. seat so narrow that you cannot move seat cushion hard and old. cabin crew comment you have extra legroom arent you lucky my comment  yes and i paid for it when i asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport. food was bland. arrived on time. departing abuja on return trip i had an aisle seat again narrow and extremely uncomfortable. old aircraft. cost cutting squeeze in economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more. now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet. food on return trip was a so called breakfast yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter. cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to get service finished and to disappear. return flight was on time. punctuality was bas saving grace.    london to tokyo haneda. boeing 777 was tatty inside cabin items seats carpets tables etc worn and dirty. sticky surfaces and hate to think what germs are being stored here. meal standards are very poor compared to lufthansa and ana that i flew earlier this year reflects the ba move to being budget standard airline at premium prices. cabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at ba. time to remove the lowcost airline minded ceo there now and surely skytrax must now downgrade them to 3 stars at best     london heathrow to hong kong. a really mixed experience. in the positive side cabin crew were professional and polite. cockpit announcements very informative. flight on time with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failure. in terms of hard product i was a bit disappointed. the premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight. entertainment screen very slow to respond happened to me to with another a380 from ba so means its an issue with the hardware. food is decent quality but the presentation at least in pe could be improved. the luggage delivery has been a pain 75 minutes from the landing to the delivery of the bags is too much even for such a big airplane.    gatwick to alicante. yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving at our boarding gate and seeing two long lines of a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkenness. not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young baby. the language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisle. especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible. it was all truly horrible and very disheartening as we had driven for hours to avoid these conditions in lesser aurlines. previously we had had a lot of respect for british airways standards now thoroughly destroyed.    flew london heathrow to kalamata. slow boarding on this new ba destination in greece. club europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service. no ife. cabin crew were professional and attentive throughout. lunch service definitely improved although the lactoovovegetarian main course was the usual bland overcooked pasta. arrival on schedule and through to car hire within ten minutes of landing. overall a reasonable flight although club europe is poor value by competitors business class standards.    gatwick to mauritius. very disappointing airline and service. the facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits its a mess. why because you get other people stumbling on your feet during midflight. or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you midsleep every time they need to use the restroom the tv monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. getting the brightness right to make the colors work. because if you dont want the monitor to blind you when its snooze time good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. the worst thing was the food  salad was frozen. the beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. my partners chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise it was hitting all the wrong spots. they believe in umami and dump a ton of msgs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. i ended up eating bread and butter only. same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. bacon was extra salty.  and the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad. overall very poor and disappointing experience.     geneva to london. british airways used to be my favourite airline however over the last 2 years i have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights i have had with them. i do fly with ba about 30 times a year. in this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departurearrival cities i was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind i was flying at 7am the morning after. their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight. i must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy. when i managed to connect i have had to hold for an hour before the line died. i have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. horrible customer service by the way the person i was talking to couldnt care less. i was originally flying in business and i was placed in economy instead. i was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries and promised a refund on the fare which to date about 4 months later has still not happened. if you call them they transfer your call to india where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help. what once was the best airline is now worse than ryanair. avoid if possible   ba used to be a nice airline with great customer service those days are long gone. if you fly in their business class you will get what you used to get in economy 5 years ago same leg space same food same drinks. forget about a welcome drink before take off 3 course dinner was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight and personalized service. economy class is just like easyjet or ryanair but you will pay much less for the latter ones. shame.    london heathrow to new york. after reading reviews i was hoping some were inaccurate but after this flight in club world i realise that ba has fallen even lower than many have said. check in at t5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff i have encountered for years. the lounge was crowded and dirty and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. onboard seats are old and tatty cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. the food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me and what a lousy offering this was  below many airline economy meal standards. ife screen was not working properly fuzzy and very poor. cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these. luckily i am leaving the usa to asia from los angeles next week on eva air and expecting a big step up in standards.     flew london heathrow to chicago. simply appalling. aircraft was old configuration b747400 with premium economy adjacent to first class. cabin was filthy and carpets coming up. food was inedible. the ife system was old slow and low resolution. no wireless of course either. british airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service and sample it themselves. for them to call it first class is insulting demeaning and arrogant in the extreme. these old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely a380 and the entire first class and club class product should be reviewed  enhanced. but of course this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the atlantic.     gatwick to tirana. full flight on both outward and return journey. the seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch. the aircraft was clean. cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods. the main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from uk to tirana otherwise nothing special to recommend. both flights on time.   i booked british airways to travel under the assumption it was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier. i expected a meal and baggage to be included. i was unaware of the brand changes and was very disappointed after i booked. this airline is no longer quality with the prices they charge. expect a budget airline experience here. staff were very friendly and helpful however. pilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info.    funchal to gatwick. due to adverse weather our return flight was delayed three days. when we did fly the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time. they were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight. the catering service was absymal no choice of hot meal hardly a bar service and no teacoffee  i suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from lgw they hadnt fully loaded the food & drinks trolleys. in contrast to the outgoing flight this was a flight to be endured  just shows what a difference the crew can make.    los angeles to doha via london. great staff poor food and stupid cabin layout. im spoilt flying gulf airlines but this time i tried a rear facing internal 4 of 345 configuration. firstly staring in the face of my two new best friends seats facing forward was at best weird and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. crew could barely serve me ventilation was restricted and access 100 blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. once the security screens went up i felt like i was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression i had died and was on a viewing. the food was embarrassing bad  bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls. ba you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support.    london heathrow to istanbul. british airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers even loyal ones who have status like myself. the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. galleries south in t5 is large airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled. drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers  the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. onboard it is similarly tired the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. seating is cramped. the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. onboard experience the service is no different than flying easyjet in fact i would argue worse. there is no complimentary catering you are subjected to m&s sandwiches. it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings. service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight  meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle  i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. the slow service is due to the use of card only payment and also the fact the supplier doesnt allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. on the return journey its clear ba doesnt care about its european or nonnorth american routes  the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy but least the food was decent. overall if it wasnt for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline  you get better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.    athens to london. slowest baggage drop service i have ever experienced. i spent a whole hour waiting to drop my bag queue for people who have already checked in. i seriously do not understand how they can be so slow. people have already checked in they just need to leave a bag. the company really needs to look after their processes    london heathrow to nice. deliberate extortion by ba in my opinion. i booked an economy basic return from nice to london with ba. days before the outbound i had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier. i ended up buying a new single outbound flight as ba app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight. in the uk i received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from ba. however app again gave up and said i had logged in too many times. upon arrival at heathrow i was told ba had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings. they said i had to pay approx 350 to buy a new single ticket home even after i explained my situation. i argued that had i been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did i could have at least bought a cheaper flight. even the day before when i got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper. eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for 122 charging me again for taxes. as i needed to get back and there was no time to go to gatwick for cheaper flight i had no choice but to pay. terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when i asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t&c he said he would not like to comment.     gatwick to orlando return. worst ever longhaul business class flight.  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended not the worlds favourite airline by far. we have never liked bas business class club world seats since they changed over to the yinyang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. the seat layout together with the poor service meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever longhaul business class flight we have experienced. to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinksmeals which is just ridiculous. true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to get out of the centre seats rows e and f and the window seats you have to climb over another passengers feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have gone. we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. the return leg was a night flight the service overall was very poor the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap. the service at breakfast was also poor the offerings were inconsistent. my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. the entertainment system was archaic very few recent film titles the small screen resolution was very poor this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age. this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. it will be marginally better than being seated at the back but that does not make it right. we will probably never fly ba longhaul business class club world again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and reconfigure their seating    london to abu dhabi. i told ba at checkin that i would be interested in upgrading to premium economy if a window seat was available. the lady replied can i check  you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window. i replied yes. after a series of phone calls the upgrade was processed i paid 149 gbp. my seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of premium economy where the toilets should be. when i complained i was told that seats could not be guaranteed so i had no complaint. no refund offered no token gesture offered nothing. the food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. if it wasnt for the rude customer service i would fly again. i was led to believe i could pay for a window seat and i paid in good faith. ive flown ba for years but this year has been disappointing. i wont fly with them again.    london to madrid in economy class. late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from heathrow. online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay. boarding quite efficient. cabin was dirty  carpets table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. i wouldnt have minded on a cheap ticket but this was not a true case of ripoff ba in 2017. will avoid if possible.   i was told on the saturday that my hand luggage was fine the right size by ba staff at geneva airport  it was physically inspected. then on monday i was ordered to pay 65 83 francs. staff at the airport were insanely rude to be honest the supervisor particularly. their customer service is also awful. its a joke of an airline compared to competitors like qatar. when filing a complaint they did not respond for 3 weeks. they only responded when i chased them up said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. can you believe that the explanation was their it system failed in may 2017 an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved.    grand cayman to london. i cant comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the atlantic ocean only allows 1 check in free bag for economy class. upon returning to gcm from lon on october 6 2017 i had to pay 290 for additional baggage.  particularly for university students such as myself who migrate from such distances to achieve good education.  in addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage has ba gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights that was one of the things i appreciated most about ba as it made me feel valued. i am truly disappointed with ba these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to lon from gcm you guarantee i will abandon ba    sydney to paris via london after flying with them i have to admit its probably the worst airline i have been flying. when i boarded the plane i notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my. i assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep ear plugs maybe a small tube of toothpaste. here you have some headphones and thats all. with british airways you can order some special meals. i received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast. one of the cabin crew asked me if i ordered a special meal. the plane looked quite old. i tried ba never again.    pisa to gatwick. i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany. believe me it does not get any better  but the option is ryanair and thats worse. flight started in the new south terminal lounge. the decor and layout of the facility is great. no problems here although its located in a not so easy place to find. breakfast food was ghastly. cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up eggy thing. horrible. didnt touch it and those that did  left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps. had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a g&t. yes i know bit early in the day short walk to the gate. plane left on time. the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in club europe. the front row made it easier  but only just. had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad. the plane was very old. this was confirmed by the wc. originally the loo flush button was blue. after 100000  uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses to a grey colour. the loo basin cannot be described here. plane landed on time. the captain came out and i had a nice chat with him. very nice bloke. return flight started in the shared lounge. it okay but can get busy. same plane back recognizable by the flush button in the loo  unless all the ba319s are like it. skipped the meal as id eaten lunch in pisa. it looked nice though. a few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product club europe is. great flight back into the setting sun. fas on all flights were great. morale very low thanks to the miserable mean cost cutting by the ba ceo mr cruz who has no idea on how to run an airline. i first flew ba in 1980 and what a difference. decline is sad and depressing to see as verified by 80 of reviews here be so negative. time to find a new ceo i think.    las vegas to london heathrow. this particular boeing 747400 must have been one resurrected from storage in the desert. the condition of this aircraft was appalling. the first class cabin was literally falling apart with loose  yellowed bins and filthy carpets. the entertainment system was old and slow and low definition. the premium economy cabin was directly behind first class and those passengers kept using the first class toilets. it didnt matter because they were filthy. the dinner in first class was inedible. british airways are now a national embarrassment. british airways are at best a three star airline and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitors.    los angeles to london heathrow. the inflight entertainment was not working so no tv video music or radio. usb socket not working. headphones not working. customer service very poor. cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend. food mediocre. there was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didnt bother to fetch any. tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. no refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley it took 2 days to get through to customer relations many calls cutting off after 18 minutes  others cancelled after going through options. i cannot recommend british airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve. the experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service. as the british flag carrier the experience was shameful my last flight with this airline.    malaga to gatwick. theyve introduced new cabin baggage allowances. ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers resulting in a ryanairlike scuffle. they now charge for food. this would be fine if it didnt take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane. on my previous three flights with the new ba weve been left for over an hour and a half the last flight was actually over two hours without any service. as the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane. on the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. the cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. one of the key reasons for flying ba was their friendly cabin crew service. this has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company giving them no time or energy by the look of it to be nice. ultimately if price is everything make sure you check norwegian before you spend any money with ba. if price isnt everything dont fly ba.    london heathrow to bangkok. was looking forward to eventually flying with british airways after flying reguarly to bangkok with other airlines  how disappointed i was. a low budget product with a premium price. i will never again use this airline its the most costly option usually for my regular journey to thailand but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines ive used on this route in past 30 trips. seatback screen so small and of poor quality service is dreadful seats are old with no powerpoints no wifi on board. best part of the trip was getting off. absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the uk. lower your costs ba as you really are budget  go fly with any of the gulf airlines or a vast majority of europes best ba are nowhere near good enough. current price almost a 3rd more than the other 2 direct flights eva and thai to bangkok and british airways is only half as good as those.    gatwick to marrakech the cabin crew was lazy and rude refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds . for the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped. half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu. the lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customers. after 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadnt finished serving other customers even though none of the 3 staff members was seen serving anyone. we waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored. after another 10 minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving. we tried for over 1 hour to buy some jaffa cakes which would have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask for. ryanair or easyjet service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew. i will not use ba again if i can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline .    shanghai to tampa via heathrowgatwick. we received deplorable customer service recently from british airways. i purchased business class tickets on 11282016 for flights on september 30 2017. i purchased two tickets for a total of 9676.26 plus an additional 652 for seat assignments. the problems occurred on our return flights. we were booked october 17 2017 on ba168 shanghai to lhr  london with continuing service october 18 2017 from london gatwickto tampa. we were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of shanghai on october 17 2017. we checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 1100 a.m. on the evening of october 16 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 700 a.m. in the morning on october 17 the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british airways because we expected that we would miss our 1100 am flight. we were unable to do so. we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. we were aware of this requirement. we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. we knew that without a visa of valid flights out we would be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. we were able to contact a travel agent via email our phone was not operating as we were at sea in chin . our agent was able to contact british airways and explain our situation. there was another flight that departed on october 18 which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. that was flt ba 160. we were told here are your choices 1. pay a change fee of 884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights ba 160 and ba 2167  even though we would be able to make ba 2167 as it did not depart london lgw until 1155 am on october 18 2017. 2. pay an additional 6388 per person for a total of 12776 to keep our business class status on both flights. we had already paid 10328.26 for these tickets. 3. disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration. option 2 was outrageous option 3 frightening. we felt we had no choice but to choose option 1. the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at checkin and request our business class seats if they were available. when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available. yes several was the response. we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. yes for a cost of 12776 . of course we refused to pay that amount. we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. while on board during that flight ba160 i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. were we on the same flight as originally scheduled but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.    gatwick to marrakech. generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class. my gripe is about the current food service. this was a fairly long shorthaul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. after a lot of comments from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the cohoice on board is very limited especially as much seems to be already sold out. the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about 60 of passengers bought nothing. of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which i assume was not welcomed by those passengers. i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. i remember the days when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from dublin to london. if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it.    london to sofia. cabin crew were kind. this is the only positive thing. british airways are now becoming as bad as ryanair onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. when i booked my flight from heathrow to sofia i was told i get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. a day before my flight i decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me i need to pay for checked in bag if i want one. i told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. i asked him to double check this and he said he already did so i had to pay for a checked bag 30 each way since i already had my suitcase packed. next day as i went to the check in at heathrow i was asked how many bags do i want to check in. i asked how many bags am i allowed to check in and the lady said i can check in two bags one for my baby and the one that ive paid for the previous day. the thing is that i only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me i can only check one bag if i pay for it first. after i arrived in sofia i rang british airways and explained everything so they agreed they should refund the money theyve charged me for the additional bag. they said theyll refund the 30 for the londonsofia flight the same day and the other 30 fee for the sofialondon route in about a week time. a month later i checked my online banking and saw theyve only refunded 30 for the outbound journey. i rang them and theyve said they are sorry and theyll refund the remaining 30 within the next 3 days. when i pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that i get a 20 discount voucher from my next flight price they said this is something british airways do not offer.     singapore to nassau via heathrow. british airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. i will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from heathrow to singapore on oct 23. there were bugs on the flight and i have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. one can suffer the bad food service  behavior of cabin staff but having ones health compromised is unacceptable. the toilets were filthy. i was in the paid premium seat front row and i could smell the toilet from there. the attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. the food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. while flying from nassau to heathrow the dinner was fine but the breakfast i think it was a morning snack consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. i mean you cant get a croissant right the inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. the screens in the singapore heathrow sectors were ok to use but the heathrow to nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. i could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the touch screen more like punch screen. the flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time. it could learn well from airlines like singapore airlines which are pretty consistent and clean. i am giving the airline 4 of 10 only for value for money.    flew london heathrow to madrid. british airways monopoly of the routes to spain have a serious impact on the quality. ba owns iberia so theres no competition. planes are the worst of the ba fleet checkin is a nightmare because they operate each others flight but the online check in does not recognize each others booking references. really the worst of ba and iberia worlds together.    london to zurich. a budget airline at premium prices. lots of late and cancelled flights. pay for luggage food and drinks. poor customer services even at silver level. i have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the phone offered an alternative flight from another airport. no assistance for transport.    heathrow to lyon. the worst customer service i have ever experienced i arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that i could not check in. after a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up i was told i can go on a different flight  the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning. so i missed a whole days business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day. when i queried the fact that i was unable to board i was told that overselling the flight was normal  all airlines do it. the fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation. i was casually advised to read the small print in the future. on the way back from my destination in order to avoid the same thing happening i decided to check in online 24 hours before. however i was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by. apparently the return flight is overbooked again i do not understand how it is possible that the productservice that i have purchased i can not use. how can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that i have duly purchased a good 4 months in advance the disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge inept company is beyond pale on top of that the companys decision to no longer serve coffeetea and food on board is unacceptable. the ba has made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but still keep charging premium prices. i certainly will never travel the ba ever again    absolutely appalling service from ba i booked seats with extra leg room with a ba representative to ensure i was getting the seats we needed. on arrival at the aircraft we did not have those seats our return flight was the same. so i applied for a refund after a lot of back and forth with ba they started paying it back in drips and drabs not the full amount  so far i have received half of the amount owed i traveled 6 months ago  i have called a dozen times emailed and filled out forms and the last i heard was that someone would contact me and would sort this matter out  no one has called back in 2 months now. when i call they say you cant chase anymore you have to await for someone to call you ba you are a disgrace i have been patient and you have done nothing worst airline i have ever had to deal with    kingston to london gatwick. it was my first time flying with british airways and to be very honest it is my last time ever flying with them. i had a horrid experience going to my destination as well as coming back from my destination.     heathrow to barcelona. reliable. no longer feels like travelling with a premium airline. very functional but unfortunately at a cost. flight took off late because luggage for a passenger needed to be off loaded however arrived on time in barcelona. excellent information from the flight deck. cabin crew robotic and lacked personality. enough has already been said about charges for food and drink. overall falling well below the standards of the competition. great pity really.    singapore to london. my feedback seems to mirror many other users here  ba standards are just getting worse and worse and i am talking about business class which i thought they would maintain the cabin interior was worn and quite grubby the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class. the meal and presentation is really a joke and on my previous long haul biz trip i got better food in lufthansa premium economy. cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot. chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting ba because of the fall in standards  im not surprised and i for one would not use them again for long haul. time for senior management changes as the present ceo clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline. now they do little more than a lowcost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in europe.    heathrow to dubai. this is a warning of what to expect from british airways . if they continue to treat passengers this way i can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty. the reply i got from the airline below just brushed all the issues i raised under the carpet. living in egypt for 10 years i became i frequent flyer with egyptair. if i wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me 60. ba want to charge me over 500 and because i wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a 9.50 refund even though i would have given them over 2 months notice. this airline is on my black list makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline but never again will i book another flight with ba. there was no priority seat booking unless i paid another 38 extra. there was no priority boarding. i booked seat 23d but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24e. ba emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was. i did not make any changes. in premium economy i was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1 wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room. is this some kind of joke i had to double check that i wasnt in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row. the tough chicken meal was diabolical. the cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever. i really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway. i ended up paying 300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight. a few days previously i flew premium economy with virgin atlantic return from barbados and the difference between ba and virgin is worlds apart.    flew british airways from tokyo haneda to london heathrow. this is one of the worst flights i have ever had. the seats were so weak that i felt every movement of the passangers around me especially the guy in front. really old entertainment system and my friend next to me was missing the audio outlet food was also horrible.    london to toronto. by now it is nothing new anymore that the ceos very aggressive cost cutting affected all classes including first & business which called club world does not deserve it name because it is simply appalling again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder because there are smaller teams.  it is not surprising that ba current ranking bounced back to 40th from 26th in 2016. fact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommended. once a grand airline today just another 2 star airline like there are so many.    new york to london heathrow.  first class check in at t7 in jfk was quick polite staff provide better service than those at heathrow. the concorde room is just a few metres after security.  it is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths but washroom  shower facilities are downmarket. selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty. boarding was reasonably efficient  and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks pyjamas etc. delay of about 30 mins on departure was made up during the flight. i opted to sleep straight after take off  seat comfort is okay if a little narrow.  90 minutes before arrival i had some fruits and pastry for breakfast  accompanied by some good coffee. while i only needed minimal service onboard  the staff were courteous and efficient  and they are one of very few good things left after ba after their ceo seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years  arrival into t5 at heathrow  b satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam and a reason i would choose another airline on this route. we wanted for 4 satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even get to the main terminal   to find immigration in total  disorganised chaos. i buy and pay for my own tickets  and do feel that ba is now grossly overpriced forge standards they provide. please get a ceo that values quality over beancounting.    london to bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 242 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of qatar emirates etihad which are far more superior. the plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing. on this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff. cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone. its more akin to economy also a real negative point is your at heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses a shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport. this flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit. plane was delayed 45 mins & arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either. ife was poor with old films that they call new releases no where near on a par with qatar airways.    british airways short haul business class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch with lounge access and a meal thrown in. so is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket ba recently introduced business class on domestic routes and as i got a decent price for booking well in advance decided to try it out. checking in was efficient and the galleries club lounge adequate no comparison whatsoever with asian or middle eastern airline lounges. priority boarding although announced did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. having maneuvered into the cramped seat i was offered a hot towel as soon as i sat down. i couldnt decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. it was more spot the stars than listen to the safety instructions. but i guess it was something different ba was trying out. the service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. soon after take off a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. the service was good considering a one hour flight. despite a boeing 767 2x2x2 layout the cabin felt claustrophobic. to me this was no different than economy seating with virtually no leg room. how can this be branded as business class is the extra cost justified to fly club europe absolutely not.    i requested asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from oakland to gatwick on the 6th november but i was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled.  i was told that on my connection flight i have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at phoenix airport for connection flight which i never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. when i reached phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then i had to go on the different level to check in then down to go through security again to board my flight. on my return flight from oakland to gatwick when i went to the check in luggage i was told by the staff at the desk that tsa will break my lock to check through my luggage so please keep it unlocked.  i requested asian vegetarian food but when i got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet. when i mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said thats what you asked for but i said sorry i didnt as on the food label clearly says 18a and my seat no is 18k so how is this my food. she still didnt believe me instead of apology she said i have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you. after 15 mins of wait once she serving all the passengers she came to me and told me that if you want i can offer you full english breakfast i said but i am vegetarian she said i dont have any other option.     am continually disappointed by british airways. it seems they are now in a race with ryanair and easyjet to become the worst carrier in and out of the uk. flew düsseldorf to london. their lounge at dus is closed but their checkin staff doesnt know that she sent me up there. i have a connexion at jfk and i showed her the boarding passes but she wouldnt interline my bag to their partner aa and i had to recheck it. now not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11hour flight lhrlax but now they want 2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for. usually you should always fly across the ocean on a european carrier but with boac i recommend finnair or american with their one world alliance. what is the point    london to new york jfk in club world. after reading very mixed reviews here i also saw that ba were upgrading standards on flights to nyc in particular and was looking forward to my flight. should not have been so optimistic as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980s. aircraft was tatty to be polite about it worn carpets seat with various malfunctioning or broken items washrooms grimy from the word go. staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins i have flown when i have to pay for the ticket. ba talk a lot about their premium standards but even when you pay todollar for business class the standards are well below even their us counterparts. complete ripoff sums it up.    my wife and i booked two round trip business class air tickets from johannesburg to victoria falls with british airways  comair. it turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class they had exactly the same width and pitch actually british airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain and called this a business class moreover our preflight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because british airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in victoria falls. yes during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets 1372 rather than 703 which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets    london to mumbai. the electrics at my seat were not working. this may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc.  the call button light kept coming on and off on its own. it was impossible for me to control this and at the time that i did actually want to contact the flight attendant i had to use my husbands remote control to do so.  because the connection was loose on my remote it meant that things were changing on my tv screen without me being able to control it e.g. i would press play on the screen then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. because my remote controller was broken it would not return properly into the socket and kept pinging back out. this was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. the tv screen was  faulty. the usual push and release button did not work i had to push the button and then just try to pull the screen it was very tough. even the cabin crew could not release it properly. my footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own  my husband had to help every time i wanted to move this. my husbands footrest was  broken  the charging socket at my seat did not work so i could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. my husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. this is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seatrow kept opening throughout the flight. the attendant would shut it and then it would  open this happened during take off and landing as well as throughout the flight.  for this level of airline and club world seat it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  this return flight was the first time that i have flown business class. we have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our american express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. whilst the outbound flight was great i was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. the hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact the situation got worse. once i had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a reset after that the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. as you can imagine it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it. it was impossible to turn the screen off completely.    i travelled to johannesburg from london heathrow on sunday 22nd october on flight ba55 and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd october. they were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to south africa. there was no such requirement on booking the tickets via bas website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. the requirement is not even on the front page of the embassys website but well hidden under drop down menus. usually when there are requirements like for esta for entry into us ba sends a prompt. however there was nothing in this case. ba had on its system that i the other parent had travelled ba already reach johannesburg a day before. the ba counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. after being given the wrong email address first when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations they refused to refund the ticket cost only refunded taxes 25 of total. the overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and offputting. they said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of gbp 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking. other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive even though both my husband and i are frequent travellers and have silver cards of their executive program. i will avoid travelling ba even for work after this event. have received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past.    madrid to london heathrow on a busy monday evening in november was an entirely mixed affair. boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. this resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. every single seat was occupied. this was quite hard on the staff. a trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain uk based tv personalities. this was in english only. the inflight service was very poor. i ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. i regard this as a health and safety matter. british airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.    flew british airways from bologna to london heathrow. we arrived at bologna airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us. we were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. the member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. for us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the lake district the following day. we were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation. i thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines    my husband and i booked our honeymoon to italy through american airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines british airways. we ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at london heathrow and we would not arrive in rome in the am as planned. we decided to give it a shot regardless. we arrived at bwi and discovered we were not on an aa flight and had packed more bags than ba would allow. we had three checked bags instead of 2 and british airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to 100 for additional. luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. i cant say the same for the rest of our trip. we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. we arrived into london around 9am. late of course and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. we again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome. the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight  so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into rome for dinner. upon our return flights we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british airways app and web learning from before and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account. we eventually had to make an international call and pay 174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london. once we arrived at rome to check  we got hit with the 100 additional baggage fee we we tried to explain the representative refused to comp the bag. upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. luckily we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. otherwise i imagine we wouldve had to shell out 100 again. we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london. if you fly british airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey.    london heathrow to brussels. i had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in belgium. going there the staff at checkin in were amazing as i had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. however coming back to london the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. i got on the plane and asked if i could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as i could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. the first staff member at the entrance told me that i had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat if no one could help then he will try to come. so thats what i did but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasnt allowed to carry a bag unless i help her and even after explaining the situation she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end. i work in retail and i know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane. i am very angry by this situation and next time i will think twice before choosing the company again.    \\r\\r\\nflew london to san francisco. british airways provided a functional disinterested service on this ten hour flight. we were given what was necessary and certainly no more. ignored for five hours not even a glass of water offered and it was made clear that the staff were happy to do the bare minimum and no more. if you have to go with british airways do but if you can avoid them then i would. in the interest of fairness i have informed the customer service team at british airways of my experience  so far i have been ignored hence writing this review.    london heathrow to seoul incheon. i was flying my return leg back to korea after a christmas vacation. i had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. to start with i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. having not had my selection available on the outbound leg in business class i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. i couldnt pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had again run out of 50 of the available selections. quite disgraceful. i was also unable to check in on line so i was directed by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. the rest of the airport process after that was smooth. this time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. this meant that i did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if i wanted to get out of my chair in flight. of course i had to pay extra s for the seat selection in business class  a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. the flight was uneventful. on this occasion i had a very warm crew for which i appreciated. overall i still feel that ba is just too cheap on its product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. frankly even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time i had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier.    seoul incheon to london heathrow. this was my first flight on ba for many years. as a brit i was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for christmas on board the relatively new b787. i was disappointed. the fare i paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a j class cabin  in my view. however it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in j class. i do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and i certainly do not appreciate it. i was seated in row 1 by the window. my first experience in this cabin was a shock when i realised i was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me. and further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. the tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service. even in row 1 by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. this left me taking a korean option on a flight on ba where the majority of the passengers seemed to be nonkorean. clearly something wrong with the meal ratios. they offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight. i went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise  it was mostly just drinks. it also seemed to be a fixed meal time  something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. the ife selection was nothing more than average. i found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers. the service and product simply left me feeling that ba is way behind other carriers and i concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin.    flew cape town to london with british airways. its hard to think of a good thing about this flight. on the outward journey i was in an aisle seat. next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. the crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt. so three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. the food is awful poor quality and with poor selection of wines  cheap spanish wine with no choice the cabin was over heated. it was the most uncomfortable flight i have ever taken. until my return flight  entertainment system was not working  ancient plane same miserable food. this airline used to be good now it is awful.   british airways is seriously lacking in all areas. singapore to sydney return in economy. fly the route often usually with qantas which are great. the flight out to sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night  most people are looking to maximise their sleep. especially those who have come from london. cabin crew were surly unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised. after departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest. during the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep. the food is very average also. two hours before landing they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic. no tea or coffee. the competition is too strong for this route. i would never use them again.    london heathrow to basel. boarding there are now so many priority boarding passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like secondclass citizens. the new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further. since i was traveling on a lowprice ticket i found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. yes ba appears intent on replicating englands class system  on board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a french atc strike. obviously this was not bas fault but no drinks not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. after take off the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. why ba offer heated sandwiches further slowing down their bob service even further when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place is beyond me. the nocash policy further contributes to the snailpace progress of the trolley. the trolley and a cup of tea was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. end of service. someone at the back quipped so you opted for the premium seats too yes ba is a joke its attitude towards passengers its customers shameless and embarrassing. it wasnt until i had left the airport that i was able to get that cup of tea. needless to say eurowings and easyjet do things much better.    miami to london heathrow. a bit of a mixed bag. boarding at miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back so much for safety. seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at heathrow. also my wifes ife failed mid flight. impossible to hear information from the flight deck. these ageing 747s really are in desperate need of replacement. the congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. the minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired. the only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew. they must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support. flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly.    prague to washington via london. british airways has turned out to be the worst airline i have flown. unfortunately i am forced to fly them often from prg if i want to connect on their one world partner aa which i have exec plat status with. ba charges for everything including water. prglhr is on a small business class seat same as in economy dried up breakfast that was tasteless flight attendants that could not care less and when i asked for coffee told me they were landing soon 40 mins before landing and that i should have thought of it earlier. london to washington  was on a broken down 747 seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. entertainment system has about 40 movies compared to about 200 options on aa flights. overall horrible experience. the extra added costs for flying over lhr and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. ba what is it about your flights prglhr with your onboard luggage allowance only they charge usd 100 for a checked in luggage even to emerald partners  horrible food aircraft lhr and transfer experience. good luck ba will avoid at all costs. included a picture from the bathroom which was broken.    bangkok to london heathrow. despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe on this route ba has a daylight flight i cant stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you cant sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. the fare was also pretty good. in the end i have to admit my mates were right this was a let down all along. my issues were the following. i purchased a ticket in premium economy. the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version when in fact not one of the 777200 which operates the lhrbkklhr route have been refitted. the seat date from the early 2000s  almost two decades ago and i had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. come on  yes i got my amenities kit a better pillow british papers and predepartures drinks a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. but the seat is old not that comfy the ife belongs to the late 90s and is a disgrace to the industry. great sound good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. i spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat. the seat itself is way outdated and the cabinseat were dirty. it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great. the meal service was not good out of bkk. bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack  just a napkin. main dish was ok but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. no cheese nor crackers. not enough at all you are left starving and in economy it is even worst. i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the jc had a brand new a la carte service as well.  cabin crew operating both legs were great  professional approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. the only false note was the meal preselection. you get served first as they do with special meals  but do not offer you any drinks. you have to wait for a very long time. by then my meal was cold and i sent it back. they did replace it right away but this was clearly a waste of time. preselecting your meal means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. other than that it was this time a decent meal. having said that there was no middle service which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. not acceptable on such a long haul. funny enough the bkklhr feature three meals so why not on the lhrbkk leg . ba could be so much better. they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right  and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .   after 3 hour delay at airport flight destined for verona with arrival time of 21.35 was rerouted to venice meaning bus transfer and arrival at 2.30am. we passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. i had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. at such an unsociable hour of the morning i could no longer disturb her. i explained all this to ba who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and i would be reimbursed. on arrival i was brusquely told by a ba rep to go online and find my own accommodation. after a more than 5 hour delay my phone had no battery life. i was left to borrow a fellow passengers phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport  miles away from where i should have been. it transpires ba knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight  yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. i wasted 5 hours at gatwick when i could have carried on working. also had i known would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. to top it all when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of verona at 2.30 am  no taxis. ba had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. further wait. not only had i missed my dinner reunion to my astonishment british airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill stating that they had after all got me to my destination. i hadnt even counted the extra taxi bills i incurred 45  but i did expect ba to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture. not impressed.   flew british airways from madrid to london heathrow. an aircraft full of people. we were being asked to checkin our hand luggage or in some cases to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival. i must say i find this irritating as i had one piece of luggage within the rules. other people didnt. those should be asked to do this. i truly felt as if i were in a low cost airline which is sad to see. shorthaul with ba never again    london to miami. british airways have been so disappointing and need to improve fast. they cancelled a flight the morning of a flight and so i had to buy a new flight. the compensation they offered  was 22. then my most recent trip was to miami which i had an expired esta but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small fee they let me buy a 1000 new flight. then offered me a 112 refund when i phoned to complain. i am a ba member and must say the customer service is atrocious as a company its just spiralling down.   berlin to london city. i have never experienced such an unreliable unprofessional airline that is so hard to contact. my flight kept being delayed for hours. after more than 4 hours delay there was no point for me to fly to london anymore as i had missed an important meeting. i was told that i will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation. after a few days i call their customer support to ask about the refund. they told me that i will get the refund within 7 days. after 4 weeks i notice that they still havent refunded me. its very difficult to contact them. the phone hotline is only available until 5pm mondayfriday. they hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website. once i managed to send them a message i only get a reply a few days later telling me that they cant reply to this case via email and that i should call. all i want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund. i take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times. after being on hold for a while it turns out they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hours. a very convenient mistake to forget a 360€\\xa0refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiry. only after i asked what compensation i will get for this i was offered 5000 avios points. no thanks with that level of unreliability and bad customer service i will make sure to never fly british airways again. i make sure to tell all my friends about this experience.   flew newcastle to san francisco via london heathrow with british airways. one issue after another the flight from newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in london we departed late. we should have had a two hour layover for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to san francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been rerouted via washington our booked flight to san francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back. we finally got on the washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from amsterdam to catch the flight. the delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at heathrow thus delaying the flight further. we eventually arrived in washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight  there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available. obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour around about 23.00 trying to find help at the checkin desk in a practically empty airport. united acting on behalf of ba checked us onto a flight the following morning and the ba staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away. ironically the ba personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us we were also downgraded to economy on the flight between washington and san francisco as business class was full. we eventually got to san francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival. ba offered no compensation for either the time lost or the downgrade in class. they did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the prebooked but unused hotel in san francisco. the airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibility. not a good experience at all and nobody really cares   manchester to london. we were flying business class and expected a fast track boarding but alas the fast track boarding queue was longer than normal boarding queue then on the flight it was the case of 2 ends of the plane on either side of the curtain those in the front were offered a quick sandwich and a drink those behind had to purchase. the short flight was on time the leg room in front of the plane was exactly same as at the rear except the middle seat was blocked off though it felt like business class in the plane on the ground pre boarding it certainly did not ba needs to improve and fast    london to athens. on the date of the flight i received a text message and an email saying my flight is full so i could check in my carry on luggage for free later on another text saying that i will have 46 minute delay. i was at the airport almost 3 plus hours before. checked in at the machines but it couldnt allocate my seat number. then a british airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat number. seating at a cafe i was checking the tv screen every 510 minutes and it said delay 1246. my flight was scheduled for 1200. at 1145 i tried to pass through security but the machine would allow me to scan my boarding pass and asked me to seek assistance. the security officer told me that i lost the flight because my flight was at 1200 and suggested me to go to counter c1. now at the counter c1 a lady told me that the flight was at 1200 and i lost it. while i was explaining that the flight will be delayed she made phone calls and tried to explain the whole situation. then she told me to go through security because the bar code on my boarding pass will be valid for 2 minutes went straight to my exit and it was packed from people sitting. waited at the gate for another almost hour and in total the delay on arrival to athens was 1hr 20mins.    london to barcelona. the ground service was really poor even thought i used premium counter sapphire status of ow.  i paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak english. staff could not distinguish the taiwan passport from the china passport and keep said that we need visa to go to spain. it took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad. the worst staff i had  met. although ba sold a very expensive ticket however even a cup of water you have to pay for it. i would never choose this airline again.   very disappointing. i was scheduled on a british airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at heathrow and having flown ba in the past it was very sad to see how ba service went down this year. meal and drinks for purchase uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight. i would fly a low cost carrier instead since thats exactly what ba now achieves. many years ago it was one of the european flagship carriers and it was fun to fly ba now its just another shrinking violet.    vancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had. i was travelling with 2 seniors 85 & 70 we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. we actually had to beg for help. the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare. the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. the 2 seniors had to walk all that way. it was not only the walking it was the rush they had as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 130 hours. on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. again we had to beg for assistance and the british airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. they said that they called the buggy and that was all. we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 in london and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. this gentleman who is not british airways employee provided a great service. summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out. seats were another problem. we did the online check in 24 before and we had the seats already chosen 12d for one senior isle and 18d isle for the other senior. when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. so once again more walking for them problems to get inout the seats and of course problem to get to the washroom.  luggage another problem british airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver. surprise surprise we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage.  they said we had to pick it up before going through customs. there was no way to go back to the carousel so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. so nightmare again and another rush to us to get to the next fligh. according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. what can you expect from british airways if it doesnt even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver.   this was really a no frills business class. this flight was part of trip with qatar airways. unfortunately the london to doha was operated by british airways. the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines. the ife was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options. the meal was not good related to the price you have to pay. the fas were really dull nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like fas from other airlines. ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin. it might be excellent innovation back in mid 2000s but the industry has moved on.   london to berlin tegel return. its becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between british airways and the budget airlines. the only saving grace is that ive never experienced any issues flying out of or into t5. noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also ba have removed a toilet in economy within their a319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet disgraceful. my flight to berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldnt offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats. i feel for the staff who often work tirelessly.    flew london heathrow to dubai. arrived at the new wing at t5. a quick process and into the concorde lounge. i noticed as before the check in staff do not mention the concorde lounge per se. just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge. this option was rammed. am pleased to confirm that the concorde lounge has had a long overdue makeover. it looks a bit better. had a snack and a few glasses of fizz  then made my way to terminal b. friendly fa showed me and wife to our seats. looked freshly cleaned. pushed back on time. 1st class was full. airborne i had dinner mezze to start which was nice. some chicken thingy for mains  which was horrible. cheese and biscuits to conclude. wines were ok. the seat the new first  is not wearing well. looking somewhat tired. managed to get some sleep on the bed with the usual duvet and blankets. i am a tall guy and need the space. the club world option is horrendous. very pleased to confirm that mr alex cruz bas ceo has reintroduced flowers in the 1st wc. readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. if mr cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747400s. so a full 1st cabin will generate about 40000 of revenue. the flowers for 2 wcs probably cost 8.00  so pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the reintroduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. the 1st product is very mediocre compared with say emirates. some have said its sort of an upmarket business class. id agree with that. one would think ba would want to make a big impression on this route  with at least some high end food. logic is not something ba seem to understand  given the high level of negative reviews on this site. very disappointing.   flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow. arrived at dubai airport checked in  and endured horrendous security. not bas fault. walked miles to the new lounge. its a weird set up. you walk through the club option with a considerable variation of food  to a tiny room with small options of food. seating very mediocre. made our way to the plane. departed bang on time. airbourne i went for lunch straight away  after a couple of g&ts. arabic lamb starter. boring and tasteless. no other options. skipped the soup. had a salad. the beef mains was very good  not exceptional and no wow factor. just nice. red wine was ok  mid priced stuff at about 25 a bottle. my wife was told the beef was now unavailable. my friend had beef and so did i  when challenged on this i was told  only 3 beefs aboard this flight was again full and had been for weeks. 14 people. 3 beefs. a joke. my wife had an arab dish which she did not like. when it came to coffee my friend then i  had a choice of chocolates. my wife then had the box offered  only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy fa. most ba cabin staff are good  this one was a pr disaster. flight was smooth all the way home. another sad experience from our national carrier. definitely not worth some of the extreme prices posted for this route.   flew british airways from saint lucia to london gatwick. agree with other recent reviews ba quality is severely lacking compared to other oneworld carriers business class. we were not addressed by name. staff seemed rushed and not proactive at all had to ask for anything we required. not all breakfast items were available. seat space and comfort seriously under par. nobody came to collect rubbish prior to landing so it remained on the floor in front of me. did not feel like valued customers.    london to montreal. very bad service with delayed luggage. for some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone elses name and to a different destination. i was flying from london to montreal and my suitcase was sent to dublin. first guy i talked on the phone after a week of no news at all he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something in theory he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to montreal. but after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing i decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase was still in dublin. a second email was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. a couple of days after and of course with no news at all from them i decided to call them back again. this time my suitcase wasnt in dublin it was sent to london heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. this guy asked me to call them back monday morning london time so i did. i called back again on monday morning and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his london team he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase when i had done that same day i placed the delayed luggage report. dont they have all this info in file. after telling him that i did that first day he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. im tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. no compensation was mentioned to me even that i had to buy clothes and some other items that i already had in my suitcase. lucky enough this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. i understand there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but thats no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get whats yours. i think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time i would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me. after this awful experience with their missing luggage department i hardly doubt i will use british airways again.    london to houston. executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day. the staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 usd to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end. needless to say that because we are away for christmas & new year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team. i repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that ba and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority. because we have been given 801 usd no phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto todays flight. furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 usd in the first place the callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested ba return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. the tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items.     las vegas to london. absolutely horrendous experience we were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours in high temperatures with no air conditioning  the passengers were all sweating before the plane took off. kept saying it would be 10 mins and then 15 mins. 2 hours odd later we finally took off. economy on ba is horrible. seats are uncomfortable no space can hardly get refreshments the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water food is bad. to make it worse when we landed in london we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because ba didnt have a spare arrivals gate. due to all the delays we had to run like mad people to get from heathrow to gatwick in time for our onward flight with ba. against all odds we got their with 30 mins to spare plane hadnt boarded yet but they casually said we were too late and said wed have to fly the next day. absolute joke i wont be flying with ba again when i have a choice.   flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow. overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through t5. unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight. flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. b747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. the food was ok. the biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. no smiles or even a welcome on board whilst walking down the aisle. on arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers. the service provided by ba has significantly declined over the past few years. even the newer planes b777 and b787 havent got cabins that compete with todays market. also just like other budget airlines you now have to pay to choose your seat. very very disappointed that i didnt choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price.   i was on a flight from new york jfk  budapest via london heathrow on 9th december the flight was delayed 6hrs when i arrived to london i got information that my flight to budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow. that was on the 10th december. i was there with a few thousends other passengers from ba nobody gave us any food any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase. after waiting 23 hrs for my suitcase i was struggling with cold at terminal 4. someon from ba took us to terminal 5. today is 12th december and i am still in london without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to budapest. i paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels ba offered are fully booked. this is not what you normally expect from british national carrier airlines. very poor website nothing is working and for 3 days no call centre they try to tranfer you from one number to another without any sense.   flew tokyo narita to london heathrow with british airways. flight delayed by four hours  which is understandable due to the weather in the uk at the time. the inflight entertainment was awful. it was good for only a short haul journey. very limited selection and very dated equipmentscreens. plus they kept stalling. the staff were ok although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum. we were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end. the food was average and i was very hungry throughout the service. as far as i am aware on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible  i dont call being starved very comfortable other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey. why cant you you used to be the best and now youre budget. i wont be flying with british airways again.    i was quite disappointed with my experience with british airways. first of all our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in lhr. however the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with foodvouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. however there was no information on connecting flights in lhr. once on the plane the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying ryanair or british airways. seats were okay but nothing outstanding  same with the crew.   flew british airways to pisa due to flight times and ba miles. overall a poor economy class product. the seats were really tight. staff were ok but seemed stressed. you had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of ba and they predict other airlines will follow suit. difficult to get a glass of water. three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child. at checkin their automated system failed so it was done manually  thank goodness for carbon units still employed by ba. overall ba is dramatically failing. those who have ba miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines. ba is no longer uks national airline. the magic of alex cruz and willie walsh is not working if it ever did. avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets. loyalty does not pay.    london to toulouse. british airways is no longer a full service airline. to compete with easyjet and ryan air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with m&s food. this is overpriced and not that great. secondly the food was never complementary it was included in your ticket price. this was the case in this flight to toulouse. next time go to pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. i asked for a glass of water. this came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. at least offer people water  it is a human right. the seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. in this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  i was told by the cabin crew when i asked about the new service level that more may be in store for bas comers  charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. i hope that this is not true. the only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. customer care and service has gone. avoid ba if you can. consume your ba miles and shift to other full service carriers. they are better and more responsive.    will never fly with ba again. outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos. our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. cabin crew said the aircraft shouldnt have been in service. i agree. flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. no assistance provided by ba. told it wasnt there problem and sort my own accommodation out. took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. was told club seats werent available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. was told i couldnt have a refund of the difference between club and economy. looked at ba site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had rebooked me onto. called back but they refused to put me in the cabin i had paid for saying i had volunteered to downgrade and i would have to pay to upgrade 600 each plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for. ba is now as bad as ryanair so will never fly with them again. theyre charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service.    london to tel aviv.  i have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of british airways. i landed in tel aviv and waited one hour for my bag to appear and when it didnt i went to the qas counter and gave them my information. for three days my bag was in london before reaching tel aviv and then the driver didnt bring my bag to where i was staying.   i flew premium economy from london to cape town on british airways. having flown premium economy before i had certain expectations of what i would be getting but i was sorely disappointed  this was by far the most expensive premium economy i have ever flown and unfortunately also by far the worst. the plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. from premium economy i expected wider seats and more legroom  the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat where i was constantly pushing against it. i finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. the personal entertainment system with noisereducing headphones  the screen was tiny the blind next to me could not be pulled down. the headphones were plugged into the side of the seat where i kept knocking them but the quality was inferior to the point that i spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in so that i could actually hear anything. expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding  no priority boarding at all. i find it shocking that ba charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. i needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times with no success i phoned ba and was on hold for about 15 minutes after which i gave up and just cancelled the flight which worked first time. i booked a flight on another airline and for just 200 more i got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant.    dublin to heathrow. ba gets worse and worse and worse. today was special though. as usual the did the standard in dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasnt  after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadnt started. again as usual club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad. today as a special treat they hadnt heated the paninis for my row  so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients. and finally they ran out of champagne about the only advantage left of club.     london to new york. aircraft was very dated ife poor meal service average no snacks poor drinks service crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and were outdated a decade ago. the meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years. to top everything off the crew couldnt even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest  embarrassing when you tell ba about a negative experience theyll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint  absolute waste of time  dont waste your money flying ba  ive had far more positive experiences on ryanair.    budapest to philadelphia via london. they changed my return flight by more than 4 hours. when i asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there. called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy. then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes. wonder what they do with the miles. the worst business class i have flown. never buy their premium class. lounge in london is worse than the free lounge an american express card provides. what the heck is wrong with them    london to düsseldorf return. outbound flight from londiin city was fine. boarding was quick and smooth flight was not too busy. nice crew on time departure and a breakfast tray which i did not expect. on the flight back a319 to heathrow and you need to buy on board. dont understand the concept of ba. its an incosistent product as on the outbound flight there was service on the inbound flight no service. they should decide if they are a fullservice airline or low cost. i understand that they are under pressure but they are usually more expensive than lufthansa  and a completely different story if compared to easyjet. easyjet is not offering any great service but you wouldnt expect it. with ba prices are like fullservice but value for money is much worse than easyjet or eurowings.    new york to london. my flight was cancelled on november 17th. the day i was supposed to fly in the evening i received text when i was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that i had to leave in middle. after talking to one of the agents for hour and a half i was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from charlotte instead of new york. in order to get this new flight i had to be at jfk airport at 145 pm. to make this happen i had to skip all last minute arrangements. the flight from charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to london. our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours. on top of longer and uncomfortable commuting i was unable to sit with my children. the meal i requested was not available on the new flight. absolute worst experience while flying back from london to new york on november 27th we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didnt have our requested meal available it was my first experience with british airways and ill make sure its the last one. on my flight back to new york i requested water to one of the attendants and she didnt turn back for 9 minutes i reminded her. she said she has been very busy. no apology no courtesy nothing. a big name like british airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff.   flew british airways from london to cape town. where to start yesterday 6th january our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today due to technical problems which they couldnt fix that night. after a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the hilton hotel next door. so we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the ba desk to collect our vouchers. we duly went along to the hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us  by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained especially those with small children. the desk staff told us they were trying to phone ba to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. so at this stage my husband and i decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to london safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th january. we duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. oh dear ba why couldnt you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night just too efficient for you i guess. so weve been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do no problem ba we didnt mind forking out another 5 to cover it. you used to be such a wonderful airline flying our countrys colours proudly and we were proud of you its almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers.    toronto to london return – business to london and first back to toronto all on avios. fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team. fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. ba presumably to save money have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – premium plaza. its frankly awful no class or professionalism with limited wine and spirits options and cheap and nasty food piled high. elevator music drove us mad and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft  what on earth are you thinking ba fast boarding though with fewer crew the boarding service in club is fragmented. late with champagne wash bag after take off etc. with only four crew working club there just isnt time to offer a quality pre flight experience. the new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. we were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. all choices were available but the food is just not club standard. poor entrees cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for got some sleep had an okay fast breakfast passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new first check in fast track and concorde lounge. excellent service on boarding a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. dry sandwiches with mean fillings but okay cakes and scones. early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags 45 mins after landing. these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences. the crew were young and lacking experience  knowledge but make an enthusiastic polite and smart. however they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. long haul crew were cranky at times but they would connect better and offer a more sleek  fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped but ba really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.    las vegas to manchester via london. fairly dire as always. ba is cutting the new club world product as i speak before even having rolled it out. addicted to cuts. perfect partner for aa. so i get on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg so why did i not fly a low cost airline there no difference whatsoever the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. and what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to vegas a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. no oil just some grey vinegar it was foul i assume nobody ate it. the main was tomato pasta or curry. the curry was so appalling i ate none of it. the chicken was like paste the sauce dried out and the rice overcooked. i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing a mini blueberry muffin was given to my ravenous neighbour. no cheese crackers these days nothing. served with cold tea. i really loved also being rammed on a transfer bus from t3 to lhr t5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus it wont leave until it is full then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. and to top it all of ba now offers a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express. i have another flight in may which is nonrefundable i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. this is not a full service airline. it is fully no frills. the only exception is i think is the long haul canteen meal you get. the airline is a national embarrassment. the flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given but the ground staff are beyond it. fly this budget airline at your own peril think about spending a bit more. im going to try lufthansa or thomas cook though i admit im dreading that prospect.    london to dubai.  this was a terrible flight with grubby cabins same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying. the staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive language. if ba actually knew their premium passengers they would have avoided this.    amsterdam to london. service ryanair wouldnt tolerate but with premium prices. every two years or so i fly with ba and every two years i am reminded just why i dont normally fly with them. whilst not as bad as my previous experience which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to milan and left me  out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived an no they wouldnt refund me we were still delayed. all the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. ba didnt show the delay until we should have been boarding. get to the gate with my shopping what else are you to do during a delay and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or theyll put one of my bags in the hold. even ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. it would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasnt allowed. once we were on board the reason became clear just like easyjet ryanair and many of the other budget airlines ba doesnt include a checked bag meaning that all the hand luggage wont fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. so not only was the flight delayed but i now had to wait for a suitcase. once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly i managed to catch the last train to my destination unlike the previous time id flown with them. additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. do not fly ba save your money and go with a budget airline. the colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.   no curtains in business class once again british airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they dont matter. this flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet. why pay more to fly business then dreadful flew in from chicago to heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest ive ever seen and with awful food. the controls in my first class seat did not work either. british airways is fast going down the drains. avoid   flew british airways from warsaw to london heathrow. my complaint is about the cabin luggage policy. my fullsize cabin bag was given a yellow tag and i had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was full. if you dont have enough cabin space to accomodate all the cabin bags please introduce the wizz air solution the bigger cabin luggage is charged an extra price or decrease the allowed luggage size. the current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair.    i was due to fly london heathrow to vancouver jan 7th.  six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelled. when i called in after waiting for 45 minutes on hold i was told it was due to operational requirements. a lot of back and forth but the bottom line ba could not get me back to yvr until thursday. i could get a refund on the return portion my flight which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to rebook. or they could fly me into seattle on tuesday and i must make my way home from there on my own dime and i could submit for reimbursement from ba  no guarantees they will reimburse though. i was told when ba cannot get you to your home destination their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country and forces me to clear customs there and at home. i am flying air canada when i return to the uk in february. at least if they cancel my flight they will make a better effort to get me back home.    london heathrow to madrid connecting onto iberia to panama city. had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for business class flights ba still wanted 20 per person each way to pre book our seats. we tried to check in on line and were unable to. when we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to costa rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in madrid airport. this flight had been booked since march 2017 and no one had raised this the assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage. we were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to madrid the seats were the same as economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat. we were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard we were we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in club world. we were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats thats just greedy.    london to dusseldorf. my suitcase didnt arrive. i was unable to file a claim upon arrival because ba 940 was delayed and i had to catch a train to osnabrück but was told i could file online. that is incorrect because the online system doesnt accept american airlines strap tag numbers. i tried to call the number i was given but the agents in madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after i explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the dus baggage office. i called the local number they gave me but the call was routed every time back to madrid who again refused to take the claim. finally on about my third attempt to reason with the agents i found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. however i did not still see my suitcase until four days later. now i am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred toiletries underwear doctors consultation and replacement medication. on another topic 1.80 for a tin of coca cola    johannesburg to london. awful pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant. my seat area was absolutely filthy. when i asked the stewardess to assist she looked at me like i was such a nuisance made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper.  between 34am in the morning i went in search of snacks. found the cabin staff in the kitchen area. when i asked please may i have some snacks i was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. not one them got up to assist not one of them had replaced any of the snacks the counter was empty only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs they kept serving the person next to me over me instead of going around me didnt matter that they blocked my viewing  that is fine and understandable but no excuse me please can we nothing. rudeness at its best. if you asked anything the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore and made one feel like you were being a burden.    dubai to london. cabin looked dire and wasnt particularly clean. seats are dreadful. sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to get to the aisle. product must be about 15 years out of date. food was of poor quality. no midflight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches.  second meal was tiny. arrived at a bus gate in london. no bus appeared for about 30 minutes. crew blamed the bus providing company. overall an awful experience i do not intend to repeat.    flew london to bengaluru. british airways have reached a new low. flight boarded on time but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded and engineers were working to replace a pin. two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne. cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful. the ba premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. the promised fine china dining experience only relates to main course. all other food and drink was served in plastic. the entire meal came on a cluttered tray dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. the chick pea starter was icy cold the main course lamb over cooked tasteless and inedible. dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. entertainment screen was marbled and very small. reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery. a very unpleasant experience. i have no wish to repeat but sadly i have to return to heathrow in the same way.    reykjavik to london. i had to pay 8 to change seats at checkin 80 for one checkedin baggage. you also have to pay for food and beverages on board the aircraft. all those petty things are why we avoid low cost companies but now that we know those are traits shared with ba we will also avoid ba in the future.    bangkok to lisbon via heathrow. we booked our flight tickets directly on ba site since july 2017 for the travelling date of december 24 2017. one day before our travel we processed the online checkin and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight bkk  lhr without prior notice through any communication channels email sms text by ba. after many attempts to find a solution it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in thailand. however we managed to talk to the customer services team in uk. she informed us that due to the connecting flight from lhr to lis was cancelled by ba the airline had removed our names from the entire trip 2 sectors. the assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the bkk  lhr flight if we by ourselves could find a connecting flight from lhr to lis. the only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. unfortunately there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice  to accept the refund to our tickets without offering any other help. our intention is to seek for proper explanation from ba in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communicationnotification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. we had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to checkin online 24 hours before the flight. if we had went to checkin counter directly on our departure date we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled.  we were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but bas neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. finally we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66 extra since it was a last minute ticket on christmas eve. i find it inexcusable for a worldclass airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. this event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trips spending but left us with one of the worst flying experiences. we chose british airways in hopes of a seamless and stressfree travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help.    london heathrow to paris orly. flight arrived 40 mins late nearly double the scheduled flight time. as all short haul british airways flights no complimentary food or beverages or included checked baggage. premium airline price budget airline service. i only use as ba have a virtual monopoly on heathrow and to maintain oneworld status.    i was supposed to fly from new york to paris with a direct flight. but they canceled our flight and rebooked us on a flight with a stop to london  the new york to london flight got 3 hours delay therefore we missed our connection in london. we waited 6 hours to get the earliest flight from london to paris this flight got also cancelled we rebooked a flight and waited another 2 hours. this flight got also cancelled after waiting the whole time. we finally left the airport and took the eurostar otherwise we could not get home  they lost our luggage we received them a week later to our home after 30 hours we got home and complained to british airways which was supposed to compensate us for the original flight eurostar tickets and the delay of our luggage but they never answered.   flew singapore to madrid via london heathrow with british airways. seat had a broken table and nowhere to move to unless downgraded. service was inattentive at best. suitcase did not arrive and after repeated attempts to speak to customer service to express the urgency of receiving suitcase for which i had received automated message stating it was at local airport i was told ‘ba does not have the telephone number for office at mad so all that could be done is wait for case to arrive. this is beyond ridiculous. company used to deliver bag eventually was horrendous. they asked to meet them at corner as they could not park when parking was clearly available. too many options in business to put up with this ‘low cost service at premium fares.    gatwick to tobago. many years since ive flown in ba club class. interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified. outbound flight to tobago on 1 january was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadnt turned up. floor around seat not vacuumed properly. looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up. fa took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker. invited over pa system to read high life magazine  not in seat pocket  had to ask. preflight drinks served ok. when asked for meal choice options didnt correspond with what was on menu. asked fa if i had wrong menu. fa insisted it was right menu. looked again and fa said it was wrong menu and brought correct one. meal ok fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty. seat was comfortable if snug. yingyang seat layout makes it hard for fas to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless youre in an aisle seat. meal tray not horizontal. didnt bother to watch movie as screen quality poor. flight had caught up a bit on arrival at antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. arrived tobago 5 hrs late. return overnight flight left tobago on time. old school fas on board  attentive capable unobtrusive. dont think ba trains them like that any more. meal tray came with dessert already on it i hadnt selected. when converted to bed seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you cant bend your legs as i do in sleep. got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back. seems fairly common for fas on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking if youre obviously awake if they can get you anything. not on this flight. i guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring club kitchen. breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early. i can remember when a flight on ba club class was something to look forward to. cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the service. not so any more based on these 2 flights.   a fairly average flight to cape town and return. the old 777s they use out of gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. the tv screen is very small and fuzzy and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working but the selection of entertainment is ok. the food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with british airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. as always with ba the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly others were borderline rude. however i would probably still choose ba to cape town in order to fly direct.    las vegas to london heathrow. really poor food i am little fussy with my food but my partner will eat anything and even he wouldnt eat what we were served. the breakfast wrap of turkey bacon or mushroom and spinach. they both smelt revolting and i didnt even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldnt eat anymore. chicken curry was questionable or again spinach lasagne  just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesnt mean they what spinach with every meal there are some very nice alternatives out there. we were not offered tea or coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive. i would think twice before traveling with ba again. i thought they were meant to be our flagship airline.    orlando to gatwick. the flight was ok but let down by utterly appalling food. the chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour. it was mainly just rice. the biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar  no fruit bits in it  just like eating sawdust. who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast bizarre and ridiculous. looking around the cabin very few were eaten. i commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising. come on guys  even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel what planet are you on   san francisco to hyderabad via london. i had a really bad experience with british airways. i had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try british airways instead of taking my regular emirates. the flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the takeoff. the customer care was unresponsive. i have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. i had to go book emirates in the last moment with 400 hike in price. i wrote email to customer care. it has taken so much time to get a response from them. the bad part is they wont refund your ticket price. i hope no one goes through such similar issue. my honest opinion be sure of your travel plans before you book british airways. i was my first and last journey. i wont recommend personally to anyone.    london to duesseldorf on 21 january. flew with them 10 times over a one month period. this was the last of those flights. 8 of the 10 flights were changed or cancelled. the flight i was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure. mayhem at the t5 customer service desk. far too few people to serve. seats on ba are terrible. everything costs extra. there is nothing good about ba anymore.    i had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life my 50th birthday. on this occasion i had invested in an upgrade and as such i expected nothing less. for 15 hours on an overnight flight i had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. i was downgraded as ba overbook their flight by 10. their offer of compensation was 200 i am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. this experience has caused undue stress and at this point i am reluctant to use their services in the future. their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming british airways into the worlds leading global premium airline. our investment in our staff our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service. the experience with ba has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday i feel i have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience   london to istanbul. flying in bas club europe is a miserable experience and i think they have the lowest standard of all european airlines. the seats are economy class seats with no legroom the only difference is that the middle seat is kept free. service and food are mediocre. when will ba get its act together and return to acceptable standards   i have traveled several times with british airways but only in long haul trips. those have been pretty good. this time i had to fly from edinburgh to london gatwick and i end up with mix feelings. ground service in edinburgh was outstanding. expeditious friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge. service on board was average but friendly. departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier so very well. the plane was an airbus 319 in pretty good shape clean and well maintained however the space between seats was simply ridiculous. it was extremely small even for a midsize person. there would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work. happily the person in front of me did not recline that could have been a disaster. very bad. of course there was no entertainment. there was food and beverages for purchase. due to the space between seats i would avoid flying with ba in short haul flights.   could british airways get any worse flew chicago  london heathrow in upper deck  club world of ancient b747400 british airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. the seats are the crazy  odd facing each other with a rude screen and are terribly uncomfortable  narrow. they must be at least a decade out of date. the food  wine was simply awful and they didnt have the lamb on the menu but replaced it with some kind of beef mush. the crew were young uneducated and unprofessional. they were waiters and waitresses at best and didnt seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. club class on this route was also full of screaming children one of whom threw up on the flight. why do ba hold their premium customers in such contempt i can give you the answer they have a monopoly from the uk to the usa and back and no legitimate competition.    the best thing about this flight from london heathrow to miami was its punctuality. however having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45 if we hadnt eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich. only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady. aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age. screen tiny scratched and hardly worth looking at. we have flown similar routes on thomas cook and tui planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this ba flight which i think is shameful for the national carrier.   flew short haul business class with british airways manchester  gothenburg via london heathrow. its a diffcult one to review some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. we used points to travel so what we paid was fine though would never pay a full ba business short haul fee. we have family in sweden so took 70kgs gifts etc of luggage with us for our four night trip. checkin was fine both ends all fights ontime just about and no luggage issues a positive. the staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to emailpublish our concerns. we had a mixture of fortunes with the catering manlhr nice cold meat platter 30 min flight. lhrgot three dried up finger sandwiches no alternative offered were told could not take from the m&s menu in economy either. one reason for this because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. i was told to change my profile details on ba site  once home i looked it clearly says meal options  none i.e. no special menu confusing to say the least. thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. we were told in economy you had to purchase everything even water however if in an emergency tap water could be provided  so much for a fullservice airline any newspapers also gone from business class. on lhrgot route there was no divide put up between business and economy so a free for all to the front toilet. leg room not great even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat more than 24h in advance 21 for the frist row and 18 for the rest which is ridiculous if you had paid 400 return. lounges ok  preferred man to lhr which is busy and looking worn already. the downscaling of ba and the mix of pretending to be a fullservice airline but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. the fas were a saving grace though rest assured they are not happy. well use up our existing points though definiately not our airline of choice.   flew london heathrow to prague. bad service. had to check in the hand luggage at the gate despite being bronze. arrogant staff. not to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshments. i fly the route a few times a month. british airways sometimes uses airport bus instead of air bridge. and there are frequent delays. whats the difference between ryanair and ba again please ah the price the only reason i give 210 is because the plane has reclining seats and got us there safely.    new orleans to hyderabad via london. i booked my flight ticket couple of moths before my travel and i received an email on the day im going to travel saying that my flight was cancelled and they asked me to book my ticket for the next day. this destructed all my plans. i have an interview to attend which is very important. i gave a call to the customer service and they really did not gave me any options. after couple of hours over the call i am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from msy to dfw and london and hyd and the layover is very short and i am very tense as i dont have any options to choose. this whole journey was very irritating and the customer service is really bad.    delayed 2 hours on outbound flight to athens due to lateness of aircraft and then due to technical issues. no tea or coffee offered while on business on that flight. extremely dated aircraft. meal offered was good. cancelled inbound flight to london due to technical issues of aircraft. hotel and compensation offered. no entertainment during the next days new flight. in general british airways has no customer satisfaction anymore. unfortunately i fly with them cause i have to. it has become an unreliable average airline.   it was a 13 hours flight from heathrow to kuala lumpur with british airways and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served. during the dinner i was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake. for the breakfast the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals up until 40 minutes before landing they were still serving i waited for my turn but no food came so i asked. instead of them explaining and apologising i had to ask where is my food. they said that they ran out of food because they only cater for 80 of the passengers assuming some will be asleep. the cabin crew were very nice he apologised and passed me a feedback form which i have filled in. while i understand that this airline does not want to waste food and i liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours. also it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew i thought they should have their own. it was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes and out it came a cabin crew. very interesting experience.    worst business class i flew you are facing a stranger for the entire flight. also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face. dreadful food a very dated 777 plane and  uninterested staff. the bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food. they also ran out of the appetiser. i was told sorry we ran out of satay and other passengers have already ordered them. therefore please select another option.     bangkok to london. the worst long haul carrier i have flown with. a very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy. the flights served the worst food. the boeing 777 i flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones & portable devices. the seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey. meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8 hours. when i mentioned to the onboard staff i was hungry i was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful. the dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens.   food on this 4 hours flight from moscow to heathrow was a filled roll and 1 cup of teacoffee. the other londonmoscow flights provide a full meal. the cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers. when the flight touched down it was 75 minutes before we disembarked 6 british airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then 15 minutes for an air bridge operator. my email to their ceo produced nothing except a plastic apology even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation. used to be ba was a world leader. theyve followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction.   flew london heathrow to delhi airport. terminal 5 concorde room is impressive clean but lacks service. had to wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attend. when boarding the plane  no one to escort you to the seat. as you know there are only 8 first class seats in b7879. when it comes to meal choice the main course i had selected non veg indian dish was not available. when questioned why  i was told sorry today we only loaded 3 of those dishes and other passengers have already ordered them. therefore please select another option. so i skipped the main meal. i reminded the stewardess that i am not an upgrade passenger i paid full price. it is shame that ba is flying with less than 50 food choice for their premium passengers. i have never faced this situation with virgin or emirate and have decided never to fly with ba if i can help. two regular an uneventful flights. curiously enough though with the exact same crew the crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite but i just cannot take it that british airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers where everything is charged for apart from luggage. on the second leg of the trip the aircraft felt extremely warm and for some odd reason row 6 where i was sitting did not have ac.   london to belfast. another regular flight by british airways which has turned into a low cost airline given the total no frills service they provide. the staff are extremely nice and polite but in the short haul flights you only get luggage. the flight went perfectly departing and arriving on time.    my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the 10th march 2018. we have a 1 year old and a 4 year old. once seated we realised that our entertainment system was not working. the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. as it was a night flight my wife and i had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video we didnt receive this. the flight was the worst airline experience weve had. i doubt ill ever fly with ba again.    gatwick to madeira. the flight left on time and arrived early slept as early morning flight. the plane was not very clean grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats. the staff were pleasant. breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate. the return was poorly organised no use of fast track security for business class passengers. long queue for boarding and a grubby plane. really no point in paying for business class. the staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment dogeared magazines.  quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration.   london to casablanca. their customer service quality in heathrow terminal 3 is very patchy. for background my initial flight was with tap portugal which got cancelled then rebooked to ba. my second flight had further issue and instead of requesting tap to rebook me ba took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me  which turned out to be overbooked. this then caused me having to liaise with both tap and ba to rebook my 4th flight  i was tossed around by both customer care telling me its not their problem. tap can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as ba rebooked me on the 3rd flight. i was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue  the last flight i was rebooked was overbooked. however later on i was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. they were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of ba. this is very rude and extremely unprofessional. ive never had this treatment during my 10 years of flying with various airlines both top rated and low cost carrier.   hyderabad to brussels via london. didnt expect this from british airways. for me quality hit the rock bottom. especially the unclean flight. i would have preferred the aircraft from brussels to london and vice versa for the long haul travel. maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price i paid for ticket i think its not worth it. other airline which i used to travel had the same price and if i compare the services of that ariline i regret choosing british airways.    milan to london heathrow. the service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at ba i am flying with them very frequently and this last trip was testament that they have lost passion. the response was we are not responsible for cleaning the plane.\\r\\r\\n   very full flight on gbnlpb747 flying from miami to london. according to basource.com this plane was built in 1990. obviously since then it was not refurbished. felt like a teenager again. worn seats cracks in the walls and dirty. additonally the ife did not work. at the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment. as the night approached crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. no ife and no book reading possible. crew were young and friendly but obviously not experienced. took 2.5 hours until we had our meal after takeoff  they skipped our last four rows. only after inquiring we got a tray. on arrival new contractor at terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available. needed to wait 20 minutes until someone arrived. overall poor experience with british airways. they used to be good but they try to be lowcost and charge legacy carrier prices. will not work. to fly to serve is no more adequate as their slogan.    i booked my flight with cathay pacific  the route between stockholm and london was operated by british airways. for a 2.5 hour flight they do not offer anything free on board there was no individual screen or usb charge at the seat for this short european flight.   flew british airways from lisbon to london heathrow. uneventful flight. the crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there. they should smile and be a little more considerate. however the checkin lady was nice and we had a laugh. my problem with ba for a while now is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights.   singapore to heathrow. i skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal. the air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came. when i asked another air steward for a bottle of water he told me they dont have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal. was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight    chicago to chennai via london. the pilot and captain were top class  the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours  but they made it up to 2 hours and was smooth. chicago check in staff unfriendly it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of us. the only thing they tried was to upsell me into first class. meals  excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business.  my co passenger asked for a menu  answer  you are booked for veg meal  so that will be served. he asked for drinks menu  answer  what do you want  the seat was claustrophobic  closed and uncomfortable. the crew was unsmiling.   i flew british airways from heathrow to hong kong in club world on a a380. they have recently introduced the new club world service on this route and it was a complete disaster. it took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight. they ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold. the cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didnt seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new ba concept doesnt seem to work well it was even criticised by the crew during the flight. i am gold on ba and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future.    london to phoenix. decided to pay to travel first class for a big birthday. upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in i was disappointed to see no separate check in. just a young girl with a couldnt care less attitude behind a temporary room divider. off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious uninterested staff on the door huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago. the lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. on board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first  was followed by a filthy seat a screen that wouldnt stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. our return in club from new orleans was not much better no separate check in no lounge but a 30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest. i love ba onboard crew in general but i will never fly ba again.    gatwick to barbados in december 2017. on a 9 hour flight they provided one meal and afternoon tea which consisted of a mars bar and a cup of tea. the plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were surly. the only redeeming thing was that it was cheaper than competitors but still not cheap.    london heathrow to dallas. the aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so. seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. the personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen so i had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. the choice of ife is very limited. the food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. i saw some passengers request for more food and i was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. i must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights tofrom jfk. i had an onward connecting flight with american airlines and i can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. whilst aa is improving ba is becoming a national embarrassment. ba remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. the seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. it no longer deserves a 4star rating but edging between 2 or 3 star. its not even worth redeeming avios points anymore. these days id rather spend my avios on partner airlines.   decided to go in club europe for this relatively short flight 90 minutes from london to copenhagen. dropped my bags and went through security which did not take too long. i then went to the galleries lounge south and although i have not been there for a year or two it looked the same. same food same drinks same slow wifi. my gate was just around the corner and i got on the plane. i like the fresh look inside but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. the food service was disappointing. the service in the cabin was ok but not very warm. i have travelled a lot with ba over the past 20 years after yesterda i have lost my faith in british airways.   ba used to be a byword for quality and service. you simply cant say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. i paid 600 dollars for my ticket from istanbul to london with ba. for that price there is no airbridge you will wait on a crowded bus and no entertainment note this is a 4 hour flight. also screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight so no alternative of watching movies on your ipad. oh and youll have to buy any food and drinks on board. i flew ba on this route because no other flight time worked for me however turkish airlines is by far the better option with airbridge free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. pegasus and atlasglobal offer a similar service to ba but at far lower prices. it seems to be the same all over. ba used to be a first choice but at this price for this service its become a last resort.   premium economy worse than most airlines economy. unprofessional staff uncomfortable seats foot rest but no leg rest very little seat recline and difficult to operate. rubbish food very poor landing and everything went flying. additionally we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. these premium economy seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light  not ba. even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. this was the second leg on a flight from sydney via lax so we were beyond tired. when an attendant picked up my sons water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight he didnt hear my son say thanks which he had so the attendant said pointedly youre welcome  rude and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. in my experience better and cheaper premium economy can be found with norwegian air new zealand and american airlines  all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. ive never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with british airways ive never had a good experience.   flew belfast to london with british airways. stressful day started with a 2.5 hours delay for the morning flight at 7am. as an apology they sold us the food and the drinks yes they asked for money even though we were stuck on the airplane for over three hours seriously if you can find an alternative to travel within the uk do it. not very countable if you have a connected flight   naples to gatwick. the online checkin would not work for me in accordance with the one world frequent flyer policy. i am a qantas frequent flyer and so i ought to have had the chance to checkin a few days ahead of the flight. the ba website would not let me do so. the bagdrop in naples was slow and seemed rather random. boarding was tedious. i should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. in the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. the cabin crew were quite indifferent. i greeted 2 cabin crew when i boarded and neither of them smiled back. i bought a marks and spencer drink at an inflated price. one of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when i went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. disembarkation was slow and badly managed. nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers. ba has become a lowcost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag i will not be using them again in a hurry.   i have been flying with ba for the last 32 years between sao paulo and london on and off but mostly ba. i have travelled in all classes except first. ba used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. not value for money. the food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink even in business i flew out club and returned economy plus. staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude no changes there. boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. service is not exclusive anymore. seats on the 777300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on club. their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety in case of food allergiesintolerances really bad and of poor quality. it is a shame singapore airlines doesnt fly to brazil from the uk as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. ba has become mean greedy and indifferent to their customers and i feel it is time for the ceo to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. the changes on baggage weight has become silly also. i was allowed two luggages of 23kg. any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as i havent go above the allowance i am entitled. instead i had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. in my opinion unnecessary as i had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg so i will in future rethink my trips to brazil. even if i have to make my journey longer as i am after good service value for money and a differentiated experience. thumbs down to ba.   i traveled on british airways with my wife from dallas to lagos nigeria via london on february 23 2018. i had an extra bag that i paid 200 for in dallas our flight got delayed in dallas therefore we missed our flight to lagos. when we got to london we went to the ba counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a virgin atlantic flight to lagos. on getting to virgin atlantic counter we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from ba we decided to do that. i opened a case on ba website explaining what happened and requested for a refund as what happened was their fault and not mine. they refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy i know this but what happened was not my fault but theirs. that was the last time i heard from them on the issue even the economy premium was a waste of money nothing special such a disappointment never again   flew british airways from budapest to london heathrow. quite possibly the worst flight i have ever had and i travel often. generally when we travel we try to pack our hand baggage light as we check our heavier bags and its more convenient for other passengers too. my partner and i had 2 briefcasesized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. as more passengers boarded most with aslargeaspossible carryons the overhead lockers filled up. the flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads takes out our bags hands them to us and says im sorry but the space is needed for large bags telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. reducing our leg room to zero. how is this at all fair i questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carryons and was given the response that i would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. i have no idea who at ba thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean thank you for bringing smaller carryons than everyone else as a measure of our appreciation well take away your leg room. the general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. young adults barely out of high school and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services starbucks such was their experience at providing pleasant service. what a sad state of affairs. i will never ever travel british airways willingly again long haul or short haul. i would rather take a civilised onestop journey with lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct british airways flight.    ba lounge in toronto pearson closed last year. the new firstgold lounge is dated rammed only one shower which was like being in a old poorly run gym. poor food selection and nobody in the lounge was eating. overnight flight time to lhr was 615. tiny welcome drink took 20 minutes to arrive. waited an hour after take off to receive another drink. service took just over 2 hours once in the air. no sense of urgency by crew to think that passengers may wish to get more than 2 hours sleep. skeletonstaff of crew working a large business class cabin embarrassing serving of nuts with drink. warm wine. cheap meat on menu watery soup no bread basket etc. wake me up card requests ignored as woken up by 40 mins to landing announcement. given up complainingfeeding back to ba knowing that ill receive a cut and paste response. functional business class for the bedspace only  set your expectations low and youll step off a ba flight with a spring in your step.   the air conditioning didnt work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot. i had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was cooler. it was an 8 hours flight from london heathrow to new york jfk. overall the airplane was old with little space to seat. there was no wifi. the legseating space was very small. i wish that food would be more taste neutral. if your child doesnt like spicy or flavored foodssnacks there would be nothing to eat. the stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding. landing was smooth. the ba staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on. there are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in and these boxes are very small. also the airport security was overly zealous  they had to search kids bag and they found rollon deodorant and checked it for fumes.     my bag was damaged on a ba flight in december 2017. all looked good when i got to the airport customer services counter  was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to call. i called this number when home and its a 3rd party company called k2. they will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used. i raised this with ba who refused to offer likeforlike replacement. i got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times. 4 months later i decide that something is better than nothing and call k2 to get the bag they offered me only to find that ba have closed my case and they wont send one. finally get through to ba and they finally agree to put me back to k2 to get the bag offered. if i want to upgrade what they offer i will have to pay it myself. i wont hold my breath but it is supposed to arrive on tuesday. i would not fly again unless i had no other viable option.    st lucia to gatwick. as this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and i now wish wed saved the extra that it cost a complete waste of money. the cabin is very dated and cramped it wasnt clean half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor and the service and food were average at best. why in this day and age do ba persist with having seats with no direct aisle access not that i could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway the seat was adequate and no more the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky needing very firm contact to get any response. on top of this there was no usb point to charge my phone i expected better cabin service than we got not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it  i certainly dont expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier. all in all it was an education certainly taught me a lesson    fort lauderdale to gatwick. an efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals terminal 1 to the international terminal terminal 4. checkin was friendly. security staff insisted on using a wholebody scanner for everyone and were overly officious. surprisingly there was no business class lounge although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. club world was in two smaller cabins with the usual outdated eight seats abreast. takeoff was on time. the wrong menus had been loaded so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. drinks and food service served efficiently. food adequate and not overcooked but below the standard of turkish airlines. seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat. abbreviated breakfast no hot option served an hour before landing. arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule. overall an adequate flight but the inflight experience was well below bas competitors.   london to las vegas. disappointed at ba  flights were delayed my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 23hrs. aircraft interior was outdated unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space. no safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this. food was tasteless and i did skip a meal in the end  during one of the snack times we werent given the options by our fa but the guy sat next to us who was served by another fa was given different options. inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old. to ensure that i sit with my partner on the return flight we paid to reserve our seats  not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke ife box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor.  learnt our lessons next time we will not fly ba   venice to gatwick. i use snokart luggage which is designed to be zipped and fastened together to allow skiers to check in one bag only. in feb of this year i was told by ba check in staff in venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together. the staff were clear that it is ba policy that bags cannot be fastened together. for nearly three months i have been asking the ba complaints team to provide evidence of this baggage policy. i have had several replies in that time but on each occasion the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in venice. ba has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact ba employees or employed by a third party. this is very disappointing in what was a reputable company.   first 3 legs were trouble free. lounges were good some staff were good some were very poor especially the agent i encountered at security in lhr. my flight from singapore was delayed in the air and i was not allowed onto my connecting flight. british airways rebooked me on the next flight but downgraded me from business to economy and into a centre seat. fine i wanted to get home and they said they would compensate me. after 3 weeks they finally mailed back to say they would refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket but i was not entitled to any even token gesture of frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat after a long haul flight. i missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleep. it was all handled very poorly late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via air france or one of the middle east carriers who value my business. its left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and i will certainly look at flying with other carriers now.   flew london to budapest with british airways. massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like ryanair or easyjet with no real added value. no drinks or food served on the flight the checkin process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well. a bit more legroom but that wont justify the 200 price difference on a 2hr flight.    paid for a vueling airlines flight from florence to gatwick and bumped off flight. when called british airways most unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them even though i bought the ticket from ba.com and had one flight number ba2058. a shocking attitude towards their paying customer.   worst ba flight ever flew tampa to london gatwick. no greeting by the door shown to economy despite business seat. dirty plane. bits dangling from the ceiling. only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier. probably the worst business class seat around wobbly footrest facing strangers and having to climb over people. breakfast was a single meagre roll with one tiny bacon slice and unbranded ketchup. at disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers that was left to other passengers. crew just stood there. economy was not held back so no priority disembarkation. never again.   flew british airways from london heathrow to dusseldorf. despite being row 1 legroom was tiny. no comparison to say eurowings which is a budget airline. food terrible. even worse was the seat. this is not business class one expects a degree of comfort. next time i will fly eurowings and get decent leg room with a table i can actually work on.    glasgow to heathrow. very disappointed in british airways. having been delayed by a partner airline and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve ba charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning. their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my ba exec club membership so id had to book it as two flights. neither ba or loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night. clearly being a member of the ba exec club counts for nothing. very bad customer service ba. seems ba and loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers.    madrid to london. the main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly and hard working. the i saw no food in the iberia lounge at madrid no working washrooms and discourteous iberia staff. the food on board was ludicrous in business i got a panini  the staff looked embarrassed to serve it. waste of money.     london to moscow. british airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in business class is no longer club world flat bed seat but club europe seat not flat bed. it is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. i cannot fly during the day as i have meetings scheduled. ba has not offered a like for like change they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that ba is offering during the day. they also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date like friday when the seat whether club world or club europe is less important as saturday not a working day and one can get a rest. in summary it is unacceptable that ba is charging more for the flights with club world seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change. this was never the case before and ba was fair previously.    athens to philadelphia via london. i chose ba because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ath to lhr they do not serve food and beverages free. on the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats there was no waste envelope whilst my inflight magazine was so overused. lhr to phl an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way rather poor lunch. i was disappointed with ba especially with their decision to charge for f&b on european flights.    hong kong to london heathrow on b777 in club world. this was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to hk on an a350 on cathay pacific and the difference was huge. the ba club world cabin is very cramped when compared with cathay. the seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. the duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off this is fare enough but there is little room. they also provide bottle of water which is great but again little storage area. the food service was also disappointing the duck breast as my main course was very tough. drinks selection was very good. plus points go to the cabin crew who were very professional and had a sense of humour. understand ba plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough.    cape town to london. dated aircraft very poor cabin service semi inedible food and the inevitable entertainment system crash made for a very poor journey. the cabin crew clearly regarded us as an intrusion and i do not feel that i should be having to ask for a drink with my main meal surely we should have been offered something as a matter of course. i used to be happy to pay more to fly ba now i pay extra not to.    washington to prague via london. i have flown them several times in the past but not for a number of years. i remember them as not a top of the line airline but better than average. this time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped hot towels as you neared your destination and they have become almost a low fare airline. you pay for reserving seats on shorter flights you pay for food etc. the seating on the boeing 787 seemed very cramped. it is said to be 31 but seemed like less. on the return flight on may 3rd two of the lavatories went out of service. the a320 from london to prague seemed to have more seat room but the seats were very hard. they may be the new slimline seats im not sure but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. also on the washington  to lhr flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. the agent at washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife. it was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home. i wont say that i will not fly them again but i will definitely compare prices in the future. they arent worth any extra cost.    hamburg to abu dhabi via london. hamburg to heathrow not even a free glass of water or a candy. everything is for purchase i felt cheated. heathrow terminal 5 was a big mass. getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over 1hr within the same terminal security screening was extremely slow and staff rude. i will avoid heathrow in the future. long flight to abu dhabi was ok no frills in premium economy but edible food. return flight was similar but heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time. my last flight on ba was over 30 years ago it was a real premium carrier then.     london to washington. apart from the space nothing nothing was first class not even the comfort. crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach. food which used to be fantastic is just eatable no more. wines which were the best in the sky when jancis robinson and hugh johnson made the selection apart from a good white champagne but mediocre rosé are at the level of a business class. and my seat did not have sound from the audiovideo system so they moved me. and an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing. needless to say no wifi apart from their lhr first and concorde room lounges at lhr which remain great ba is now no better than a 3 star airline. sad for the clients and shameful for ba management.    london heathrow to vancouver. the 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft even though i paid for premium economy the seat was hard small and uncomfortable it would not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat back the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off. the touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely working. the washroom had a leak and when i used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said i shouldnt have worn socks. there was no accessory pack of eye shades etc out of two meal choices one had run out after two rows had been served. the  crew appeared bored and not bothered.    london to montreal. i did my online checkin the night before and left to go to the airport. i arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and the kiosk wasnt working so i proceeded to the ba counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. i was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines. the line we were moved to was substantially longer however i was patient. by the time i got to the desk an hour had passed and i had a bit over an hour left to my flight. i figured this was tight but all the while manageable since i trusted bas system. the woman at the counter asked me where i was going and when i said montreal she looked at me and said you wont make it. i explained the situation how i had been in the airport for several hours already and that i was in line for 1 hour. she just told me i needed to go to the missed flight counter. i got to the counter and they informed me that i had to buy a new return ticket. my original return ticket cost me 800 my return cost me 1350.  i had no choice but to buy the ticket. i also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to gatwick airport the following morning. once i arrived back in montreal i called ba customer services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket and that i could get a refund if not for the new flight then for the 400 of the flight i missed. imagine my shock after spending an additional 1500 cad all in. when i escalated my complaint they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you and that was that.     tokyo to amsterdam via london. on the evening before departure i received an email from ba the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldnt be a delay. in the end the aircraft left tokyo haneda with a 90 minutes delay. baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with japanese politeness. if you have the choice to fly from nrt or hnd i would definitely choose hnd because its much more conveniently located to downtown tokyo. the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft adding more time to the delay we already had. i didnt like the seats on the 777. i found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. on the window and aisle seats theres also the ife box so theres no place for both feet. the meal was a joke and there was no choise. inflight entertainment is not up to date small screens with low brightness. the crew was not very friendly. when i went to the galley for a drink i was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. the second meal service was rushed. weve got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to lhr.  luckily ive made it to my connecting flight to amsterdam because i had a short connection. the a320 flight to amsterdam departed ahead of schedule. theres nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice. unfortunately ba decided to cut the the service on european flights in the race to the bottom.    paris to newark flight cancelled. this experience was one of the worst ive had. the engineers had no idea what was wrong with the engine all air and water shut off for three hours. not to mention the boeing 757 looked ancient for a 6 hour flight from paris i expected a little more. the flight attendants did not keep us updated. lastly after we got off the plane they had one  receptionist at the desk to deal with the 60 people who needed to rebook flights and get hotels for the night. will never fly british airways again. delta forever.    i flew ba from heraklion to gatwick. i bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. i paid around 150 for that in january. we got to the airport 2 hours before departure queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. i asked why. the ba rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. she then said we should have got there earlier. she wouldnt call ba customer service when i showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. i was told to email ba and ask them to refund me the seat cost. the flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. she apologised and said shed take our case up with ba customer service. i also sent in a complaint. today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. ill never fly with them again.    took a day trip to vienna with british airways booked at the last minute. flying out at 0720 on a sunday and having an early start to get to the airport i was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight. having never usually been a problem i boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers – only business. freezing temperature onboard the aircraft so managed to get limited sleep – another example of bas pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the nonexistence of customer service within the airline. despite it being one of the first flights out of heathrow with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into vienna – quite as to how is beyond me. ill be sticking to easyjet until british airways once again starts to value its passengers as currently they couldnt care less.    outbound from lhr to washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in economy all in all wasnt a bad experience modern looking cabin with excellent ife system food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to premium economy. return flight ba 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight but no worries could relax in the pe cabin boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed how old was the plane the cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadnt had the refurbishment treatment. leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the ife system that decided not to work mind you the screen was so small and scratched i doubt i would have been able to watch anything. cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with after a few words from the captain we departed. the evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok wine and g&t was acceptable about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should i say offered some sort of filled roll. i declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. i should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special for having spent an extra 400 for the upgrade. ba this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline never again.    glasgow to heathrow. ba are a disgrace it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high. my flight from islay was delayed by 2 hours no fault of mine so i missed my connecting flight after being fobbed off as not my fault nothing we can do i ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again i had to pay for another flight. money grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling   singapore to london. this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380. now this aircraft in qantas colours is one i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf. as mentioned in my review of ba16 which was the first leg of this trip it is the on board soft product that is the problem. the same comments for that review apply here. the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content. on qantas american cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies great music choices. those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning godfather gladiator braveheart roman holiday etc are all things we as passengers want to see. some smart edgy team in soho london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. ife is one thing on long haul. the other is food and beverage. the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly. on qantas say qf1 from singapore to london one gets the evening meal service followed by weiss ice cream a lindt chocolate along the way midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found chocolates banana bread cheese and biscuits. you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such. i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. put the smartest best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. one guy looked like steptoe for those who remember and was a miserable. flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. that is sad given the stature of ba. i came back on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply. hard product is fine except for no snack bar but the soft product is lacking severely.   sydney to london via singapore. it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than 9 hours. last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in 2002. the years have not been kind to ba. probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines. nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a380 occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines. the problem is not the hard product. a b777 or the a380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. the b777 from sydney to singapore was fine. nosier than the a380 but that is well known. very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home. it is the soft product that is lacking. check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security being a gold ff with qantas. boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore. now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. no menu given showing what was to be served as with cathay emirates and qantas. the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap. kfc offers a better grade of plastic. i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas. the food itself was very bland a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. its just the quality that is lacking. drinks i have a tradition something silly about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke. this is available on qantas but no sir we dont serve that. a note about the fas they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. final word about this leg is the ife. a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. one or two interesting things and some new releases. come on ba for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. as for music well im 53 but still like the pearl jams etc of the world. we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters. if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. it is a mix of ba going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that ba set many years ago.    flew barcelona to gatwick. this review is about the arrangement for check in rather than actual flight. ba allows you to check in online but not to print out a boarding card. there was no machine to print a card queue taking 75 minutes to get boarding card and several people were too late for check in. there were 4 desks 2 for priority 2 for general check in for all flights. only 1 desk served once they were about to close check in    munich to londonheathrow with british airways. while british airways is more or less in the same price range as lufthansa no complimentary food or drinks were served. crew was friendly. the departure was from terminal 1 in munich which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal 2. and arrival at terminal 5 in heathrow which is not as niceeasy as the new star alliance queens terminal 2. no wifi personal device entertainment or onboard monitors on my flight. seat reservation too expensive in my eyes. british airways has one big advantage though the generous hand luggage rules.    london to warsaw. ba european service is becoming like an expensive low cost airline. the price of seat selection still remains high. the seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2hour flight.  you can always feel the elbows of the passengers next to you whenever someone is moving. i didnt buy any food or drink onboard although i reckon its not badly priced. the inbound flight was on an older a320 in which the seat was reclining.     london to istanbul. due to poor weather conditions at lhr the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandable. when the passengers were informed of the gate everyone gathered at the a gate in t5. then no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own. next there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a c gate. everyone rushes to the one of the last of the c gates. once on board the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour. the flight finally takes off nearly three hours late. after a while the crew comes with the m&s gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and i had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner. the flight arrived in istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal.     london to hamburg. typically if i fly ba it is sfo or lax to lhr. this time i flew them from miami via tampa thru lhr to hamburg. using their avios points i secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because ba charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at 500 per direction. their miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to american as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the american premium class not lounge. all the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what i call a premium lounge. the ba gate in the dreadful e terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. people jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. boarding was like a cattle call. ba flies one of its oldest b747 into miami and it showed even in first. the seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. the service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of california. the flight was late leaving and late arriving and this miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what i did for my connection to hamburg. in the end i decided i was done with ba because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. their avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines. try using ba points on american or cathay or even alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try.    turin to london gatwick. rubbish checkin service as bad as ryanair. i show the staff my mobile boarding pass checked website that i have 2 x 32 kg bags checked allowance. one bag was over 23 kg 2728 they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me i will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in. they were so rude and unhelpful. boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner. flight was delayed without the checkedin agent saying anything after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather. at the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait.    when i checked in the evening before for the 7am flight it looked like only 40 of seats were occupied. 2 hrs before flight they cancelled it without rebooking or explanation. there is not a hotline to call.    bas reputation has been declining for years so i dont use them. for various reasons i had to for a flight for madrid. i had hand luggage. they texted asking for the hand luggage to be checked in as the flight was busy. i did and they lost it. 7 hours later no luggage or idea where it is. no compensation  only after 12 hours and for a small amount. ridiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good will. lagging significantly behind easyjet in all aspects.    los angeles to london heathrow. desperately poor service from british airways in club class. business class is utterly outdated with the weird facing eachother configuration and narrow  uncomfortable seats. the food served was appalling. the cabin crew were inattentive at best and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service. the problem with british airways now in first and business class is what they are completely lacking namely any class or manners whatsoever. poor food uncomfortable seats terrible  small movie screens no wifi and an overall budget airline experience. british airways even charge for seat selection too which adds insult to injury. avoid this horrible airline if you can. the only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful quiet airbus a380. a shame ba ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude.    london heathrow to mahon. booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults 2 children and 1 infant in lap almost 1k for all of us. prebooked seats at the same time. i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying about your flight to madrid on the 26th may when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca. airline assured me everything was fine. further concern when selfservice checkin opened 24 hours out wife and daughters checked in fine me and my son were referred to airport checkin despite all being on the same booking. an urgent call to ba i was told 1 i was probably being moved to a bassinet position. when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2 infants cant check in online which i now understand is also incorrect. my concern was well placed. at ba t5 bag drop check in agent looked flustered a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our prebooked seats were gone my son and i had no seats at all and were standby and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin 16 rows apart. ‘prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know after kicking up a huge fuss i believe they cant legally sit children below a certain age away from parents the checkin manager offered me no explanation other than full flights but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the checkin supervisor who cant have been more than 22 in tears. when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son again many rows apart from the rest of my family. as this was my sons first ever flight i was absolutely livid that we couldnt sit anywhere near each other. added to that my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding kids needing toilet etc. i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son i get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff i even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that were going to have to get off here and my children in tears. much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found there were quite a few on the flight apparently and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight what seat. raised a formal complaint and was told that they understand my frustration which is nice. separate complaint raised to caa about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat. conclusion is families avoid at all costs.    los angeles to london. i booked with aa lax to lhr round trip very far in advance. ba is aa partner. paid for the ba seat selection early to get good seats. ba canceled the flights coming and going ba did not inform aa or me that the flights were canceled. all of my text and phone number was entered with ba with my passport number. they should have contacted me. i found out a couple days before my flight because i happened to call to do a meal request. it turns out that ba shifted to smaller planes and i actually spent six hours over two days trying to get flights on the days i needed to catch up with a tour. all they said is we cant help you. i kept calling and calling and got seats on the days i needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed premium economy was awful. food was terrible. we had pre paid 276 to choose seats. there were no good seats left. we ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. which meant the smell people are bumping into you the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. same seats coming home. i would have been better off flying in coach. i have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. i tried to get this before my return flight started because i was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.they wouldnt refund. after returning i made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. called again today was disconnected twice and told there is nothing i could do. it is possible i may get a response in a month regarding my email request. dont ever fly with them they used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. if you have a problem you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. they have an endless loop of calling waiting on line their agents cant or wont do anything but sell seats. i spoke to many many supervisors no results. there is no one to solve problems. they pass the buck have you fill out forms online and no one responds.    the overall flight wasnt too bad. seats and everything was comfy enough although my girlfriends television didnt work for either the outbound or inbound flight and little effort was made for a resolution. i understand that it isnt the flight attendants fault  but it would have been nice if a little more effort than theres nothing we can do was given to the issue on the flight from gatwick to tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 3040 minutes as the bridge wasnt where it should be which once again wasnt the worst problem in the world but after a long flight isnt particularly what you wanted it wasnt the best experience.    \\r\\r\\nbas galleries lounge at cpt is adequate but let down by a poor food selection including packaged cheese and biscuits with flimsy wooden knives and limited wine choices. champagne was conspicuously lacking. toilet paper wasnt being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. there were no information screens so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. boarding itself was efficient with priority for groups 1 and 2. seats 62jk on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job and at least theres plenty of storage space in the window bins. take off was on schedule. fas went through the motions with little enthusiasm. the food was the worst weve ever experienced in club world. the smoked chicken salad was atrocious and the scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. the white company bedding was a letdown and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. theres little one can do to remedy a hard seat. landing was ahead of schedule. overall a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a subpar business class product. british airways are falling ever behind their competitors.    gatwick to san jose. ive just stepped onto a ba flight from gatwick to costa rica an 11.5 hr flight and can honestly i havent seen a screen with so few pixels since the 90s. i  fly other long haul flights and none of bas competitors are providing such low quality entertainment.  i used to think of british airways as being a premium airline  now theyre just rubbish.    linate to london. the morning of the departure i received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled with no specified reason. as an alternative they rerouted me on a night flight to madrid then to palma to arrive the next day in birmingham. disappointed of the disservice i called the customer service in england and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator and i was offered a flight in the evening at 1900 which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined. i had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to london in time unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune. on top of it since the flight would arrive no longer at heathrow but at stansted i had to pay the taxi 70 more than the agreed amount if i arrived at heathrow. british airways did not take responsibility i was not reimbursed the new flight i had to book last minute nor the taxi difference. they did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused. the worst has been the answer of their customer care saying it was not their responsibility    geneva to vancouver via london. worst experience. terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism they offered 25 voucher and no apology  an insult as did not ask for compensation. its an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline. on a positive point the geneva to london flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to vancouver were abysmal.   flew british airways from jk to london heathrow then connected london galwick to rome. bag has been lost for 48 hours. no email phone call text update. they didnt even answer my email my wife and i have had the same clothes on our backs since we left jfk. thank goodness for washing machines. we have missed out on events. we cant get into certain places due to dress codes. we had to wait for a store to open to buy toothbrushes and toothpaste. horrible horrible service. then we were told our bag would arrive at our hotel at 4.30 pm yesterday. its almost 1 pm the next day and the bag still isnt here    i have flown british airways numerous times over many years. sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. the staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left  too little had apparently been loaded. there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. we asked for the fish. after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice  no apology. eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. we were not given anything. the service was really poor  and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines. ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers.    our original flight was cancelled as my wife and i were just disembarking from a cruise ship. we were then advised shortly after by sms that we had been automatically rebooked on a flight the next day to london heathrow. this was not a lot of good when our car was parked at gatwick. i managed to get through to ba and was given a new booking to gatwick also the following day. we were offered no other assistance by the airline. the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. having eventually boarded the aircraft we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at barcelona airport. shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours so we would be given water. this was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice so no water was served. the real horror of this flight however was british airways new food service whereby passengers buy food and pay by cardavios. this simply does not work. after one hour in the air the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. about 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps potato chips. he returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can which we duly shared between us. having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours this was the only refreshment we could obtain. i consider this to be completely unacceptable. if this is the level of service we can now expect from british airways there is no point traveling with them. the budget airlines can do better at lower cost.    hong kong to london. this was my first business class trip on ba as i mostly use emirates or cathay pacific. in comparison ba offers a very low standard. the flight attendant who served the section where i was seated couldnt have cared less. no greetings when passengers boarded the plane no offer of help. he asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink. no second drink was offered. the toilet hadnt been cleaned properly before boarding and during the flight one of the two washrooms became unusable resulting in long queues. the seating arrangement  having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction is uncomfortable. overall appalling quality and little value for money.    very disappointing experience  flew out on a 747 400 series should be scrapped departed late. loaded aircraft ready for push back no ac temperature was excessively hot all flight no cool air. personal media system broken split screen. food quality diabolical. moody flight attendants ran out of hand soap. return flight on a380 left on time 100 better service meal quality and crew definitely made up for outward flight. been flying ba for over 25 years probably would be a last choice in future  sad to see.    calgary to london. cabin full. overhead locker full of blankets. seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently. take off about 1945 local time. evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time. menu listed seasonal salad leaf one small piece of lettuce and cucumber braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta with butter pecan cake. only 3 beef meals available. choice was either pasta or to go hungry. i chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice. breakfast a light refreshment including juice tea and coffee consisted of a cream cheese roll and oat biscuit and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later. we paid extra for world traveller plus but i consider that we were conned. customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing i received the following response thanks for coming back to us. i completely understand why youre disappointed we couldnt offer you our full catering service especially as on such a long haul flight. i hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering. this meant they couldnt provide a full meal service and i absolutely agree this isnt what you would expect when you travel with us. im sorry weve let you down. that is it. thank you ba. this is the last time we will ever book long haul with you.    london to zurich. the airline isnt bad. their boarding procedure was very good though the aircraft was very old. i know it is one of the oldest and personally i enjoyed it. but if i have to be realistic its very old loud and uncomfortable. the service isnt good either you dont even get a cup of water. its great to hop to london but dont expect any kind of special treatment or service.    glasgow to new york jfk via london. outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747. still i could see its age. we had a duo seat at the back of the plane. the plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head. the ife was decent and had a good selection. the cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us. flight left close to on time. service was quick as we were first served at the back. we were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later which was vegetarian pasta for me. adequate amount of food served and was tasty. ice cream and juicewater was served halfway through the flight. we then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone. it was ok. return flight from vegas was on a old 747. horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty. service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. less drinks served again food was ok chicken curry this time. small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. ife was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice. i wouldnt fly ba again if i had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats. 210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive. also the planes they use are too old and tatty.    earlier this year my wife and i travelled business class with ba from dublin to joburg returning from cape town thru london in each direction. having paid business class fares we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. had we not selected seats we could have found ourselves not just separated but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the a380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. we therefore had no choice. what sort of customer retention policy is this no other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection but ba just dont seem to care. it is a ripoff. the forwardrear facing business class seat plan on ba planes is really unattractive complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. ba should take a look at the emirates a380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. this was our first business class experience with ba. having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly we have discovered how much behind the play ba actually are.    had four flights in total with this airline first flight from dublin to london on 29th june 2018 was delayed by 2 hours. this delay would have meant we missed our connection in heathrow to miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs no reason or apologies. we arrived in miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning. by the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab. our flights home to dublin via heathrow were fine until we reached dublin and realised they had lost our bag. despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day it was put on the wrong plane  again no apologies given for this inconvenience. we are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out. seems like no one cares. this was our first and last experience of using ba.  as part of your luggage allowance but i was charged 65 to bring my bike back. the check in staff were very forceful and abrupt. as i had to bring the bike back i had no choice but to pay. when i got back i contacted their customer service they are not willing to help.  also the seats are getting really uncomfortable. the food is terrible.     the queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 mins. a more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the bag drop. excuses as i saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. they could have just got more staff there to begin with. group boarding was super slow. inside the econ cabin the plane seemed very old and wornout. the entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didnt inform the customers about it. some of the flight attendants were unprofessional. meals were bad for me the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good. they gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight. the wifi doesnt exist in the cabin.    british airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class. no coordination at airport and apparently not one ba manager at rome airport who i could speak to. had to call ba customer service in uk which was a waste of time. given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. advised stewardess but they did not care. could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat. waste of time paying to go business class with ba.  they did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way.    mumbai to london heathrow. disappointing experience. i wouldnt book business class again felt like bad value for money. ive flown economy and premium economy before found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. i expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food better seat and a larger entertainment screen i really didnt see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. the staff werent that attentive so i felt like i got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. i had one person ask if i needed anything who then brought me the tea i requested. the staff were helpful when i saw them but overall what a waste of money. i paid an extra 500 for better food on a tray with cutlery. really not worth it   when you travel british airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with british airways staff. right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. she spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late. because i need special assistance they didnt have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it. my wife now very stressed and i arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there i asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. my wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. the guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. the cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787s i have been on have 6. that means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. of course the 787 is a great aircraft. so for me the seat was below my expectation. i was also amazed that i had to pay 190 to reserve seats i dont pay anything with other airlines. the food was just ok nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice. in my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who dont have snobs working for them.    ba first class is not even that any more. starting with the lounge in t3 this may be an offshoot of the fine concorde room in t5 but it need not feel like a rural train station. poor food average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with lh facilities in fra or muc. there is no ground assistance and boarding was haphazard. fine cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. the seat was ok but not in the same class as the new ac j class pods and not close to the emirates suites. small things like the menu presentation boarding sufficient food there are a lot of seats in f seat comfort ok but nothing special and the toilets small and curiously offering singleply paper. the crew were very friendly the service was decent in delivery but poor overall. ba your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you and your first class product is not worth the name anymore. one can only assume that ba are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product. and no wifi   flew london heathrow to hong kong with british airways. flew premium economy and the experience was anything but. check yourself in create and scan your own baggage labels and load them onto the conveyors yourself. unsurprisingly slow process and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in line. hardly a ba service attendant in sight. better service with ryanair i hate to say it.   flew to istanbul with british airways on 5th june. at the passportvisa check desk presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady  my wife was holding the passports. the lady looked at the boarding passes and barked passports as if she did not see my wife holding them. second bark do you have a visa. third bark show me. fourth bark next. no smile no hello or good morning. hardly any eye contact either. if anything the situation was worse at boarding. ba recently introduced a boardingbygroupnumber system. all such systems need to be policed but there are ways of policing the arrangements. some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. when caught by the gate keeper they were told not yet. some attempted to board prematurely more than once. on the second attempt the staff told them to wait. accepting that the system must be monitored ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with potentially anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands english.   london heathrow to manchester. it was outrageous of british airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when i checked in at lhr on the 0507. i bought paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date. how dare ba do this to me when i was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work different airlines until i encountered ba at heathrow. checkin and help desk are arrogant rude and are as miserable as hell. not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a 5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat. we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from ba. british airways is a disgrace of an airline because they have a monopoly on the heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service well they are wrong like others i have found an alternative airline. i close my review and say i will never ever use british airways again. i would rather walk to manchester.    london to madrid. lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and i not sitting together.  i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i dont want any particular seat. we are travelling as a pair. there are three seats each side of the aisle. there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they dont know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit. ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you dont wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this.     luggage broken into – no explanation. first the good point. cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on ba169 london to shanghai on 22 june. not so good. the bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement. the trust breaker. upon arrival in shanghai i was not the only one from ba169 reporting missing luggage. mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use. nothing was missing so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage people deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state. ba have not provided any explanation despite queries to customer relations this is not acceptable. corporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff.    london to tehran back in august 2017. the cabin looked so old and tired i struggle to understand why ba has not updated yet on a lot of their b777 aircraft. the inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the 90s but the selection of movies was alright. the meal service commenced 2 and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this point. the option i wanted ran out by the time they got to me and i wasnt even sitting in the last rows of the economy section.  the seats were very uncomfortable. a couple hours later there was another drinks service.     pisa to london heathrow. having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the ba website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft. our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row 22 of an a321 aircraft is standard seat pitch. why didnt ba notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight once wed boarded we found that there was one extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg room. the ba cabin crew did move my husband but said this happens all the time with row 22 it might be an exit row but its not extra leg room.    i recently took a first class flight from london heathrow to las vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded. the plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes late. when we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around. the service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated. the return flight was a disaster. the seats were dirty food was like rubber plane was dated seats smelt lauren perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great. when i complained i was offered 8000 avios are you serious ba i think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that i experienced on british airways. unless a first class ticket on british airways is on sale i would suggest you fly with another airline. british airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty  its about time they  had a deep clean and remodel the first class its getting so old its like club class with a few tweaks.    gatwick to barcelona . check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff. staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight. however the in flight product has deteriorated  salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers  had to have sandwich. seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class. no priority boarding for business passengers. really disorganized at boarding  calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed up. on arrival no bags and trying to get update but no update. trying to get update on baggage after 12 hours but no update.     jeddah to chicago via london. the flight from jeddah to heathrow wasnt as good as i expected ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude. also the new baggage restriction for the flights to the uk made the trip uncomfortable i had to check my carryon bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the power bank were there they took my laptop when i dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers. however the crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too. the flight from lhr to chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous.  i wont fly with ba again until they change their baggage restrictions for the saudi flights.    london to frankfurt. i need to fly ba for business frequently as i dont have other choices. not only planes are delayed as today but the lounges in heathrow are a joke. i dont use them anymore as they are overcrowded and they dont serve proper food just snacks. their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests. their business class in europe is economy class with a free seat next to you.'"
