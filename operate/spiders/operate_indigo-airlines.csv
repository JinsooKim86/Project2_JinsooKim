nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,nan,2.0,nan,no,Delhi to Coimbatore,1.0," |  Delhi to Coimbatore. I have flown with Indigo loads of times and have regularly recommended it to many. I have never had a bad experience in all of my trips and was really happy until my recent trip. I had booked my seats under student discount which allowed an additional baggage of 10kgs free of charge. During my through leg from DEL to CJB, this promotion was honored and I paid for whatever excess I had, (excluding the 15kg+10kg allowance). But they would not agree that I had this promotion during my return leg and would not agree or believe me that I availed this in my first leg. I was astounded when the rep said there was nothing in the notes regarding the promotion. How can it be possible that you allow different baggage allocations for different legs. I ended up paying for the excess baggage which I had packed in anticipation of availing the 10 kg student discount. It was never about the money for me, but Indigo let me down in not acknowledging my promotion status. ",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Delhi to Vadodara,5.0," |  I was travelling from Delhi to Vadodara in July 2018 through Indigo. Unfortunately, our flight from San Francisco to Delhi (Via Shanghai) got delayed and we missed the 5:10 am flight from Delhi to Vadodara. The Indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful. They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering! We could not have done it without this staff. We now realized why Indigo is such a great airline. it is because of the great employees.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance.

Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment.

Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge.

So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs.

It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger.

I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals.

I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor).

However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system!

After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,nan,2.0,nan

The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,nan,4.0,nan

You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty.

The Indigo staff at the Mumbai airport were very helpful in arranging to board the aircraft at the last moment. She was travelling alone and had no knowledge of Hindi.

Smooth boarding from Bangkok. Impeccable onboard service und attitude. Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30. Nothing happening; line not moving; IndiGo staff still looking as if he was in a daze. No repeat announcement, in an audible voice, re rows 16-30.

On two occasions I ordered a sandwich (about 250 rupees) which was quiet tasty to my surprise.

Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again?

This level of service and concern is exemplary and way beyond call of duty - kudos  for her generosity and to IndiGo for nurturing employees like her - way to go!",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,5.0,February 2018,nan,5.0,nan,yes,Chennai to Bangalore,5.0," |  Chennai to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Bangalore in February. Very pleased with this airline, clean aircraft, on time service, no luggage issues. I booked this trip from the US and everything worked out without any issues. Excellent value for money and way better than full service airlines I have flown within India.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,5.0,February 2018,nan,5.0,nan,yes,Kolkata to Bangkok,3.0," | My umpteenth flight with IndiGo in the past four years, almost always Bangkok-Pune-Bangkok via Calcutta. As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks. On the downside, no Foreigner Arrival Cards on board the flight from BKK to Cal and no Thai immigration forms on the flight from Cal to BKK.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,5.0,February 2018,3.0,5.0,1.0,yes,Dubai to Singapore via Chennai,4.0," |  Dubai to Singapore via Chennai. New aircraft, very professional cabin crew. They assist me at the check in to put my luggage to Singapore via Chennai. Transit in Chennai was very smooth despite the procedures of Indian police - checking three times our passports but all went ok. On time flights. I will fly with them on this route if needed.

A320-200,Economy Class,5.0,January 2018,3.0,5.0,nan,yes,Kolkata to New Delhi,2.0," | Flew IndiGo from Kolkata to New Delhi. The check-in process was smooth and the baggage handling went well. I later found out as I had a ""Lite"" ticket, which was cheaper, I had to pay extra for my checked baggage. I did that. A bus took us to our aircraft. The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle. The plane's air-conditioning had troubles, so it was a bit hot. At last, the plane landed on New Delhi after 2hr 5min. Experience could have been a little better even if it was economy-class.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

A320,Economy Class,4.0,February 2018,5.0,4.0,nan,yes,Chennai to Madurai,4.0," | Flew IndiGo from Chennai to Madurai. The flight was a pretty short one, one hour. During that time, these are the things that I felt about the airline. 1) Check In: The Lines were long, the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights IndiGo operates. My advice, arrive early. 2) Aircraft: Neat. Clean aircraft. No problems. 3) Crew service: Pretty good. Up to standards. 4) Ground Support: I didn't face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too. 5) On Board Meal: it's not complementary. You have to buy it. Tasted good for the money. 6) Punctuality: On-time. No issues there. 7) Communications: Book online. You would get all the information via SMS, even the boarding gate information.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,January 2018,4.0,1.0,nan,yes,Chennai to Raipur via Hyderabad,1.0," |  Chennai to Raipur via Hyderabad. Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,December 2017,nan,4.0,nan,no,Bangalore to Mumbai,nan, |  Bangalore to Mumbai. My flight 6E 464 was scheduled for departure at 9:20am on 30 December and is finally boarding at 3:45 pm. In between this many flights for Mumbai has flown and Indigo crew remained clueless about this particular flight and spoke rude to passengers who we're enquiring. After the delay till 2:40pm the airline stopped sending any information to passengers via SMS or call.  At some point we were thinking as if we were waiting for some imaginary flight!  The refreshments were announced only at 12:30pm when most passengers had arranged their meals.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
