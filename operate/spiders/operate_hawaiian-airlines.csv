Honolulu to Maui. This was the worst experience ever. I will never fly with Hawaiian Airlines again and I think no one else should either. First off the employees are very rude. I was asking one AO some questions and he told me to go ask ""questions at another gate"". I was on standby all day until the last flight out and for the most part no one said anything throughout the process besides how many other people were on standby. One employee was so loud when speaking to the customers, almost as if she hated dealing with customer's but that's her job. My husband and I are employees of another airline we paid for our tickets but was told by the male employee who previously told me to go away that we were on the bottom of the list because we are employees of another airline and booked through our flight benefits. We were later told by really nice AO's something different. In the past I flew with many airlines and overall this is the worst experience Hawaiian Airlines did not even offer food vouchers to their customers. To whom every is thinking of flying with this company I suggest you think long and hard.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

A wonderful experience on all sectors, the cabin staff were outstanding, and the flight deck were very informative on the conditions expected throughout the flight. Hawaiian music and videos welcomed us onboard, and set the mood for a very enjoyable flight. I usually travel Air New Zealand out of Los Angeles or San Francisco but decided to try Hawaiian as they fly out of Las Vegas. I am so glad I did and would like to thank all of the crew, both cabin and flight deck for a job well done! The only complaint is with Honolulu airport. It is certainly overdue for a complete overhaul.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Honolulu to Phoenix,1.0," | I was beyond disappointed with Hawaiian Airlines. From the horrible customer service, rude flight attendants, planes that are so outdated and falling apart that nothing works on them. The terrible fees they charge. I left a carry on bag and when I tried to get a flight attendant from our flight to help me out with it I was met with a rude attitude and told I would just have to call the next day because she needed to meet her friend who was picking her up. When I asked if there was someone else she said there was no managers or staff or anyone in the entire airport that could help, I find that hard to believe considering the fact that our baggage hadn't even made it to baggage claim when I notified her that I left somthing behind. She made no effort to try to help at all and was clearly bothered by me even asking. The flight attendants on the plane weren't any friendlier either. When boarding the plane I was told my carry on wouldn't fit because this was a really old plane and the bins are small and hopefully my bags would make it cause that's reassuring. For the amount of money I spent to fly 7 people I would expect a lot more. I am doubtful I will get any help tomorrow regarding my carry on left behind. I have flown with many other airlines and never had such a poor experience.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Their customer affairs department that handles issues is only accessible via on-line submission form, and they're just going to send you the same response, no matter whether it resolves your problem or not. If you call - they will tell you there is no way to talk to consumer affairs department, and just keep sending them messages.  We boarded a plane and were sitting on the plane for 1.5 hrs with no idea of why we are not taking off. Nobody was able to give us any information on what kind of “issues” are those. We had to get off the plane and only after numerous inquiries and concerns raised one of the staff told us it was an issue with pilot’s communication system. 2 hours later from the original departure time, we boarded the plane again, and took off. The plane was freezing cold and I was told I have to purchase blankets if we’re cold, and they can’t change the temperature. Other people were freezing too, and there was nothing done about it. Additionally, there were electrical issues and our monitors weren’t working for a long time. They said we will all get unlimited entertainment package for our inconvenience, but it never happened. 20 min into the flight one of the passengers had medical issue. Within minutes this man collapsed in front of our eyes and they started performing CPR on him, alternating with oxygen mask. After the plane started flying back we got an announcement that it was turned around. Back at Honolulu we were waiting for at least another hour for all of the medical procedures, and police investigation, before we could get off the plane to switch the planes. By the gate we were told to wait in line for food vouchers and new seat assignments.  It was chaos to say the least as all of us were trying to get food at only one restaurant that was opened by the gate. There was not enough fast food left after first batch of people went through it, and ordering food was impossible as they said they won’t be able to make enough for everyone in time. It was past 9pm at this point, and we have been traveling since 10am. We boarded a new plane which was an older plane and it was freezing again! And we were sitting on a plane for an hour with no announcements or letting us know what’s going on. Later they were waiting on a second pilot. Why were we rushed to get on the plane with no time to eat, if the pilot was not even there? Entertainment systems were still locked, and we got offered no comfort, drinks or anything after everything we have been thru. Back home, their luggage process got screwed up with mixing bags from different flights, and nobody from the staff knew what's going on. After all of that, we only got offered $50 refund! Absolutely ridiculous! And there is no way to talk to someone, and all we get is that consumer affairs approved $50 and good luck with that. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

When I contacted Hawaiian Airlines to change my flight they wanted $400 to do so. I was blown away by the clerks attitude we were working with, so insensitive and would not cooperate in any way. It was cheaper for me to purchase a return flight than to change my existing flight. My wife thought that she would appreciate my empty seat, she would be more comfortable on the return flight with the kids. She checked in my seat for which I could not get a refund or any consideration. A smelly beach bum tried sit in my seat. My wife told him that it was not his because we paid for it! The stewardess told my wife it was his seat because they resold my seat to him. WOW! Talk about double dipping into our pockets. I am so upset at how Hawaiian Airlines has treated my family and great lack of customer service or consideration. I can never use them again and I would not recommend them. By the way they charge for just about everything. The dinners that we had going out and coming back were horrible. A terrible value in general and poor customer service. ",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

The change moved not only the time from several hours to about 1.5 hours, but also we had to stop in HNL and change planes. I called Hawaiian Airlines customer service about what to do and got 'maybe this, maybe that', in other words, no help.

When booking my families tickets I decided to pay extra to fly Hawaiian because I had heard positive reviews of the airline before but I was surprisingly disappointed. On both flights I was excited about getting a window seat but on both flights the window seat did not have a window but rather just a wall to look at. The in-flight entertainment app did not work and the flight attendants skipped past both me and my brother when handing out food. During the flight I saw that all the bathrooms near me were occupied and saw a bathroom sign that said it was unoccupied towards the front. After walking to the front bathroom a flight attendant blocked me with their arms and told me (quite rudely) that I was not allowed back there.

The great experience with Hawaiian Air resumed on my return flight on a 767 to Brisbane.

To my surprise no one was there at the check in counter. I explained that I had a flight to Hawaii that leaves in 40 minutes and I asked to speak with a manager or supervisor to assist me. The only response they gave me was to go to the information booth which was downstairs and turned their backs on me and said “There is nothing they could do!”I went downstairs dragging my heavy luggage to ask for help at the information desk was told to call Hawaiian Airlines. I went back upstairs and there was a representative there. I explained my situation stating there was no one to check me in. I was told: There is nothing that he could do and the next flight is tomorrow! I was stranded and had nowhere to turn to at the time. I was offered no assistance at LAX airport. I ended up paying for the ticket having to change my return ticket because of their policies. Then they informed me about a reduction fee policy after I already paid an extra $200!

As a Platinum member I have vouchers for a complimentary upgrade to first class on flights from the mainland to Oahu. I am now on my 3rd year of travel to Hawaii and I have not been upgraded once. The process requires that you wait until 72 hours before the flight before they will consider an upgrade but most of the time First Class is sold out by that time. Even if it isn't sold out they will not allow any upgrades until the last minute in hopes of generating more revenue. The fact that they offer First Class to their Elite customers then put processes in place that makes it impossible to use it says that they really don't have anyone with any customer elations skills working at the corporate office.

The price was right and the A330 aircraft configuration of 2-4-2 was handy for couples and family groups alike. Seats were rather hard on the behind after a few hours and getting up to move the limbs is hard if crew are working the aisles with snacks & meals though these weren't too common. It is all pretty no frills stuff though on the international sectors all the in flight entertainment is free but premium content is paid for on domestic sectors. The meals were adequate on international but really a token effort on domestic although Hawaiian claims they are the sole US airline to feed you on domestic sectors anyway. SYD-HNL is overnight so it is best to just try to sleep or doze the night away after they feed you an hour or so out of SYD. a 3 hour layover and HNL-PDX is a daytime flight that arrives just after dark in the last bit of the trip. PDX-HNL is daytime but is a bearable 5.5 hours or so. My most negative comments are about the HNL-SYD sectors flown almost entirely in daytime again staff feed you an hour or two out and do a few rounds of drinks but then want everyone to close the blinds and basically sleep/doze/not bother them for the next 7 hours or so. Overall we got to PDX for a month at a super low fare and knew what to expect having read a number of reviews here so had reasonably low expectations for all the additional things airlines can add to make trips bearable.

It is not the best lounge I have spent time in but having said that there was good selection of food and drink. Boarding was effortless and again done with priority. The plane was old and it showed in the console and to a lesser extent the seats. The seats were comfortable plenty of leg room the seat recline was not sufficient enough for a comfortable nights sleep. The leg and foot rest mechanism in my seat was faulty. The staff were wonderful and very attentive both food and drink were plentiful and a good variety to choose from. The entertainment selection was good but a few more recent release movies would have been nice. I had a window seat once the seat in front of me reclined I literally had to climb over the console to be able to go to the toilet. The USB charge facility did not work so don't rely on that. All the above pertains to the trip home as well with the Exception of the Hawaiian Airline Lounge at Honolulu Airport. If your idea of a business class lounge is a cup of coffee or a soft drink then you will be happy. Not only did they not provide anything other than a packet of nuts they do not allow you to take any food or drinks in.

What was a highly rated menu scripted by the GM of the Hali'maile General Store in Maui (great restaurant) is now normal coach nasty airline faire. The speed of the decline is epic. The 'ghetto birds' (767) still flying the non stop route from SJ to OGG are an insult to us Nor Cal folks. Why are the new planes not in place yet? The planes are old tattered and the seating in First Class is more like a glorified coach. Our last trip in January had us on the runway at OGG for 12 hours! Delay after delay we even had a crew switch as laws had them time out. Rude flight attendants were rampant on this trip as well (something we'd never seen on HA prior).

The leg room was huge, improving comfort and thus the ability to get some sleep. Return HNL-AKL afternoon flight was in standard Economy seat 18A and whilst a little tight when the person in front reclined, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable. On-demand movies / TV series / games were free and it was fun to watch some Hawaii-centric shows. The touch screen was not very responsive and there was no alternative controls resulting in a lot of unnecessary ""poking"". Upon embarkation, FA's handed out amenity kits comprising eye masks, headphones, earplugs and in Extra Comfort seats additional items were included in a cute little pouch. Food and drink service was prompt after takeoff and I think relevant to the time of travel. A snack pack was offered at midnight with a breakfast before arrival then on the return a hot chicken/rice dish at late PM takeoff with a sandwich as a late supper. Much better than a curry at 3am as I have experienced on some airlines. Service friendliness and professionalism was mixed depending on which crew member attended you (as always) and the return was much better but overall more than adequate. Water was offered frequently throughout the flight. My only negative would be the temperature of the cabin - it was freezing cold! The FA's were even wearing cardigans. And the complimentary blanket smelled like it had been in a smokers zone - it was disgusting. Fortunately I had packed my own. Overall I was very impressed with the flights.

In the end we used Priority Pass to use the Air Canada Maple Leaf lounge which was great. Boarding was orderly and quick. The first class cabin is quite small and seems to take up about half of the space between the first and second set of cabin doors. The first class seat was comfortable but basic, reasonable width and legroom but not lie flat and for a tall guy it was not easy to get into a comfortable lying position. So although on a modern aircraft the seat felt straight out of the 80s again. The IFE was excellent, good choice and on demand with a decent size screen. What stood out about this flight was the cabin crew. We had a Los Angeles based crew with two crew working in the first class cabin.

Cabin crew were good and they were in the dark as we were. However, instead of selling snacks, they could have offered them as a gesture of goodwill. We were then asked to leave the aircraft. Bad enough if you are able bodied, worse if you are disabled. A nice ground crew guy returned my wheelchair to me and we slowly made our way back to the gate.

To sit together will incur a further charge of $120. The plane is full we were told, we can't move you. Seriously - has it been full for 6 months? It wasn't full at all - there were plenty of people lying down over 3 seats. After a lot of argument we finally get seats together. Upon arrival in Honolulu, we're held up at the gate for 35 minutes because they can't get the airbridge to work. Very uncomfortable. In customs, the computers are down so we wait in a queue for 2 hours to get through. The Customs Usher told us to go to a newly opened desk, only to have the Customs Officer scream at us to get back in line and only approach his desk when he had given us permission to do so. He kept on yelling and yelling at us, over the sign on his desk which says Welcome to Hawaii. I know this is not Hawaiian Airlines fault but by this stage our impression of Hawaii is sinking by the minute. Whilst on holiday, we receive the distressing news that my mother has died, so we need to cut our holiday short and fly back. We are charged $400 extra to change our flights to a week earlier - once again on a flight which was not full. So we don't understand why we had to pay extra. We arrive at the Hawaiian Airlines desk to find that once again we are seated far apart, even though we are travelling together as husband and wife. The seriously rude women on the counter at the gate asked us why we wanted to sit together and advised us there would be a charge for changing the tickets. At this time I am very distressed and my normally placid husband starts to lose it. The way she spoke to us was beyond belief and extremely distressing. After a lot of argument we finally got to sit together (the plane was not full), but I think she took revenge because my suitcase was sent to Sydney, not Brisbane. More stress, trying to recover that. thankfully Qantas took over and found it and delivered it with amazing efficiency. Most of the cabin crew were very nice - so that was something. Although on the return trip one officious steward told me to remove my headset every time the fasten seat belt sign came on, in case I needed to get out of my seat quickly. In all my years of flying I have never been told that. And he told me every single time there was turbulence. None of the other stewards told passengers that, I think he was just on a little power trip. With the appalling way we have been treated by Hawaiian airlines and Hawaii customs we will never ever return.

We had high hopes for this flight, having never flown Hawaiian Air before. We started out on a good note with their signature drink - Pukana La, which is champagne, pineapple juice and grenadine. Our flight was 8 hours, departing just past midnight, and I envisioned the typical amenities we're accustomed to on overnight flights. To our great surprise upon boarding, there were no lie-flat beds or personal seating compartments. The narrow seats didn't even have electronic controls. We had to manually adjust the recline (minimal) and the foot rest (pathetic), which didn't elevate. The seats were something out of the dark ages. Sleep was painful, almost impossible. Attendants handed out cheap headphones that hurt my ears, while other airlines are providing Bose now. The inflight entertainment is littered with ads that you must watch each time you choose another movie or TV show. It's not enough they're charging a fortune to fly, but now you have to watch ads too. They shut off in-flight entertainment half an hour before landing, ridiculous.  Some allow video to continue right through landing. Hawaiian Air switches you to a 30-minute music video promoting Hawaiian musicians (entitled HISessions), after they take away your earphones. Whose ingenius idea was that? We were absolutely freezing the entire trip. It didn't help that the blanket provided was wimpy. I kept a coat on during the entire flight. The attendants were all turning blue. The overnight kit was cheap - cheap earplugs that didn't stay in, cheap eye mask that didn't keep light out, cheap thin socks (which I had to wear over my own socks to avert frozen feet). The food was horrific. Salmon omelet? Good grief, who eats fish in an omelet? And fishy tasting salmon, no less. Greasy, cold chicken sausage and rubbery potatoes for sides. Ugh.

The plane left 3 hours late as the engine was broken and they were fixing it. I had a 1 hour layover in Honolulu and therefore would miss my connection to Kona. I spoke to the Hawaiian Airlines agent at the gate and told him I would book a later flight with my smartphone. He told me not to do that as Hawaiian was going to book new flights for all passengers with a connecting flight and my doing it myself would mess everything up. When we arrived at Honolulu, the plane pulled off the runway and stopped. The crew said we would have to be towed into the terminal. The crew then told all passengers that we should get off at gate 52 and there would be a shuttle waiting to take the passengers with connections to the interisland terminal. We were then to go to gate 56 where Hawaiian Airlines personnel would be waiting to take care of our connecting flights. There was no shuttle waiting. A shuttle going the other direction stopped and the driver asked what we were doing. We told him and he said no shuttle was scheduled to meet us but that he would turn around and take us to the Interisland terminal. When we got to the interisland terminal and went to gate 56 there were no Hawaiian Airlines personnel anywhere. After waiting a while, one of the other passengers said she was going to go look for help. We got new tickets and finally got to Kona. Passenger service is worse than non-existent. We go to Hawaii every year and this is the 4th time Hawaiian has messed us about, the 5th time was when we came back from this trip. We're done with Hawaiian permanently. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

The cabin crew was somewhat friendly, seats were comfortable and the entertainment was good (AVOD with dozens of movies). The major let down was the food. The main meal on the HNL-SYD flight, served shortly after take-off and the only option (no choices), consisted of some overly sweet chicken dish and was barely edible. At the end of the flight to SYD we were served 2 sandwiches which tasted ok, certainly better than the first meal. On the overnight return segment BNE-HNL we only got a pack of mystery meat sandwiches which were truly disgusting plus some ok single-choice breakfast before landing. Additional snacks were available on the flights but had to be purchased. Hawaiian Airlines could be a great airline if they just got the food right.

We booked a centre row (4 abreast) and a window row (2 abreast) at a fare that was significantly less than that of the competition's premium economy fares. The aircraft on the outbound sector was a 3 year-old A330-200 that was clean and in good condition, and the inbound sector was a 4.5 year-old A330-200 that was in equally good condition. Each seat has its own IFE monitor with a decent array of programmes. The food is actually not bad, and excellent by airline food standards. The service was also outstanding - Hawaiian and Virgin America have by far the friendliest and most efficient cabin service, not at all like that of the unionised drones that work Delta, American and United.

Last year we traveled extensively around the world in Business Class with Korean Air and Qantas. Flat beds were the norm, with amazing service, plentiful quality meals and hot snacks, a wide variety of wines and a large entertainment library on both airlines. The only positive with Hawaiian Airlines was the fact that we were able to access the Qantas Business Lounge prior to departure out of Sydney as Qantas is the handling agent for Hawaiian. The Qantas Business Lounge is superb. Now back to Hawaiian Airlines, when we boarded, (seats 1A and 1B), we were less than impressed from the start. The seats were antiquated, with very little space between rows and with no electronic function. There was no locker for our jackets and upon seating we were handed a menu and asked immediately what our selection would be for dinner, not much time to peruse the menu but the selections seemed appetising. When the meals were delivered, on a tray, similar to most airlines economy class they were disappointing, small portions and the hot component on both different choices coming out lukewarm. We were offered red or white wines with no explanation of variety or country of origin. The snacks offered during the flight consisted of a small bag of crisps and a cookie. When I asked for a small bottle of water, I was asked by the Flight Attendant didn't I get one earlier in the flight, when I replied yes but I would like another they reluctantly gave me one. During the flight we discovered that the seats would only recliner a small amount, making the 10 hour journey most uncomfortable. We still encroached the space of the passengers behind us despite the limited pitch. My seat squeaked, and my partners leg rest would not function. Having spent a considerable amount of money, ($7500), on two return tickets we feel totally ripped off. Hawaiian Airlines First/Business Class is similar to most international carriers Economy Class.

Three criticisms:  Hawaiian makes much of the fact that it's the only US airline still offering comp food, true, but not great quality. The seat-belt sign was turned on at the slightest bump, then left on way, way after any turbulence was way behind us. Cockpit crew need reminding to turn off the sign.

Check-in lines out the door, delayed baggage twice during our 3 days break and they won't take responsibility when they have done the wrong thing! We were recently dismayed by the poor service of Hawaiian Airlines during inter-island flights which we had booked as first class passengers. On the first from Honolulu to Kona we arrived from a flight from Australia and proceeded directly to the domestic flights area, queuing in the astonishing line for first class more than 20mins before it closed. I've never experienced a premium class service that had a queue as long with just two staff. When we arrived at the front of the queue there was still 10mins before closing time but one of the women serving walked away and a man came to take over and had to log in etc. This process took all the time remaining and not once did he look up and ask when our flight was. I regret not being more assertive at that point as the service was dismal. We then took our bags to the bag area and proceeded directly to the gate where we were told we shouldn't have been checked in and that our seats had been given away so we were now to be separated in economy seats. Not the end of the world, but laughable given the massive premium we had paid for first class tickets and not ideal given one of our companions was heavily pregnant and wanted to stay close to her husband. When we arrived on Kona we waited nearly 30minutes at the baggage carousel and after not seeing our bags, we enquired at the desk. Again we were told that because we were late (we were not, Hawaiian Airlines have a staff drought and inefficient processes) our bags weren't carried on the flight and so were arrived in Kona after 24 hours of travel with no clothes for another 3 hours! On the return flight we found the same lack of efficiency and even though we arrived more than an hour before the return flight from Kona to Honolulu, both My husband and I had our bags not arrive until the next flight. We had to wait in the airport again until the next flight arrived. Thank goodness we didn't have to get straight on another flight. We were not the only ones.

He then told me rudely to stop ""mulling"" around that area, so I started to go back to my seat, but then he said the other one was vacant. After using the other toilet I had no way of getting back to the other side of plane so I attempted to go back through the galley but then he critisied me again for going through that area and spoke ""rudely"" to me (in front of other passengers). I absolutely refuse to accept this type of rude behaviour, to a paying passenger from a flight attendant. The female attendants were not rude but this male attendant needs to have a close look at himself and this behaviour towards passengers.

Our flight did not include individual TV screens, only shared TV screens that showed things like a Hawaii city council meeting and public access type television programming. The food was inedible - lukewarm breakfast sandwiches with fruit that tasted old. The airline staff were very curt with us. At one point we asked about early boarding because we had a child with us, and the desk agent snapped that it wasn't our turn yet. Okay, that's why we were asking. We had to check in our stroller at the gate and when we arrived at Lihue, it took us 20 minutes to find an airline staff who could tell us where the stroller was. We were told they'd bring it to us, then it turned out to be behind the desk.

There is no policy about checking in on time on your itinerary so the only way you can find out about this bad news is if you get it first from the desk. I was then printed a ticket for a flight an hour after my original flight, and when everything was done, I went off to TSA line and got to my original gate in 2 mins. I arrived at the gate 20 mins before boarding even began and I was denied entry on board by the Hawaiian employees. They were not being friendly at all and wanted to just go on their ""lunch break"" at 6:28pm. Very unprofessional of these people. I was also belittled by one of them when claiming that is my plane that I should be on and they were asking me in a very condescending way if I want my ticket back as I gave it to one of the ladies for confirmation. I was and am still disgusted with Hawaiian Airlines and their customer service. I feel cheated that I had to still pay them for the pet cabin too because I had my pet in her kennel all the time waiting eagerly to get home.

On this trip, despite checking in all the way to Lihue, for some reason my bag was only checked to Honolulu. I wasn't told this when checking in, so I arrived at Lihue to find my bag hadn't come with me. This was annoying, but the way Hawaiian handled it couldn't have been better.

Check in: automated counters weren't working, so everyone had to be manually checked in, took around 30 mins of waiting. Service staff at the counter couldn't even manage a smile. But was a smooth process despite the minor flaws. Boarding: boarded in zones, worked well, was slightly delayed due to the incoming flight being slightly delayed. Staff kept everyone well informed. Couldn't ask for more. Inflight: air crew were very casually dressed, fitted with the Hawaiian vibe. Weren't as tight and efficient as Thai airways or Etihad. Still the staff were friendly and seemed like they cared about passengers having a good experience. There was no power port on the plane, only USB charging for low power devices. The seats were uncomfortable with very thin cushions, the seats recline quite a bit but there's hardly any leg room. I'm not a tall person but my knees were mashed into the seat in front most of the flight. They provided a pillow and a blanket as well as headphones and earplugs which are necessary as this aircraft was very loud. Meals: dinner was a casserole/curry with rice and beans which was pretty good. There was some coon cheese, and a dairy milk. Staff offered a large range of beverages. Breakfast was a bit dissappointing as there was no hot meal, I got a yoghrt, a bread piece with jam and butter and a cinnamon muffin. Overall was acceptable for the price",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

At around 8.16am, there was an announcement regarding the flight being delayed for 7 hours with a new scheduled departure of 4.30pm. When we were all moved to a different gate, we stood in line for about 20-30 minutes when another announcement came on asking everyone with the delayed flight to take a seat and that accommodations would be made. We sat and waited for a while and around 9.40am, I noticed people who had been on the delayed flight were able to check into the another flight, 41. So I went to wait in line to ask if we could be accommodated. After getting to the counter, the employee who assisted us, said it was possible and stated she needed everyone up at the counter. I signaled to my family but as we were boarding, I realized my husband wasn’t there. I called him and he had gone out of the gate area thinking we would not be accommodated. My kids and I came back out of the tunnel area and I apologized and told the agent we would wait for the 4.30pm flight since my husband wasn’t there. At this, she became upset and yanked the tickets from my hand and all three of my kids’ hands angrily. I apologized again and she made a comment stating “This is why I asked if everyone in your party was here.” I responded that I thought we were. She then raised her voice stating that “you guys are the reason why this flight (41) is delayed”. As upset and frustrated as I already was about a 7 hour delay on our original flight, I had been patient but could not believe my ears when she accused me and my kids of causing a delay in the flight when 1) there were still individuals going into the tunnel at the time we stepped out and 2) after our original flight was delayed for 7.5 hrs and we were told to sit down and they would take care of accommodations. I can understand there can be flight delays but it does not justify the workers being hostile. I did respond that it (causing the delay on 41 even though that wasn’t the case because she was still checking in someone else) wouldn’t have happened if the original flight wasn’t delayed. Also, at this time, there were still other customers who were going into the tunnel area. This is my family’s first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines and it has been a complete mess with rude service. When there are flights delayed for 7.5 hours, I would think that the airline would better train their employees to understand the frustration of its customers instead of blaming them for causing another delayed flight or yanking tickets out of kids’ hands when there are additional people boarding after.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

That's when it got out of hand, passengers yelling at the staff for answers. They finally were forced to put everyone in a hotel for the night. The next morning we reboarded the repaired plane and another mechanical issue forced us back to the gate. Several people just got up and left the flight.

I am not sure when their decline in quality and service happened but it's a real bummer. I had my trip back home planned for over six months. My boyfriend decided to tag along and bought his ticket a month before. Not knowing Hawaiian declined, I boasted how great of an airline it is. I wanted his first trip to Hawaii to start off great and felt confident he'd have a great ride. We arrived to HNL within 15 mins of each other. This was the first time I rode home on United and it was great! I ran over to the Hawaiian terminal with a fresh lei in hand so I could give my bf a proper Hawaiian greeting as he walked out. After giving him his lei I asked how his flight was. ""terrible, this was the WORST airline I ever rode on! They had no entertainment on the flight, no complimentary meal and everyone was terribly rude!"" I didn't believe him and joked that maybe he got on the wrong plane. On the way back home after a great week on Oahu, his flight was delayed and then delayed again for another two hours after they boarded. I thought for sure his flight was a fluke with Hawaiian. Well, here I am today. Christmas Day 2017. My father called last night to let me know my grandma would be passing. Hawaiian Airlines was the only airline with a seat on the earliest flight out so I booked it knowing I'd be in comfort.  Lo and behold, the flight was a half hour delayed because their caterers had trouble getting the food on board. Then they finally board us! Nope. I am sitting here almost two hours later, as they decided to fuel up and de-ice after boarding passengers. Why would any airline make its customers wait on board in cramped chairs when we already have a long flight ahead? So, I decided to bide my time by watching some entertainment. No! I guess my bf wasn't lying all along, there is none! Bad on their part, now my only source of entertainment is to write this (what should be 0) one star review. In addition to their decline in quality, a single bag check used to be free. Now $25. Haven't had my in-flight meal yet but I'm wondering if I'll have to pay premo-prices for the food the caterers probably dropped all over the place when they had a hard time loading it up and delaying the flight.

It was really like taking a domestic US flight across the Pacific when there are so many options on international airlines. The service amenities and aircraft are not comparable. Manila check-in was ok but they had problems with non-working printers and were unable to print all of our boarding passes (they told us to just pick up the last one in HNL because they couldn't figure it out). We boarded the 20+ year-old 767 with overhead bins sized from the 80's no IFE and ageing cabin. The flight attendants all appeared to be senior and had a lot of attitude. We overheard one flight attendant insult an elderly passenger behind her back because the passenger requested to change her new blanket which had hairs on it. The mocking and poor attitude of flight attendants which other reviewers below referred to was true on our flight. To watch movies they rented personal DVD players for $15 per segment. With a change of plane in HNL that meant 4 segments round-trip or $60 per person to watch movies. When we inquired if there was a seafood option (the only choices were chicken and pork) the flight attendant replied they used to have special meals but no longer offer them. On the return flight from LAS we stopped over in HNL for a night but were charged baggage fees for that segment because it was technically a domestic flight - $25 per bag. Finally we took off from HNL-MNL and weren't in the air for 30 minutes when the captain announced a faulty generator requiring us to return to HNL (again a 20+ year-old 767). However we had to burn fuel first so we flew in circles at 7000 ft for 4 hours with the landing gear and flaps fully extended - an uncomfortable ride. The flight attendants were plain combative with understandably worried and upset passengers. Six hours later we landed in HNL again. They arranged another plane with a new crew and we arrived in MNL 8 hours late. To make matters worse they left behind baggage of at least 50 passengers in HNL so there was an ugly queue of irate passengers at 2:30 am after an 8 hour delay. We received our luggage two days later. We wrote a letter to Hawaiian but they did not respond. All in all if we had flown on CX or KE or OZ via HKG or SEL to the mainland we could've avoided a tremendous amount of hassle (eg. having to collect your bags and check-in again in HNL) being nickel and dimed (eg. luggage fees and DVD rental fees) poor service (being insulted by flight attendant) and delays from old faulty aircraft. I should also mention I felt bad for the business class passengers who paid $2000+ for their seats. The seats in business class are domestic US first class seats - very little recline and leg room.

The inflight entertainment was average - for $15 you can rent a cumbersome hand-held unit with 12-15 movies 12-15 TV programmes music videos and audio tracks. The $15 is pretty steep but it's better than standard IFE on other US airlines. HNL-ITO and ITO-HNL on B717-200s which have assigned seats and first class cabin. Service very good and beverages ae offered on the 40 minute flights. HNL-LAX segment with the new A330-200. We upgraded to first class for $300 per seat - recliner seats have adjustable legrests and footrests and recline to about 130 degrees. The controls are non-electronic and the legrests are a bit difficult to push back in place. Food service very good. Hawaiian's first class is very good value for flights to the USA but does not compete with Korean Qantas Delta or the Asian airlines on flights to the Pacific Rim. Service on all flights is cordial and friendly and FA's are more professional and customer-friendly than other US airlines.,nan,4.0,nan

As we are from the UK we did not have to pay any baggage fees to and from the Mainland (had to show check in staff our flight details from the UK).

Do not be fooled by the winglets (which HA added to save fuel) these are old planes with interiors to match. Also do not for a moment think you will be getting anything like a Business or First Class product on a first tier airline this would be a mediocre Premium Economy product at best.

Unfortunately this was the same content for all 4 long haul flights and by the end of the first flight I had already watched all that interested me. It was also awkward to use these during the meal service as there was basically nowhere to put them. Food was adequate although dry and uninspiring. The ""champagne"" served on take off was in fact a fairly unpleasant Prosecco and the single white wine choice with the meal was probably a hazard to the aircraft paintwork if you spilled any. As with all airplane travel the quality of the experience is relative to the price you have paid.

Although the plane is equipped with personal touch screens on every seat there are very few complimentary options to enjoy. You have to pay for movies TV shows music selection and games. On our return from HNL to LA our flight left on time and arrived 15 mins early. Personnel were a lot less enjoyable lnot rude but did not make you feel welcome. There were two different meal options however by my turn they only had sandwiches left. Overall they got the job done and did not experience any major hiccup but at the end of the day we did pay a premium and so I expected more.,nan,1.0,nan

They had my husband and I sitting separately - despite the fact this happened last time and I went overboard asking for it not to happen again - 4 flights sitting separately. The seats were awfully uncomfortable. General lack of 'couldn't care' by staff. Even when I said I didn't feel well and asked for water they never came back.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LAX-HNL on Airbus A330. Flight was delayed 35 minutes. At first it was announced that the flight was delayed due to TSA requirements. Then it was announced the delay was due to scheduling problems. Boarding commenced shortly after the missing flight attendant arrived. The economy cabin was very cramped. The seat was simply uncomfortable even for a 5 hour flight. The seat was hard and narrow with poor leg room. The IFE system had a decent variety but required a fee (so make sure you have your credit card on hand) though on a full service airline this should be complimentary. Refreshments were served. Breakfast was served shortly after but consisted of a disgusting breakfast burrito and sugary bun with no other options. No complimentary refreshments were available for the remaining 3.5 hours of the flight. The flight attendants were well mannered but unprofessional. The flight concluded with the managing flight attendant listing all of the routes that Hawaiian Airlines services and will service in the future and instructing all passengers to recommend Hawaiian Airlines to all of our family and friends.,nan,1.0,nan

I flew from Hilo to Las Vegas and was quite impressed. Flight crews on both flights were very warm and welcoming. Any requests were honored with a smile. Flights were smooth both ways. Check-in was a breeze in Hilo and Las Vegas. For meals I was offered a complimentary pasta dish with a piece of cake and a Turkey sandwich on the return. Flight attendants were visible throughout the flight and constant runs of drinks. Very Impressed.,nan,4.0,nan

No AVOD but portable digi players were available for rent at US$15 credit card payment only. A330's will commence on this route soon. Both flights left and arrived on time although check-in at Sydney took 50 minutes because they're weren't enough check-in attendants. Meals on both flights were satisfactory and service was fine although flight attendants were hardly seen between the meal services. Would be happy to fly with them again.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,We flew to Honolulu from Sydney in Business Class and returned in Coach. We have a 8 month old son and my wife is vegetarian. On the Business Class leg there was no bassinet available even though promised and we could not be confirmed that any of the food would be vegetarian. As a result our son had to sleep on our laps for an 11 hour flight. Service was very friendly and they assisted us greatly to make it comfortable with pillows but we were trapped in seats for the entire flight. On the return leg seat allocations were not confirmed bassinet not available again and instead of being the front row of the main cabin we were stuck in the middle rows and had to ask passengers in front not to recline so as not to hit our sleeping son. The food was minimal and only 1 meal was vegetarian. Service and food were good but very minimal. There are higher quality ways to get to Hawaii from Australia.,nan,1.0,nan

Flight over was fine but seats were a bit uncomfortable. Meals were ok but service was average. Didn't really see attendants that much. No inseat entertainment. you can rent portable DVD style players though. Cabin crew ran out of customs forms so you had to wait to land before these could be filled out which caused a delay at customs. On the way return again check in was hassle free and better than in SYD. All the portable DVD players were gone by the time they got to me. Flight attendants were very nice but rarely seen. All the toilets in the rear of the plan were not working about 6 hours into the flight so a bit of a wait for the other toilets. All in all it was ok.,nan,4.0,nan

Crew very unhelpful and not interested in assisting us with details of baby change toilet or heating bottles etc. Food was terrible and service not at all satisfactory.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,We used Hawaiian because they had a direct flight. After we booked it was changed to a flight with a layover. Once onboard the flight crew made my wife (then the bride) to roll her wedding dress up and wedge it between luggage in the overhead bin. Flight attendants we very short tempered with us seemed stressed and overall very unpleasant. Our video player stopped working when we got a replacement the audio and video did not match up. The seat tray was covered with dried food when I asked for a cloth to clean it the flight attendant sighed and turned around without answering.,nan,1.0,nan

There was just over an hour between our arrival and departure for Kona. Held in a holding pattern over HON. Once we landed we sprinted for Hawaiian Airlines check-in arriving 30 mins before the flight only to be told it was too late to check-in-. Check-in was rude and unhelpful just basically repeating over and over that we had missed the luggage check-in. We ended up spending a long acutely uncomfortable night sitting at HON airport.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,HNL-FUK-HNL on 767. Excellent fare to/from Seoul when connecting in Fukuoka - almost half-price of non- stop. Average experience does not come close to Asiana. No in-seat entertainment no choice of meals and what was served was mediocre cabin attendants disappear for a long time very little communication from pilots. Of four possible aisle seats three have a box underneath that limits foot comfort-choose G to avoid box. In 3-seat middle section I was put with couple and their baby luckily well-behaved but 4 people in 3 seats not acceptable. On-time and smooth connection in Fukuoka to avoid customs. Overall acceptable but cabin service on 9-hour flight not up to standards of airlines based in Asia.,nan,1.0,nan

We decided to treat ourselves to First class both ways which ended up a little disappointing to say the least. The seats did not recline very far (about the same recline as Qantas economy) and the food going over was just plonked in front of us in one hit. At least the staff coming back had a better idea of serving food. I have food allergies (which I notified the airlines of when we booked) and they said they'll see what they can do - all I can say was I was hungry when I arrived except for the food I took with me! Also the inflight entertainment was the same on all four legs so I was wishing I had brought a good book with me. The positives were the staff were friendly drink service was great and they boarded us quickly.,nan,1.0,nan

Plane was half hour late arriving into Sydney which made about 1 hour late departing. Staff food seats were great. We then flew from Honolulu to Big Island on 11 July and returned to Hon on 14 July and then departed Honolulu on 15 July back to Sydney. Good service and friendly staff. 15 July flight home at 12.45pm was again late yet was not Hawaiian's fault. Overall would fly with them again no problem. Food was lovely and plenty of it. Entertainment units were good and purchase of movies if required was easy.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Flew on their new direct flight from Honolulu to New York (JFK) to celebrate the 4th of July. Very impressed with the speed of their boarding flight attendants were friendly and enough storage space. The seats of this Airbus were slightly wider than normal HAL planes so didn't feel like a packed sardine the seat itself slides forward as it reclines and there were folds on the headrest so you wouldn't end up on your neighbor's shoulder; it was quite comfortable to sit for the 10 hour haul. Free soda snack and meals (2) snacks for purchase alcoholic drinks for purchase premium meals for purchase. Surprised that you actually get 2 basic meals for free. Passed out free headsets and there were some video and audio for free but had to pay for others. Everyone has their own video monitor so very cool. USB input available. I kept falling asleep during the meal and drink service and they were very accommodating to bring it for me when I woke up. No regrets and will be returning in 6 months!,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Check in at Kansai A/P (Japan) is dysfunctional. I had bought round trip tickets state side for travel from SFO to Kansai due to personal circumstances I ended up buying the trip in 2 segments (for the same day). The first from SFO to Honolulu with a connecting Hawaiian flight to Kansai with similar routing on the return. I was assured I would be able to route my baggage through from SFO to Kansai and visa versa (i.e. without having to pickup and recheck in Honolulu). The agents at SFO were able to do this but the Japanese agent at Kansai insisted that Hawaiian required all baggage picked up at Honolulu with passenger responsibility to recheck bags for continuation flight to SFO. Of course this created undue/unnecessary passenger burden! Bottom line Hawaiian needs to improve training of the Japanese agents they hire for check in at Kansai. I will never take Hawaiian for travel outside the states again!,nan,1.0,nan

With my status we thought that it would give us preferred boarding and no checked bag fees - wrong! I stepped into the ""Premier"" line to see if we could get on an earlier flight as we were at the airport ahead of schedule. The woman behind the counter rudely told me to get into the other line (no one behind me BTW) because my status on AA ""didn't matter"" to Hawaiian Airlines even though they were a codeshare partner. I stepped in the other line only to get right back to the same person five minutes later. I asked if we could standby for the earlier flight and she proceeded to charge us $50 per person. For a thirty minute flight with open seats? Decided against that and was rudely reminded that we would still have to pay baggage check fees because they didn't care about our status with AA. Her tone was so rude that I asked to speak to a supervisor who came out and proceeded to complain about AA. I will avoid Hawaiian Airlines at all costs and fly one of the other commuter airlines with better service and lower costs.",nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,JFK-HNL roundtrip. The food on both flights were very good. There were drinks given throughout the flight and you were able to get a drink anytime throughout the flight. The FA's were nice and interacting with the passengers and were polite and were always cleaning the plane. The bathrooms were clean and FA's cleaned them frequently throughout the flight which is something you do not normally see. On the A330 there was plenty of legroom in the economy class. However the one drawback was when I was trying to confirm a seat on the plane the person on the phone was unhelpful and was unable to help my problem. On the flight you also had to pay for the in flight entertainment and they had a big selection of movies to choose from.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,We were married in Maui. Our outbound was very good. On our return flight to Vegas we had a medical stop in Oakland. When we landed some passengers got new flights and hotels to stay in two groups were connecting on Southwest however the customer service desk said they don't work with Southwest so they had to find their own accommodation. In the meantime I got a new flight on my own and I gave a staff member the numbers to our new flights to add our luggage to. He promised it would be there then he left without telling us anything.

Boarding at LAX was chaotic and crowded although we were spared the worst of it because we got priority boarding with 2 babies. The flight left on time and arrived about 25 minutes early. There was no wait on the tarmac at HNL for a free gate. Inflight service was much better than average for U.S. carriers food was decent IFE was better than the competition and the cabin crew smiled more and was more attentive than average for U.S carriers.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,Wife and I flew from Las Vegas to Kona Hawaii connecting both ways in Honolulu. The LAS-HON leg is on an Airbus with 2+4+2 seating in economy so my wife and I can sit together. Hawaiian doesn't jam the seats in economy together as much as some airlines. And for an extra $35 per passenger each way you can get a bulkhead or exit row seat with tons of legroom but to get this you have to do online check-in pretty darn close to 24 hours before your flight. You can actually call the airline and talk to a customer representative without waiting more than a few minutes. If you fly in the evening you get a free tasty although small real hot meal with veggies and meat salad and dessert. (The breakfast service is also free but not as nice as the dinner.) Also when I asked about wine the steward mentioned the half bottle (375 ml) of red as having pleased other passengers so my wife and I bought it for $16 and it was a nice pinot noir.,nan,5.0,nan

You also get a free meal (poor to fair quality) with a free wine to accompany it. They nickel and dime you for everything else (baggage IFE (films etc.) preferred seating). Cabin crew was efficient but not overly friendly on the outbound flight and on the return flight one member was downright surly. He didn't even look at us when handing us drinks and ignored us when we asked questions. Also took inter-island flights HNL-ITO return in B717s. Good for short flights and you get a free juice or coffee. In summary Hawaiian are good for inter-island but avoid them for long-haul flights.,nan,3.0,nan

The cabin crew were excellent and the food served much better than economy but again there is no comparison between it and say the food served in Qantas premium economy. Our flight back to Sydney was back in economy and I was very happy with the experience though the ""Hawaiian high tea"" served towards the end of the flight was just a roll and a biscuit.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Flew Honolulu to Sydney in Economy. Got exit row seats row 33 with bulkhead in front. Plenty of leg room and no one in front putting their seat back. The only problem was that other people feel it is a through traffic area and use it to cross from one side of the plane to the other. I paid the $75 to have that space for me. I ended up no moving my legs and annoyed some people by doing so. The other thing is the flight attendant was going to move another passenger into the empty seat between myself and a travel friend as the other person was unhappy with her normal economy seat. I complained and reminded her that we had paid $75 for these seats and why should she get a free seat. There were empty rows of seats at the back of the plane that she could have moved her to. I got my way and she was not moved to the exit row seats. Food was good digeplayer was poor. Staff overall were ok. Did not show to much of an effect to make the trip enjoyable.

All this food plus a free mai tai on the way out and wine with dinner on the return on a domestic USA flight and free to boot? Unheard of nowadays but thank you Hawaiian for still being the only US carrier to offer free food on flights. Cabin crew generally friendly and sharing the aloha spirit.

I have travelled Business on several occasions between Sydney and Honolulu during 2011-12 and although there has been an introduction of new aircraft of late previous flights have been on old planes with tray tables faulty on two occasions. Seats are also not very comfortable in Business although are better than Economy where space between is very tight especially with tray table down and the seat in front reclined. On 6 September 2012 I did Honolulu-JFK on HA50 at least ending up in a pre-booked window seat in row 13. Overall it was very ordinary if adequate without anything terribly exciting.

Seats on the 767 are actually more comfortable when upright while the entertainment on the 330 is far superior in choices. Meal service is the same and was excellent on both flighst.

On LAX-HNL leg they served a turkey sandwich and a brownie. Chose to upgrade to the cheeseburger for $12.99. Not a lot of leg room onboard but the seat wasn't too bad. Boarding was slick and organized. On flight to Sydney you were served a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing-not really enough for a 10 hour flight. You also had to pay for IFE on New York flight which is a long route with no IFE.

Yes the first bag cost $35 but Hawaiian checked it through from JFK to West Maui even though that flight was on Island Air and I never touched the luggage until I reached my final destination.

Hawaiian cancelled our flight rebooked us with a ridiculous routing involving two plane changes and neglected to inform us. I only discovered this when I went on-line to check the flight time.

On A330 I would advise taking the $75 upgrade to a bulkhead seat - particularly row 11 as its right behind Business class and in a mini cabin of only 3 rows. If travelling overnight I'd pay for economy and upgrade on check-in online to Business if available. Best thing about the flights was the excellent service and the prompt appearance of baggage at the carousel. Food was good drinks plentiful. Pay TV option was a bit much but we read. I joined their FF program before I booked - for only $120 it was worth it! Business check-in express pass through customs lounge access it's kind of like the Qantas Club.

Run down and torn seats my table tray still had crumbs and gravy stains and my seat volume control was broken as was the overhead monitor screens. Cabin staff treated passengers like cattle. The only smiles I saw from the flight attendants were when they tandem delivered drinks and meals joking loudly with each other as if the passengers didn't matter. During the noodle service the 2 male flight attendants were in such a rush that they shoved the noodle cup in our laps even though some passengers didn't have their tray down. The service did resemble the price I paid. On the upside the meal was tasty and plentiful and the trip back from Fukuoka to HNL was completely opposite.,nan,4.0,nan

On checking in online exit row seats (window/aisle) in a 2-4-2 layout were available at 35 bucks each. Well worth the money especially as priority boarding was thrown in to the price. Bag drop was slow but bags helpfully tagged through to Molokai. Well organised boarding on a completely full flight plus the priority boarding meant that overhead bin space wasn't an issue (though it was for others who boarded later). An on time departure and a very thorough briefing on our role at the emergency exit set a positive tone for the flight. A ""continental breakfast"" (but more like a snack box) with a sweet roll with cream cheese savoury snack bag and a cookie plus T&Cs and juice was served promptly. A second round of T&Cs and a later water run were offered and unexpected. An hour or so out of Honolulu a further drinks run with T&Cs and complimentary mai tai were offered concluding a cabin service which was good and delivered by friendly and professional crew.

There is no longer even a snack provided for what is quite a long flight instead they want you to buy dismal snacks from the back galley. There is the walk between terminals at HNL and then a fair short flight to Hawaii. Coming back we paid for first class on the short flight. That was good. Bags flew free and Mai Tais are available.

The majority of the hostesses are rude and not helpful at all. We received no information from them in regards to seatbelt safety etc when it came to our daughter and had to ask. The last thing as a parent you want to do is inconvenience other passengers however they make flying with a child horrific as once again we are unable to book and pay for the bulk head seats through web check in. They had the cheek to tell us that the only way they could help us was for on our last day to catch a cab to the airport and check in that way.

Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem.

The real downside was the fact that blankets are not offered and must be bought which would be ok but they hold a very small stock which sold quickly and the cabin was freezing.

On both legs no vegetarian option was given and we were given hard cold chicken with undercooked vegetables.

The pluses end there. Minuses: For international passengers the food/beverage and inflight entertainment is dire. Can see why US passengers might rate them highly given what they endure domestically! What's with the bland chicken and rice dishes on all lunch and dinner flights? The free F+B offering on SFO-HNL breakfast run consists of 4 grapes 4 slices of melon a piece of cheese and 2 packs of crackers? HA should charge a couple of bucks more and get serious with their offerings or drop the pretence of food completely and charge for a decent offering. The 'complimentary IFE' is a joke in content despite the new A330 planes even the pay per view movies (US$7.99 a pop) were exceedingly limited in choice. The HA terminal in HNL and terminal in LIH are in a time warp but suspect this to be the fault of the airport authorities (and TSA is certainly outside HA's control). Like I said all's not lost this airline certainly is no 4/5 star airline but it could be halfway decent with a few weeks. For the price paid not really good value.

I have flown on many Boeing 767's and this one was by far the quietest one ever. Flight attendants were very friendly. The complimentary breakfast after take-off and the complimentary rum punch before landing are a really nice touch when flying in the economy cabin. I can only think of two draw-backs: 1) your regular head-sets don't work well (you need a two-prong plug or you only hear their [free] video entertainment out of one ear]) and 2) the cabin is very cold (I was prepared and wore my coat but several folks around me were sneezing).

Meals the same bland poached chicken bits on rice with broccoli (ex AKL) and diced carrots/peas (exHNL). Not worth staying up for esp when served at 2 am out of AKL!

I gave the porter a tip but still did not get a priority tag. No information given about lounge access had to find lounge on my own. Overall a very chaotic unfriendly check-in process. Lounge at HNL airport very basic staff ok not overly friendly. On board the service was good and so was the food and wine.

Hawaiian were accommodating on getting us on a flight but charged us both for entirely 2 new one way air fares ( AUD2200) - talk about slugging you whilst you are down - absolutely no compassion at all. Other family member were in the UK and Emirates/Qantas did all they could to get them home in time which they did and did all of this free of charge - we've flown with Hawaiian in the past but this has left a very very poor taste in our collective mouths. IF we can at all help it will not be flying Hawaiian again.,nan,2.0,nan

We upgraded to business class on flight from Brisbane to Hawaii the night before on online check in for discounted price - worth it. Lounge at Brisbane airport is AirNZ and was great. Staff on ground very helpful food great we paid extra for bulkhead seat from Vegas to Hawaii - again worth it plenty of leg room. I found every aspect of the flights great.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,Most uncomfortable seats on any flight I've ever experienced. Very cold on the flight no blankets or pillows offered on this OAK-OGG flight. Meal is a joke! Brunch consisted of 2 small slices of cantaloupe 2 small slices of mushy watermelon 2 very hard slices of unripe honeydew melon 4 grapes 4 crackers one piece of cheese and one chocolate covered macadamia nut candy. When leaving home at 6:00 a.m. with two hour advance check-in before a 5:33 flight don't assume Hawaiian is offering a meal as their advertising reports; eat first take food on the plane. Take a jacket to wear on the flight. Very tight leg room uncomfortable uncushioned hard seats. They are the only airline that I know of that charges for ear phones. Could have brought my own if I knew they are not included. Poor quality entertainment choices. If you want to starve freeze and suffer through a long flight fly HA otherwise choose a different carrier.,nan,2.0,nan

nan,First Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,I flew HA436 first class from SYD to HNL on 12th October on a brand new A330 and had a very good experience - attentive crew - great food preparation and meal and beverage service and good in-flight entertainment. The only drawback was the lack of a lie flat bed for a 9 hour flight-the seat was comfortable but if HA pulled out those cradle type seats in First and removed the economy seats in the second smaller cabin and installed lie flat beds in both cabins they would have a great product and sweep away their competition.,nan,5.0,nan

Hilo to Honolulu HA 121 8.50am departure seat 1B first class. Lounge at Hilo very basic free wifi coffee and soft drink. Pre boarding done correctly on time departure quick 50 minute flight just enough time for a coffee and a biscuit. Honolulu to Sydney HA 451 seat 14B the reserved seating bulk head seat cost $75 extra. Boarding called in correct order except kids get priority again. My bulk head seat was as spacious as an economy seat can be. I would have preferred the seats in row 11 but they were blocked for the entire 24 hour period during check in. Not long after take off a very friendly stewardess offered drinks and 2 hours into flights refills and dinner served would give this food a 4 out of 5 for economy. There was a lot of young families traveling with babies all were reasonably behaved for a 10 hour flight. There of course was one family who thought it was ok for their children to play a portable DVD player without head phones so all the cabin could hear it.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,5th October SYD-HNL-ITO. This is my 10th year as a dedicated Hawaiian air traveller for long distance trip SYD to HNL and Hilo also to LA and Vegas also started to use their HNL to JFK this year and looking forward to their expansion with new aircraft purchase planned. Today's trip started on 4th October at 2000 when I attempted to use the web check in 24 hours prior with no success. I am lucky I am a gold Pualani member so I called their dedicated line after about 25 minutes they were able to upgrade my SYD-HNL flight and my HNL-Hilo which is good as business on Hawaiian is normally very good. 5th October check in was a breeze with the dedicated business and Pualani member line and with express pass through immigration I was In the Air New Zealand lounge in no time. This Air NZ lounge has improved over the past few years it was getting tired and food mediocre. But gladly today much better I really like the self help bar. My flight is scheduled for 2000 departure I noticed in bound flight arrived on time. Boarding started on time and again children first before business - this always annoys me. Once onboard was offered welcome champagne or juice the seats are wide leather seats but don't lie flat but are still very comfortable and they have power for your iPad or iPhone. Take off on time and as soon as we levelled off drinks started to flow I had a few chivas regals and before dinner there also was a cheese plate. 3 options for dinner I had the veal and catch of the day and it was fantastic. Breakfast was strawberry yoghurt fresh fruit plate country style potatoes and crab and scallion omelette also fantastic. The cabin crew were very attentive and professional I managed to get a good couple of hours sleep and rested for my next flight HNL to Hilo. Got through customs fairly fast but maybe they could looking into express path for business passengers like in Sydney. At the transfer desk no Hawaiian staff there to send my bags to Hilo so had to take them to the inter island terminal myself. Once there was easy to drop off bags and head to the priority security line. Honolulu to Hilo again seat 1B a quick 50 minute flight no problems arrived on time and bags were quickly available. Over all a 5 star trip very pleased and look forward to many more Hawaiian trips.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,"San Francisco-Honolulu-San Francisco in September 2013. Outbound Flight HA11 boarded on time boarding was organized flight left and arrived on time. Newish Airbus A330-200's economy cabin was stylish and comfortable. Basic IFE offered little entertainment you have to pay extra for movies and TV programs. Not a problem for me and my wife as we brought our own respective iPads. The outbound basic ""free"" meal consisted of a fruit tray a cookie a Hawaiian chocolate candy in a wrapper water and juice or soda. Upgraded meal was $14 for a hamburger or a Chicken salad with a few extras on the meal tray but we felt those were not good values for their prices therefore we bought two sandwiches in the airport before our flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and they offered free Mai Tais and Hawaiian chips about one hour before landing in HNL. Total of three drink runs during the 5 1/2-hour flight. Return flight HA12 also with organized boarding left and arrived on time. Nothing new to say about the Airbus A330-200's IFE except this particular airplane's moving map display has an added information on the airplane's flight level in meters and feet. Surprised we were given ""free"" in-flight meal of Chicken- stuffed hot sandwich with a small salad and Hawaiian chocolate candy a free cup of wine was an option! This was very much appreciated. Again three drink runs during this 4 1/2-hour flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. With HA's convenient departure and arrival times and newer Airbus A330-200 aircraft's used on the SFO- HNL-SFO routes we will fly with them again next time we visit the Hawaiian Islands.",nan,5.0,nan
nan,First Class,5.0,May 2018,3.0,5.0,nan,yes,Honolulu to Kona,5.0," |  Together with my parents we flew from Honolulu to Kona in Business Class/domestic First. Taking into account that the price difference between coach and Business Class was $50, and that luggage is included, I would most likely pay the difference again. The seat was a big, comfortable chair with enough leg space. We sipped our Hawaiian cocktails and enjoyed the splendid view outside the window. A snack was served (small bag of pretzels); I think here Hawaiian has room for improvement such like fresh fruits or a snack basket like the mainland carriers use for such short flight.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

The lines for bag check in and for security — for TSA Pre too— were around out of the terminal and around the block. Gee, HNL is Hawaiian Airlines’ hub; one would expect that they would have their check in act together on their home turf. Not. Almost missed my flight. The food selection in flight was incredibly limited, and Hawaiian did not even offer the option to buy a meal. Really? On a 5 hour flight? Hard to believe. The flght attendants are also starting to catch the disease normally associated with other airlines: Surly-itis. It took 45 minutes for my bag to appear in baggage claim. Altogether, a disappointing flying experience.",Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0

What a terrible experience this flight was, keep the temperature in the plane at a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius just to make people ask for blankets which they sell with 10$. After take off they started to sell food without informing that in another 40min they will serve the food in the tickets -  they ask for money on earbuds and movies.

The island is beautiful and the people are lovely. Unfortunately the staff and customer service wasn't. We were left hungry both on the way and back as they couldn't provide a vegetarian meal even though I had checked double times both ways. no effort was made to provide substitute food and the staff has very little concern. The 9 hour flight was a struggle and we will not be flying with them again. After complaining we received 100 credit with the airline. Not sure how this helps me?,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0

Air New Zealand have been fleecing New Zealanders for years on this sector for years so it's great to see competition. The cabins are very airy and simple, seat room in economy was ok and the seat was comfy enough. The cabin crew were very friendly and had a nice Hawaiian relaxed style. Communication from the flight deck was excellent re flight times, turbulence etc. Meal service was good as was bar service. Despite the cheaper ticket price, Hawaiian is a full service airline and you're luggage is on the piece system, good for bringing back you're outlet shopping! We will definitely fly Hawaiian next time we go up to Honolulu and further.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

The cabin was so cold, we were offered blanket for $10 but when we went to buy one they didn't have anymore so we froze the whole 6 1/2 hr flight. The food was terrible also, so we were cold and hungry by the time we arrived. After voluntarily checking 2 of our bags when asked, due to limited baggage space due to a totally full flight. The appreciation we got for that was a totally cracked suitcase with no explanation.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,March 2018,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,New York to Honolulu,4.0," | New York to Honolulu. I had the gate slammed at my face after my wife and I spent close to 40 mins at the TSA line. We were roughly one minute late. We explained to the Hawaiian Airline staff at the boarding gate what happened and they reported that they could not let us board the plane due to ""security reasons"". The plane waited on the tarmac for 20 more mins after our experience before taking off. Within this period of trying to negotiate, 9 other people who were late came up to the gate with the same TSA complaint. We noted and reported that other airline staff tried to help get their passengers quickly through the TSA lines but Hawaiian airline staff did not. We were asked to rebook our flight, only for us to get a quote for $2200 dollars for (2) one way ticket from New York to Hawaii for my wife and I - twice the cost of my return ticket. This was predatory and exploitative. We were upset but paid it as we were attending an annual medical conference in Hawaii and had paid for extra courses as well which we did not want to miss. I should have flown United, Delta or American Airlines. My friends who did had a better experience in terms of friendliness and consideration of their ground staff and cabin staff. We spent 20 extra hours trying to reach our destination and paid dearly for the one minute delay in getting to the boarding gate. Please avoid this airline at all costs. We are in the times where airlines are trying to redeem their image. Unfortunately Hawaiian does not give a rat's behind about customers and diplomacy as long as you have paid for your tickets.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Honolulu to Kahului,1.0," | Can I rate it a zero! The absolute worst customer service ever. I had a total of 6 flights scheduled during my honeymoon in Hawaii. The total cost of all the ""island hopping"" flights is about $600 dollars. I needed to change my flight because of blizzard in the eastern U.S (NY to DC) that has 2500 flights canceled. They are a partner of United, my carrier to Hawaii and you should be able to change due to inclement weather. I needed to push each flight back one day. After waiting on hold for one hour they tell me they want to charge me about $400 to change the flights (75% of the cost). They said maybe to try having a United rep call to change the flight. I call back with a United Rep. They want to charge me $400 for the flight. Speaking with their customer service reps is a miserable experience. All offshore reps which doesn't always have to be unpleasant but I felt like I was speaking to the mafia with these folks. Every other hotel and airline I called to reschedule due to this snow blizzard were nice and had no issue changing. This airlines customer service is rotten to the core. Stay away.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

They let people in the plane, we were waiting for 1 hour inside the plane (it was really cold and when i asked for the blanket they said its extra cost). Finally they let us out and said its gonna be a delay, because engine was broken and they were trying to fix. Mechanics were trying to fix it for the good 6 hours, airline was promising every hour that soon we will depart. After all they couldn't fix the engine and something else was damaged on the plane (it was really old, scary how they let such old planes to operate). After 6 hours at the airport and official note from the airline that the flights is canceled i went to Hawaiian ticket counter and they issued new tickets for me and my husband for the next day with another airline, and thanks god i checked it by the evening and found out that reservation wasn't existing. They issued the ticket wrong. The company is hard to get a hold of, i had to wait 40 minutes calling from 2 different phones at the same time. Finally the representative answered and she said that they can't refund money for the flight or to change it The result, 6 hours in the airport, 2 hours on the phone, no money back nothing. The most horrible experience of my life so far with the airline.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
