Our flight from Montreal on May 19th departed at 4:00pm, 10 minutes earlier than the  departure time of 4:10pm. We had a connecting flight in Beijing on May 20th  at 6:30pm on flight and was supposed to be landing at 5:00pm however the plane only landed at 5:50 pm in Beijing. Due to this delay we missed our connecting flight to due the poor customer service from Air China at Beijing airport. When we arrived at the Beijing airport we were able to see that the were doing a last call however nothing was done to communicate to hold the plane for us and for other passengers that were supposed to be on that flight as well. This was the first time that we had flown with Air China and was the worst experience. We stayed in Beijing airport trying to figure out what to do until 9pm where we were told that we are getting a hotel to stay for the night with a meal included and will be catching a flight the next morning at 8am. We had taken a bus that brought us to a hotel which was the worst hotel ever in my life. Is this how you treat customers? We went into the restaurant hoping for a good meal after all of this terrible customer service and making us miss our flight. We were presented with a buffet that was the most disgusting food ever and with nothing to drink. Once we got into our room it smelled rotten and the bed was like sleeping on a piece of wood. The next day we went back to the airport to catch our flight and arrived in Hong Kong only to find out that one of our luggages is missing and that it was still in Beijing and the other luggage was damaged with one of the wheels broken which I had to purchase another luggage($150). We ended up getting the missing luggage delivered to us 12 hours later and found out that the luggage was damaged as well with the handle on the side ripped off. This is ridiculous and the customer service that Air China provides is way below standard and is a joke. On our way back from Japan on June 7th at Haneda airport, when checking in, we had asked for an upgrade to Premium economy for the flight CA879 from Beijing to Montreal and they agent had told us that the do not do upgrades and we would need to do it in Beijing when we catch our connecting flight. Once we got to gates in Beijing they told us that they do not do upgrades either. Customers looking to upgrade their seats and give Air China more money are turned down.

Yet, the type of service I’ve received on past experiences was not worth the price I paid. I understand that I chose an economy seat and I was not expecting any kind of first class treatment. However, this company’s overall customer service is poorly managed. From checking-in to flight attendants, including any department that has the name “Air China”, I’ve seen and had only rude experiences from employees. Employees are very impatient with questions that you asked and raising their voices at you being very disrespectful. Although I’ve decided to come back to this airline after every disappointing experience for its cheaper price tag, this will be my last time boarding with this airline.

Flight attendants were rude at times. Food is also terrible. Since it's first come first served, there is no guarantee you can choose what meat you prefer since it will run out. The rice is always bad, so sticky and the noodles are not better. People (and flight attendants) will speak Chinese to you if you are Asian and mostly will continue to do so even when you tell them you are not Chinese. Transiting in Beijing is also a terrible experience. If you don't know where to go, even if you ask they are not very happy and look very annoyed that you asked. Or worse, just shouted at you in Chinese and pointed to somewhere. The time of transit is very short, which you will easily miss your next flight (more troubles). The last thing I am most frustrated about is, at the end of the flight, you will likely lose your luggages. Happened a few times already.

The food was quite good (I would say it was better flying to Ho Chi Minh City then back to Warsaw), flight entertainment were also good (30-40 movies in English and new releases like Black Panter and other older movies). The planes were quite old and I believe Air China should update their airplane fleet. We booked lounge in Beijing and as we have 15 hours layovers, it was nice to come to lounge, have some snacks, drinks, use showers and rest a little (we spend most of layover time visiting Great Wall of China and Forbidden City).

That was until I experienced the absolute most horrendous customer service from Air China.  I was travelling with a group of 7. I had booked a round trip from Edmonton to Hong Kong. This booking was done via Flight Hub which would include an Air Canada flight from Edmonton to Vancouver and an Air China flight to HK. Upon arrival at the airport in Edmonton Air Canada alerted me that my middle name was missing from the flight info and were happy to add it. Air Canada updated both my boarding passes. When I got to Vancouver I went to the Air China check in counter to receive my boarding pass and I waited 2 hours until they told me I wouldn't be allowed on the flight because of my missing middle name. This information came was communicated to me 10 minutes before gate closing. This gave me absolutely no time to contact Air Canada or Flight Hub for help. Air China were unwilling to add my middle name despite showing my passport and other government issued IDs. I had to cancel and rebook my entire round trip because they wouldn't add my middle name on the return flight either. One of my friends stayed behind and took the flight with me. On the return flight my friend was rejected from the flight for ""breaking the sequence"". Upon enquiry Air China confirmed that his seat was still reserved for him but he would have to pay an $1200 USD to get it back. Air China was incredibly unhelpful and threatened to call security when was asked why he was rejected from the flight even though they themselves confirmed the seat was reserved for him.

Each seat has its own screen and personal entertainment system. There were a lot of movies in English or with English subtitles available. A few movies also available in French as Montreal is a French-speaking city. However, there was only Chinese music available. I found the lavatories quite clean, I found the crew professional. It's a fact that staff don't really speak English - a few could speak a little bit of English but it's very minimal. Only two meals were served during the 14-hour flight (in comparison with other airlines that serve three meals on similar routes). As a result, I found the 8-hour interval between the meals a bit too long. The meals were good enough Montreal to Beijing but only average on Beijing to Montreal flight.

Due to the change we had to leave a paid night at our hotel and miss our last tour in the Phi Phi Islands. We asked for a refund since we had made changes to that specific flight so we could stay that extra day in Thailand, but we were given a number in China to call. We spoke with the manager in Bangkok who said we were going to be upgraded in Beijing and that we needed to go to the ""transfers"" counter - which does not exist in Beijing. No numbers to call within the airport and we couldn't go out to the counter to get our business class upgrade. We were told that no upgrade was going to be given since we paid for coach. We explained that we had already paid an additional $400 dollars to change our earlier flight to the original flight in the late afternoon so we wanted our $400 back.

The movies, in both English and Chinese, were current not outdated as some have noted. My only comment is the business class lay-flat seats on the A330 was more comfortable than the seats on the Boeing 777ER. The screens were larger also. We took advantage of the 72-hour transit visa in Beijing and had a wonderful time. Planning to return again in the future. The re-boarding in Beijing for our flight to Singapore was very easy because they have a check-in area for first and business class passengers. We took advantage of the Business Class lounge which had plentiful food and drinks. The return trip from Singapore via Beijing to Newark was even better. Check-in at the Singapore airport is in the first/business class lounge. Transit in Beijing was quick and allowed us to enjoy the Business class lounge again. We were hoping to get the same cabin crew for our trip to Newark but the new crew was just as hospitable and friendly and spoke English.

It took me almost 15 minutes to check in in Saigon. Both flights on time and even departed and arrived earlier than scheduled. The flights were on Boeing 737-700’s with only 8 seats in business of which 6 were taken on both legs. Aircraft were very old (eg. with ashtrays all over the place) but well maintained. Seats old recliners, but limited legspace on first row and limited recline on 2nd row due to the wall separation to economy class. Space in business class on a B737 is bit cramped if more than 4 people. Onboard, the style and service differ from many other airlines, and Air China may be disappointing if expectations are similar to those of other full-service carriers. However, I like the exotic, rigid, Chinese touch and the Chinese cuisine and service provided. Evening meals were good was good and plenty but the breakfast was only with a choice of noodles or porridge. Both mediocre. Predeparture drinks offered incl champagne Cattier Brut Icone. I got the smallest champagne glass that I have ever encountered (top-diameter only 3 cm!). However, refills were offered more than twice. Wines were only Chinese or substandard European brands, beers onboard only Yanjing was provided. Soft drinks plenty. Tea and coffee only from teabags and instant coffee. Cheese offered on the last sector, not the first. Chocolate not available. Flight Entertainment provided no options for selection and constituted merely a joke. Only a shared, microscopic ceiling screen of 25 x 20 cm was available per 4 pax. Earphones provided but are tiny and cheap substandards for business class. No amenity kit provided.

Flights on time, food was relatively good, they gave you 3 selections of main course and it was edible. Movies I do have to say was lacking a bit - Air China had about 5 new recent movies and everything else is a bit older or Chinese related movies. The airshow map was interesting as it tells you where you are and local cities around. But you cannot really complain if my plane ticket is £350! I could have flown with British Airways but the ticket was £550. The seat was surprisingly comfortable, they provided water in the flight twice.  The onward flight to Hong Kong from Beijing was a smaller plane, seats were slightly uncomfortable, quite hard and no entertainment on the seat. It was a 3.5 hour journey and they provided a full meal and 2 round of drinks. Cabin crew can be seen as rude, and their English is really bad.

Entertainment system has a 9"" 16:9 screen, but they have letterboxed all content in 4:3 format. The content is all 16:9 or cinematic so it displays using only about 1/4 of the screen area, so you end up watching what is effectively about a 4"" screen. - Entertainment system is not gate to gate - Movie selection is very poor, only a couple of new releases, and a small number of old movies, most of which are Chinese. Crew and captain make constant announcements, even in the middle of the night. e.g. at 3am they announced they would be coming through selling duty free, then at 4am they announced that we might like to watch an exercise video. Lights are left on too late on night flights. Midnight takeoff and lights were left on till about 3am. The cabin TV screen was also left on the whole flight which was glaring bright and unnecessary, should have been turned off when the lights were turned off. Sest pitch seemed smaller than normal. Air China website does not allow seat selection except if you purchased from air china website, so you end up in a seat lottery. Food quality was terrible, and quantity very small. Same meals served on all 3 flights I took (Chicken or beef with rice on every flight) Wine was undrinkable including Chinese wine. Air China lounge in Beijing is very poor, dirty, and run down. (Shanghai lounge is excellent) If you transfer in Shanghai with Air China you have to clear immigration, collect your bags, clear customs, go to check in, clear immigration, clear customs and clear security, which takes 1-3 hours depending on the immigration/security queues. Why can't they check bags through for international transfers like every other country/airline? Staff constantly bump into passengers in the aisle seats and seem to not care about this.

Flying Air China today felt like flying with one of the major airlines 10-15 years ago – perfectly acceptable, but these days there are much better options out there. I got an exceptionally good deal from London to Sydney via Beijing (return). The entertainment was mostly Chinese, but it’s a Chinese airline so that’s to be expected – and who doesn’t own a iPad etc these days? The food was pretty ordinary, kind of like airline food 10-15 years ago, but it did the trick. The seats were comfortable enough – in fact I don’t usually sleep too much on planes but got a fair bit of sleep on this journey. Checking in at Heathrow and Sydney was fine. And whilst Beijing airport is not great for a stopover compared to some other Asian airports, the Air China lounge made my 5 and 7 hour connections quite comfortable. The main issue I had with them was the flight crew who, whilst polite and helpful, were not as assertive with some of the passengers as they should have been. I too witnessed people sending text messages and using phone internet whilst the plane was taking off and landing. Some teenagers around me were having a pillow fight whilst we came into land at Beijing airport – no harm done, but throwing pillows around the cabin was a bit out of order. And the 4 times I landed, some passengers stood up to grab their bags almost as soon as the plane touched down. Not the flight crew’s fault, but I can imagine if it happened on Qantas or BA then one of the flight crew would have torn shreds out of these passengers. I’d definitely fly them again if I got a good deal. That being said, the only reason I flew them was the £400 return price and I would probably pay £550 if Thai/Malaysian/Cathay Pacific etc were available as an alternative. So if you are a good flyer, then I wouldn’t have any dramas flying them, just expect things to be a bit dated.

A quite inefficient security control anyhow: arrived in Bangkok, I discovered I had forgotten a hacksaw blade in one of my bags, and that it had not been spotted. I did not really appreciate having to pack my carry-on bags again in emergency in both flights. On my return, the connecting time being around midnight, the immigration control was understaffed, and finding one's way at Beijing airport was made unpleasant by the fact half the lights in the corridors were switched off.

It started all wrong from check-in. I was traveling with my 8 year old daughter and we had been given seats 10 rows apart. When I realised and tried to ask for help, the man at Air China desk could not utter 1 single word of English and gestured me towards some other women and walked off. Anyhow we were all sorted or so I thought. I am a vegetarian and had booked 2 veggie meals online and confirmed at the check in. Once on the plane, different story, no veggie meal, the staff was so rude and kept repeating beef or fish - no vegetarian but vegetables in the meal? I ended up eating the rice and the spicy broccoli, which left me with a bitter taste. The flight back was no better. We sat on our allocated seats, I could smell a lovely lemon spray with a vague touch of vomit. Thought nothing of it at first but when the floor felt squidgy it dawned on me that we were sitting right where someone had been sick and clearly it had been cleaned in a hurry. I tried to explain myself to the staff who could not understand a single word of English so ended up taking her to my seat and showed her the issue, the answer I got was ""aaaaahhhh"", which we all know is the usual response one gets from someone with great customer service skills. Anyhow I patiently waited until staff from business class turned up and ushered me and my daughter towards some other seats. No apologies given, just a gesture showing me where to sit. Needless to say that I am clearly put off by the lack of customer and general service provided by Air China and would not want to travel with them again. Some might say that this is what you get in economy class. I would simply respond that you cannot put a price on manners, understanding and sympathy.

For the most part nothing went wrong. The flight was delayed for one hour which actually suited me since I was running late to the airport. The flight to Beijing was full of empty seats so it was great to stretch out and really relax. There was no entertainment screens on the back of the seats but I didn't expect there to be for a 4-hour flight. I chose to eat some type of rice meal with veggies and cuts of ham (I think?) and it was nothing to write home about. I couldn't even finish it but you get what you pay for and for a $500 dollar ticket I wasn't complaining. When we got to Beijing the transition to our next flight was pretty simple since the layover was about 5 hours. When it was time to start boarding we squeezed into the bus and took a short ride over to the plane that'd be bringing us to Washing Dulles Int. This place did have entertainment on the back of each screens. I enjoyed the selection and it made the flight go quickly. As for the meals they offered chicken and rice and duck and rice. I chose the duck and it was ok, again nothing to brag about. If I had one thing I didn't like I'd say the time they made us wait to eat the second meal almost felt like torture. Next time I know to bring snacks along. The second meal I chose the beef and noodles and it was actually pretty good. The side was some dark chopped up root-type plant that had a flavor similar to seaweed (it was good). I didn't even bother to try and eat the last meal they handed out. It was a 3-set of sandwiches comprised of 1 tuna, 1 ham and 1 cheese. The turbulence never got too bad, the staff were constantly moving around to assist people and most importantly the flight got us from point A to B safe and sound. Again you get what you pay for and I'd like to think I got my moneys worth.

First of all, the crew from the ticket counter to the airline stewardesses were rude. During the 13 hour flight, the food was disgusting and I was provided the equivalent of 2 dixie cups of water. When I asked for 2 more cups of water, I was told I was only allowed 1! When I asked the second time, I was told to go into the galley and get it myself. I have never been treated with such disrespect. On the way there, in my weariness from traveling 32 hours, I left my tablet in the seat pocket. When I called the airline once I got to the hotel and realized it was missing, I was told that it was not their responsibility and that I would have to deal with the Phuket airport. I called them and of course no one spoke english. Upon returning to the airport at the end of my trip, there was zero Air China customer service attendants to be found and their office was empty. To add insult to injury, while in Bejing on my 1 hour layover, the ticket attendant literally yelled at me and fellow passengers that we were 'slow' and needed to 'hurry up' to make our next flight to JFK - our plane had just arrived! Once getting to JFK, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I had to go to the Lufthansa counter to report my lost luggage becausee (surprise!) no Air China employees could be located. I was told that nothing was in the system tracking my bag and now, 4 days later, my bag is still no where to be found. I can't even file a missing bag claim with Air China because there is no customer service number and in order to file, you must mail or fax (what is this, 1980?) to a number that is provided by the local lost and found office which is unobtainable because no one answers the phone at JFK lost and found and no one returns calls.

The cabin was relatively spacious in 3-3-3 layout, better than Emirates who use 3-4-3. The IFE system was pretty good with an alright selection of movies. Not as many as you might have on Emirates, BA etc but enough hollywood movies in English to entertain you for an 11 hour flight. There are about twice as many Chinese films as there are English. On my outbound the showcase film was Star Wars VII and on return it was The Revenant: a better selection than expected. Each seat came with a blanket and a pillow - the pillow was comfortable. Food was ok, choices of one meat with rice or a different meat with noodles and for breakfast a choice of Chinese (congee etc) or Western (omelette etc). The food and drink selection has nothing on other airlines but you get what you pay for. Flight were on time and flight attendants were attentive with good English and regular water services. On the return trip they lost my luggage in PEK. The bag was delivered to my home 4 days later but I had to make the calls to HKG and PEK Air China baggage offices to chase it up as the agent in London couldn't tell me even if the bag made it on the first flight.

My onward flight to Tokyo was similarly good but without the inflight entertainment. Have to say that after 11 hours in economy my posterior was starting to complain. I kept waiting for bad stuff I'd read about to occur and it never did. Maybe I got lucky but I thought it was great value for the money I paid.

The crew remained calm, willing to serve passengers, and tried to keep the toilets usable, the upgrade to premium economy on the Beijing to Moscow sector meant extra legroom. Manila-Beijing sector was on a basic Boeing 737-800, while the A330-300 used on the return leg had comfortable seats, AVOD with reasonable content, and crew that aimed to please.

The flight itself was not too bad, a bit old and dated, not the best food and the entertainment system was pretty useless (poor selection of movies/ shows, and was only working intermittently), however, nothing I can't put up with for the duration of 24 hours to get a cheap flight. My nightmare experience begun when Air China sent me a change of schedule email for my return flight, which is in July, which did not fit with when I needed to be back in Europe so I called the Australian number provided on their website, to change my ticket. Nowhere is it stated that it is a very expensive pay number, so I ran out of credit while waiting in the phone queue before I even got to talk to anyone. I somehow managed to find a free phone number which operates between 10am-5pm, but calling this number means you're connected to somewhere else in the world (they must not have an Australian office??) where conveniently enough it's always night time and no supervisors or managers are present. Dealing with the call center staff is painful as the vast majority of them are incompetent and give conflicting information, the night staff seem particularly unable to answer any questions and are generally useless. It took me six weeks and over ten calls, not to mention how much phone credit, to change my flight, and all but the last person I spoke to blamed the Beijing office. Strangely the last person I spoke to managed to change and confirm my new ticket within five minutes. She was obviously one of those rare people who actually knew what she was doing. Three weeks later I got an automated email informing me that the second leg of my return trip, Beijing-Copenhagen, had been cancelled, just like that! No information on why or what to do to get a refund - nothing!! Again I called the AU Air China call centre, was advised that I'd get a full refund because Air China was responsible for the cancellation, it would take 3-4 weeks to process though. A confirmation email was supposed to be sent to me but never arrived so I called again a few days later, they blamed my email and then proceded to tell me that the first person I had spoken to was wrong to say that I'd get a full refund- that was up to the Beijing office. Long story short, over the past 8 weeks I have spoken to five different people who have all given me different information about how much I'll be refunded and when. All of them failed to inform me of/ send me the refund form that apparently has to be filled out in order for them to start processing the refund. I only found that out yesterday when I spent $20 on a 10 minute international call to try to get hold of a supervisor or manager to complain about this ordeal. The latest news is that I will (probably) be refunded for the second leg of the flight (Beijing- Copenhagen) but not for the one from Melbourne to Beijing as that is still departing according to schedule!? So I should go to Beijing and be stuck there, or only get a partial refund? It will also take at least 7-8 weeks before any money gets paid back into my account. So for someone like me, who doesn't have a lot of money, I had to borrow money to buy a new ticket with Thai Airways so that I can get home for my holiday, I have spent way too much time and money trying to sort this out and still have to wait two months before I potentially get any money back.

What is disappointing was the quality of the meals. I have seldom tasted such bland food and the presentation was horrible. Before take-off only orange juice and water were served. Wines (good selection of French wines) were excellent but must have been very expensive because there was no second serving nor were liquors offered at the end of the meal. Another drawback was the total absence of reading materials in English or in French except a few China Daily newspapers. A large proportion of the offered movies were oldies.

Hongzouh to Beijing was canceled. The company announced the flight was canceled two hours before the departure. Until then the flight was scheduled as normal. The reason for canceling the flight was the disruption of the air signalling system caused by the launch of a space ship. The launch was scheduled to take place at 6.30 pm. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 8.00 pm. Eventually two other passengers and I managed to get the last three seats on to another flight to Beijing.

Landing in Beijing was on time. The main concern that I had was the customs / metal detector line where you pass through to the International Departures area. It was apparent from my observations that Air China has sold a lot of International to International flights going through Beijing Airport to the point where China Customs has too many international transfer people to check which leads to a delay. I wouldn't fault China Customs as they had every one of the four international transfer desks open. After customs an even bigger delay occurred at the metal detector area for International transfers which only had one of the two counters open. Because of the aforementioned delays I made it to my JFK flight just as it began boarding. My wife who flew two weeks after I did missed her connection to JFK because Hong Kong was in the midst of a typhoon. It took Air China a while to process her for the next day's flight and put her in a hotel. When my wife arrived at the hotel she was surprised to be informed that Air China was going to put her in a room with a roommate and subsequently paid an extra USD$24 to get her own room. Flying back from JFK was pleasant and we arrived on time in Beijing. There is no plug-in point for a laptop or iPad so my battery died halfway through the flight. The aircraft does not have personal screens in the Economy Section.

Seats no worse than many other airlines in economy - maybe an inch more than some. Food quality ok. Wine only served at end of main meal! Staff fine. Loos ok. Entertainment a bit limited and one seat back terminal ropey and you need the double mono adapter. Flights all pretty much on time. Beijing transfer is a bit tricky first time - go to the ""transfer passenger"" queue on the far right of all other queues looks slow but works ok then down escalator and back through security.

At check in and subsequently on flight we were reassured that all information and assistance would be given at Beijing. We arrived just before 4am - there were no Air China Staff on duty and no directions as to where we should go eventually we found our way to the International Duty Manager's desk which did not open until 5.30am. Once Air China Staff arrived they initially refused to speak to us or offer any assistance. About six hours after arrival waiting going between desks collecting luggage we were given a box of food and a milk drink and checked in on a flight Frankfurt. The flights themselves were cheap adequate and clean Cabin Crew were polite but had difficulty communicating in English. I was disappointed with the poor service shown by Air China airport staff and their lack of honesty in communicating what was to be expected at Beijing especially in view that the situation in Beijing was beyond their control and would not have involved a loss of face despite their poor management and lack of skill in dealing with an adverse situation.,nan,2.0,nan

On arrival in Beijing a Chinese man with a sign gave us a sticker and a friendly couple explained to us we were being put up in a hotel overnight because there were no connecting flights until the next day. We followed the sign man and queued for immigration after finally getting through sign man had vanished. A number of passengers were also left behind and approached the Air China information desk. After hearing our problem both employees went and did not return. A representative was sent to meet us and after waiting a couple of hours we were taken to our hotel. The hotel was pretty gross and breakfast inedible however it was provided at no extra cost. The next morning a bus was provided to take us to the airport. After queuing for almost 3 hours we were issued boarding passes. Onboard the plane staff unfriendly and unable to smile. The food was poor. Finally we arrived in London after travelling for 28 hours. Our flight back was a bit better as we were only delayed by 9 hours in Beijing! Although our experience was fairly negative I would like to praise the check-in staff in London and Hong Kong as they were quite friendly.,nan,2.0,nan

The new-ish business class lounge at Gatwick (North Terminal) is excellent for a short stay but perhaps not the best if you have a 3 or four hour lay-over. Aircraft was A330-200 seat 13L. Cabin was a little tired but was still in reasonable condition. The seat cushions were a little firm but the space and width were reasonable. I was worried that the full recline/flat bed was not actually going to be flat but it was and was very comfortable for a sleep. Supplied also with pyjamas and quilt for a snooze. Staff very attentive and there was no need to request drinks or top- ups as these were forthcoming throughout the flight. The Chinese meal was good but a little tasteless. A bit more variety and freshness may have improved it a bit. The AVOD completely froze for my seat and was never rectified throughout. However glancing at the programmes and films on offer I did not miss much as it was very dated. Punctuality excellent. Beijing T3 is not the easiest to change flights within and there is no channels for business class to speed up the process. As there were several flights arriving there was a very long queue of at least 200 waiting for the immigration check (although it was just a check to then be allowed in to the area for security - where there was another queue). Flight to UB was fine - with only 8 business class seats and two staff for the section we were very well looked after.,nan,4.0,nan

When the flight boarded passengers came with numerous bags giving no regard to any of the printed limits or specifications on size or weight of carry-on items. The food selection was of significantly low quality. The aircraft itself was dated and seats were below average in terms of comfort.

Very comfortable lie flat bed as I slept 5 hours out of the 6 hour flight. The food was plentiful but not very good quality and drinks selection limited. The flight attendants were actually quite good and attentive but they lacked product knowledge as four staff unable to work out how to lift the TV screen and the economy passengers were let to rush into exit on disembarkation!

However our flight to Beijing was delayed for reportedly ‘weather reasons’ although when we arrived in Beijing with a delay of 4 hours there were no signs of any bad weather. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight to Europe. In the arrival hall all all service desk were closed and unstaffed despite around 40 people also missing their connecting flights with Air China. The flight attendants from our flight made the effort to call some service staff and left us. After 1 hour of waiting no one had turned up. We eventually made our way into the departure area (without having visas for China) where all Air China counters were also unstaffed. The one staff member we found was unable/unwilling to help us and advised us that Air China service desks would open at 6:30am (4 hours later). Rather than getting a hotel room meal vouchers assistance in booking to connecting flights and most importantly an apology as is standard service with every other airline we had no choice other than finding a bench in the departure hall and try to sleep there. There were families with babies/small children travelling with us and had to do the same. At 6:30am all stranded passengers queued for the service counter which also could not/refused to help us and referred us to the ticketing counter which would open an hour later. When it eventually opened the staff suggested booking us to the next flight to Munich which would depart 18 hours later. I said that was unacceptable and asked to be booked on a Lufthansa flight to Munich (4 hours later). Lufthansa and Air China are both in the Star Alliance and I assumed it was standard practice to use partner airlines to get passengers to their final destinations as quickly as possible in those circumstances. However she refused to book us on Lufthansa. I had to make the suggestion to fly via Dusseldorf (7hours later with Air China) which was reluctantly arranged. We then had to pick up our luggage and check it in again. This involved another 1.5 hours of waiting time with the result that after receiving dismissive and rude answers from baggage staff we were informed that both our bags had gone missing. We filled in the missing luggage report which took so long that it was too late to go to the hotel that Air China eventually offered (although fellow travellers reported that Air China expected random people to share rooms!). We arrived in Munich with a delay of over 17 hours. We have emailed Air China asking for feedback on the terrible experience we have made but after over one month we still have not received a response. Throughout our trip Air China staff were rude dismissive and at the first moment keen to say ""this isn't my responsibility"".",nan,1.0,nan

For lunch they offer a choice of 4 main courses plus a 'daily special selection'. All food is served on one large tray separate serving of appetizers etc. would probably be too time consuming. Quantity and quality fully acceptable so is the presentation and the cabin crews general service standard. In beverages Air China highlights a choice of 7 different teas 4 coffees.

Transit in Beijing was good arrived and departed from hard stands business class passengers had their own minibus to take them to and from the terminal.

Upon boarding we both noticed that the FA’s were very nice and extremely helpful to us. Aircraft was either new or had been refurbished because everything was spotless. After takeoff the FA’s began there services. The drinks available were limited. The most popular American whiskey in the world was not available so we had to accept lesser things.

But after almost every one went in an attendant followed to clean up and replace loo roll etc. Space between seats was more than ample with at least 10 inches between your knees and the seat in front and even when the person in front put their seat back the seat wasn't right in your face.

The crew seemed uninterested the food was nothing special and beverages extremely limited and served out of sync with food. Beijing to Sydney on a Boeing 777-300. The plane was ok but service identical to the one we had between Stockholm and Beijing. Very disappointing. On return a Boeing 777-300 from Sydney to Beijing. The experience was repeated. Service was very disappointing and beverages served late and very limited except for water. Beijing to Stockholm an Airbus A330. Legroom was more limited than the former A330 and selection of audio/video very limited. Service was somewhat better and beverages was served right after food however very limited. On the positive side was the opportunity to use the Air China transit lounge however this did not compensate for the low quality service.

Travelling for work all I really want is the cheapest business class seat that I can find for overnight flights to China there are few options reasonably priced. Air China's offering on A330 equipment is an older style seat but is virtually flat and with plenty of space. It was set quite low to the ground so was easy to hop over the person adjacent when going to the toilet. Food below average for business class and AVOD was limited with mostly older films. Didn't really matter too much when I slept most of the 11.5hrs each way. Flight crew were efficient and polite but characterless.

Overall if I was flying business class I would choose Air China again if the time and price was right. My return flight in PEK-LAX was in economy. Again 777-300 hard product (seat) which includes in-seat power plug for your laptop was quite good but the seat pitch was borderline acceptable. The IFE system is good AVOD but lacks enough current Western content. That aside I would not recommend Air China economy to anyone because of the quality of the food.

After the second hot meal sandwiches were distributed for passengers to snack on for the remainder of the flight. Entertainment was a good selection of movies on individual screens. Pushed on time to the minute and landed forty mins late due to headwinds. Only complaint is almost all pax on Air China are Chinese and hence all have visas which means each pax takes longer for US immigration - which can be interminable at the best of times - will take an hour unless you're one of the first off the plane.

Later in the flight I produced my phone / tablet (which was in flight mode) to check the time. I now realise I shouldn't have but the guy sitting beside me became aggressive in an animated fashion. I requested a move which the cabin staff to their credit quickly agreed to. Their English was extremely poor. I flew a total of four 8+ hour flights with the airline in the past month (Sydney - Beijing - Frankfurt - Shanghai - Sydney). The food was variable ranging from quite poor to somewhat edible and the Chinese red wine was sour and undrinkable. My main issue was uncivilised fellow travellers - I almost lost count of the amount of times I was pushed / shoved or cut in front of in queues during this experience. In addition when transferring through Shanghai I had to collect my luggage and re-check in mid way - they could not transfer my luggage directly from Frankfurt to Sydney.

Initially the blame was levelled at tardy passengers that meant we lost our place in the queue. Then the weather. This is while other aircraft were taking off and landing. Of course the delay meant we missed our connecting flight. Again information had to be squeezed out of the staff. The layover was at a local hotel.

Agree with comments about the food a bit hit and miss and strange that you have to say which of the wines you want when you order from the menu also a bit odd to make your choice for the meal served just before landing before you actually take off.

Mostly it was a pleasant trip with good service. A330 was in good condition. A few scuff marks at feet level. Bathrooms were clean throughout. Captain spoke excellent English and FA announcements were clear English. Requests to FAs were mostly understood. Service when the call button was pressed was very prompt. Meals were fine. Presentation was a bit naff but food OK. The seat was good the design made me think of J in Lufthansa. I worked the whole trip so didn't try it as a bed. Access to the power point and headphone socket was fiddly under an armrest. The overhead light was not accurately aimed at the table. Amenity pack was OK. Mostly working so not much time for AVOD. Video feed quality was excellent. Headphones not noise cancelling but adequate. LHR-PEK - Departed on time. Good quality pyjamas provided and the bed comfortable. Blanket a bit on the small size. Meal service was fine. Choice of movies was OK. Headphones were very good with noise cancellation. PEK-MEL - First time trying PEK as a transit. Not good. Arrived in T3. After walking about a kilometre reached the transit desk. Half an hour later I was through. Had to take the train then finally get to the domestic lounge. Was called to the gate but stood for 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the plane. Plane to Melbourne was via Pudong. Lunch was OK then arrived at PVG. A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane. All in all I came away with perception of 4 star service for the air portion. 2 stars for the transit service at PEK maybe 2.5 stars for transit at PVG.

It was however like a Turkish Airlines long haul business class seat but with more privacy. Male flight attendant was very kind and nice but definitely needs a touch up on grooming while female flight attendants were immaculate in grooming but need a brush up on service skills. Bizarre meal combination with Chinese spicy chicken and prawn served with Risotto. Whole service lacks refinement and sophistication of other airlines but very efficient. Return check in at Pudong was fast and friendly. Did not have time to visit their lounge. Flight was operated by an old A330 but still with a seat that turns into a full flat bed. Did not eat and slept for a good 8 hours. Cabin crew on this sector were all attentive and very friendly. English did not seem to be a problem on the flights I took as others experienced.

Security at T3 something of a nightmare each checkpoint (of which there are about twenty) has it's own line which pass through a barrier and when joining the line it's impossible to see but every other checkpoint is staggered so the checkpoint might be just on the other side of the barrier in which case there are about five people ahead of you or it's much further away in which case there are thirty people ahead of you and the difference is worth about an extra twenty minutes. One last complaint about the airport at least in summer - it's incredibly hot so despite preparing for comfort on a long flight one always boards sweaty and uncomfortable which is rather awful. The route has been upgraded in July to a Boeing 777-300ER. Boarding smooth with a final security check in the jetbridge reducing congestion at the aircraft door. Every seat was filled except the one separating me from my neighbour which was lucky. Pushed on time and made a smooth takeoff and climb. Meal service was tasty and hot chinese seafood and noodles. Air China still have one terrible habit of (even on a daylight flight) insisting - at times rudely - that all window blinds are closed. Why on earth is this? It's an all-day flight that arrives late afternoon a lot of sleep in flight is actually quite counterproductive to beating jetlag. I opened it an inch to enjoy the sights of Russia enough to see out but not enough to incur the wrath of the cabin crew who were kind and laid-back on every other issue - top up a drink? an extra bread roll? no problem. Want to look out the window on a daylight flight? I enjoyed the excellent on- demand entertainment options which included plenty of first-rate western movies. Second meal service was another tasty hot meal as we left Russian airspace. Landed on time at Heathrow. Baggage claim was pretty quick.

I fly frequently and my experience was the worst. First time I flew with them because of price and second time because I had to book a seat very late and could not find another airline.

In addition horrible food (tasteless boiled shrimps on rice no dessert) champagne without bubbles (bottle must have been opened many times and kept warm). Only highlights: decent toilet kit friendly attendants good schedule for connecting flights from Beijing (only reason for me to take this flight.

Some had new seats some had old seats some had seatback entertainment on demand (others on loop). Planes showed a little age but nothing worrisome. Onboard product varied greatly. Many delays due to ATC in Beijing. That meant maybe 30 mins to 1 hr of just waiting to take off for a gate you name it. The cabin crew and pilots did their best to keep everyone informed though. The cabin crew was polite and welcoming. As they were short flights I never had to ask for anything. They spoke basic English but oddly on ICN-PEK and return only one attendant spoke Korean over the PA only (pax about 50/49 Chinese/Korean and 1% Westerner). Airline food is not supposed to be gourmet in economy but Air China's food was completely inedible. Dry noodles that stuck together no sauce no flavor just horrible. Normally I can eat all of my food but I definitely just left it untouched. All flights were short (under 3 hours) so the seat was comfortable and didn't cause any problems. AVOD selection was limited to perhaps one or two recent western movies some really old western movies and lots and lots of Chinese selections. The price was right for this trip (500 USD) at peak vacation time in Korea. We only had one layover in PEK on the return to ICN. It was quick and painless. I'd fly Air China again.,nan,3.0,nan

The bag was on his lap disguising the fact that he was not wearing his seat belt. I asked him to put his seat belt on and his comment was ""relax"". Same thing happened on landing - they didn't check his seat belt. A friend who was seated in a bulkhead seat said a bag was in front of her on the floor during take off and landing. I had to completely unpack my case at check in because the scanner at check in had identified something (it was the plug of my travel kettle!). Check in staff were most unhelpful and officious.

The majority of people on the plane were Chinese and non English speakers who queued up to board when there was some indication we would soon be boarding. The ground staff announced in English that we would be boarding from the rear of he plane and started to announce a range of rows. The people who had gotten in line saw people from the rear rows trying to board and started pushing to board because they thought people were cutting in line.

The Singapore legs used clean new planes with excellent entertainment systems. The longer London legs were both on a very old plane. It was clean but decidedly tatty. The food on all legs was unappetising and fell well short of any other airline food that I have ever had. Cold drinks were offered but we had to work hard to get anything other than orange juice or apple juice. There was very limited wine and my requests for tea or coffee were met from the trolley but not graciously. All of the above were not deal breakers but the following are - the old London-Beijing planes were very uncomfortable. The seats were old and tatty and the entertainment system was atrocious. If it worked it was extremely complicated and mine didn't work at all on the outbound leg. To add insult to injury a black box linked to the entertainment system was placed under the seat in front of you and this severely limited leg room and forced anybody with normal length legs to sit on a twist. The Singapore plane was more comfortable so would be put to far better use on the longer flight to London as ten hours is far to long to sit in a crooked seat on a tatty old plane. The cabin staff were very task orientated and not people focused. I didn't find them friendly and they were uncomfortably cold.,nan,3.0,nan

The airline's website is a joke (booking flights there often doesn't work at all or is as complicated as applying for a tax refund). Flight experience itself - there have been improvements over the years but only gradually. The food for example is still one of the worst you can get.

It creates a very comfortable lie-flat bed and comes with a large fluffy duvet and large pillow - making for very restful sleep. Cabin crew was friendly attentive and hard-working albeit robotic programmed and not proactive in responding to passenger needs/desires. Food was decent - about average for international business class. Wine list was decent too but crew served white wine and champagne warm. We had to constantly ask for refills of wine and water in very small glasses. Air China would do well to learn the fine points of premium service from Star Alliance partner Asiana. Inflight entertainment had handful of American movies/TV but an understandably heavy emphasis on Chinese entertainment offerings.

Having said this we were pleasantly surprised at the service food and the cabin. Both flights were without a doubt the best trip I've had. Comfortable beds totally lie flat in Airbus around 30 in business class so it was extremely quiet and personal. Toilets were always clean FA were attentive whilst they may have had difficult in speaking fluent English we got by. Inflight entertainment was the only drawback in terms of selection not up to date movies but nonetheless there was something you could see. As this was a night trip I enjoyed the sleeping arrangement more. We had a layover in Beijing to break the trip. The other leg to London plane was newer and business class had about 80 people so I think the attentiveness from FA was a little less but that's understandable again food bed and toilets were great.

The toilets on each flight were not clean when I got on the flight nor were they cleaned during the flight. No Movies on demand. The air hostess doing the English announcements was impossible to understand. Wanted us to buy duty free but there were no duty free brochure in the seat pocket on any sector.

The staff aren't overly friendly but then I refuse to fly BA because of their staff. The food was a bit grim but find me an airline where it isn't. The inflight entertainment on the PEK-LHR route was ok (there was no entertainment on the PEK-REP section).

I happened upon cheap flights for the festive period so was not expecting too much especially after reading negative reviews. How wrong I was to presume. The return flight was much fuller than the outward flight however on both legs boarding and feedings were performed with a minimum of fuss. Longest wait was for an over packed young couple at Heathrow followed by a wait time for take off at Beijing. Hardly anything to complain about.

Seats for YVR-PEK return was selected at booking time however when confirming flight info of trip at later date no seats assigned as there was a change in aircraft - this resulted in having seats in less desirable area of the aircraft. Confirmation was obtained regarding return flight info for departure time and seat assignment. The outgoing flight to Bangkok was on schedule. In cabin service was fair - they did not go out of their way to offer water or snacks on a 13+ hour flight - passengers had to serve themselves the majority of the time. Meals offered were edible. Return flight from Bangkok was a complete nightmare. Arrived at Bangkok airport at 4am for a 6.10 am scheduled flight to Beijing - no listing of flight - it took over an hour to find someone who eventually advised us that the flight had been rescheduled to 1.50 am that morning and that we missed our flight. Advised that we would have to deal with Air China rep who will show up around 11.45 am to check in passengers for a 2.20 pm flight. Attempts were made to make contact with Air China in North America and Beijing - no success 7+ hours later the ticket wicket opens however no Air China rep shows up until numerous requests were made. Another hour goes by before boarding passes are issued for BKK-PEK. Required to fly standby for the remainder of the trip which resulted in an overnight stay in Beijing. Attempt to obtain boarding passes for PEK-PVR and was advised we missed our flight>had to explain the whole scenario again - after 45 min boarding passes were issued and advised we have no seats from YVR-YEG and will probably have to overnight again. Client service provided in YVR was excellent ticket agent met us at the gate upon arrival and ushered us through customs and to the Air Canada kiosk for the issuance of the final boarding pass to YEG. I will definitely not fly with Air China again It is not worth the frustration I had to encounter trying to rectify a situation that resulted from them changing departure time without advising their clients.

I couldn't seem to check-in online prior to my flight but check-in at the airport and boarding all went smoothly. The planes were clean and comfortable enough and the flight attendants regularly offered drinks including beer and wine. Although there was not a huge range there were a few decent films and TV shows to choose from for the in-flight entertainment. I had downloaded plenty of programmes to watch on my iPad anyway and I'm pleased I did. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. There was a bit of a language barrier but their English was good enough to get by without much difficulty. The food was a bit hit and miss (some of it I couldn't eat and I'm not usually a fussy eater) so I'd suggest taking some snacks.

Nothing was communicated by the airline the time just mysteriously changed from 14.30 to 16.10. When the staff were asked about it they either pretended to not speak English or just didn't. No apology was issued on the flight. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the flight was due to take off so no excuses there. We already had an 8 hour stopover so the extra couple of hours wasn't welcome when our total journey time was already 30+ hours. The entertainment system didn't work at all on my seat - not good for an 11 hour flight. Didn't matter as I had my iPhone loaded up with videos / music except Air China won't let you use your phone on the flight even with flight mode switched on!

How is there no wifi capabilities on such a long flight? Lastly they don't come around and pick up trash. I think it was 10 hrs in when they brought a bag around. By the time the flight is finished there is a pile of trash by your feet. Granted I was in coach. The 1st and Biz class looked very nice and I'm sure a very different experience.

As predicted our luggage was not on the carousel. We went to Lost and Found where several staff just stand and chat. With less than 30 minutes to board our flight we were still without bags. Thankfully the lady at check-in (who did speak English and showed compassion) organised our connection located our luggage and had it transferred. On the return journey a week later the flight was delayed which meant that we did miss our plane to London. Air China organised an overnight stay. At Beijing airport we got to the check in desk to collect boarding passes. One would imagine that the person manning the London flights would have some command of the English language. This person did not speak nor comprehend a word of English. Both times we did not receive our requested vegetarian meals and were abruptly given bread rolls as a substitute. The seats are cramped and offer little leg room in economy class. The meals are unimaginative. The only good thing I can say is that soft drinks were available on request.

Once there there was very little communication. Eventually our flight did go around 6 hours later. My major points with the airline: Very few staff members spoke English and those who did had communication level. Staff members also gave conflicting information about the delayed flight and were unable to answer most questions in English. All major communications were given in English but it was broken and often very confusing. Inflight the staff were not very friendly would barely make eye contact. Inflight meals were poor. The second meal they gave two options I chose the chicken option and it turned out to be the exact same meal they had served earlier. Inflight video quality is poor and screens cannot be dimmed which makes watching movies overnight very hard on the eyes. I would not recommend travelling with this airline.,nan,3.0,nan

The meal options were limited but the food wasn't bad. The only think I will warn is that if you're on a long flight and you don't like Chinese food don't take this flight because that's what you'll be served throughout the entirety of the flight. Chinese food is okay to me but it did get tiresome eating just that.

As a Star Alliance carrier we used United First lounge at LHR T2. 777 was clean/new bed and pyjamas comfortable amenity kit akin to US carriers' international Business class. Food was pretty average (JAL economy on subsequent flight was better tasting) wine list ok but limited whisky etc. I avoided the instant coffee. Cabin nice and quiet only 4 pax in First both ways. Glad we weren't in fully-crammed Business class. Staff on LHR-PEK were decent but hard to get a smile return from PEK-LHR food was much better and FAs much friendlier. As others have noted IFE is on-demand but somewhat limited English options. I know it's Air China but they should take a page from other Asian airlines e.g. JAL who have tons of international film/TV options. First Class lounge in Beijing is pretty poor: self-serve bar but no ice or lemon etc so don't even bother trying to make a gin & tonic just pour yourself a glass of warm white Chinese wine and whimper in a corner. Beijing Capital Airport is a beautiful Norman Foster building but don't ever transit internationally in Beijing. Unlike pretty much every airport on Earth you have to go through Chinese immigration just for connecting flights (it's a separate queue but still). We had a full two hour connection and spent nearly 1h45m just waiting to get the passport stamp to then go straight back through security. Incredibly inefficient and infuriating. No special/fast track for First class and no staff seemed to care that the delays were making everyone miss their long-haul connections. On balance CA First is slightly better than BA Club but below VS Upper Class. However for 25k fewer miles than VS to Asia it felt like a fair trade.

Both are national carrier of their respective countries, however, the difference is obvious. I just want to mention some main points: 1) The crews are not really warm nor patient, which happens to almost all Air China flights I have taken. I am not sure whether it's because majority of the passengers are Chinese. I am not going comment on the behavior of the passengers themselves, as a service provider, the least you have to do is smile and be courteous. On the other hand, I can't say all Etihad crews are excellent, but I have encountered some who are really sincere and hospitable. 2) The entertainment system is really outdated, the control is not sensible any more and the movies are really lame. On the contrary, Etihad has a great selection of movies and easy to use system. Besides, it has considerably provided each passenger a small pouch with an eye mask, a toothbrush with toothpaste, a pair of ear plugs plus a pair of socks.

During our first flight with Air China from Australia to Beijing, I asked to have a replacement of food from steak to chicken, thinking it was less spicy, and I received a chicken meal prepared with extra cardamom. I asked the flight attendant about it and he said that all customers that returned their first meal get the 2nd meal with an extra spice taste!

When we book the ticket, the airline told our agent it is not any issue. This is a lie. On the way to China, flight attendants told us that we need to get our baggage in Beijing and then return them for the transfer (this is fine, and we do this when we get to US). When we arrived, the help desk woman near the baggage claim said the same thing. However, we waited and waited, but our luggage never came out. We asked the attendant who supervises the baggage claim, she said they will be directly sent to the final destination. Of course, we missed our connection flight.

Later, I found out they should have paid our lodging since this was their fault. Of course, they forgot to mention this. On the way back to US, our flight from Hefei was delayed for 24 hours. Basically, Beijing Airport did not allow any flights to get in that day. So after notifying us the flight had no departure time, no one from Air China showed up to assist or answer any questions. We were kept waiting and waiting. After sitting in the airport for 8 hours, finally two low-rank Air China staff showed up and could not solve anything. When the passengers got upset and asked to see the supervisor, one of the staff said the manager does not work on weekends, instead she got four security guards! We and two fellow passengers had international flights at Beijing, and were stuck. We called the airline help desk, they said they are not responsible for anything and cannot make any changes since we bought our tickets from an agent. If we need to change, we need to go to Beijing. Essentially, if you are not at Beijing, you are screwed in any emergency situations. Once we got to Beijing 24 hours later, the staff at the counter were rude, unsympathetic, and unorganized. There were so many passengers who missed flights, and Air China had only 2 staff members to deal with the passengers. If you do not insist on them providing a solution, they just brush you aside. We had to stand before them for 2 hours before it can be finally resolved. Overall, if you could, do not take Air China, the service for emergencies such as delay, particular in any other cities, is non-existing.

We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it.

Did not hear the Captain speak for this long stretch, and crew's English announcements can be hard to hear. Flights to and from TPE: Breakfast appeared to be simpler. Captain did give announcement for this stretch. Wifi IFE is available for flights to and from TPE, but Air China specifically bars mobile phones from accessing this system. If you don't have a laptop, you are probably out of luck. Premium economy seats are empty, and are basically the same economy seats on SYD-PEK (channel-based IFE). ATC delayed 1.5 hours both directions. Overall a decent value for money, if you have China on your visit list and don't really mind about the IFE.

Alternatives on this route will be EVA air, for example. Worst customer service, delayed flights that will screw up your entire trip, terrible rules in Beijing airport. For example, once the first leg was delayed and screwed up our plan to get out of the airport and spend a day in Beijing, we tried to get on the earlier flight to San Francisco to avoid spending 6 hours on the airport. The staff at the gate refused to even talk to us. They said we need to get out through immigration and customs, go to the Air China ticket office and talk to them to get on a standby. Seriously? Did you try going through security in China? They take out every battery and examine it manually. Also, if they didn't have any seats, we'd have to go through security and check in process for our original flight again. Once you finally make it to your flight, there is no use of mobile devices, even when in the airplane mode. My 6 years old daughter wasn't allowed to watch movies or play games on her inactive old iPhone (basically an iPod). Flight attendants do not smile, they are rude, answer no to any request.

The first leg from Tokyo to Beijing, a flight attendant decided she didn't like me, sternly telling me no when I tried to tell her I didn't need the China customs ticket, and then passed me over for headphones among other rude behavior. This flight from Beijing to New York seemed to be off to a much better start. I had paid for upgraded seating and was excited to not have to sit in the back of the plane and be somewhere a little quieter, less turbulent, and easier to exit from, since I had to quickly exit the airport and make it home at a reasonable hour for work the next morning. While the plane rolled away for take off, a flight attendant asked us to move to the very last seats in the plane - row 62 by the tail and next to the bathrooms. The reasoning was that seat next to us had been double booked, so they upgraded that passenger to the upper deck. The new passenger in that seat was a girl of about 6 years old. The mother stood by because she had bought the three tickets spread all over the plane, but they wanted to sit together. So naturally we were asked to move. Instead of also offering us an upgrade, I got worse seats than the ones I had been assigned when I originally bought the ticket. They would not help with the refund procedure and ignored me. I spend 12 hours sleepless through turbulence (the tail end is bad, with not just shaking, but sea-like waving back and forth) children running down the aisles screaming, children crying due to turbulence, people lined up leaning on the backs of our seats for the bathroom. The bathroom constantly in use (I have never seen the cabin washrooms so consistently occupied or so disgusting), and flight attendants yelling at other passengers who were out of their seats when they were asked not to be. I've never heard a flight attendant actually ""shout"" at passengers before. They were unapologetic about making us move, although the mom did thank us, and I made zero fuss other than mentioning I paid extra for those seats and asking what I should do. I fly a lot and never experienced anything like this. I don't have high standards and I know what true economy is - the plane was nice, new and included more amenities than expected, but the service was very poor and the passengers were downright vile on this flight. We weren't allowed to power phones on ever which is unusual and cut back on what I could do to pass the time, since I loaded my phone with entertainment.    ⚑ ",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

I was with a travel group and the travel agent booked the trip. First of all, if you call the customer service line to pick your seat and have a meal preference, prepare to be on hold for almost an hour, pressing “1” every 7 minutes in order to stay on hold and not be disconnected and also be prepared to speak to a Chinese person that speaks little English. I had to call back 3 times and stay on hold forever before I got someone that spoke okay English. At this time I request a vegetarian meal as well and was told seat assignment and meal would be sent in a confirmation email. I never got an email. Needless to say, on the flight from Houston to Beijing, I did not have my vegetarian meal, neither did others in the group that requested one, and we all called within the time limit they request. I didn’t have a problem flying with the airline in general, until the return flight from Beijing to Houston. It was terrible enough to make me not want to fly Air China again. Another reviewer said they take your water and other drinks at the terminal before you board the plane back to Houston and they do! I was wondering what the security was doing when they came marching military style in four rows of two into the terminal (about to search bags and take drinks). I’m glad I heeded this warning. But once you get on the flight, good luck getting the flight attendants to bring you something to drink. There was a Chinese NBA players sitting behind me in economy (not joking), the whole team was on the plane, and he must have been 7 feet tall. I had an aisle seat, so one of his feet was nearly on the foot rest with mine, and the other leg was behind me with the knee jabbing me in the back. So I couldn’t recline my seat or try to relax for the 14 hour flight. I requested to the flight attendant if I could relocate and she actually looked at me annoyed and asked me why.  She then told me no, the flight was full (no it wasn’t). After two hours into the flight and dude behind me driving me crazy, I asked again, and she found me a seat between two older Chinese men, both hacking and spitting - if you have been to China, you know they hack and spit everywhere, and do not cover their mouths when they cough. So I declined and went exploring the plane myself. There was a man in the next section that had an entire row to himself, stretched out sleeping, so I asked the flight attendant if I could move back there. Of course they acted irritated with me and pretended not to understand what I was asking. The young man next to me spoke Mandarin, and translated what I was saying, so they had to comply. I was more relaxed, but their funky attitudes made the flight miserable. I have never had a flight attendant lean over in my face and look at me like “what?” when I requested assistance. You are not allowed to have your phone on at all, don’t even pull it out, just leave it in your carry on. But you can use other devices. Some women in my group chose to book their own flights so they could fly on airlines they were more familiar with (ie. American Airlines) and I know to do the same next time.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Hoping the first time with Air China was just bad luck they have proven themselves again and again to be hopeless. Staff are rude and uncaring. They load 6 cans of beer for the flight so run out before reaching mid aircraft for service. No white wine - what makes them think every one drinks red? God forbid asking for a refreshment after trolley service - no chance of that. They have to always carry a security guard - wonder why - irate travellers who paid for service but don't get it that's why! Few English movies and bad seats makes it a long long flight.

This daily flight seemed to be the best connection to Europe, with a stopover in Beijing, but I was truly mistaken to make that assumption. The flight was two hours late, no staff was present to explain why (even in Chinese) and practically no food was served on the flight (except dry bread with something that was heavily processed meat) - not great since the wait in the airport was so long that I got hungry. The worst though was that according to my lounge staff the flight is always one hot late, it has never been in time, which is not what official Air China statistics say.

Comparing the ticket price with service quality, no complaints at all. First leg, Tokyo to Beijing on a tiny A321. Flight took about 4hrs, but without any IFE installed. Seat reclines less than 45deg. It was morning time so breakfast was served. I opted for Chinese breakfast and what came were tasteless congee, weird-tasted pieces of dim sum, and a super so-so pickles. Reaching one of world's most overcrowded airport, Beijing-Capital (PEK), we were delivered to the terminal building by bus, and the transit counter queue was horrendous, felt like queuing for a Disney attraction in summer time. Second leg, Beijing to Rome on brand new B787-9. FAs quite professional. I was provided with business class basics, slippers, glass of champagne, (super wet) hot towel and menu. Another adventure with the food began. Beef steak came with a super yellow slump of mashed potato and choices of appetizers, bread. Breakfast time came, teriyaki sauced chicken and rice. This breakfast looks more like an economy class breakfast being served on a proper plate rather than plastics. IFE choices better than fellow Star Alliance members Asiana and ANA, but limited compared to Singapore Airlines or even United long-haul. A lot more to complain about, but since I'm regularly an economy class passenger and my business class seats cost the same as an economy class, no complaints looking at the price. Highly recommended.

Staff incomprehensible for languages (they needed to bring 3 hostesses to translate among themselves). No salt and pepper with the food, no toothbrush. The seats offered to us were J/L.

I'm wondering how they could pass Star Alliance basic standards. First, my flight was cancelled and I had to fly one day later. Their ticket office offered me a refund or change the booking to the next day. Having no choice to come back home, I had to take the flight the day after. Regarding the check-in, I had issues on both legs. From Bangkok, the check-in is done by Thai Airways staff but they were useless. I arrived 2 hours before at the airport and almost missed my flight because they could not fix the issue. I was traveling with my wife, an infant and a child. I had requested a baby bassinet which was only done on one leg. They had the great idea to put my wife and the infant on the first row and me and my child on a different row at the back of the plane. They couldn't give us seats all together so me and my wife could take care of our baby together. I even talked to the Station Manager in Beijing on the phone but she could not care less. On the way back, it was even more ridiculous. The check-in staff was very rude. The flight was full so they upgraded my wife to premium economy but me, my infant and child in Economy. Despite asking them to downgrade my wife so we could all seat together, they refused. They said they were unable to downgrade my wife nor upgrade the rest of my family so we could all seat together. What kind of airlines would separate a family on long-haul? This happened on both legs, so I assume this happened often. During the flight, the entertainment system was mostly for Chinese as there were very few English movies. As for the food, I would advice anyone to bring some snacks on board. There were only selection of Chinese food which was simply disgusting. It was so bad that I couldn't tell what kind of meat it was. My wife and I took different dishes to spread the risk, and all of them were very bad. Last but not least, when we came back home, we had one luggage missing. I took them 4 days to bring it back and my suitcase is really damaged so I can't use it anymore. My only positive point, which I was very surprised considering their ground staff, is that the crew were very nice and friendly.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

My travels started out on 8th December 2016 and as of today I have yet to receive my checked luggage nor be compensated for the loss. I filed a Property Irregularity Report as soon as I landed in BKK and my checked bag was not with the rest of the people's checked bags that I flew with. They said if or when it arrived they would bring it to my hotel. It never did. My hotels were even nice enough to follow up with it everyday multiple times a day on the trip. I ended up having to buy clothes, borrow clothes, and purchase other items I had previously packed. It was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. When the trip ended and I arrived back at BKK I let the gate agent there know the situation and she turned it over to another person, this person made some phone calls and told me I should speak to those in DC. SO I flew back to D.C. and when I got there I spoke to their baggage claim that worked for the airline. She informed me they have 21 days from the date I file the report to find my luggage (I filed it on the 10th December). Once the 21 days past if it is not found I am to file a report for compensation and it should take 2 months for them to compensate me. On 30 December 2016 I called the baggage claim office in IAD and spoke to an agent who acted completely incompetent when I started speaking to her about the issue. I told her the 21 days past so I am now seeking compensation for my lost luggage. She basically said they would keep looking for it and I asked how long do they have to look for it? An infinite amount of time? What is standard procedure? She then copied a bunch of people on an email (all of which had Gmail email address which I find absurd for a company this size and also extremely fishy) and turned it over to BKK and Beijing to handle my claim. I received a reply from one of the individuals she copied on the email in Chinese. I don't understand what about our previous correspondence indicated I speak Chinese. I had a friend translate it and he said the email was extremely unprofessional, it does not give a timeline of action or state a standard procedure. Everyone I have dealt with in this airline has either acted incompetent or unprofessional and I have lost a good amount of my belongings. I can't even get a standard procedure, a timeline of next steps, or an email in English. I will absolutely never fly on this unprofessional and incompetent airline again.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

I've flown with Air China on three trips and the experience has gotten better every time. Not largely due to anything Air China has done differently, but because I've adjusted my expectations and I've gotten better acquainted with airport and inflight regulations. The mode of operation of Air China comes across more as a hard and fast checklist, rather than keeping customers comfortable or even satisfied. I've had to be rather forceful and persistent when I make requests inflight. That way, my requests as a paying customer are usually met. The cabin crew aren't usually the most inviting or pleasant but keeping busy with the entertainment system is a good distraction. The entertainment system is decent, even on a 13 hours journey. Try your hardest to stay away from aisle seats. The aisles are narrow and you're sure to be disturbed by constant bumping from passengers and crew alike. The menu is rather limited but the meals aren't the worst- balance of flavours and sizeable servings. The seating comfort is pretty average too. I'm 6'1 and it works. Lastly, though the expectation is for the crew to be multilingual, English isn't a strong suit for all attendants. I've always used simple English and I get by. I'll continue choosing Air China because of their prices and punctuality. Yes, the service can be rather dry, but it isn't abrasive or intolerable. I just need to get where I am headed, with the security of being on time, fed and safe, and that's what I've gotten from Air China.. ",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

The food absolutely sucks, so I'd pack your own. On the way back my bag got left in China, which the lady at Heathrow said had happened for the 3rd day in a row. I contacted Air China via the email address I was given, to be passed onto someone else, who said that was the wrong email and I should have emailed within 7 days.

I was left stranded in another country just like that with no further information.

When we arrived at LAX, the Air China desks were a little hard to find (it appeared that they do not maintain a normal presence there but rather use a communal check-in area for less frequent airlines). The attendants were fast and got us seated where we wanted. The flight left on time and the plane was new. Economy for a long flight is never pleasant, but for the most part it was a decent trip. Meal service initially was delayed, but it was served hot. Typical airline food, but free beer was nice. Overall, the FAs were rather austere and not at all friendly. We landed in Beijing, and it was a nightmare. Our connecting flight was delayed about 3 hours and the cattle-call in the area was exhausting. They loaded us onto trams to take us out onto the tarmac to board a very large widebody aircraft when it appeared many normal departure gates were open. We were dressed for the warmth of Bangkok, and it was below freezing in Beijing, so the 100 yard dash across the tarmac to board the 700-200 was miserable. As a side note, the International Terminal at Beijing was freezing cold as well and the security seemed excessive. The flight from Beijing to Bangkok was in a much older plane, with no individual IFE systems, which made the flight quite boring.

The separate international departures area in Chengdu for flights connecting in China before heading abroad is a shambles, and having to clear immigration in Kunming instead of Chengdu is just an added hassle. The flights were uneventful, though the domestic leg featured a bottle of water and no IFE, and the international flight the same (albeit with some poor quality Chinese food). No IFE isn't a huge problem, unless you're on a Chinese airline where you can't use your phone, and in a country where books are hard to come by, expensive and with a poor selection. The domestic flights in Myanmar, despite being only 45 minutes long (compared to 1.5 and 2 hour flights with CA) featured service and snacks superior to China's 'flag carrier'.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

It was cheap and I needed to book asap. Take off from LHR was on time, surprising as they have a penchant for being late. Air hostesses were pleasant enough to communicate with - food was standard Western and Chinese option (they made a notification that they don’t have enough western options so it may run out) - this seems to be standard practice with them. I was fed and watered so that was fine. Seats are a little narrow but that is expected on a Boeing 777-300ER, however it wasn’t unbearable. Entertainment was lacking in western options but you’re on a Chinese airline, when in doubt just sleep (if you can). Passengers can be annoying with some of their habits but it didn’t affect me much. Toilets were clean, cabin was clean. The second leg from Beijing to Tokyo was a little testing - immigration staff are rude and make you throw away water, lighters and anything they generally don’t like the look of – scanned my iPad a million times and my battery pack. One female immigration officer was giving me stick because the scanner couldn't see all the components – I simply turned it over and showed her it was Made in China and to take it up with the Chinese company if she didn’t like the design of it (she wanted to punch me in the face but I give as good as I get). Flight was delayed by three hours without explanation. Finally boarded the smaller flight to Tokyo. No entertainment screen as expected for a short haul but they actually fed and watered us. I took a recent flight to Prague with BA and had to pay for everything I wanted which is appalling in my opinion, so thumbs up for Air China. Arrived at Tokyo Haneda to no luggage! If your luggage is ever lost in Haneda via Air China and your final destination is Tokyo, speak to the JAL Staff not Air China and you will have your luggage in a few hours or the next day delivered to your door. Don’t know how it works but the Japanese don’t take to kindly to Air China mishaps in Japan so albeit I had to hang around the airport for 3.5/4 hours for the next Air China flight to bring my case, I got it! Return flight – pretty much the same minus the lost luggage and the Beijing to London flight was delayed! I think as long as you go in not expecting the world for the price you have paid you will be fine. Don’t get me wrong they need to majorly improve and I think they should be suspended from being a part of any airline alliance but it could have been much worse! Proceed with caution.

But no one cares about doing anything other than tell us rudely to wait for 2 days. No attempt is made by Air China to reimburse for the expense of getting clothes and toiletries for the two days. All phone calls to any Air China office went unanswered. They act like typical government employees: no attempt is made to satisfy customers. They seem to think that it is a privilege to fly their airlines. I will never fly Air China again and I urge others to not just consider cost. The service is terrible.

When the meal was cleared away, they did not come into the cabin until 2 hours before landing in Beijing.

He ended up attending to our line about half the time. Eventually, one of the the staff left and he ended up following her. They were never seen again and no one told us what was going on. Air China gave us a free night at a hotel since there were no flights available that night. It was a pretty bad hotel experience. The free stay would be nice if you came with another person, but as a solo person, you had to either share a room with a complete stranger or pay $100 for a single room. Ridiculous! When trying to reserve a room, the staff seemed very rude. They would say, ""Wait a moment."" They wouldn't specify how long I had to wait. When I asked them a third time, the guy appeared to make a number up just to shut me up. I saw another staff behind the counter playing a game on his phone. Customer service is non-existent in this company. They are fine when there are no problems, but when their are difficulties, they really need to manage the situation better.

My flight from Bangkok to Beijing was delayed due to snow in Beijing which meant that I missed my connecting flight from China to London. I wasn't mad at this as bad weather conditions can't be helped but the staff at Air China were unhelpful beyond belief, weren't accommodating or understanding at all and didn't even have the customer service to even apologise for the inconvenience! 10 stranded Brits were appalled by the way Air China handed the inconvenience and that all Air China did was put us on the same flight the next day and barked at us that they would arrange a hotel for us. To make things worse not only could Air China then not retrieve our luggage which we asked for after we waited for it for over 2 hours telling us rudely to just ""wait more"". It took them a total of 4 hours from when we landed, to take and just leave us at a hotel without even translating what had happened to the hotel staff. We all then were left to argue against the hotel staff about an agreement that they had in place with Air China which was that it was two people to a double room regardless of who, and if we wanted a single room to ourselves we had to pay, which meant that we had to stay in a room with complete strangers! Absolutely ridiculous and unsafe! The hotel staff were equally not accommodating or understanding, we were provided with food but were only allowed one bottle of water per person for the night. The next day, we asked Air China if anything could be done for the massive inconvenience and just got a rude ""no"". I'm disgusted at the way Air China operate and their rude staff and couldn't believe that they treated us like the inconvenience was our fault. It was so stressful and looking back to the events, it's unbelievable how we've been treated. When I asked to speak to the manager about how long we had to wait for our transport to our hotel, he just barked at me in limited English telling me to just ""wait, it will be soon"".

The tickets were so much cheaper than any other airline so I figured it was worth at least trying. I couldn't work out how to order vegetarian food when getting the ticket and then when I tried to call the airline to make the request for the special meal I couldn't get through. I was a little worried as it's a very long flight not to eat on. The plane wasn't super flashy but it was a normal plane with screens in the seats for every passenger and there were a lot of Chinese movies (it is a Chinese airline), but there were more than enough English speaking films. The cabin crew were polite. I explained the situation as far as the vegetarian meal and they apologized but let me know that they had no record of request for my vegetarian meal.  The meals were served around me and then a hostess stood over me, with a meal that had located a spare one from business class. For the voyage back I was able to request the vege meal and received the same service all the way back to New York. So it's all relative, it's the only time I ever flew Air China but I figured people are way more likely to make bad reviews to vent a bit, my experience was better than average.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The staff was friendly and food and drinks was a lot. Beijing to Frankfurt the staff was also nice.  The seats were comfortable and we could lay down 180 degrees. What was not so good was the movie selection at the inflight entertainment. The choice was less and unknown movies. Also WIFI connection was not available on the flights.,Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Strange that just after take off during first round of drink service they were out of white wine. We ordered red wine instead, but it was all what we can have - 20 minutes later they were out of red wine and beer as well. I know that plane it is not a restaurant, but anyway strange.

We took advantage of this 5th freedom flight on the way from Beijing to Barcelona with a stop in Vienna from where we flew. It is more convenient to fly on a widebody aircraft, even on a relatively short route such as this one. And the fare was pretty good, with checked bag included and an inflight meal. For our dates, lowcost airlines such as Vueling were selling this route for the same price, so why not try Air China? First disappointment came shortly after take off, when they told us they don't have vegetarian meal we ordered a few months in advance, and the flight attendant just came to us with her list to show us we're really not on the list. Not very professional. Otherwise the onward flight was fine. On the return trip, after being ensured by the checkin staff, we were served the vegetarian meal, which was just ok. Edible, but not good compared to other airlines. The flight attendants were polite, but not very personal and when they spoke English, you could not understand it anyway. And even though the plane was 2-3 years old on both ways, it wasn't very clean, in one of the toilet cells there was a missing lock, so in order to lock the door you had to use your nail to move the lock. The seats had a small IFE touchscreen, with a very slow system, a very very few Hollywood movies and a lot of Chinese movies; they had a very good 3D map flight information system though.

One month before my international trip they canceled my return flight for reason ""irregular operations"" and gave me no reasonable alternatives for rebooking (3 days ahead or like 4 days after the initial date - and no hotel or compensation offered for the inconvenience). There were available flights that day but they refused to rebook me on different flights if i didn't pay extra, given the prices are now so expensive a month ahead. So essentially they canceled my trip last moment. I had to take the refund and get new tickets which were now twice the price.

The flight from Taipei to New York seems a bit cheaper on the surface but there's a 14 hour layover in Beijing. So you need a hotel for that. Which, with a bit of drama I managed. Don't get the hotel in the terminal, get the one outside. Yes, they don't answer the phone, but it's still a valid if ultra ghetto place to sleep. More seriously when I got to NY I found the lock on my suitcase was broken. Checking I found the following missing an old Windows laptop, clothing, an iPod and iPad. I asked them for compensation but they're diligently stonewalling me with 'this is not the right number', 'you must claim within 7 days'. Even though I've called all the numbers and the emails they've sent me show someone in Air China got their documents emailed back inside the 7 day window. Right now they're just ignoring emails. Another interesting thing they said was 'did it have a lithium ion battery?"". The Windows laptop didn't as it happened. The iPod and iPad obviously did.

Food was basic, chicken and rice or noodles, offered on both flights, however a good range of drinks offered. During my time at check in at Bangkok, the service was abysmal. After queuing for an hour and 20 minutes at check in time (there were still a lot of people behind me queing) I was met by rude staff. I felt very upset by the way I was treated.

Moscow SVO Airport terminal 2F is a scary terminal with very rude and not so orderly security process. Boarding was a free for all, no priority given to passengers with special needs, business class or Star alliance high tier members. Air China ground staff did not seem bothered neither as they were chatting with themselves with arms folded watching the mess sorting out by itself. Once onboard, despite the seats looking worn and dirty, the cabin attendants were amazing. Addressing passengers by surname, kneeling down to speak and engaging in friendly but not overly intrusive small talks. The lady noticed I bought caviar and offered some dry ice. Landed in Beijing late and the nightmare restarted. We were greeted by poorly dressed Air China staff, turned out, all Air China staff in Beijing Airport were poorly groomed. They barked out orders only in Mandarin and to other Russians who do not speak the language, they resorted to pushing and pointing to the transfer zone, very long queue to get our boarding cards stamped and when I asked a question to an Air China staff if that was the right queue, she told me 'only sticker, only sticker', so I went off to look for another queue and was sternly turned back by airport security to ask me to rejoin the sticker queue. Turned out what the lady meant was she was there only for people with a sticker (those that had tight connections) and I should not ask her questions. It took over 40 minutes to clear the 'transit boarding pass stamp' and security formalities. Reached the lounge with 50 minutes to spare but was turned away by the lounge agent telling me that the connecting flight was already ready for boarding. It was a lie as after a 15 minute stroll to the boarding gate, it was not for another 20 minutes before boarding commenced. Once on board, the excellent inflight experience returned.

The plane was also a joke, especially the one used to fly from Beijing to London. I'm 188cm tall, I didn't have enough legroom and my knee were pushed against the sit in front of me for 11 hours! The legroom was less than in a cheap low cost airline (e.g. Ryanair), how can that happen in an international flight where you need to be sit for more than ten hours! Let's ignore the cleanliness and comfort, but a minimum amount of legroom should always be provided. The flight entertainment was also embarrassing, straight out of the nineties, the resolution of the display was probably the same as one of the first smartphone ever produced, it was painful to watch, and the controllers of the entertainment system were unintuitive and most of the buttons to press were unresponsive. The meal quality was really poor, food was just a little warm, they gave us two options for the meals and they ran out of the first option immediately, I think they managed to serve maybe ten persons and then they ran out of it, speechless! To conclude our trip properly they damaged one of our luggage, we found the luggage completely open running around on the belt at the luggage collection, we obviously filled in an official complaint as part of the content was broken/lost.

The staff is extremely rude, unpleasant and speaks next to no English not even understanding basic questions about food and drinks. At one point the staff told me and my neighbor sitting next to me we had to be quiet. Mind you we were talking quiet and politely. A couple hours later a couple of Chinese women were rudely talking basically where anyone and everyone could hear, but of course the staff said nothing to them. The food is disgusting and the only snack they offer is card board bread with a slice of fake ham. Then when I finally arrive at my destination they announce my name and then tell me my luggage was left in Ho Chi Minh city and it would be delivered to me 2 days later. Finally 2 and a half days later I get my luggage and the lock is missing and you can tell my luggage has been opened.

We and many others make repeated offers for people to pay to upgrade ahead of time, over the phone, at the ticketing desk and the boarding gate, they refused to accommodate extremely tall people and allow them to pay to upgrade to a larger seat.

When we got to the ticket counter, we specifically asked the lady, even if we had to pay more, to allow us to travel in Premium economy and she said she had upgraded us for free, because of the delay, but we would be able to double check once we got to Beijing. When we got to Beijing, there was no one at the counter, and we waited. Finally, minutes before boarding we saw a person that we met on the way to Thailand, and he said they had changed the gate.

The key to tolerating a long flight is a good entertainment system since you are stuck in the plane with nothing else to do. I was shocked and disappointed at how bad the in-flight entertainment was! It's a small screen that was extremely pixelated, not touch screen, with a wired hand controller that dates to pre-internet days where you have to tab-tab-tab-select and oops you missed your target so start all over again tab-tab. The choice of movies and shows were kind of okay but catered to the Chinese. They also provided English subtitles but as the resolution was so poor it's not possible to read them! The more recent movie choices in English had the qualify of having been pirated. The audio was just awful. I gave up on the entertainment system an hour in, and read ebooks off my tablet instead! In this day and age, such a bad quality entertainment system is just unforgivable.  The Chinese food was not too bad. The seats were just ok for an average-sized person but when the person in front of my reclined back, the entertainment screen was practically in my face and I had to in turn recline all the way back so I would stop kissing the screen. They wouldn't let anyone use any phones, even in flight mode! I would only fly again if there was a huge difference between the cost of their ticket and that of a more reputable airline.

First of all my luggage was left behind in Beijing. No big deal - this happens with all airlines. What's terrible is how Air China resolved this, or rather didn't. After chasing them many, many times over email (with up to two weeks passing between replied from their customer service team), they finally agreed to pay me the due compensation of £46. Great, I thought, a resolution. But when the envelope finally arrives through the post, I find it contains not a cheque but a voucher for travel with Air China. As I have NO intention to ever fly Air China again, I find this next to worthless. Reading back through my emails I now find (of course) that Air China did make one very discreet reference to a 'TCV' (or Travel Compensation Voucher). I think it's disgusting that they use a jargon-y acronym to hide their true intentions.

I have flown IAD to SGN three times before on other airlines but Air China was the worst. The seats were uncomfortable on every flight. The food was mediocre at best  - like something you'd find on a mediocre airline, not the flagship air carrier of one of the largest countries in the world. And don't plan on listening to the hours of music you downloaded to your iPhone because Airplane mode is not good enough for this airline; your phone must be turned completely off for the entire flight. And since the flight was late taking off, most people on the flight had a snowball's chance of making their connections in Beijing because of the mess that transitting in Beijing is. But you will have to read about that in a review of PEK. I will not fly Air China ever again. I would rather pay more.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Maybe I slept 2 hours out of 12. People 7"" shorter than I were equally miserable. Larger people were pacing the aisle trying to release leg cramps. Zero room to make yourself even minimally comfortable. Staff had little English and were remote. Also Air China's connecting flight from Bangkok to Beijing was delayed til 4:30 a.m. Miserable and compressed connecting time to something resembling chaos. Over and never again!!

I have to admit that this is the first time that i have been driven to write a review of an airline. I have elite status on Star Alliance and One World. In all my travels i have never come across a worse airline than Air China. I am writing today warn off my fellow travelers from this airline which probably should be de-certified in a number of territories. I recently booked a ticket from Seoul to Beijing on the US website. Unfortunately there is a glitch in a the system and my name repeated itself (for example it appears as John John Smith Smith). I also can confirm this was not me accidentally entering my name twice because - before noticing the error - I booked a second itinerary and the same thing happened. And now for the incredible waste of time. The US 800 number basically does not answer. When calling the 24 hour number in China given their poor English they seemed convinced that I was somehow trying to do a name change. The UK number answers on a loop - throughout the UK work day - that the call center opens at 9am. Then disconnects. The French number on the Air China website is not valid. The loss of time in the last 48 hours has been absolutely breathtaking and I would have paid the double with another airline had I known. Resolution? 40 minutes to get a US rep who asked that I send my passport in despite confirming that there is a glitch in their booking system which allows for passenger names to be repeated. Still waiting for confirmation that the issue is resolved. Avoid Air China. Buyer Beware.,Business,1.0,nan

It took them 3 hrs before they announced that our flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. Then there was a staff who informed us that we will be refunded the amount of our new flight if we rebook the flight ourselves as their person are taking a long time doing the rebooking. After we rebook a flight with another airline, we were then informed that a full refund is not a guaranteed and was given a Delayed Flight Form that we are to give to their Air China colleagues when we arrive in Vancouver. I was already mad as we had to take care of everything ourselves and have been misinformed. This misinformation costs me $925 CAD. A very expensive misinformation. When I got to Vancouver, the 2 employees on their Air China booth said they can’t assist me with my issues and to call or email Air China! So I called. I called more than 10 times now and the call keeps getting cut off. I also sent an email and there was no help there either. Thanks was told to cancel the booking and request a refund (no detailed information given) But it won’t be the $925 I paid to get to Vancouver. I was also told to call the Philippine office. When I asked if they’re going to cover my overseas call charges, I never heard anything back. I will never recommend them to anyone. Worst customer service!

The seats are narrow and a packed Air China plane is not comfortable, especially for a long haul. I had to transfer in Beijing. For some reason I've not been able to figure out, the itinerary I'd been sold didn't leave enough time to get from the arrival gate to the departure gate of the connecting flight. I don't know if that was Air China's fault or the agent (Flighthub)'s fault. The Air China personnel at the airport strenuously maintained that it wasn't their fault. They claimed their only responsibility was to take off on time, and if I missed the connecting flight, that was my fault. Out of the goodness of their hearts, they said, they would allow me to board another flight the next morning. So I had to wait around in Beijing airport for a flight the next morning. As a result, I incurred some expense from missed connections and reservations in Japan. Although I've not been able to find out to this day whose fault it was that I missed my connection, Air China's unsympathetic attitude towards stranded travelers struck me unfavorably, and I'll probably try to avoid doing business with them again.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

The continual running problems with Air China is terrible ground service. This particular flight was delayed in Beijing (on a transfer, headed to Hong Kong) for five hours. There was no explanation given, nor any explanation posted at the gate. Only the word ""delayed"" was there (it was not in Chinese either). The staff either didn't know or didn't want to say. And they gave no rough indication when the connecting flight would take off (if ever). Passengers were left to wander around the gate area for hours. Luckily, there were some coffee shops open so we were able to buy drinks, etc. This problem with the service process is all-too-common among service providers here in East Asia, and especially in China (including Hong Kong, where I work). I hope the airlines and hotels take the lead in improving service and better communicating with the customers. And also, the voice recordings on the Air China phone lines in Hong Kong were impossible to understand (the English recordings). Really an uncomfortable travel experience - the second time for me.",Business,3.0,nan
A330-200,Economy Class,5.0,May 2018,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes,Geneva to Hong Kong via Beijing,5.0," |  Geneva to Hong Kong via Beijing. It was the unbeatable price that made me book and try them. One of the myths is that the planes are old. That is true and you see it from the very beginning when boarding the plane. You go through business class and it looks basic as well, just the full flat seats that remind you of business class. Economy is worse, except the seat legroom which I found better than most of the European airlines when flying long haul. The entertainment system is old and has only 1-2 movies in English, and almost unusable. It responds 5 seconds after you've pressed the button (no touch screen), the image quality is bad and the sound even worse. I had to use my headphones in order to understand something. But, the choices of foreign (not Chinese) movies was big and I had some novelties from the US, there were many European movies, a Chilean one and so on, all of them translated into English. The series were lacking the usual suspects from the US so I had to stick with the movies. Even the Chinese ones were subtitled, so after all a good surprise. The flight attendants did everything to make our trip nice and although the knowledge on English is basic (really basic), they struggled to make us feel welcome and asked if we needed something. They  provided a blanket for the 3h flight from PEK to HKG. The food was average, but better than some other better considered airlines. For breakfast there was  a western style one offered with omelet, chicken sausage and hash browns which wasn't bad at all. When it comes to beverages, the tea was very good, coffee so and so, the juices were nice (orange, apple, tomato) and the beer and wines (Chinese brands) were awful. I  only experienced a half an hour delay once, with 12 legs flown in 2 weeks with them, so big surprise, they also land 45 minutes before schedule. Connecting in Beijing is almost a nightmare, but I have survived, give that the connecting time was decent, though not to much in order to get bored. Bottom line, Air China succeeded to impress me. I was expecting the worst and I got a fairly good economy product, better than some other airlines which should be better. I would say, you should give it a try if the price is right.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Flight was late due to bad weather. Sitting on a plane. Out of nowhere went up. Circling above Hong Kong then trying to avoid the thunder storm we did not know was being ahead. Terrifying turbulence. Then 1,5 hour with total helplessness what was going on. Flight attendants did not know either. Captain speaking: ""Need to land in Wuhan due to bad weather"" - flight cancelled. Stuck at immigration desk (literally). Officers could not let us thru as we did not have Chinese visa - did not need any when you traveled to Hong Kong. Cannot go thru unless there is a new itinerary booked for us. It was 2am; entire airport closed till 6am. No english speaking people in Wuhan Airport. Booking system opened at 6:30am. Took ages to get a new itinerary. Surprisingly the new flight times were not able to fit each other. Long story short - after 20hrs spending in China we finally flew away home.

Boeing 787,Economy Class,3.0,May 2018,3.0,3.0,2.0,yes,Taipei to Madrid via Beijing,3.0," |  Purchased a very cheap ticket (less than USD600) for Taipei to Madrid via Beijing, returning from Paris. While this was not the best airline I have flown, I got there and back on time and safely. All flights arrived early or on time.  Boeing 787 was a comfortable aircraft but nothing special, while the older A330s were less so, but still acceptable. I had no major issues, although I may just have been lucky. It seems most of the bad reviews are due to delays or cancellations and lost bags (which I was lucky not to experience). The food was quite average but edible, although mostly Asian style so might not suit those who are not used to eating average quality Chinese food. It's true that the staff and attendants don't speak good English so you might also have issues there (I speak some Mandarin) and the in-flight entertainment is not great (bring a book or tablet). Also, facilities such as immigration, security, signage etc at both Beijing and Shanghai airports are poor, and while these are not the fault of the airline, they affect the customer experience. In summary, if you get a cheap ticket and remember how little you paid when you fly, you can probably consider Air China worthwhile. If you can afford to do so, you should probably fly another airline to avoid the risk of running into issues.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

A330-200,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,no,Geneva to Tokyo-Narita via Beijing,4.0," | Geneva to Tokyo-Narita via Beijing. Flying Air China is like taking a time machine back to the 1990s. There are some good parts, such as the fact that the seat pitch is huge. The food was generally surprisingly good and often reflected local food at the place of departure (nice Tilsiter cheese and dry meat which, ironically, you don't get on Swiss in economy). Beer and wine were offered twice, before meal times. On the other hand, the plane interior itself was probably due for an upgrade, notably the in-flight entertainment system. On both outward legs, there were individual screens with 12 channels showing 6 films on repeat (with different audio). Unfortunately only two were in English (and one channel was made up of documentaries that switched language; one Chinese moving had illegible English subtitles) and the same movies were shown from Geneva to Beijing (10 hours) as from Beijing to Tokyo (3 hours) so I was rather bored. My return leg from Shanghai to Frankfurt did have touchscreens with a good selection, though. The staff were pleasant - decent English skills and I felt like someone came around offering water every 10-15 minutes for the whole flight each time. On all four legs, the plane had a recorded announcement from the flight's ""safety officer"" listing behaviours that were illegal under Chinese law (climbing on seats, trying to open exits in-flight, preventing cabin attendants from going about duties), the staff then turn off the lights and ask for windows to be closed straight after the meal (even when it's only mid-afternoon at the point of departure) and at the end, the purser thanks the passengers for their cooperation. It all felt about pre-empted riot prevention. Two legs delayed by an hour - at least one was due to air traffic control restrictions which is not Air China's fault as such, but something you have to consider if you choose to transit through any airport in PRC. Also worth knowing is that they will put you up in a cheap hotel near-ish the airport if you have an overnight layover but you have to know to ask. All in all, it was fine given that it was 30% cheaper than the competition but I couldn't help feeling jealous of the passengers flying on CA's code-shares served by ANA's 787 and Lufthansa's A380.

Outbound flight was delayed by two hours. Crew on outbound flight were underwhelming, service did not seem polished and crew had limited English capabilities. Food was an uninspiring snack box, not enough for the length of the time we stayed on the plane. Seat dimensions were standard, with 31"" pitch. However, seat comfort was good that I managed to get sleep. Unfortunately, only one blanket and pillow was provided for every three seats. IFE was offered in the form of TV shows/moving map displayed on drop-down monitors every three rows. The inbound flight was quite a different story. Although delayed by an hour due to the heavily flawed design of the departures area of the ULN airport and bad, windy weather, we did not encounter any turbulence, which was a plus on this flight. Crew were more professional and had better English. Unfortunately they acted such that they had no time to be friendly towards passengers: they would forcefully and rudely demand that passengers fully turn off their mobile phones while in flight, and wouldn't stop until the crew sees the passenger doing as told. The food was great presented in a snack box consisting of an sausage and cucumber appetizer and a red bean bread, in addition to a hot dish of chicken with rice.  What's disappointing, however, is that even after my parents had ordered vegetarian special meals, there wasn't any on this flight. We sat near the front, enjoying a more spacious 32"" pitch. Overall a mediocre experience, not worth the price paid for these flights, that severely lacks consistency. ",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

CTrip could not rebook us on any other flight to HNL even though we explained that we have a hotel reseravtions and rentacar paid for for two week vacation as well as interisland flights and that they are costing us thousands of dollars by this impromptu decision. They were not able to offer anything to us. Neither a rebooking later that evening nor change of air carrier within the Star Allaince. We went to the HKG airport just to receive the same information from Air China ground staff, who were rude, unapproachable, insolent to say the least. The ground staff just gave a terse answer that all Air China flights leaving HKG that day were cancelled due to typhoon, even though all other companies were departing that night, with a bit of dalay but they weren't cancelled, without offering a solution, customer care or showing any compassion and cooperation. The only thing that we got was the refund for the tickets in full and only becuase we had booked throught an agent.

The Air China airline needs to undertake thorough review of their customer support system. Their inability to speak or converse in English is a big handicap in looking after the needs of their passengers. The food served onboard is basically chinese food named as per your choice rendered during booking. Quality of onboard service is pathetic. Hostesses are rude and refuse services in the first pretext. Their baggage handling is also poor. My one checked-in baggage is lost and not yet traceable (since last 48 hours). When I am calling up their local office in Mumbai, their response is sluggish. The connecting flight at Beijing was delayed. The front desk executives were rude with passengers and did not have any information about the departure of flight. They were so unconcerned that they stopped responding to the queries of passengers, some of them were old and some were mothers with small babies with them.

Fortunately I could overnight at my nephew who lives near the airport. The luggage was delayed at Hong Kong for more than an hour ad then my bag did not arrive. The reason they said is that they did not have enough time to put it on the plane in Beijing although the fligh was delayed for more than two hours. FTE was limited and seats uncomfortable. On the way to Vancouver, the air conditioning in the front was not working effectively. It was so hot and I almost had to undress when I walked to the toilets at the back, where it was almost freezing. The food was atrocious and the worst vegetarian airline food I have ever eaten.

Chose this airline as it was cheaper and the timing gave me half a day more in Shanghai before moving on to Beijing. The aircraft type stated during booking was a Boeing 787-9, however, they changed this a few days before the flight to an A330. Luckily I had a point to check my flight booking consistently, as the seat that I selected (33A) was a premium economy seat on the 787, but an economy class seat on the A330- managed to move to seat 32A, which was a premium economy seat. The seat itself was identical to the economy class seat, with the exception of a different colour and generous legroom - I could stretch my legs fully without even touching the seat back in front of me! Before take-off, the cabin crew served drinks to the passengers in premium economy - a welcome service, but perhaps the standard of a premium economy class cabin, given that this was my first time flying premium economy. The flight was delayed-the boarding time was supposed to be 5:25pm, but the aircraft did not even come in until about 5:35pm! In the end, we landed in Beijing 30 minutes late. The cabin crew were quite friendly, giving out drinks quickly and clearing them fast enough. A meal was served on board, but I found it to be rather small compared to other full service carriers.  The IFE screen, though touchscreen, was a bit small and the selection was quite limited. However, what I really found weird was the ban on all electronic devices - being used to being able to use smaller PEDs (with communication features turned off, of course) on other airlines, this was a surprise to me.

He refused to offer further assistance and told us to contact the airline ourselves, even though we had no local phone to use. Basically he said that was not his problem. When we tried to seek help from a neighbouring female check in agent, she got up and yelled at us at the top of her voice to ""get lost"". We are stuck in the airport with no way of getting our flight rescheduled. It is really shocking how Air China can simply dishonour a confirmed itenary by another airline just like this.

Just had an operator in Sydney hang up on me as I wanted to confirm that the new departure flight also provided for us the original seating to be advise no and it was against policy despite being given same on booking.

I understand flights in china are complex and you can't help certain circumstances but the following is definitely Air China responsibility. We board and than the announcement is saying the engine is broken. There are no solutions offered and it is communicated to go back to the gate and get another ticket.

They provided such poor service that I am taking time out of my day to write this review.On our flight from Bangkok to New York via Beijing there was a 6 hour delay for no reason. When I arrived the customer service was so far from what you expected that it was almost laughable. I had more info on my phone than they did on their computer. They attempted to lie that the flight was only delayed by 2 hours but flightaware was showing that this flight still has not taken off from Beijing. They asked me to fly to Beijing and see what I can work out when I arrived 6 hours late. I had to run to make the 1pm flight that had a 25 min layover in Beijing or would have had to sleep in the airport for a second time. There was never any talk of compensation or just basic customer service for a customer that has paid a huge amount of money. I would strongly suggest you avoid at all costs. Unless you enjoy sleeping in airports and dealing with some of the dumbest customer service representatives.,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Average service if you are lucky enough to avoid any unexpected situation (delay, flight change etc) during your trip. If not, you will know immediately why there were so many negative reviews for this airline. Their service in handling special situations are horrible. My first flight was hugely delayed for more than 4 hours and there was no compensation or anything offered by Air China for all the loss of time. Instead, they asked everyone to simply wait in front of the gate and take care of yourselves. Because of the previous delay, the connection flight could not be caught up and I was asked to change my connection flight at the Air China counter after I arrive Beijing. There was a big crowd of people, who also needed to change their connection flight due to the delay, was stuck as well in front of the counter. It eventually took me walk between multiple counters and more than 2 hours to get my flight rescheduled. Everything was handled in a very messy way and it was so unorganized. I am not sure if this is the worst airline around the world, but it is no doubt the worst airline that I ever took.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The return trip was particularly memorable! Over two hours of delay before take-offin Geneva airport (at the time it was the only flight departing Geneva that was delayed). Naturally missed my connection in Beijing. Ground staff were rude, and the only thing they could do was to change it to another flight 28 hours later! And somehow they could change the flight # without changing the date!! (Found out this problem when checking in, nearly refused to give me a boarding pass. I had to then spend nearly an hour queueing in the ticket office before the problem was finally resolved). When checking in, I repeatedly told the staff to locate and transfer my baggage to the new flight. And then after 28hrs, that flight was further delayed for nearly 4 hours for no reason!

All 3 flights so far have been delayed. They ruined my honeymoon in Thailand with my wife and made me miss all of my business meetings in New York by being delayed over 7 hours for now reason. They claimed it was due to bad weather in Beijing but weather.com showed that it was beautiful weather in Beijing and in Bangkok. Made us sleep in airport without even providing hotel accommodations. We paid $6,000 each for our business class tickets and were treated in the worst way possible. When speaking to the representative they said the best they can do it give me access to the lounge at the airport - which we already had access too since we were business class! Absolutely the worst.

When suddenly the flight was ready to board the gate opened and there was a mad rush to get on the plane. Once on board we waited for a long time before we finally took off.

Air China basically provides bare minimum standards of business class service, champagne, French red and white wines as well as spirits and liqueurs.

All 4 flights we took was delayed for 1 hour respectively. The journey in general was good. The airplane was fairly new and in pretty good condition. The food and beverage were good. Seats were comfortable. Power socket was provided in B777-300ER for laptop and tablet. The only discomfort was the air temperature was a too high on flight from HK to PEK. Our outward flight transfer time was as long as 12 hours, Air China provided free overnight accommondation including shuttle. However, they should improve the online check-in system. We were unable to check-in our outward flight due to some internal error of its online system, but it worked in return flight. The entertainment system on Air China fleets was designed for those who speaks and reads Chinese.  The touch screen of my wife's seat (both outward and return flights were not working) she had to make use of the fixed controller instead. Both journeys were good, not bad honestly.

In the process, the captain contacted the air traffic control at PEK and said we could fly at 18:40 the earliest. We then returned to the terminal and boarded again afterwards, but the plane couldn't land because of thunderstorm and diverted to Shenyang. The airline sent us to a hotel and returned next morning. When I took the return flight, the airport was a mess. I arrived the terminal 50 minutes before the scheduled departure time. The queue was long, and there were many people holding the same ticket as mine still in the queue. Multiple flights were cancelled the day before and my flight accommodated many those passengers, resulting in some passengers couldn't get on the plane even if they chose a seat before, and had to take an afternoon flight. I ended up assigned a premium economy seat with my economy class ticket. The flight delayed as well due to thunderstorm, as well as many other flights on the same route, and only after 7 hours of waiting we could board the plane.

Basically they said they can book me on the same flight next day staying overnight in Shenyang at on my own expense or standby at the airport in case my flight leave some time later that day. I was told it is due to bad weather in Beijing airport. I checked Beijing airport website to find out more on weather delays there. Their chinese version was announcing something about the weather but when I switched to English version, it doesn't say much about the weather delay. Anyway, I eventually get on the flight after about 7hr delay and when I landed in Beijing I found my flight CA991 to Vancouver was still waiting at the gate which was 6 hr after its scheduled departure time to Vancouver already. I tried to rush to the gate but being in Chinese airport you have to queue up three times before being released to the airside, resulting gate was closed already when I managed to get to the gate. Later on I managed to get back to check in area to reschedule my flight with help of a chinese speaking fellow passenger, and we were offered 200RMB with no accomodation for the night.

They caused me a lot of grief, and a little communication would have gone a long way at making my travel with them smoother. This is a company that lacks flexibility, empathy, and the know-how to be able to retain customers. Judging by their track record online, they seem to be effective at creating disloyalty.

There is Chinese or western cuisine, I had both and these were good enough. Choices of wines, liquor and beer very nice. Air China has a big business lounge in Beijing. Plenty of food and drinks with WIFI. Onboard Air China does not allow the use of Mobile Phones or Tablets/Ipad due to Gov't regulations although some people watch movies in their tablets/Ipad and no one bothers them that I can see. Communicating with the cabin staff sometimes is challenging because most of them are not very good in English although they know what to do when providing services. You can ask as many drinks as you can consume and they will accommodate you. You should move quicker while in Beijing because you might not have enough time to your connecting flight if the gate is very far, you may need to ride in a golf cart to speed up your getting to the gate/lounge (drivers ask for tips). Changed to smaller plane in Beijing en route to Manila. My layover was less than 2 hours and the flight took another 4.5 hours to Manila which was not bad.

There was some turbulence during both flights but it seems like the seat belt signs were put on throughout most of each flight eventhough the turbulence had long passed. There were blankets provided although some were sealed in plastic bags while others were just folded without any packaging giving the impression that they were recycled from the previous flight. The cabin crew was efficient and attentive. The flight experience was pleasant although slightly marred by the other passengers who dropped their blankets and pillows in the middle of the aisle or those who insisted on walking around when they were not supposed to. Checking in in Bejing can be quite a chaotic experience. There are counters for domestic flights and dedicated counters for international flights for specific locations.

I like China, I know and like the Chinese people, but this airline is just unbelievably awful. The lounge in T3 PEK airport was so crowded and hot, food absolutely vile, and I thought getting onto the flight might improve things. No! My neighbour sat and hacked up phlegm for most of the trip, occasionally spitting this into his glass or cup. God knows what germs he was spreading. The seat was okay, but cabin was dirty and had a pungent and very unpleasant smell. Forget the IFE as choices are typically Chinese limited. After the lounge food offering, it got worse on the flight and truly resembled and smelt like dog food - and this was the western choice I opted for. Final elements of enjoyment was when I walked to the toilet about halfway through the flight and noticed 4 cabin crew (in full uniform) spread out fast asleep on some vacant business class seats!

When we did, they just told us to call their customer service line, which we did, and never heard back from them. So we contacted our travel agent, who then contacted Air China, and had this to say about them: ""I called the reservation and they don't take care of the refund.

I was told to wait 3-4 hours for the price. The fees are so excessive the agent warmed me ahead of time. I was charged 3 times the amount i paid, on top of what I paid. The ticket only states that rebooking they will recalculate fees so that leaves them free to charge what they want. I could have booked a cheaper ticket on the spot going to Expedia but then they were going to cancel my return flight and I was returning with my friend which was already there. We were returning together. I tried to avoid the fees but in the end they control the situation. I understand fees but basically I was overcharged and nothing I could do. The service is very poor. The flight attendants are curious, food is awful, entertainment if it works, is poor same movies on the return flight. The web site is also very primitive with google translation from Chinese.

The aircraft was old and shabby, my arm rest was missing the top of it so for the 11 hour flight was very uncomfortable and I had to put a pillow on it.

The experience on our flight back was horrendous, we arrived to the airport with plenty of time to check in. However the self check in machines wouldn't work so we had to go to the desk which had a long queue.

I made the mistake of reading the reviews about Air China after I'd booked my flights, and I was therefore a little apprehensive about travelling with them. I'm pleased to say that my experience was quite different and I needn't have worried! The flights from London to Beijing were operated by a newer 777 aircraft and the seats were surprisingly comfortable and the aircraft interiors were clean. The Beijing to Yangon flight was operated by a 737 aircraft and the interior seemed a little tired. I'd recommend checking the aircraft type before booking as spending over 5 hours on a 737 aircraft was a little uncomfortable. In terms of onboard service I was impressed by the quantity and quality of food and drinks provided. On all legs a drinks service was followed immediately by a meal and then another drinks service. The food was quite tasty, and on one occasion I even got a cold beer (a rarity on Chinese airlines!). While onboard staff can be abrupt, there does seem to be a genuine attempt being made to be helpful and to provide good customer service. From my experience, this appears merely to be a cultural difference, rather than being rude as such. As others have mentioned, the entertainment system isn't the best, with a very limited number of both Western and Asian films. On both the outward and return legs I had 7 hour layovers in Beijing. I'd recommend that passengers bear in mind the long queues and security checks when transferring to other international flights at Beijing which took over 1 hour on this occasion. I've noticed other reviewers laying blame on Air China for this (I had exactly the same experience when transferring at Beijing with China Southern Airlines on a previous occasion). While you might be able to make it through security if you have a short connection, your luggage may not be so lucky, and it would also be extremely stressful. Based on my experiences, I'd say Air China is superior to China Southern  in terms of seat comfort, onboard service and catering; but inferior in terms of inflight entertainment and cleanliness. It's therefore a little unclear why China Southern receives such glowing reviews, and Air China receives awful reviews. It's also worth mentioning that mobile phone use is banned on all (I think) flights in China (including in flight mode). I don't think it's justified to give a bad review to a particular airline based on this, given that it's a legal requirement. I'd definitely be willing to fly Air China again. The flights were great value for money. However, I may be reluctant to do so in case I have one of the bad experiences that many others seem to have encountered.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,November 2017,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,Newark to Chiang Mai via Beijing,3.0," |  My boyfriend and I departed Newark airport for a flight to Beijing. Upon arriving in Beijing, we learned that our transfer flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand had been cancelled without prior notice and rescheduled for the following day (a full 24 hours later). I don't understand how an airline can do this without notifying their passengers in advance. This caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety in an airport where English-speaking support is limited. Finally, Air China was able to accommodate us in a hotel several hours later after we had to apply for temporary visas into China. It took 1-2 hours just to get the visa. This was a huge disappointment because it stole an entire day of our vacation in Thailand. On the way home, Air China cancelled our connecting flight in Beijing again and rescheduled us on a flight 16 hours later without letting us know in advance. However, there were 3 other flights earlier in the day going to our destination. It made no sense to me that Air China wouldn't accommodate us on one of the earlier flights. Instead they again caused a huge amount of distress by putting us on a flight 16 hours later which would mean we'd have to spend an entire day in the Beijing airport for no reason. Eventually Air China was able to accommodate us on an earlier flight but initially told us we'd need to pay $600 to move the flight. This was an absurd request seeing as Air China made this mess, not us. Ultimately we did not pay the fee and our flight was moved appropriately. We made the best of the situation but Air China made our trip extremely stressful and unpleasant. This was a trip booked over 6 months ago and we were really looking forward to it. Instead, we lost an entire day of our vacation because of Air China's incompetence and were not able to relax. I would not recommend traveling with this airline via Beijing. The only good things I can say about this airline is that the staff was nice (1-2 people we interacted with were unpleasant or unhelpful) and the food/beverage service on the flights was fast and  efficient. Food was generally okay.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Air China offers great value for money and a decent, but not outstanding quality and service. I have flown Air China on around 30 legs now and I am very satisfied with their service. Value for money is unbeatable for some of their deals. Inflight meals are okay, beverages offered as well. Nothing outstanding but everything you would expect or need. Inflight entertainment is alright, a mix of Western and Asian movies. The fleet is not the most modern and in a few occasions the entertainment is not working in some seats. (1 out of maybe 50). I had one damaged bag which I claimed damaged and received 50 euro. On another occasion, my bag did not make the extremely short layover and was sent to my hotel 3 hours later. Air China however does not allow the operation of mobile phones, not even in flight mode! I would like to highlight that on my last trip I missed my plane due to my own fault and the Air China hotline rebooked me on the next available flights (2 legged flight!) Free of charge!

Although it’s marginally less expensive than some other airlines it’s not worth the headache. Every single person we encountered that worked for this airline was rude and showed no empathy. The food is hardly edible and drinks are barely edible. The real nightmare started when we missed our return flight. They would not put us on another flight later that day or the next day. When we offered to buy new tickets to Beijing to make our connection to New York they informed us that our second leg of the trip would not be honored because we missed the first flight, change fee or buy completely new tickets. They also said that they could not change or sell any tickets from the two airports in Tokyo. How is this possible? We walked to the American Airlines counter and bought two tickets to JFK.

The LAX-PEK leg was on a Boeing 777-300. The flight departed LAX around 12:40am on time. I had an aisle seat. The seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom and were slightly wider than other airlines. The seat back entertainment had limited number of movies and TV shows, but I was more interested in sleeping than watching a movie. The flight crew did a reasonable job serving the after departure meal and breakfast. The meals were edible, nothing special. One complaint I have is they could have been through the cabin more often with water and juices during the flight. I gave myself several hours for transit through Beijing. This was reasonably fast and I had no problems. On the Tokyo leg the flight was on an A321. The interior of this plane was a bit tatty. The seats were comfortable, but a little thread bear, but tolerable for a short 2 hour 40 minute flight. Again on this flight the flight crew could have been through with water or juice more often.

Then they kept misleading the passengers to wait for an hour, to get the problems solved, but kept delaying more. Eventually we are told to return the next day for the next flight. No compensation provided. No hotel rooms provided. Passengers were stranded from different locations without even knowing if the airline will book further connecting flights or not. No courtesy towards passengers. Rampant language problem. The flight hostess didn't even understand English. We were stranded in Auckland for a day, sleeping in the airport. After returning to check in counter the next day, they didn't take our issue or priority and we were the third last people to get our boarding passes, that too through a different route.

No care given and despite pushchair requested at the gate at Beijing it went through to baggage claim which at 1.30am and the immigration nightmare that awaited us this was a real issue. The aircraft was too hot and on board staff were unhelpful with helping with seat location and general assistance with luggage and narrow aisles whilst carrying children. Children’s meals were placed in front of the children and the foil containing the food was piping hot. Very dangerous. I told the hostess who remained emotionless and walked off expressionless. 5 hrs into the flight I was told I could not listen to my music on iPhone? Seats are very uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment is ok however the handset is dated to the 1980s so it doesn’t work and frustrates you trying to access films. Toilets are disgusting and not maintained by crew.

I chose it for the really affordable price and booked it through my chase ultimate rewards, as some others had mentioned it is impossible to check in online therefore although I was able to chose my seats when booking my flight I had a hard time changing it and I wasn't able to choose my meal options. They do feed you a lot on the plane, but the food was disgusting, like even their rice was bad (tasted like paste with a play-doh consistency) - coming from an airline that has ""China"" in it is shocking since most Asian diets consist of rice. Since I don't eat a lot of meat I asked the flight attendant if she had a vegan or fish option and she said she will check but completely forgot about it and when she came around to ask what everyone wanted to drink I asked her again and she finally went in search of my vegan meal. She came back with it but gave me an attitude saying I should request it ahead of time next time -  if your site had given me the option to trust me I would have! The bread isn't fresh and taste stale so I pretty much ate nothing throughout my whole 12 hour flight to Beijing (layover) thankfully my reserve card enabled me to have access to the premium lounges and I chose Air China first class lounge. The food was okay I suppose, there was a good variety of hot food and the staff are attentive at cleaning up the plate and the bathroom is clean, literally I threw a tissue in the garbage can and a cleaning lady went in right after me picked it up and tossed it outside... anyways they have an open bar with limited alcohol, but their noodle station was a big hit and although I had to camp for it got myself a few bowls of these to make up for the terrible flight meal. The recliner seats in the first class lounge is trash, ripped seats and doesn't recline unless you decide to throw all your weight into leaning back then it might budge, the private rooms are the worst! Broken ripped massage chairs with a box of tissue in front I felt like I would catch something just sitting on the chair. The worst part bout this airline was that they damaged my luggage and it's nearly impossible to get through to them at their jfk line or via email.

For the price paid for the ticket, I can't complain. Check-in was 30-45 minutes at BKK and IAD. Staff were friendly and checked my baggage through with no hassles. No bag-drop line for those who check in online at either airport so one has to queue with everyone else in economy. The online check in on their flight didn't work for my return flight to BKK which put me in a middle seat for the Beijing to Bangkok leg. IFE was OK. There were power ports for laptops in economy on Boeing 777-300ER flights. Food was edible. Beer and wine were available. Flight attendants were reasonably friendly and came through every so often with water.  60-80 minutes is a tight connection through T3 in Beijing so if you're on a tight connection, get a Air China sticker from staff and they'll escort you to the front of the transit-security line after your boarding pass is checked.

Entertainment wise, I felt that it was dated and they definitely can improve a lot more on it. Cabin crew were very polite and cheerful, I was able to converse in Mandarin and thus have no issues. They know a little English but do not expect much. Ground Service: JFK has always been known for screw ups including delays, cancellations and baggage loss. I was expecting that since I was traveling during the winter. However, what Air China could have done better was to have better service recovery. The re-booking of flights were horrendous, I had to hold the line for an hour and was cut off a few times as well. The NRT counter for Air China did not seem to know the airline policies, they re-booked us on an economy flight and forced us to accept it. They said that if we do not accept it, we had to call Air China on our own. This was unacceptable! They were also unaware if the difference in fare would be refunded. I obviously rejected and thus had to re-book on my own. Lounge in Beijing was reasonable but not fantastic. They can certainly improve on the food selection. The shower rooms are aged as well.

For the cheap fare I paid, the flying experience wasn't bad. However, the same cannot be said for my return flight from New York to Beijing on 7th January 2018 and Beijing to Singapore on 9th January 2018. My experiences were horrible. 1) I reached JFK Airport at 12.30 pm on 7th January to check in for my flight CA972, which was scheduled to depart at 3.50 pm. The check in process was messy and chaotic. There was no clear organized way and I was only able to check in a few minutes before the departure time. Quite a number of Passengers were still to be checked in after me and I believe that this was the reason the flight got delayed. 2) First, we were told that the flight got delayed for 2 hours. This was acceptable. We were also given 20 dollars worth of meal vouchers, which wasn't bad. Then, for no clear reason, our flight got delayed by almost 12 hours and we only took off at 4 am the next day. We were not given any further meal vouchers after the first one. The delay time was ridiculous. I would surely miss my connecting flight to Singapore. 3) The flight was actually pleasant and I reached Beijing at 8 am local time on the 9th January. The employees at the Air China Transfer Counter changed my ticket to Singapore on another flight 8 hours later. I was tired and asked if they would be offering any hotel. They did. However, instead of directing me to get a 1 day Visa in Beijing, they directed me to international transit. They told me that I would be able to find Air China employees there (inside the transit area) who would help me to with the hotel. All this time, I could hear them cursing in Chinese, muttering under their breath. I am not Chinese (South Asian), but understand the Chinese swear words from my stay in Singapore. When I confronted them about it, the became very rude and started avoiding me. Frustrated, I left for the transit area. Once I got in, I could not find any Air China personnel in the Transit area. I was stuck there tired with no hotel or food or lounge access. I could not go back out to confront those employees. The flight back to Singapore was pleasant. But they forgot to update my Kosher meal preference. I was too frustrated at that point to even respond. It had been 2 days on the road and I just wanted to come back home. So far this is my worst experience ever. I have nothing against the in-flight crews. They were very nice. But the Air China ground staff in Beijing were extremely rude and intentionally unhelpful.

They said I have to go to their office to pick up the inconvenience fee. They can't send it to my hotel or deposit to my bank, only pick up available. Which will cost me half a day. One on vacation, this is lost one day. And they didn't tell the customers about the inconvenience fee available, you got only if you ask.

We even had 2 conference call with both AirChina and travel agents during which they were just blaming each other and not resolving the issue.

The fare was the cheapest during the time I booked it, however the overall experience was horrible. On the way to Manila, one of my 2 checked in luggage was lost-and getting a hold of an agent both in airport I arrived and through the phone was a nightmare. Food was subpar (I've had worse) and the bathroom's stink level is variable depending on the time you go there. When I got back to the States (this time via Houston), I was able to pass through the immigration line fast however my bags took a long time to get out of the conveyor belt. When I looked around, it wasn't only be who was in panic mode and kept looking at my watch as most of us had connections to make (mine was to Atlanta via United). I tried talking to the agent in the airport who was near the conveyor belt regarding my situation but to my surprise, she was very rude and told me I have to pay for my fare to Atlanta in case I miss my connection. By then, you can imagine how desperate and tired I was and I was near to tears by then but she simply looked irritated and later on I realized she was displaying that sort of attitude to everyone who was inquiring about the fiasco of delayed bags and connecting flights. Fortunately for me, when I went straight to the United counter, the guy there was very sympathetic and booked me on another flight, same day with no extra charge since I did miss my connecting flight. Now that was what customer services should be. Even if I ended up in the end paying for it (which thank God I did not), treating your customers like dirt when they are dead tired from flying over 12 hours isn't how I think customer service should be, The only good thing about this airline is the cheap price of their tickets-however if your may concern is getting through your trip without fear of losing your luggage or dealing with airline personnel who will be polite and at the very least professional to you-this is not the airline for you.

I approached the airline's duty manager and initially he tried to refer me another ticketing agent, but I refused his referral and insisted that he resolved the problem for me. He then offered to upgrade me to Premium Economy , but we had to wait at the gate until the last minute before they could know if they could upgrade us. This, I also rejected as there was no assurance that I could get the upgrade and we might ended up seating in seperate seat in different rows. Finally, he relented and issued two seat numbers next to each other. From the onset, why didn't the duty manager allocate us the seats rather than trying to pass the buck?

I just came back from a 2 week trip across China and I found myself flying with Air China multiple times over that span of time. I was skeptical about this airline in the first place, but I had no choice since the flights were already included in the travel packet. What can I say, it lived up to my lowest expectations, and the worst were international routes, especially the one from Milan to Beijing. We flew on an A330 but the aircraft looked as old as the hills and was impossibly noisy, so much so that I had serious trouble following the movies I was watching. Corridors are narrow and the space between seats is very limited and their entertainment offer is mostly made of Chinese movies. On top of that, my monitor was completely dead and there was no way to bring it back to life. I pointed it out to the flight attendants many times and they kept coming and going first trying to fix it themselves and then saying they'd try to reset the whole system, but to no avail. Luckily there was a spare seat in the row in front of me so I moved there, only to find out that the guy who had been previously sitting there had moved away himself because that monitor wasn't working properly either. As it turned out, it was insanely slow and some buttons on the remote weren't working (yeah there were remotes if you're wondering, the ones you pull out of the seat and then back in), but hey that was as good as it went! The service was virtually non existent - the crew only stopped by twice for meals and that was it. If you wanted water you had to look for them yourself and ask for it and they would come and pour you a glass of water. As for the food, I didn't touch anything because it was terrible. Overall it made for a very uncomfortable flight. A guy sitting next to me told me he had flown with Air China in the past for work, but he didn't recall it to be that bad and that the aircraft looked the same as the one he had flew in 10 years ago. This said, it should hardly be surprising that I was dreading the idea of having to take internal flights as I was expecting those aircrafts to be even older. I was pleasantly surprised instead since their internal routes turned out to be much better. The aircrafts were just regular airbuses and they were quiet enough. Oh one more thing, the pilots' English is barely understandable, I'm no native speaker but I'm fluent in English so I don't have any trouble with listening, but these pilots are the worst! Flight attendants are slightly better, but don't venture beyond basic stuff or else you'll lose them. In summary, the only plus is that it's is way cheaper than any other airline and offers highly competitive fares, however if you have a choice pick another airline at least for your long-haul flight! With hindsight, I would probably had paid a little bit more and bought the flight with Etihad or Lufthansa, even with a layover.",Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0

It was a series of disasters. We arrived at Sydney International Airport to be told that our first leg to Brisbane was with Virgin and left from the Domestic Terminal. Admittedly this may have been the fault of our tour company (Cruise 1st). We were then told that we were sitting 4 rows apart on opposite sides of the plane. We later learnt that 140 people who had booked through Cruise 1st were all in the same boat. We were told at Check in that we would have to arrange ourselves once the plane had taken off. We did do this but it was a bit of a disaster. We were one of the lucky couples who got to sit next to each other. One meal out of 5 we could eat - many others could not eat their meals either. They were disgusting. Ate a bread roll (cold, old and in cellophane) and a small entree salad. We had an 8 hour layover in Chengdu on our way back from Shanghai (Cruise 1st only let us know this when it was too late to cancel). Due to our cruise ship being delayed by fog some were late to the airport in Shanghai. There were 40 people in the queue to check in when they closed the desk and would not listen to any complaints. These people had then to all catch alternative flights from Shanghai to Chengdu costing between $400 and $550 pp. The plane then proceeded to stay at the gate for about 30 mins after the final person was on board.

From their website which you have to be a member of to book a flight, to their check-in staff, to the flight crew in the air and beyond, this airline is a disaster. I am not sure how they function domestically let alone internationally or how on earth they have become a part of the Star Alliance Group.  The majority of their flights are domestic, as it is a state run airline, so answerable to no one and regulated by some rather questionable practices. So, I suppose I answered my own question. Check in is by someone who speaks very little English. They offer very little service especially if you are a priority member but not part of their program. They mislead you and tell you that you are on this type of airline. An agent in Beijing when I asked to upgrade on an A320 told me that there was only First Class available at some insane amount. I know the configuration of the short-haul flight and there is no First Class on this flight. On another occasion I was seated in an exit row, and on the return flight they stated they could not seat a non-Chinese national in an exit row. This was a flight taken both within the country. On a flight from Wuhan to Beijing, the flight started to taxi, was just off the ground and at around 2000ft when, the flight attendant came on and started the” “Ladies and Gentlemen, please prepare for take off” speech while we had already left the ground and were not just taking off but where already in air. Well.. at least she remembered to make the announcement. Air China Planes: The planes are old and the interior is falling apart. Seat-back with the cloth from the 80’s coming of, cracked tray tables on the “updated planes”, screens that do not come down (no there are not screens on the backs of the seats), the speakers too loud or too quiet when they make announcements beyond that, the inflight entertainment is what most airlines had 20 years ago. They cram and cancel flights to force people on other flights, to fill them. The flight crew, in general, cater to their own people. They storm by offering headsets but assume if you are a foreigner that they can simply ignore you. If you ask for something they all of a sudden cannot understand you.

Check-in staff in TPE to my surprise told me that my suitcase cannot be checked through to FRA as PVG is ""not an Air China hub, unlike PEK"". Since the check-in staff did not work directly for Air China, I did not make a direct complaint, but this must be mentioned when booking a connection itinerary. The assumption when booking this kind of flight with both legs operated by the same airline is that bags will be checked through to your final destination! This meant that I had to clear customs and haul my suitcase into central Shanghai for the less than 24hrs layover. Furthermore, the transfer visa staff at Pudong was very rude. I did not have my full itinerary printed in this electronic day and age (just my confirmation number written down) and immigration staff insisted on seeing a copy of my onward journey (as I also didn't have my boarding pass for the onward flight because TPE staff could only check me in to PVG). No Wifi is accessible in Pudong Airport to travellers without a Chinese SIM card, meaning I was unable to access my booking on my phone/iPad, unbelievable! This meant that the immigration staff had to physically go to Air China to check the passenger list for tomorrow to see if I'm on it, making me wait 30 min at the counter. Service onboard is below average and smiles seem faked. The food and drinks offering is substandard with none of the alcoholic beverage offerings on other carriers. My IFE touchscreen was very hard to navigate (touch function almost broken), meaning that pausing a film when going to the toilet was not possible easily. Film selection very limited, outdated and often in Chinese. Advice: Avoid Air China stopovers like the plague, however tempting it might seem to explore Beijing or Shanghai! And avoid Air China in general if you have other choices.

My tks were purchased from Orbitz, which repeatedly told me that AirChina was my ticket ""stock"" holder, or in another word, Air China was in charge of my connection to JetBlue (it seemed to me that Orbitz paid Air China). Due to the snow storm on the east coast, this flight was delayed, and someone, not clear whether it was Air China or Orbitz, did change my JetBlue flight from the evening of the 4th to the morning of the 5th - so far someone was being responsible. What happened next was that CA981 flow to Chicago O'Hare that night, and it would fly to JFK on the afternoon of the 5th, hence there is no way that I can make my connecting flight. On CA981, we were told to get a hotel for overnight on our own, and Air China will reimburse up to $150 of the cost. I did this, emailed the receipt, boarding pass, and a cover letter to Air China.

It's been 3 months. Since I couldn't find anyone at O'Hare or by phone from Air China to change my connecting flight (Orbitz told me it's Air China's responsibility), I had to waste the ticket from JFK to Boston.

I initially received an email saying that my flight type, had been changed from business to economy. When contacting Air China, I was informed that I would be flying with Air China, however there would be no flight miles on this sector. This is a joke, given that the ticket from Geneva to Xiamen and return cost CHF4400. I had selected the seat numbers during my booking and the seat numbers were clearly indicated in my flight itinerary. However, on my flight from Beijing, we were issued different seat numbers and I did not make a fuss since it was a late night flight and all i wanted to do was get back home. I did not have anything to eat, and fell asleep shortly after take off, I could not get the seat to recline 14A, but thought this was because I was tired. Later on about 2 hours after take off, I again tried with no success. Then i tried to switch on the TV, and called the flight attendant multiple times, they reset 4 times without any success. I approached the manager and initially he tried to refer me another flight attendant to assist. I refused his referral and insisted that he resolved the problem for me. He then informed me that he would try to reset the tv again, and would try to get the seat to recline. By this time it was about 6am in the morning, as we had departed 2am Beijing time. So no chair that reclined, nor a tv that worked. Feeling very frustrated i called the attendant again and told him that this was unacceptable. During all this time, I kept getting these looks, as if to say what do you expect us to do? Finally, he relented and said he would see if he could find me another seat, this was almost 5 hours later. From the onset, why didn't they just suggest this. All the passengers were asleep and i informed him that i didnt feel it would be right to wake the rest of the passengers. I changed 3 hours prior to landing, as I had a terrible backache, but will never fly with this airline again. Small seats in business class, tine screens if you seated in front seats, and more importantly nothing that works. So in effect i could have flown economy as i basically received the same kind of seat and very little assistance from the staff!? Even, my written complaint to the airline had fallen on a deaf ear. This is my first and last time flying this airline. This is the worst airline I have flown with and will refuse to fly with them again",Business,1.0,nan

I normally don't give complaints because I always try to find the silver lining in situations, but I will this time. Though Air China had some of the best deals, it's only a good deal if everything goes smoothly. I ran into lots of trouble on this trip, and it ended up costing me much more than if I had flown with a more reputable company with better customer policies. I ended up paying lots of money for a very frustrating experience, not even able to take my trip after all. First of all, when I checked my E-ticket, it said the airlines was in ""Terminal I"" Once I got to Terminal 1, I found out, it was the wrong Terminal! The ""I"" of ""Terminal I"" stood for ""International."" Because of that I missed my flight. To rebook the flight, I was charged about $300. Shortly after rebooking, I found an error in my ticket. To correct the error, it cost me another $200. It also took a period of 5 hours to get all of this sorted! I was on an off the phone with them and had to call them back several times for emails they promised to send me but hadn't. I had my layover in Beijing Capital Airport. Thirty minutes after de-boarding, I realized I left my passport in the airplane seat pocket. After notifying staff (telling them my seat number too), they said they couldn't find it. (Which turned out to be false - several days afterwards, I received a call saying my passport had been found in the seat pocket) I thought they were talking to each other trying to figure out my passport situation. So that's why I followed them and once I realized what was happening, it was too late. They forced me through the security check and back onto an airplane flying back to Japan cause, ""If no passport, no be in China!"" they shouted at me. Once home, I called Air China to voice my complaint. It took about 2 hours. Rather than taking care of the problem themselves, they kept referring me to another number. In the end, I was fortunate enough to talk to a caring and reasonable agent. But they said there is little that can be done. I spent thousands of dollars, just to have 24+ hours of one frustrating experience after another. I understand that part of it was my fault but also, doesn't everyone make mistakes? I feel Air China has no mercy helping customers with their troubles; instead, seems they prey on the problems as a way to bring in more income for themselves. I definitely do not recommend Air China!",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
