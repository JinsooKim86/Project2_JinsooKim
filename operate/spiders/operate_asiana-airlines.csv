At the boarding gate airline members carried out an accurate weight and size-inspection of carry on luggage.  Seats were comfortable enough for this 2-hour-flight. In flight entertainment selection is mediocre. Flight attendants are very strict with drinks being brought into the cabin. I carried a beverage which I bought in the departure hall, when they caught me sipping at it they requested me to give it up and started making a fuss over it. Meals were served during the short flight, quality was acceptable. Considering the bargain ticket a recommendable airline.",Business,5.0,nan

However all legs were excellent. We had the same seats for all our flights and the same aircraft as well, the A380. We were in 9E and 9F. Embarkation was smooth and awe were warmly greeted as we arrived to the aircraft and directed to our seats. The FA's were all very polite and professional and friendly. The lie flat quadra-smartium seats were fine though I do think they could provide a duvet for extra padding. However we slept well. The food was very good and the selection of wine, beer and spirits was quite good. I like a Scotch and they had an 18 yr old Chivas Regal or a 17 yr old Ballantine's and the cognac was a camp XO, very good! The IFE was fine and we had plenty of movies and other programming to choose from. Most importantly its the high level of professionalism displayed on board by the staff that really sells it for me. I am treated like a most welcome guest.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

This was my first flight with Asiana Airlines, which I took after having checked it had the new business class. It was an excellent flight. Configuration is 1-2-1. Seats are wider than on British Airways and there's pretty good storage. Service was excellent, food was good. WiFi worked perfectly. Small quibble but movies were mostly poor quality (ie poorly reviewed) and not as extensive as the best systems. All in all, an excellent trip, and I’d be very happy to fly them again, with the new business class.",Business,4.0,5.0

Very limited entertainment, around 10 movies in total that you don't even want to watch because the screen is small and old. I don't understand why Asiana will deploy an old aircraft with limited entertainment for a long haul flight. Please use these old aircrafts for short hauls. The only saving grace was the food!

Flight with Asiana Airlines was very comfortable with great service and inflight food. My flight was overnight and allowed me to sleep on my normal schedule and arrive refreshed. I will definitely add this to my list of preferred airlines. Seats are spaced for great leg room and the seat width is comfortable for a 6 foot, 240 pound man.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

My friend and I packed some snacks and drinks on the flight and while settling down in our seats are so inconvenient as there are other passengers walking along the aisle. Cabin staff took initiative to help us hold on to our food as we are putting our carry-on luggage at the overhead cabinet and waited patiently till we’re done with putting our carry on luggage. Throughout the flight she smiled while serving food, drinks or even just walking down the aisle. Hoping that this compliment will reach her so that she could keep up her good work. However the downside of the seat is the legroom is too small for my legs if there’s wider legroom it would be more comfortable. Nonetheless, I would fly Asiana Airlines again if I ever have a chance to visit Korea again.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,2.0,September 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Seoul to Singapore,4.0," | Food wise, it was bleah to meh but palatable. The FA were quite fast to attend to general request. The IFE screen was small and the selection of movies was meagre but with the small screen with poor resolution, my handphone (Samsung Note 3) provided better entertainment if I wanted to use it. I pre-ordered an item for Duty Free purchase for my wife on the prior flight and supposed to collect it on this flight. However, they said there was a mistake made by the FA on the prior flight who helped make our pre-order. The response that I got was: ""please call us when you reach your destination and we will sort it out."" What? Call? I told them they should try to rectify it on their end and when we disembark. Why aren't the FA trained properly? It could have been better managed!",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 777-200LR,Economy Class,4.0,July 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,Sydney to Istanbul via Seoul,4.0," |  Sydney to Istanbul via Seoul. Wonderful staff and even though it was an older plane the seat was comfortable with good legroom. Unfortunately, the entertainment choices were limited and the equipment was poor and old. Luckily, the Korean films were very entertaining and had English subtitles because none of the other world movies did. The plane was delayed one hour on the runway in Sydney, whilst they waited for the meals and again when a passenger didnt feel well. However, we made up the time in the air. The Sydney to Incheon leg was a day flight leaving in the morning, however the blinds were closed for the 9 hour trip. The same happened from Incheon to Istanbul, again a day flight of 9 hours, so it was quite stuffy particularly because the cabin temperature was warm. I preferred the excellent Korean food over the western meal and kept hydrated with tonnes of water rather than trying their alcohol. All flights were full but the staff were exemplary; remaining patient and smiling. The toilets were surprisingly always clean and in order.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
A380,Business Class,5.0,July 2018,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes,New York to Bangkok via Seoul,4.0," |  New York to Bangkok via Seoul. Both Sections were on A380. First the good news, planes were immaculately clean, staff were superb throughout, food was great on first leg, not so good on BKK section. Both planes were delayed, we had received notification that the JFK to ICN flight times had changed, about one hour later departure, but we left about another one after this this. It appears that OZ221 is always late leaving JFK, its not the airport issue as the KE ( a380 ) seems to leave on time every day around the same time. Connection at ICN was tight, but the plane was delayed once we had boarded. Food option poor only two choices on ICN to BKK, no Korean option! Movie choice on ICN to BKK poor only 4 Hollywood movies. The price was keen and would use again.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

The inflight meal was good quality and FAs served for passengers politely. For the return flights, when I checked-in at CJU, I could through check-in to HKG and no need to pick-up checked luggage at GMP even though my connecting flights depart at ICN.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,July 2018,2.0,4.0,1.0,no,Sydney to London via Seoul,3.0," | Flew Sydney to London via Seoul and return in economy. After reading many reviews about Asiana I thought I'd fly with them this time back to the UK but after this time, I won't bother again. It's not that they're bad but SIA and Cathay Pacific are so much better. The food was nothing special and rather odd in texture, the entertainment system was old with poor response from the touch screen and very limited choice of movies. I don't sleep well on flights so usually spend a lot of time watching movies, I didn't finish one. Baggage allowance was a measly 20kg. Not that I expect to travel with all my household furnishings but I'd like to travel and not worry I'm going to go over my weight allowance. On the outbound flight from Sydney my wife was asleep so I ate her snack, my bad. After she woke up I went to see if I could get her another one. That was a no as she already 'had' her allocated snack. With Cathay, just in the crew area they have bowls of fruit and other snacks that you can help yourself to. Want something hot, no bother with CX, have some noodles. An annoying thing when you're trying to sleep is that whenever we hit turbulence the screen would light up. I don't understand Korean and maybe it's something to do with the Korean language but you'd get these long announcements but in English it ends up garbled and very brief. Does Korean use more to say less? I'm Asian myself and can understand that many Asians have trouble with the English language but considering English is the language all airlines are supposed to use the standard was poor and I missed more than I actually caught. I suppose you get what you pay for and they where at the cheaper end of the price scale but still, it's the little things that add up to make it a less than an experience I'd want to repeat.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

I spent over an hour finding someone who would correct my flight schedule, which they did by adding an extra leg. That followed up with 6 + 4 hours of delays, missing on my last leg which they refused to rebook on another partner airline that was leaving sooner. All in all, a 16-20 hour trip turned into a 36 hour ordeal and nothing from the airline for all meals bought and hotels stayed at. Pretty sure I'm not going to use this airline again.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Asiana's business class seats are in a staggered 1-2-1 configuration on the A380. The seats could be turned into a flat bed and were very comfortable, in particular considering that it was only a three-hour-flight. Service was friendly and very efficient, and the quality of the food was impressive for a rather short flight. I would take Asiana again without hesitation.",Business,5.0,nan
A350-900,Business Class,1.0,June 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,no,Seoul to London ,3.0, | Flew Asiana Airlines from Seoul to London. Staff were more interested in chatting in the kitchen area than helping the passengers and made you wait when you asked for something. Food was very ordinary so I skipped the second meal and entertainment is limited. On the plus side the seats are individual ones next to the window and are quite big and flat.,Business,2.0,nan

Except from the announcements (turbulence, arriving message, etc) played over the PA system, all other announcements (asking if anyone wanted extra servings of beverages or had rubbish for throwing, etc) relayed by the flight attendants face-to-face were done in the Korean language only. No efforts were made by the cabin crew to engage non-Korean speaking passengers, as they seemed to have forgotten that there were passengers of other nationalities on board. In this aspect, Korean Air fared far better.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Ground staff did a great job, they worked hard and they were very busy to minimize the delay.

The flight crew was very polite entertainment system had a great selection of movies takeoff and landing was good and the flight was smooth overall! I really appreciated the drinks that the flight crew brought us every 20 minutes or so starting at the middle of the flight! ICN-SGN was somewhat less desirable. We scrambled from security and nearly missed the connecting flight but the airport crew was very kind and let me and about 30 others through. The Boeing 777 was very cramped and I was stuck in the middle seat the entertainment system was aged and it was really hard to sleep so the flight seemed much longer than SEA-ICN.,nan,5.0,nan

Hotel stopover included with outward flight and Asiana foolishly bus you into town and back robbing you of much of your time – they should use an airport hotel. The downtown stopover hotel was very good but it offered very ordinary food as part of Asiana’s package.

As the whole trip from Sydney to London is during daylight hours I prefer to have the blinds up. On the Seoul-London sector the cabin crew insisted that blinds be lowered. I complained to the airline only to be told that the blinds are lowered to enable people to rest. Travelling to London from Sydney I get a nights sleep before the flight where I am expected to ""rest' then a night in a hotel in Seoul followed by a daylight flight to London where I am expected to ""rest"" again. I was informed that I could use my personal light to read if I wanted to.

Business class passengers are given priority boarding and lines were orderly and organised comparatively superior to American carriers. Meals served soon after take-off with Korean and Western options in three courses. Flight attendants frequently checked on the passengers with a delightful attitude and drinks were served multiple times. Seats were wide and comfortable as expected in a five star airline.

Staff a fairly attentive get the immigrations forms out quickly and always offer a pen if asked for it. They are also good at getting people to put seats up when you are trying to work or eat. They also leave it to the last minute before landing before getting electronic devices off. Food is probably the best I have had in economy with the exception of Dragonair. Whilst you don't get a selection it is usually very edible and portions a OK.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,Flew from Seoul to Sydney overnight food and service again very good seat average but at least this one on a 777 I could recline fully though the footrest would not lift high enough so when laying flat or near flat it caused you to lie with your back concave leading to back pain and the footrest was a clip on leaving a gap just big enough to catch my heels. Really on a trip this length a 5 star airline should have lay flat seats. Also the AVOD was poor with movies only available on a loop viewed on a grainy screen. How can an airline be rated 5 star without on demand video on a reasonable screen? I fly Qantas regularly in business class and really there is not enough in my view for Asiana to qualify for the extra star. They really need to upgrade the aircraft I flew on then they would qualify for the extra star to be 5 star.,nan,4.0,nan

Had pod style seats which were reasonably comfortable till you reclined the pitch was a little tight as when I reclined I couldn't raise the footrest fully because my feet would not fit under the seat in front with my shins up against the seat pocket rail in front and the seat only reclines about half way back. Recommendation based on this flight in future if I have to do this leg I'll try to schedule so I do it in reverse so I don't have to try to sleep. Service and food met 5 start expectation but the seat and plane condition definitely do not. It had AVOD but choice of movies a little limited.,nan,4.0,nan

The seats were nice and wide with good legroom far superior to the economy class in Singapore Airlines and they seemed softer than most economy cabins allowing for restful sleep. The food was excellent especially the Korean option. Flight attendants frequently served drinks which were much appreciated. Cabin was maintained well and toilets were kept clean and stocked throughout the flight. Although the IFE was rather limited.

Pillow and blanket were provided. HAN-ICN on newer A333. Delayed 45 mins due to airplane connection problem. Plane was clean and leg room was fantastic. Pillow and blanket provided. FAs seemed to be tired and half-hearted. Wide screen and new version PTV but the ones on my seat and on my friend's seat right behind me froze up and not working at all during the whole flight.

While I have read many times about how good Asiana's economy seats are I found my seat very uncomfortable it felt unusually hard and I was unable to sleep. The head support cushion extended out too far to allow me to use my neck pillow. Then my entertainment system froze up on me in the last hour segment of the flight to ICN and it happened again when returning to Seattle. Then there were the never ending announcements seemed a little louder than necessary and too frequent. On the final leg of my return trip into Seattle the staff servicing my area weren't as good as before seemed a little bit miserable. One attendant was clearly annoyed when I asked for a replacement headset mine wasn't working on one side.

On the outbound flight breakfast and lunch was provided with mini snacks in between. The overall quality of the meals were great and there were plenty of it as I still had the option I wanted despite being served towards the end.

The lack of full lie flat seats I can cope with as I'm of average build and height. 4 hour layover at ICN may have been at a quiet time but plenty of seats in lounge shower available within 15 mins of booking and very well appointed - no complaint there. 2nd leg on A330 had been led to believe that Asiana are progressively upgrading their business class to herringbone configuration but alas this aircraft was also Pulman albeit with one less seat per row which made the cabin more spacious. Now had OD IFE and touch screen controls which worked fine in economy but with a 60"" pitch you need to release your seat belt to perch on the edge of your seat to be able to touch the screen. Otherwise you have to use the remote which has a strange logic all of it's own. Cabin crew are polite and attentive - somewhat robotic. Ordered a G and T which duly arrived but when the meal was served and I asked for a glass of wine she did a double take before returning with the wine list. I realised that what you first order is what they'll attentively serve you the rest of the flight there is no such thing as a pre-dinner drink.

IFE system between Seoul and London so outdated as to be non-functional (bring an iPad) and lacks 'western' content. The demanding of blinds-down during day-flights is becoming a big issue in these reviews and one that should really be addressed. No-one on the flight wanted to sleep following an early afternoon take-off. Many wanted to see the Mongolian landscape which is why they had asked for a window seat in the first place. This is especially true as one lands at LHR 6pm and therefore will go home or to a hotel have dinner and then try to 'sleep' again. Communication from the flight deck could also be better as the aeroplane just starts moving (on time) and the captain will say thank-you at the end of the flight. 50/50 then although in economy that seat-pitch is worth a lot.,nan,4.0,nan

Staff are unfailingly pleasant but the service fails often: requests forgotten or sometimes just ignored. On checking in at ICN yesterday for example I was told that I could not change my seat because the aircraft was full. Almost half the seats in business were empty. This has happened at least twice before. As others have observed the seats on 777s used on this route are not lie- flat and are five across. When the aircraft is full the cabin seems very crowded. Last night's flights was on an A330 - the AV was better but the seat and thus the quality of sleep was terrible. The food is ok but nothing to write home - or here - about.

Outbound we left late - with 90 mins delay in Incheon there was no chance to catch up a single minute thus an extremely loaded A333 left more than 90 min late for Taskent. Economy class had been overbooked many pax upgraded. These passengers were frequently visited by their friends/relatives from economy so there was an enormous traffic in the galleys. Cabin crew did not even do the minimum to stop this and ensure the comfort of the business class pax. Food and beverage service was ok but under these circumstances worse than expected. Flight back out of TAS delayed more than 4 hours and left at 3.28am. The attitude of passengers was again identical - and the cabin crew once again were helpless (or unwilling to intervene).

Ground staffs in ICN were excellent friendly and tried their best to accommodate me.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,My husband and I flew in economy from Sydney to London beginning of April and returned last week. We normally don't enjoy flying however our experience with Asiana Airlines was flawless and very comfortable. The seats were the most comfortable we have flown in and my husband who always suffers leg problems when flying had no issues at all both ways. The flight attendants really set the standards in their service and were top of their game throughout the flights. Even at the airport I had left my medications box on the plane but they still managed to find me and return it. TVs attached to every seat were very tech savvy and could be controlled by touching the screens. One stopover at Seoul and Asiana put us up at a luxury hotel for a night. We highly recommend Asiana and will certainly choose to fly again.,nan,5.0,nan

Very comfortable seats that are padded nicely and adjustable to a flat 180 degrees. Ample storage space and a multi-adapter power point also available. Amenity packs with unisex L'Occitane products were given as well. Wide seat back screens with large range of movies on demand and noise canceling headphones improved sound quality. Dining was superb and plentiful with an excellent variety of alcoholic beverages. Service from crew was an exemplar of exceptional business class service. Efficient transfers in Seoul and a ground staff waited at the gates to escort me to a tight connecting flight on another airline. Excellent service on the ground and onboard.,nan,5.0,nan

IFE had fantastic touch screens and AVOD though not on the Sydney to Seoul sector. I travel frequently with Asiana on different routes and their Sydney to Seoul flights are the only long haul flights that still have small screens and no AVOD. Would be good to update like on other routes. Complimentary hotel at the Seoul Hyatt provided with meals included. Looking forward to future flights.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,New York to Sydney (connection in Seoul) in economy last week. Checking in a breeze. Once at the airport I was assigned the seat and there were hardly any queues albeit full flight. Check-in staff were very friendly at JFK and ICN and got the job done efficiently. Boarding was also organized with lots of staff at hand. Very clean cabins and seats nicely upholstered and well maintained. Excellent legroom and good seat pitch (34 inches) meant seats didn't recline into your face. Comfortable slippers provided which were convenient to walk around in. Lots of inflight magazines available and an extensive range of duty free shopping at very reasonable prices. Lavatories serviced regularly and stocked well with toiletries and expensive creams. Extensive films with many recent films on demand. Staff service was thorough and genuine. Rarely had to press the call button as they were present walking the aisles checking on passengers even during sleep time. Meals were a standout also very generous and serving/clearing up was efficient. Arrivals ahead of schedule and disembarked feeling refreshed even after two consecutive overnight flights.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,My partner and I flew SYD-LHR return via ICN at the end of March. The flights from SYD-ICN and return were a bit disappointing compared with the INC-LHR flights. Being 9.5hrs long I would expect a quality entertainment system but instead we had a selection of 5 English language films (2 were children's) which played on a loop which were unable to pause when announcements were made by crew so they would speak over the top missing parts of the film. The ICN-LHR flights were excellent and the entertainment system was more modern and had a much better selection of films and TV which you could actually control. Staff on all Asiana flights were polite and helpful better than I have experienced on any other airline. Food was OK but could have improvement it was all pretty similar - the variety of dishes was very limited.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,Travelled the Red eye from ICN-HKG-ICN. Check in and boarding was efficient and ground staff very polite. I have flown many carriers in the past but nothing comes close to the customer service on Asiana. Crew were extremely attentive and always smiled when attending. Flight was full but was able to comfortably stretch my legs out. Sleeping comfort also really good as seats are wide and soft with good recline. Food was excellent and nice wines were offered to coach pax. Snacks and drinks served in regular intervals. Entertainment was AVOD and monitors were very big touch screens. Plenty of movies to watch for the duration of the flights. Travelling red eye flights can be very tiring especially in economy however Asiana did a terrific job making the journey comfortable and painless. Would definitely fly again.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,Third time traveling the San Francisco-Seoul route on Asiana and beginning to grow weary of the monotonous service quality that is being offered onboard. In the past 3 years I have travelled this route the in-flight meal has yet to be changed even once with the same old bibbimbap and western steak option and I am fed up with it. I recognise that the airline is attempting to remain consistent in the service that won over customers to begin with but too much routine feels a lot like stagnation. The staff have also lost a lot of their flair due to the absence of personal warmth and attentiveness that was once experienced and replaced with a robotic and mechanistic service. Overall Asiana got the job done well enough.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,Used Asiana Club points for a trip from Sydney to London return in business. Daytime flight from Sydney to Seoul then another daytime flight the following day to London. Overnight hotel provided at the Hyatt Regency was excellent. Return flights were faster though less appealing with 2 overnight flights with a good connection in Seoul. Check-in process on all legs were efficient and check-in staff very friendly and welcoming. Lounge in Incheon was an elegant space with good hot and cold food. First and last legs were in the older 777 models and I found the angled seat very comfortable with sufficient width and space. Very comfortable flat seats and offered plenty of room and storage space. On all legs meals were served up beautifully. Impressed by their selection of quality champagne wines and whisky. On top of main meals snacks were served. IFE was much better on the newer aircraft with plenty more movies and even wider screens. Amenity kit contained branded products and extra amenities such as combs toothbrushes cologne and facial sprays were available as needed in the lavatories. Outstanding service from the crew and both hard and soft products are among the best.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,5.0,Holiday of a lifetime to Britain from Australia which I planned for twelve months. Flights on time planes spotless but tired looking. AVOD shocking. Flight crew fantastic nothing too much trouble poor command of English. Meals ok if you like Asian food. Leg room in Economy the best I have ever had. While on holiday in the UK my wife fell and broke her arm she is in her late seventies. I pleaded with Asiana Airlines to change my wife's seating to the rear 2 seats or the bulkhead seats on the 777. They were not interested.,nan,4.0,nan

Asiana ground staff professional and very polite with their welcoming and during my escort to the boarding gates. Once onboard each of the attendants approached me to introduce themselves. Pre-flight beverages and snacks given without me having to ask followed by luxurious pyjamas and a Bvlgari amenity set. Cabin very clean and fresh. Toilets also kept pristine decorated nicely with a rose and toiletries facial creams and eau de toilette available. Scented hot towels given before meals and menus were very extensive in 5 courses. Food presentation and taste were impeccable (entrees aside which were largely forgettable). Alcohol options excellent with a variety of fine wines. Noise cancelling headphones given for AVOD and screens clear and wide. Seats were excellent and attendant turned off my reading lamp and placed a blanket when she noticed me doze off.

Food was excellent. My only complaint would be that AVOD was a little old model and you needed to press it very hard otherwise it missed repeatedly your touches. Though the large selection of up- to-date movies could compensate this. Altogether I gathered the best long haul flight experiences and will definitely fly Asiana Airlines again.,nan,5.0,nan

The seats laid back about 80% flat and were pretty uncomfortable. In-flight entertainment was poor with a very limited set of movies and no on-demand facility. Food quality was nothing special but wine choices were really excellent. Cabin staff were attentive and friendly but repeatedly made errors e.g. wrong cutlery forgotten drinks forgotten jackets etc. Cabin temperature was too high for comfortable sleep and water refills were thin on the ground.

They are good. However that experience was spoiled by the cabin temperature being so hot that we didn't sleep well. FA's seemed as though they were mechanical rather than really providing business class service. On the other legs FAs were more personal and attentive. The seats were the old style pods that do not lie flat. Food and drink were good and extremely well presented and plentiful. The downside of all legs was the extremely poor IFE. It was not on demand even in the Smartium cabin and the choice was very small. We had an overnight connection. The hotel provided by Asiana was not the Hyatt Regency but was the Best Western Premier Incheon Airport.,nan,4.0,nan

Used joint Air New Zealand lounge in Sydney very good though Asiana Business lounge in Incheon seemed superior with more modern facilities. Flights were very comfortable even though I had anticipated their new seats for a 10 hour flight the angled- flat seats were actually just as comfortable for sitting and sleeping. Meals served in courses and tasted very good and presented well. Nice screens for entertainment and many new movies available though not extensively.

Suites were very comparable to Etihad First Suites (probably not as luxurious though the design is very clever and perhaps better). Various functions of the seat made the flight some of the most comfortable I've experienced. AVOD was excellent and 32 inches made a significant difference in viewing. Seats very comfortable especially when sleeping. Crew made beds with duck down duvets and comfortable pyjamas also given. Meals were terrific and was washed down by top tier alcoholic beverages. Charming service from crew as expected and purser provided personal farewells at the end of the flight with gifts.,nan,5.0,nan

The aircraft was very clean staff very attentive the Korean food options excellent the seats the most comfortable I have experienced on any airline in economy. The only thing letting this flight down was the ancient seat back entertainment system. Please for a 10 hour plus flight give Australian customers the same privileges that Americans who fly long haul with Asiana appear to enjoy an entertainment system worthy of 2013 and not the 1990's.,nan,4.0,nan

Coffee and tea services frequent throughout the flights alongside other refreshments. IFE had impressive big monitors and quality was great.

Check in staff at Incheon and Heathrow were incredibly welcoming and efficient with hardly a queue despite arriving at peak time. Onboard the seats were very spacious with plenty of legroom and good padding made for some restful sleep. They feed you really well. Two excellent main meals with frequent provision of snacks and a variety of beverages in between. Entertainment system was very modern with large touch screens and lots of options were up to date. Plenty to last the flights but would have liked it more extensive. Clear highlight were the cabin crew who were cheerful and accommodating. If they weren't serving food they walked the cabins even during sleeping hours and often came around with refreshments for those still awake.

Second flight from Seoul to San Francisco was operated by an 777-200LR I expected to have a newer AVOD system on such a long haul flight but it was an old personal TV system again. Equipped with mainly Korean and little Chinese and Hollywood movies choices I gave up. I hope Asiana will upgrade their in-flight entertainment system at a quicker pace. I was served traditional Korean cuisine which was delicious not enough hot beverages choices.

Sitting was very comfortable and being a daytime flight I didn't sleep much though sleeping comfort was alright. Catering was high class with a wide range of quality food and wine in many courses. IFE had plenty of updated movies for a 10 hour flight but wasn't extensive. Upon reaching Seoul crew distributed Ferragamo gifts as a sign of gratitude.

Meals were 5 course multi options which were of high quality though ""Bibimbap"" was offered on all 4 sectors- im sure they could come up with something else from Korean cuisine!

Economy class seats are comparable to business class seats in other airlines like United and COPA that we frequently use. The economy class seat at Asiana reclines in two ways: it reclines the seat back but it also pulls forward the seat. Also and of outmost importance the distance between rows in economy seats are also comparable to the business class space in the other airlines mentioned before. Another surprise was the food onboard and the service both outstanding! Too bad they only flight to/from Asia and don't have flights within America or to Europe (from America).

Food was excellent. Mainly had the Western option but Korean was also delicious and portions were large. Seats were the best I've flown in with excellent legroom pitch and recline. It was just so easy to get comfortable. I've never encountered such polite cheerful and hardworking staff in my 15 years of flying.

The flight was oversold so did not get an Aisle seat as I was promised. Flight was delayed (not Asiana's fault but we were given a variety of excuses). Food was a real problem - vegetarian meal not loaded so when I was offered ground beef with rice or pork meal I refused and asked if there was any chance of anything else. No there was not so I was not fed for 12 hours. Why have only meat options onboard. Sadly catering has never been great on this carrier. I never used alternative carriers but whilst Asiana has stood still (i.e quality has not diminished) other carriers have stepped up their game and so its not a Asiana/Korean Air carve up on this route.

Their lounge in LHR is the Star one so nothing impressive. The best part is obviously on board. Their service is just perfect. The crew is extremely attentive and as opposed to other airlines you can definitely see them around during the night. Food and drinks also impeccable. Their lounge in ICN as the whole airport itself is amazing. Good food good drinks and more importantly their local team is very friendly. The return flight was equally pleasant.

We travelled Sydney to Seoul and Seoul to Frankfurt and return. The cabin crew were excellent - nothing was too much trouble. The five course meals that were served were of restaurant standard and beautifully presented. The beds while not quite lie flat were very comfortable and I managed a good sleep on all flights.

Not much seat pitch but otherwise the seats were up to expectations (not as good as the best such as Singapore) and the service efficient and charming. I would do this again but never to Sydney (or the other sectors with those angled seats) in Business again. How is it that a 2 hour flight has AVOD and an 11 hour flight does not?,nan,4.0,nan

Flight OZ746 on B747-400 bound for ICN departed on-time food and beverages served shortly after take-off. My choice was ""Beef Noodles"" and the taste was not good. However bread salad and dessert were good. Cabin crews smiled at all times and were very nice. We knew where to claim luggage through the inflight entertainment system after landing at ICN. The return flight was OZ745 on B747-400 a 15-minute delay on departure and ""welcome drink"" was served to us. Again food and beverages served shortly after take-off.

Daytime flight SYD-ICN very quiet cabin lunch rushed out very soon after 0930 departure and as cabin was so quiet was over very quickly. Cabin then plunged into darkness so not conducive to work. Tea served before arrival no offer of alcoholic drinks. ICN-SYD thought business lounge was awful. Granted it's being renovated but don't see how that justifies plastic tableware one choice of wine shockingly bad food. Cabin was full so service not nearly as good. Food quality fair at best.

Seating on Sydney to Incheon flight was not super comfortable as I kept slipping down in the recline position. Probably fine for a smaller and shorter passenger. I really appreciated the cabin kept in darkness and I did get some sleep on all legs. On one of the legs the cabin staff appeared a bit muddled and the meal service was slow and fragmented. A couple of particularly demanding passengers did not help the staff holding up the serving of meals to immediately attend to their needs. They should have been asked to wait a couple of minutes. Generally a great airline and would use Asiana again.,nan,5.0,nan

Bland and dated interior pretty ordinary seats (fabled generous pitch wasn't noticed) heavily creased or missing inflight magazines awful food (including a few entirely empty 'bowls' on my tray). Crew were OK nothing too special. In fact you only saw them for at the beginning and end of the flight. The rest of the time we were in darkness with all blinds strictly down.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,5.0,Seoul to Paris round trip. Both legs on B777-200 with 2-class configuration. Not a single empty seat on both flights yet the in-flight service was flawless. Very tasty meals were served in time and never rushed. Seats were wide and pitch was excellent. Recline was surprisingly generous but we were asked to seat upright at meal times. The biggest letdown was the lack of on-demand IFE; some 10+ channels of movies and short features on continuous loop. Quiet cabin and comfortable seats made me sleep good part of the journey and the service was never intrusive yet very effective. Just do something about the antique IFE!,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,LHR-SYD via ICN and return. 777-200 on all legs. A bit of a mixed bag really. Firstly their English language website seems clunky and I was unable to select a seat in advance as the system didn't recognise my check-in code. Although the cabin was blandly coloured and fairly dated the seats had plenty of leg room though and you don't feel cramped - the 3-3-3 layout really makes a difference as opposed to the more packed layout of newer 777s. The food was varied and generally good with interesting Korean dishes on offer for those in the mood to experiment though I opted for the Western option for all but one of the meals - probably more down to personal taste. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive if a bit robotic. IFE was much better on the ICN-LHR legs as these aircraft had AVOD Sydney legs had an older system with programmes stating every 2.5 hours which was frustrating. Overall a good selection of films but much smaller than EK. Transfer facilities at ICN were excellent free showers and plenty of comfy armchairs/recliners tucked away from the busy concourse to lie down on. The stopover Hotel in Seoul on the return journey the Seoul Royal was excellent with the restaurant service being the quickest I've experienced. Overall a few quibbles but significantly cheaper than the ME/SE Asian carriers and BA/QF and it gets you there well fed and in relative comfort which is after all the main thing.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,I flew Seoul Gimpo to Shanghai Hongqiao return. The first flight arrived well ahead of schedule and the second was about 5 minutes late due to air traffic congestion in Shanghai. The service was very friendly and professional. There was no choice of meals but the food they served was very nice. The seat was comfortable with lots of leg room and the entertainment was really good. I can't think of any significant fault with this service. The ticket price was only about $20 more than China Eastern and the service was much better.,nan,4.0,nan

Flew on an ageing A333 which still had Asiana's old interior the IFE at my seat wasn't working properly and the screen was fuzzy. Food choices were great - had the Korean breakfast choice which was chicken porridge very tasty. The seats were old and tired but well maintained and the cabin was dim and dark but clean. Strangely the FAs I interacted with during the flight seemed to speak very limited English - very smiley and helpful nonetheless.

Good food (ssambap for my lunch and a very nice hot croissant sandwich midway through flight) . Early arrival in LHR despite circling and then overflying to come in from west and luggage was on carousel as I arrived. Excellent flight.,nan,5.0,nan

On my trip back I was lucky enough to be flying on one of their retrofitted A333s - new cabin interior bigger screens more extensive and responsive IFE. The FAs were attentive and friendly and the food was great. The food cart ran out of choices by the time it reached my area so I had the Korean choice - bibimbap which was decent. The boarding process was smooth and seamless. A great flight overall.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,ICN-SYD Sydney to Seoul daytime flight. Lunch was served immediately and then cabin was plunged into darkness which I found odd and disappointing for a daytime flight - if the sun is shining outside I'd like to see it. BC cabin is very open and spacious and the service is attentive and outstanding - they couldn't have been more friendlier or helpful. The seats whilst very comfortable only laid back about 80% flat and were pretty uncomfortable. In-flight entertainment was poor with a very limited set of movies and no on-demand facility - they start the movies every 2 hours and if you miss the start then it's bad luck. This is very 1990's and in quick need of an overhaul. Cabin temperature was too high for comfortable sleep even after asking them to turn it down.. Overall for the money we paid we were happy. Asiana BC is around $2000 cheaper than the other big brands so we made big savings given there were 4 of us but you do get what you pay for. Others offer lie-flat bed s and a massive selection of AVOD.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,2.0,The flight was on-time and the boarding process was relatively simple and hassle-free from SFO-ICN. Aircraft was an 777. Flight was overall good but I didn't feel comfortable for the whole 14 hours. The food was bland but edible. The seats felt stiff and it was hard to wiggle around. I did enjoy my window seat however. The transit process at ICN was long and slow! Aircraft was an Airbus but it seemed more comfortable. ICN-DEL. A few passengers had a mix up with their seats and the flight attendants handled the situation very well. I could not complain about their service. They served the same meal on the two different planes. Flying over 20 hours I expected minimal comfort but I honestly did not feel it on Asiana airlines.,nan,3.0,nan

The cabins had been well maintained and as usual the Asiana staff on the ground and on board were impeccably groomed and gracious. A late brunch style meal was offered to ICN and it was ample and very well prepared. The crew could not have been more professional. Ex ICN we were seated in the upper deck. I was pleasantly surprised to find the overhead bin large enough for my hand carry (no checked luggage). While the seat is the older type it was comfortable and fully functioning. The on board service was the usual ""5 star"" Asiana product. I can't speak highly enough of the calibre of the OZ crews. We arrived on time and well fed and rested.",nan,5.0,nan

The duvet and under quilt made bed good. Several children in C but in fact they were good. Food very acceptable - now a third western option is there - previously just 2. However despite a not-full cabin service was not excellent and my water glass for dinner did not get topped up. I noticed no champagne on boarding only water or orange  no bottle of water for the night and I had to ask for water refills for the pre- landing snack. No juice offered then. All OK but the 5 stars seem to be slipping away.,nan,4.0,nan

When I called customer services they went above and beyond to make sure all my questions were answered. Onboard flight attendants were helpful quick to respond the food was pretty good and the inflight entertainment had lots of current movies to choose from. Travelling on a transatlantic flight is miserable but Asiana made it as comfortable as possible. We missed our flight home from Phuket by 12 hours (it was my fault) and Asiana moved us to the next flight that evening for free.

Business lounge was nicely refurbished and expanded since the last time I visited in April. I was greeted personally once on board by one of the cabin crew which I thought was a nice touch. Food was decent for coach and drink runs were abundant. The cons to the flight was that the 772 used to fly this route is seriously starting to show its age. AVOD carried a wide enough selection of films but was not the most state of the art touch screen ones you find on newer planes. Baggage was already on the carousel by the time I cleared immigration but it didn't mean much as I was met by a colossal line to clear customs due to the poor facilities at LA airport. Overall this airline is a good airline that provides bang for your buck although they do start to get monotonous when you fly with them for a while.,nan,5.0,nan

The space in the Economy seats is the best I have had in a long haul cabin and got some sleep. The inflight entertainment was disappointing - no video on demand on either of the long haul flights and only a main cabin screen Seoul - Saipan flights. There was a message on the looping system saying how long the films had been running for so you had to try and judge when the next batch would start. I was very glad that I had heard of the poor entertainment system before I left so I loaded up my laptop and smartphone with movies and TV shows. If there was guaranteed AVOD on the LHR-ICN route this would be a no brainer - but this lets down the rest of the Asiana product so badly.

Not usually a business class traveller but due to distance etc thought we'd spoil ourselves. Have to say what a professional efficient outfit Asiana run. Inflight service was brilliant a joy to see cabin crew happy in their work. Nothing was too much trouble. Business class connoisseurs may comment that you don't have a flat bed (on these routes) but the fully adjustable reclining seat didn't disappoint and was found to be very comfortable. Inflight entertainment could be updated (which I'm sure it will be) but was more than adequate for our requirements. Menu was quite extensive which should cater for most tastes if not sandwiches/snacks and drinks were available all flight. The stopover in Seoul on return flight to Heathrow was not a problem although the journey into Seoul took some time in heavy Friday night traffic but then what's new. No complaint about the hotel booked by Asiana. All in all a very pleasurable experience at a sensible cost.,nan,4.0,nan

It was nice to see proper business class seats on the A321 (rather than 3 economy seats with middle not used as in Europe). Staff extremely friendly available when needed and making a fuss of our son. Couldn’t have been more helpful. Transfer at Incheon after the short flight was very quick though staff were rude at passport and baggage check (not easy rushing through when you have a kid and all the baggage). Lovely business lounge and there was a nice large baby changing and separate play area. To Heathrow service was fantastic always someone on hand and great food. Likewise staff remembered what you were drinking though always other options. Again our son was looked after well and staff were always keeping me smiling after about 100 laps of the plane when he wouldn’t sleep! AVOD and plane were a bit dated though – it’s been a while since I haven’t had on demand. Didn’t sleep so well as seats were a bit uncomfy in recline and engine noise seemed pretty loud on the 777-200. Obviously they are rolling out a new business cabin and looks like there are some A380’s on order now. I look forward to seeing that product.

I found Asiana to be far superior in all respects with the possible exception of the on-board entertainment.

Travelling with an infant on this route is difficult but Asiana made it much easier with attentive service good food for the baby bassinets and good food for us. IFE excellent with programming on demand. First time going to TAS that we did not have to use a bus to get to the terminal. We had to gate check our stroller but at the Tashkent airport you need to pick it up at the baggage claim so we had to carry our baby until then which if you are familiar with the speed (or lack thereof) of the customs officials at TAS you know that it is not a small feat. The return was nice in business but even though we gate checked the stroller at TAS and told them we needed it at ICN they sent it through to the baggage claim. Luckily the ICN staff were wonderful and retrieved it for us quickly. Return was in the new Quadra business lie-flat seats which were comfortable for us but I can see how they might be too narrow for people with a larger build. Also strangely enough the business class bassinets are more narrow compared to the economy class ones. Nice amenity kit with L'Occitane products excellent food and service.

At check-in after I explained my mother's situation the staff gave us the front seats to cater for my mother's leg issues. The flight attendants were very attentive and understanding and language was no issue. Throughout the entire flight (10hours) my mother and I were cared for so diligently. The flight attendants would check on us regularly and ask if we required anything. Their smiles were a great addition to the journey. I can never be so grateful of the amount of care my mother and I received. I also noticed how well groomed they were which reflects their service and their carrier in general. I highly commend and thank Asiana Airlines and recommend it to anyone who seeks a comfortable and memorable journey.,nan,4.0,nan

OZ lounge in ICN was quiet upon early morning arrival from LAX however little food was initially set out. Waited 45 mins for a shower in the lounge. ICN-MNL-ICN was on the angled lie flat seat which was fine for the shorter flight. Again service was of a very high standard.

SYD-ICN by A330 and met expected cabin standards but after breakfast cabin crew asked that shades be drawn - at 11am on an originating flight. Remaining sectors by B777-200 and were simply substandard with a 7-section seat that is far from flat let alone fully flat. The crew fitted vertical plates to the footrest after takeoff to stop you slipping down and under the seat in front. Inflight entertainment was primitive.

Although the seat was a little too firm for my liking I slept. Inbound on a two class A330. The J seats are angled and not fully flat but comfortable all the same. Cabin crew make you feel like a valued guest. The only complaint is the business lounge at BKK it is a tiny Louis Tavern lounge with limited food and drink offerings. The lounge at ICN however is excellent. I would fly OZ again my first choice for Asian travel.,nan,5.0,nan

At LAX on return Asiana personnel removed all BC baggage from carousel to expedite process. Much more service-oriented than any American Airline!

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,I had very high expectations for Asiana but I didn't see them. Flew from JFK-ICN-HAN. Crew is great and they have a tough job keeping up with a lot of high maintenance passengers. Korean meals are good western meals are not. On the ICN-JFK leg dinner is served after take off and nothing else for 11 hrs. If you ask you can get a bag of potato chips. Leg room is ok on the 777 but really didn't feel like 34 inches and width is narrow. AVOD works well but the choices are limited. The 777 is also poorly designed without enough toilets so there is always a line for the two in the centre. The seat belt sign was only partially enforced and even during heavy turbulence when the crew was told to be seated there was still people walking around. Upon landing at JFK no fewer than four people got out of their seats during taxiing and had to be told to sit down. The A330 was more comfortable particularly from HAN-ICN which was completely empty and everyone had their own row. There is also an obsession with duty free and for the last three hours of the first leg the entire crew was consumed with taking and delivering orders. Having said all that Asiana is still miles ahead of AA Delta United etc.,nan,4.0,nan

Good service and leg room satisfying but besides that there is not enough to justify the ranking of this airline. Their website is terrible. Airport ground staff are not friendly and most of all this company allows only one luggage of 20kg in Eco or 30kg in Business - one piece of luggage is just outrageous for the price paid. The 747 was outworn with tired seats inflight entertainment was ridiculously small old and content simply not viewable.

Really little comparison- service better on newer plane better bedding pillows choice of movies and audio. Soft product fine on both but a grade higher on newer cabin. Food was good but the second meal on the first leg is always a lunch and for ex-UK this is served at 6-7 am. A breakfast option would go down better. Asiana does not allow CPAP machines to be operated from the a/c power supply; this is a great shame as there is no technical reason for the ruling.,nan,4.0,nan

The seats are about as comfortable as you can get in economy. The attentiveness and friendliness of the cabin crew is excellent. Meals are good if you choose the Korean meal. Entertainment choices are good if you have AVOD but fairly limited if you haven't. Toilets are clean and well stocked. The overnight stopover in Seoul was at the Seoul Royal. Only criticism is that the announcements can be too quiet and the command of English is a bit limited.

However SYD-ICN we had a lot of problems with the crew: we ignored to shut the shades on a daytime flight none of the crew could speak proper English - they all were repeating the same phrases over and over again.

All equipment functioned perfectly and the toilets were kept fully stocked and clean. IFE was more than adequate.

The flight was barely 15% full. Flew on an 3-3 configuration Airbus. The cabin felt very dated perhaps due to the yellow lighting and grey seats. Service naturally was fast and efficient. Smooth flight delicious meal and the flight attendants excellent. Only inflight entertainment was a random movie shown overhead.

Service in Y-class matched or was better than that of C-class in some airlines. Meals served on JFK leg were great. Seats are spacious with plenty of legroom for people under 6 ft tall. However seat back is very thick and the seat in front of you somewhat crowds into you. IFE was fine but needs improvement in variety. This airline really needs to focus on improving the command in English for the entire crew. Public announcements in English were poor.

On return flights I noticed one transfer and security gate that was almost completely empty while another transfer and security gate a hundred metres away was jammed packed and virtually not moving.

Cabin crew were very friendly and obliging. Menus ere handed out as soon as the seat belt sign was off and a 4 course Western or Korean brunch service was offered. The food and wine service is where Asiana really shine. Each course was served on elegant china. The wine list was well chosen.

Was told that as the economy class section of the flight was full there was nothing they could do and I would have to spend the (11 hour) flight reading or sleeping. When the passenger next to me complained that I had my reading light on (it was a night flight) the stewardess told me that I had to turn it off! As a paying passenger I feel that it is totally unacceptable that the entertainment system does not work in the first place never mind staff being unwilling to do anything about it. 12th January ICN to LHR. Sat in seat 26G - and again the inflight entertainment system for my seat does not work. Staff tried rebooting it 5 times but that did not work. Even though there were spare seats in travel class staff would not let me move as it would mean moving to a centre seat from an aisle seat. So 12 hours in a plane without any working in flight entertainment. Again an utter lack of maintenance or customer care from Asiana. I had further problems with the meals on these flights - on the ICN- SYD flight my main course was served cold it took staff 20 minutes to find a new one. I had a similar problem on the ICN-LHR. Because row 26 was the last row in that service round the western food choice was gone. I had to wait 20 minutes whilst staff waited to see if there was one from another trolley available. Now I accept that meal choices may not be available but by the time I was given mine it was cold. It was reheated. It was still cold. A new one was found (45 minutes after I should have been served) - again cold.

Three times they offered Korean immigration forms and then just disappeared until just before landing. Immediately on boarding the passengers in the row in front fully reclined their seats. That was possibly the only way they could fit in the space. The inflight entertainment had a scratchy sound. This was the worst airline experience I have had.,nan,1.0,nan

I flew Sydney-Seoul- Sydney for business in October 2014.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,I experienced 4 great sectors with Asiana very recently: SYD-ICN ICN-LHR LHR-ICN ICN-SYD. I am reviewing them together because the standard of all flights was the same - very good. Exceptional leg room in Economy attentive and friendly service from the cabin crew clean and modern cabins and the feeling that they value you as a passenger. The entertainment screens SYD-ICN and ICN-LHR were of the 2.5 hour loop variety but that did not matter at all to me - the spaciousness of the leg room and service of the cabin crew are the things that most matter to me. And on these aspects Asiana scores brilliantly. The overnight stop provided for free in Seoul was already appreciated and well executed. I will be travelling with Asiana again.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Sydney to Seoul daytime flight. Interesting that lunch was served immediately and then cabin was put into darkness which I found odd and disappointing for a daytime flight. Service is fairly attentive although English language skills seemed limited they couldn't have been more friendlier or helpful. The seats were old stained and very uncomfortable they only laid back about 80% flat and could feel the metal frame work and springs from under the foam. Inflight entertainment was poor with a very limited set of movies (5 in total) and no on demand facility - they start the movies every 2 hours and if you miss the start then it's just bad luck. This is something I would have expected back in the 1990's. In need of a major overhaul. My screen wasn't working so they advised me I would have to wait till after the movie had finished for them to reboot the system! Overall a major disappointment friends have travelled with Asiana and boasted about the service but after looking into it further I learnt that Asian use new planes in all sectors apart from ICN-SYD.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,I flew Sydney to Seoul mid September and returned last week on Asiana OZ601/602. Both flights were on an A330 which I preferred to the B777 they usually operate as it is newer. The seats were super comfortable and legroom was similar to business class on some Australian carriers. Experienced the five star service on both flights. The flight attendants worked non-stop and they were always present in the cabin. They were also very courteous and polite always kneeling to speak with passengers face to face really personalised the service. Meals were excellent on the outbound flight especially the Korean option. Western breakfast on the return flight was a little bland and the orange juice was really sour. Two main meals and plenty of snacks served on both flights. Entertainment was great and touch screens were easily usable and responded well. Overall Asiana made 10+ hours of flying thoroughly enjoyable and I will definitely fly them again.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,First Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,I flew on the A380 from Seoul to Hong Kong on 01/23/2015. I had purchased a Business Class ticket and for some reason was upgraded at the gate to First Class. Suite product with private sliding doors flat beds and the largest television I have ever seen in a premium cabin. Noise cancelling headsets blanket and pillow were great while napping on the flat bed. Loads of storage space in various forms. The service was wonderful and although a 3.5 hour flight at most there were multi-courses for dinner - appetizer salad entree cheese/fruit dessert and then chocolates. The lavatory is very large felt like a room with a sitting area to be honest and had many amenities.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,We have travelled from Heathrow to Sydney and return with Asiana before and also with other airlines. Last time we rated Asiana as very good. Sadly this time the overall level of service was much lower. We had booked through a reputable online travel agency and had a terrible job of getting our seats allocated through them. We eventually got them confirmed but there were a couple of changes along the way. As there is a 19 hour layover at Seoul on the return leg Asiana had previously provided hotel accommodation. We had expected a similar facility this time but after booking we found that not to be the case and we had to make our own arrangements. The flights themselves were uneventful. The seats were comfortable and all four flights were about on time although at least one of the Boeings was quite old. There was a certain amount of turbulence on each flight but the aircraft dealt with that and we suffered no real discomfort. We didn't however think that the meals were as good as previously and certainly the in flight entertainment was quite limited. Perhaps as could be expected there appeared to be more Korean music and films. Unlike their ground staff colleagues the flight crew were very helpful and polite. Most but not all spoke very good English. Our low rating for staff service is due entirely to the way we were dealt with by staff at Seoul. We would not discount using Asiana again but we will as ever consider our experience on this flight with those we experienced with other 5 star airlines when selecting flights in future and we would recommend travellers to look at Asiana as well as other airlines.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,We were flying round trip from FRA via ICN to CGK. The first leg was in a 744 the latter one in an A333. We were quite lucky to get upgraded from FRA to ICN to a business class seat due to an overbooked economy class. Food and drinks were still from the economy class though. Shortly after take off hot towels were distributed and shortly after that the crew gave us the dinner and breakfast menu. We both chose to indulge in the famous Bibimbap and were not disappointed. It was excellent. After dinner service the cabin was dimmed window blinds had to be closed and we had a good night's rest until two hours before arrival when breakfast/lunch was served. The second flight from ICN to CGK was in Economy. Asiana's Economy class is better than most other carriers I've experienced. Spacious clean and service is excellent. Seats are comfortable and offer relatively large leg room and can be reclined to a larger extend than others. The only complaint would be the screens of the IFE which are not as bright and crisp as others. Flight attendants are offering drinks regularly and are always willing to help and trying their best to meet all your demands. Lavatories are equipped with skin toner mouth wash and toothpaste and toothbrushes. Slippers blankets and pillows are also provided. Food from ICN to CGK and back was however not as good as between FRA and ICN. Yet still more tasty than other carriers. Overall a very nice experience and will definitely use Asiana again whenever possible.,nan,5.0,nan

What made this flight great however were the flight attendants. Not just one but the entire crew made you feel as if they really enjoy their job. Always had a genuine smile.Food and beverages were great except that my first breakfast choice was not available. Inflight entertainment not the best in the world but definitely not the worst. You have to experience the service to understand the world of difference between European US and Chinese carriers. Too bad they don't fly from the US to Europe otherwise I would be a regular.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,Hong Kong - Seoul - Los Angeles return. All flights on new A380 except Hong Kong to Seoul on old but very well kept 747 i. I have flown Asiana before and remain very impressed with the commitment to consistent and high on board service and product including economy class. All aircraft spotlessly clean and kept clean throughout the flight especially the bathrooms. Seating very comfortable with excellent legroom all flights. Crew very professional and very accommodating constantly circulating the cabin. Hot meals served on all flights with two hot meals on the LA flights. Choice of Korean and Western. Food quality for airplane food very good with good sized servings. The only negative and it is disappointing as the A380 is new is the inflight entertainment. Seats have large touch screen tvs. However choice of films and TV limited. I would understand if the Korean content was extensive and English more limited but it appears limited in all languages. It is the one thing that lets down this otherwise excellent carrier.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,All-around excellent flight! As we boarded we all received the Customs Form the Arrival Card and yes a pen. Such a simple and handy gesture yet so very few do it. The A321 had a 2-2 configuration and was brand new. The seat was very comfortable well designed and the service was excellent as was the food. Impressed with this Asiana flight.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,We did LHR-ICN-SYD for Xmas and NY 14/15. LHR-SYD in economy and back in business. The standard of service on all four flights was without fault. The cabin crew were absolutely excellent. The crew are extremely attentive and as opposed to other airlines you can definitely see them around during the night - nothing was too much trouble. We travelled also with our 15 month old granddaughter and the crew were equally attentive for her. On the return flight 3 weeks later one of the stewardesses even recognized us from the ongoing flight. All the meals that were served were of star-restaurant standard and beautifully presented. The beds while not quite lie flat were very comfortable and I managed a good sleep on all flights. Even in economy. Only a rude passenger in business on the return flight (ICN-LHR) on Jan 10 2015 was spoiling the atmosphere a bit. At the end of the flight the head of the stewardesses personally came to apologize. Their lounge in ICN as the whole airport itself is excellent. Good food good drinks and more importantly their local team is very friendly. The return flight was equally pleasant. I definitely recommend them and with no doubt they will be my airline of choice if next family visit takes me to the Sydney again. One little suggestion: we were offered a hotel on the return stopover but why in Seoul as just for the night? Aren't there hotels on the airport or in Incheon? Saves a few hours in the bus! Will look forward to flying Asiana again.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,Seoul Incheon - London Heathrow 4/1/2015. The flight was delayed by almost an hour taking off and so we were late into London missed our slot and had to circle for another 20mins. The food was truly awful if it wasn't tasteless it was far too spicy. My main gripe was with the 'entertainment system'. On a 12 hr flight we had the choice of 6 films on a loop of 2hrs you would think that we would at least have had AVOD or a better choice than what we had. I only watched 2 films as nothing else appealed. I have travelled with Asiana before and was fairly satisfied but I am afraid the service is not what it was.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,ORD-ICN-SGN-ICN-ORD on B777s. The ICN-ORD route is unfortunately served by moderately old planes while the SGN-ICN route is served by newer ones with relatively more legroom. Planes are clean; staff is professional (needs better English though) and the food is satisfactory. My pet peeve is about the entertainment system. The screens on the ICN-ORD are small have old formats with no English subtitles (even for non-English movies). The choices are limited though updated with recent stuff. In conclusion OZ is a tad bit better than KE but probably not exactly on par with CX and SQ who are fellow 5-star airlines. Honestly OZ needs to have something similar to CXStudios or KrisWorld better English speakers and needs some work on the Western food.,nan,4.0,nan

Transit at ICN airport is very fast boarding on an old B777-200 for ICN-SFO clean and still well maintained IFE outdated but with plenty of new movies seat very comfortable I picked the Korean style dinner which is the best airline food I've had!

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,ICN-HKG last weekend for quick getaway 4/3-4/6. For ICN-HKG flight it was a bad day for OZ operations but the cabin crew held it together very well! OZ 749 down to HKG (8pm departure) that was delayed an hour due to a last minute gate change and downsizing of aircraft an A333 was swapped to an A320. The A320 was definitely older (overhead TV) and tighter pitch but for three hour flight it was no big deal. Also on board an entire Hong Kong tour group decided to switch seats to wherever they wished creating a major headache for flight attendants (and messy overhead bins). The flight attendants held it together very well! The return was on the A380 redeye (OZ 746) which was quite an experience. We selected upper deck economy seats. As there is separate boarding at HKG for each level it really felt like the upper deck was our own plane. The 2-4-2 seats were amazingly spacious with a huge high resolution seatback TV. Downstairs is 3-4-3. These seats also feature side storage bins for economy too! The new plane smell was still there. I do wish that Asiana would not offer a meal on this late flight. With a 12.40 am departure Hong Kong time the flight barely clocks in at 3 hours (and you add an hour time change) so you arrive in Korea at 5am. By the time they complete take off and landing and feed you you barely have an hour and a half for sleep.,nan,5.0,nan

The best feature to the whole experience was that I felt valued both as a customer and top tier member with the personal greeting of appreciation that I get on every Asiana flight unlike that of other airlines I once had status with - guess that's the value of a medium size airline. This airline is truly deserving of its 5 stars.,nan,4.0,nan

Added bonus of comfortable seats and space. 777 on the Sydney legs were also clean but very old and ptvs were small and grainy. Seats were still comfortable for 10 hours but substandard entertainment made it feel longer. Asiana should realise their Sydney route is just as much a competitive and long haul route as their European and US flights and worthy of the same standard of new planes.

Flew on their brand new A380 ICN-LAX and attendant even gave me a tour of all cabins upon landing in LAX! Food is good but some entrees repeated on other flights. No issues in boarding flights in MNL ICN and LAX. Only slight complaint is the ICN-MNL flight where the 777 IFE equipment is outdated. However IFE selections are good in all sectors. Paid a little less than $1000 for all sectors but service felt like $2000 or above! Keep up the good work Asiana and continue being one of the world's best airlines!,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,Flew from Los Angeles to Manila. From LAX to Incheon on their new A380. At check in at LAX I was asked to check my carry on as they said the flight was very full-big mistake as my carry on was not in Manila when I arrived-it was put on a later flight and I had to return to Manila airport two days later to pick it up. Boarding at LAX into the A380 as there are so many passengers is a cattle call. They hold up signs with seat numbers and you have to line up behind the sign with your seat number. I was seated in economy upstairs and was lucky to be in front of the line and boarded reasonably fast. The economy seat on the A380 was better than most seats I have flown on many long haul flights to Asia on United or China Air and I found the entertainment system very good with good movies to watch in English. Flight attendants were efficient and pleasant but nothing special. Food I thought was very good compared to others I have flown and you are given real silverware and not plastic-nice touch. I always try to book an aisle seat which I did on this flight so I could easily get up and stand for a while during the flight. The only problem on the A380 is there is nowhere to go and stand for awhile unless you go to the restroom as compared to the old 747's with space in the back to stand and stretch for awhile. The A380 is a nice quiet plane and I would not hesitate to fly it again on Asiana. International transfer at Incheon airport are a breeze-just follow the signs for transfers and you go through a security check and then right up to the departure area for your next flight. Incheon airport is very clean and modern and all stores and restaurants do accept USA dollars so no need to exchange money to be able to buy something. Flight to Manila was on a older 777-200 which was fine for a much shorter flight-it lands at Terminal 1 in Manila which is the oldest terminal and under construction to improve it right now-leaving from there has improved since I flew from there last year-but barely. Leaving from Manila has always required you to pay a terminal fee as you depart but as of this writing the terminal fee will be included in all ticket prices and you will no longer need to pay the terminal fee when departing Manila. Just wish more airlines flew into the new Terminal 3 in Manila which is much nicer and modern terminal. When leaving Manila Asiana made me check my carry-on as it weighed more than 10 kilos but when I boarded the plane I saw many people with much larger carry-ons than mine which I know weighed more than 10 kilos? I had a camera in the bag so they zip tied every pocket and shrunk wrapped the bag in plastic with a big sign say it was fragile and I arrived with no problems.,nan,4.0,nan

Transfers were one of the easiest we've experienced especially on the return flights. London ground agents booked our seats not just to Seoul but Sydney as well, and our bags were automatically transferred by the airline to our Sydney plane as there was no layover. This gave us more time to relax in the lounge. Onboard experience was fantastic. Three out of the four legs had excellent flat beds and only the Sydney to Seoul leg had angled seats which were great for a day flight but I'd question its comfort overnight. What was truly memorable was the gracious and respectful cabin service on every single flight. The crew seemed like they weren't just great attendants but great people in general.

There were no real refreshments (other than small cups of drinks) during the three hour period either. Why couldn't they have checked the plane beforehand so that 1) we could've left on time, 2) we could've taken another aircraft, 3) or at least if neither of those options were possible, we could have waited in the terminal where we could at least walk around and get food.

Flight information is presented in a confusing manner. The best part is trying to reserve a seat. Knowing where you will sit prior to arriving at the departure airport is an important part of the travel experience. This is especially true when flying for 12 hours. Evidently, Asiana does not believe this is important and therefore will not allow 50% of ticketed passengers on their flights to reserve a seat. Instead, seat assignment takes place upon arrival at the airport. Asiana attempts to make up for the 'inconvenience' with a competent staff, but the inefficiency and uncertain seat assignment overwhelms their effort.

Old aircraft with recliner seats in a 2-3-2 configuration - as far as I know this is the only OZ long haul route without newer lie-flat seats in business class. Even though business class was only 3/4 full Asiana would not allocate us seats in the window/aisle seats until airport check-in. We were the last people in the cabin who had their meal order taken and they had run out of western meals - only Korean left for one of us. They did have the main courses left so my husband was offered a steak (no appetiser) served with chopsticks. My main course (fish) was terrible - took one bite and left the rest. Champagne was room temperature and breakfast eggs were cold - why can't airlines serve cold things cold and hot things hot - it's not that hard.

ICN-HND was on an A321 with no PTV, just overhead screen running small features and Just For Laughs. The flight is barely two hours, so it's hard to watch a movie anyway. ICN-HND is an evening flight, so be mindful of trying to catch the last train at HND. Also, they park the plane for the night, so you have to take a bus to the terminal. Sit in the front of the plane, get off quickly, walk briskly. Immigration at that time is about a 10-20 minute wait. You can get some cash at the ATM and make it to the train with about 10 minutes to spare. Otherwise, there is a late night bus (double the price of train) or a taxi (ten times the price of the train). HND-GMP was on a bigger A330 with AVOD, but again, you can barely finish watching anything. The service quality was the same top notch, polite crew.

Lots of legroom and the seat headrests were adjustable. I've previous comments mentioning that the entertainment has been limited on Asiana flights but that was not the case for me as I saw many films that were only in cinemas a couple of months ago with a wide selection of film genres to choose from. Maybe I had witnessed an improvement? The two hour flights between Seoul and Tokyo were of the same quality as the long haul in terms of staff service and meal quality. The meals on all four flights with Asiana were outstanding for economy class. On the long hauls, menus are given out to all passengers with a choice between Korean or Western meals. The Korean meal was definitely the winner when it came to presentation, but the quality of the food for both meals was very high and proper metal cutlery is used. The price of all four flights was well below £1k. I will certainly fly with Asiana again, simply for the amazing service they provide compared to my past long haul experiences with BA and Virgin.

I had great expectations for this, my first flight in an A380 and my first long-haul flight with Asiana. Asiana uses a 1-2-1 configuration in business class, so every passenger has direct access to the aisle. The best window seats are the ones with the seat on the window side and the accompanying table on the aisle. This limits disturbances from customers and crew walking up and down the aisle. Because this was a daytime flight that would arrive in Korea in late afternoon, I wanted to stay awake during the flight and reset my biological clock to Korean time. This strategy was complicated when the flight attendants lowered all window shades shortly after take-off. I enjoy watching scenery during flights, but short people will have trouble seeing anything on the upper deck of the A380 because the windows are higher than normal. There is a mini-lounge for socializing at the nose of the upper deck, but it went unused during my flight. As other reviewers have noted, the cabin was too warm for comfort throughout the flight. The cabin crew were beyond excellent. They were ubiquitous without being imposing. Meal service was elaborate. I decided to be adventurous and chose the Korean meal - bibimbap.

When we confronted the passenger service agent at the departure gate and asked why we had not been informed prior to boarding our initial flight Mumbai to Tokyo, he just said that they had a maintenance issue with the A380 and there was no alternative for us.

I must say that the standard of the service from check in to point of disembark was excellent. Upon arrival at Incheon Airport, I proceeded with the tax refund kiosk as it was still too early to check in. Once I had settled the tax refund, it was time for check in, the speed of the check in counter in handling this process despite the queue was long. Boarding was smooth and efficient. The warmth and hospitality of Korea is reflected by the Asiana cabin crew. Onboard, the in-flight attendant greeted us with a smile and guided us accordingly. The in-flight meal was served not long after airborne. Cabin crew were busy on the aisle to serve beverages even after the meal tray was cleared, and the service delivered by cabin crew was impeccable. This was my second flight with Asiana Airlines and I am glad that Asiana never disappoint me.

Short flight from Beijing to Seoul. After reading many rave reviews, this was my first time flying with Asiana and I was not disappointed. Preceding flight from Incheon arrived past the intended boarding time, but not an issue for me as it allowed me more time to drink my Cappuccino from the Costa Coffee at Capital Airport's Terminal 3. Flight departed about 20 minutes late, but landed in Incheon fairly close to the originally intended arrival time. Aircraft was new with comfortable seating and ample legroom. Cabin was fairly cold which is understandable considering the level of humidity throughout Southeast Asia this time of year. Drink refreshments were not offered after takeoff, but a full meal and coffee/tea service followed soon after. Very pleased with the quality and portions of the meal. IFE was entertaining but really didn't get to enjoy it as much considering flight duration was less than two hours. Most importantly, the staff were helpful, positive, welcoming, and accommodating. Only regret is not purchasing my ticket earlier enough so that I could claim a window seat and view the stunning sunset descent/landing into ICN. Overall, an extremely comfortable and smooth ride.

The blanket was the one used for the previous flight (just folded on the seat, not sealed in a plastic bag as it should be). When I asked for a ""clean blanket"" the FA did not really seem to realize what I meant. Extremely disappointed by these kind of practices. I usually have issues with Asiana regarding dirty windows so I usually ask the FA a wet tissue to clean it. When traveling on a legacy airline, cleanliness is an issue for me, since it's basic respect for passengers. By comparison, I flew Korean Air several times and never had such issues. Take off at 00:40 and ""dinner"" served at 2am. Seriously, the only things passengers want to do at this time is to sleep. FA woke up all the passengers by asking them to put up their seats. Choice was not appropriate - porridge or sea food. I did not take any of them. A breakfast, before arriving at Incheon would have been more suitable. The quantity of movies loaded in the IFE is just a huge joke. The movie application is divided into themes and in Hollywood or classics you would find only have 3 to 4 movies.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

It became so hot that a lot of passengers were using paper as fans to cool themselves. I called the flight attendant who said she would lower the temperature but nothing changed.

First time flying with Asiana Airlines from London to Tokyo via Seoul. Evening flight was full however it departed 60+ minutes later than the scheduled time which meant passengers were seated for at least 90 minutes before take off. The late departure caused us worry about making our onward connection from Seoul to Tokyo, thankfully we made the onward flight. Flight crew were attentive, polite, amenity kits provided quickly and bathrooms were stocked regularly. Food options were Korean or Western, partner chose bibimbap, I chose the Western option, both meals were enjoyed. Plenty of choice in IFE. Connecting flight to Tokyo was on time and surprisingly we were served a hot meal soon after departure. Immigration and customs at Tokyo were busy and took some time but to our surprise (and delight) two Asiana staff stayed waiting with our luggage at the carousel.

Several prior reviewers helped me pick my business class seat due to configuration of the business class cabin. If you are traveling alone, try to get the 2 seats that have the side table facing the aisles - otherwise you will be sitting very close to someone you don't know (look at seat configuration map of Asiana's A380 business class to see what I'm saying). Try to get the window seat in which the side table faces the aisle for more privacy. The service was polite and courteous. However, if you are used to Western food service style, don't expect the flight attendants to come around repetitively to see if your drinks are filled - you'll have to ring the bell to get refills. I find this to be typical of Asian food service, whether on land or in the air - that staff rarely come around to make sure glasses/cups are refilled. Also, strange that the rolls that came with dinner never had butter served (both on inbound and outbound flights). Seats were great and the blankets were lightly insulated and were quite comfortable. Toiletry kit supplied on inbound (ICN to JFK), but not outbound flight. Excellent wine and liquor selections. AVOD selection of movies was not the most I've seen, but more than adequate. Plenty of music tracks to pick from. Biggest drawback - no WiFi - hopefully Asiana is planning to implement this option soon. Business class lounge in JFK used the Swissair lounge and had only breakfast items were available even though it was 12 noon. Business lounge in ICN better.

Not quite a filling meal, but the thought was there and I was most grateful to have something to eat. As others have mentioned, the inflight entertainment can leave a little to be desired (for example, on our second flight (ICN-BKI, 5 hours), only 4 Hollywood films were offered.

The unpleasant experience starts with the cumbersome and unfriendly Asiana website and the difficulty in pre-selecting one's seat, One pays a premium airfare and OZ does not support the pre-booking of a seat. I connected to OZ from an AC flight which required me to seek out a transfer desk at ICN. It is unacceptable that OZ does not allow the Star Alliance airline which has issued the ticket to also issue the connecting boarding pass. A good 20 minutes was wasted sorting this out. Then on to the lounge. Upon entry I thought I was at one of the domestic North American carrier lounges: Crowded, nowhere to sit, no food to speak of, and a line up at the poorly stocked beverage section. At least North American lounges are usually well lit and not dingy dark noisy rooms. Hardly the place I wanted to be after 20 hours in transit. I walked around the ICN terminal until boarding of the flight. Onboard the service was minimal and disorganized. Although a 6 pm flight there was no pre dinner drink service. Instead, there was rushed meal service that lurched to a halt halfway through. After hearing so much about the quality of food, I was rather disappointed, as it was of poor quality. No top up of the wine glass either. The IFE system was nothing to brag about. Uncomfortable seat although the large pillow was appreciated.

After paying full payment for 2 business class tickets and confirmation of the tickets, still you have to go to the airport early to get your seats! This is the most ridiculous policy I have heard from any airline for business class passengers. What's the value of a 4000 USD ticket if the passenger has to go the airport early to get a seat? After I complained to the management of the airline, finally, the unavailable seats reappeared and 2 seats were allocated. However it was a time wasting, frustrating experience.

I have taken a few flights on this airframe and it always seems overcrowded and cramped. That is until I took the Asiana flight. Asiana puts one less seat in each row and overall spreads their business class passengers out more around the cabin to create a much more open feel compared to Lufthansa. I sat on an outside seat which is to say I was in a row of single seats. Asiana's seats are staggered so you and lined up with the table in front of you for extra leg room. Very clever. What they also does is give you a huge table to put your things on. I highly recommend taking a seat with the table on the outside, as this gives you a bit more privacy and allows access to the bins that are under the window. To say this seat has storage is an understatement. The seat is very comfortable in the seated position and in the lay-flat position is easy to get in and out of. My only complaint was that my seat was attached to something on the plane that vibrated, so when you put your head down, you could hear the sounds of the plane. I have had this issue on other flights, so I do not hold it against Asiana. A pair of flush headphones cured the noise. If the configuration is what physically sets Asiana apart, their service is the intangible that elevates them. Asiana excel in service and is one of the best. To me Singapore, ANA and Asiana are the three best. The corps of attendants are always around to help. With most US carriers, the meal is served, chips put in a basket and the staff disappears, but with Asiana mid-flight meals are served with the same attention as the main. I asked for a bag of chips and a tray of options was presented to me. That is service. I would be remiss without mentioning the food. I eat a lot of airline food and with few exceptions, it is not memorable. Asiana food is actually worth waiting for. On all four flights I took with them in the 2 week span, the food was well prepared and excellent. By the last leg of the trip, I was actually looking forward to what Korean delicacy would be served. The other aspect that impressed me was the boarding process. In Frankfurt with Lufthansa boards their A380, it seems like a cattle call with hoards of people trying to board. In Seoul, it is an organized and seemless process and you arrive at your seat relaxed. Nice job! Overall, my experience with Asiana was exemplary. The seats, the service and the food were all outstanding. I will actually take a stop in Korea over my usually direct flight to China to experience Asiana over the US carriers.",Business,4.0,nan

Booked a window with the table on the aisle side of the seat for more privacy. The Asiana website is difficult to navigate for seat assignments so I did it through the toll-free number without issue (the call was quick and very polite). JFK-ICN on A380: Asiana uses the SWISS lounge in T4 at JFK and it is a mess. Banged up and clearly not large enough for the amount of people using it. Boarding was relatively efficient with passengers arranged by cabin class in clearly designated lines. We boarded using a dedicated jetway to the upper deck. Service on board was excellent - polite and attentive without being overbearing. Seat was comfortable and allowed me to sleep most of the 15 hour fligt. Plenty of movies to watch on the IFE system which had a nice large screen. Nice bathroom with a window and a good stock of toiletries. Food was good for dinner - desert and mid flight snack were somewhat dissapointing. Transfer at ICN to NRT flight was simple. ICN Business lounge was nice - nothing super special. Flight to NRT on A321 was comfortable and though brief included a full meal service. Seat pitch was a little tight but the seat was comfortable enough and the IFE replicated what was on offer on the A380. I wasn't totally wowed but the experience was a good one.,Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

On the outbound leg, the aircraft offered lie-flat beds and direct aisle access but not on the return trip (but offered instead an amenity kit and eye mask). I would have preferred a more natural, relaxed and less frozen approach from the cabin crew. The IFE is also limited. ",Business,4.0,nan

The departing flight was a red eye and we were given a small sandwich that was pretty tasteless after take off. Overall on both flights the food was okay but nothing special. Seats were comfortable enough that I got decent sleep before landing in the airport. The crew on both flights were great, polite, and spoke good English. On the return flight we ran in to moderate turbulence halfway during meal service and the flight attendants had to kneel in the aisle by the serving carts for around 15-20 minutes until we cleared the turbulence. Perhaps the only real disappointing thing from the flight was the IFE which was outdated and not very responsive. It didn't even pause during cabin announcements so having to rewind was a bit of a hassle.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

First impression on my return flight: the aircraft seems to be older than my outbound flight to Seoul, however nothing changes inside. Ground staff were nothing but the best, they are responsive and active. However my seat that have not enough legroom. The cabin staff are really responsive and active just like the ground crew. The food that was offered to me (Bibimbap) is the best. The in-flight entertainment seems to be old, but there's nothing to differ with my previous flight and the content are still the same. Probably the best thing of all of this flight is the food and the cabin crew. Thank you, Asiana Airlines. You made my trip to South Korea really unforgettable with you. ",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

Asiana Airlines was offering the cheapest airfare for this direct route and on top of that, I had the pleasant surprise to be upgraded to a first class suite. So I can give them no less than top score! They did not offer me an amenity kit on this flight (just an eye mask and ear plugs, which is enough). I would have appreciated a better pillow and blanket to match the overall standard of the experience.

The flight crews are extremely helpful and I couldn't say anything other than that. The inflight entertainment were looking new and  excellent. The legroom of the seat are average but I was not able to sleep on an overnight 6-hour flight. On the overnight meal service right before breakfast, I was served a sandwich which is delicious. On breakfast right before arriving to Seoul, I was offered between the omelette or shrimp shiitake rice porridge. I chose porridge. Unfortunately, the food was almost tasteless, however, the good side is thanks to the delicious shrimp in it. I will consider this as an unforgettable journey I've ever went with a 5-star airline.

nan,Business Class,4.0,October 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Sydney to Seoul,5.0," |  This was a really good experience, surprisingly pleasant. I actually booked through Qantas but the flight was with Asiana Airlines from Sydney to Seoul. The food was good and the cabin staff were nice and spoke good English. The seats were comfortable and lay completely flat. They were side by side, rather than at an angle - I much prefer this. The only problem I experienced is that the cabin staff seemed to want to pull the window blinds down all the time. I am claustrophobic and find this quite distressing during the daytime. I can understand the need at night but not in the daytime. As there no windows in the kitchen/toilet area I couldn't even go along and see outside there. So to be on the safe side, if you are claustrophobic, I would advise booking a window seat. This would not put me off travelling with Asiana again as I know it is common to many airlines (oddly). I guess airlines need to think about this. The in-flight entertainment was fine. I visited the lounge at Seoul for an hour or so. It was quite crowded but provided everything you needed including a range of food. They had some nice little booths along the side with lie-flat seats (unfortunately full when I was there!).",Business,5.0,nan

Both flights left and landed on time. Service on the flight was good, the IFE worked well and there was a reasonable choice of films. Food was good. Bangkok to Seoul was a flat bed and then Seoul to Almaty was Angle Flat which I tend to find a little uncomfortable as I slide down the bed. I have flown Asiana Airlines several times before and I have no hesitation in flying them if the price if right. (I used to fly Air Astana but their Bangkok - Almaty service while direct is now very expensive compared to a indirect route carrier such as Asiana). All in all no complaints.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Fully-flat 180deg. bed with tenderloin steak lunch and veal sausage breakfast. What amazed me is the effort of FAs offering dine dining services in the middle of heavy turbulence when we were over Japan. Other pros include variety of red, white wines, as well as champagne, beer and other alcoholic drinks. Pillow and blanket are comfy as well. Cons, IFE choice too limited.

However, the meal is well but I suggested that the meal could add more in Korean element. For the cabin crew service, the crews are nice and care to what I care.

This was my first time flying with Asiana Airlines to the United States. The seats on both the A330 and B772 had enough leg room for my liking. The food was fantastic. I chose the Korean option on both flights and I really enjoyed it, however, I was rather disappointed with the food options on the return leg enroute from Incheon to Manila. Didn't taste very nice. IFE on both flights weren't as good. Lack of Wi-Fi connectivity on both aircraft models, but they do have power plugs on the B772 so you can charge your phone, tablet, or laptop. The Flight attendants were very friendly. Nothing much to say about that. Overall, I'll definitely fly Asiana Airlines again. Good service.

Fortunately, when the flight arrived in Tokyo, I could take the last train to go back from Haneda airport to my home.

It's my first time to Seoul as well as my first trip on Asiana Airlines, and the trip from Hong Kong to Seoul was really a pleasant one. Seats were comfortable though it's economy class, the width of seats and legroom was large enough and they offered pillows and blankets for each seat. The food offered was quite good to me. The cabin staff was polite and they were smiling at all times, they also spoke quite fluent English. The only thing that I have to complain is that the inflight entertainment is not responsive, in both the departing and returning flights, I can't use the IFE as they are not functioning properly. But in total, this was still a great flight and I believe Asiana really worth a 5-star.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Flight out from LA was about an hour late departing. Ticketing/baggage check at LAX pretty hectic. Flew A380 upper deck economy on LA to Incheon, row 75. Upper deck Economy on Asiana is 2-4-2. Had window and aisle seat, large storage compartment next to window. Legroom was just average. Asiana does not offer a premium economy, but charges $100 extra for some bulkhead rows with extra legroom. Service was friendly and efficient. Korean food option was very good. Inflight entertainment was comprehensive with US, Korean and world movie/TV options. ICN to Beijing leg was scheduled to be an A330, but they substituted an A321 that was only half full. Two hour flight departed and arrived on-time. It was uneventful, and was served a breakfast with a choice of western or Chinese food. The return from Shanghai Pudong was on a packed new A350. Seating was 3-3-3 and the first 4 or 5 rows in economy had a couple of extra inches of legroom, for $150 extra. Since it was less than a 2 hour flight I chose not to pay extra. The A350 had seatback entertainment system with a full compliment of movies and TV from both US and Asian sources. We were served a warm lunch, again with western or Asian food choices. We stayed over for 2 nights in Seoul before returning to LA on Asiana flight 204. Check-in at Incheon went very smoothly, using a self check terminal to generate a boarding pass and then dropping our bags. At bag check, the Asiana clerk gave us a pass to use expedited customs clearance. It was very short line, and customs and security took less than 5 minutes. The Seoul to LA leg was again in an A380. This time we sat in the main cabin which is 3-4-3 arrangement. We chose the centre section, so you are only 1 seat away from the aisle. Again, the food options were Korean or western and we chose the Korean option which was very good. I find the Asiana flight attendants to be excellent, friendly and helpful. We ordered wine with dinner, and in a vain attempt to sleep on the flight we asked for a second glass of wine. The flight attendant brought our second glass and several snack packets for both of us. I have heard some complain about hard seats on Asiana's A380's. I'm not sure that they are any worse than the economy seats on any airline. Frankly, in my opinion, spending 10-12 hours in any economy seat is tiring on my behind. Overall, Asiana is not quite at the standards of Singapore or EVA, but they are far, far better than any US flagged carrier, at least in Economy.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,May 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,New York to Seoul,5.0," |  New York to Seoul. I think the Asiana Airlines is the best airline I took. I had used Delta, United Airlines and also Korean air, but I feel more comfortable when I use Asiana airline for long travel. The service is best of the best during the flight. The reason that I writing a review for it is the best services of my latest flight. I had a stomachache in the cabin, after 8 hrs from the departure, I just stayed at he back of the cabin, and I felt the crew really tried to help me. They borrow me their own hot pack and medicine for my stomach. So I really want to give high rate for Asiana airline. Additionally, the food is also the best I can say.

I am pleased to be on board this brand new aircraft on this short haul flight. I arrived 2 hours prior to the flight departure. Check in is prompt and smooth. Flight OZ362 departed slightly behind schedule due to delay from the incoming flight and also air traffic control. Boarding call is made half an hour prior to departure. Once I boarded, the flight attendant guided me to the assigned seat. Cabin crew were busy distributing blanket and assisting passenger while awaiting for clearance for take off. Since this is a new aircraft, the cleanliness of this aircraft is a plus. This brand new aircraft is quiet during taxied off, take off and landing. I am truly amazed me with professionalism of the cabin crew despite that this is a 2 hours flight. In flight meal was served as soon as the seat belt sign had been turned off. They were always on the aisle to ensure that passengers were well taken care throughout the journey. Nonetheless, the choice of inflight entertainment is rather limited compare to other airlines I had flown. As such, I would propose Asiana consider adding more. Similarly, Asiana should look into way to improve the cabin crew English proficiency. The overall flying experience is beyond my expectation. I look forward to fly with Asiana Airlines again in the near future.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
