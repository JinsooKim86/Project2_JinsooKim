I should have heeded the warning, as I arrived in San Francisco while my bags stayed in Vancouver. The baggage attendant waited at the counter as passengers watched the empty belt go around, even though he was fully aware they wouldn't appear. Why not tell us? Then, a lengthy process to complete paperwork yielded vague promises that we'd get our bags 'on the next flight out'. That turned out to be the next evening, and when I called I was told I would get the bag between 5 pm and 11 pm, or the next day'. Oh, and the ""100 dollar Incidental Expense' they wrote on the paper they issue? Forget about ever seeing it, as it only covers expenses documented by an itemized receipt (Of course they don't tell you this when they promise it).

I also have food allergies and I went to the gate agent to tell them and they where super accommodating. They told me u could pre board and made in an announcement at the gate and in the plane. The plane was clean, I had a moderate amount of leg room and we where offered free drinks twice during the flight. None of which contained nut products.

On the way there, our flight was delayed, without warning until the morning of our flight, which was a severe inconvenience, due to the fact that we were already en route to the airport when we were notified early in the morning, the same day. Additionally, an extra layover trip was added to our itinerary, ruining our entire first day of vacation. This was such a serious lack of consideration, especially due to the fact that I am pregnant and with lower back pain. On top of all of that, our flight returning back home was cancelled. We must now wait over 24 hours for the next flight and no one is willing to help with a hotel. I have never had a more awful experience.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,December 2017,4.0,5.0,nan,yes,Calgary to Kelowna,4.0," |  Overall a great experience with Westjet. I flew from Calgary to Kelowna in December 2017 and had no issues whatsoever. The plane was small and older but did the job just like any other would. The staff were very professional and they treat you like family. The pilots also display a professional attitude by greeting you on and off the plane with greeting words and even shaking your hand. I've flown many times with Westjet and they are my no 1 pick for an airline. My only hiccup I had with Westjet was on a flight from Winnipeg to London UK when we were diverted to Montreal, sat on the tarmac for 3 hours in the middle of the night and given nothing as a compensation which I didn't like. Normally, if there is a delay, a discount on a future flight and/or or free meal would have been nice but we received nothing except a small apology. Other than that, I have had no problems flying with Westjet. Prices are fairly competitive and they have lots of seat sales during the year. A word of advice to anyone who flies on a standby buddy pass, try to use it to go to a destination that has daily multiple flights out if it and back such as Calgary to Toronto or Calgary to Vancouver as you are a low priority over guests flying that paid the regular fare. I would advise on not using a standby buddy pass on a flight with lots of layovers or a one flight a day in and out destination as there's a high chance the plane will be full and you'll likely be out of luck or stuck at a stopover location a lot longer than you originally planned. I would pay the regular fare to have high priority in that situation. That's my advice.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Toronto to Montreal,1.0," |  Toronto to Montreal. I almost always use Air Canada to fly Montreal Toronto round trip, but occasionally I am forced to book on Westjet if it's a last minute booking. Almost every time, they cancel the flight at the last minute. This happened again today; at 2pm they emailed me that my 5pm flight was cancelled and I would be changed to the 8pm. They say it is out of their control, that air traffic control decided that there were too many flights for the number of runways (suddenly!) and that they had to cancel the flight. The Westjet gate for flights to Montreal is literally as far as possible from the main terminal (it is the last gate, about 1 km from the terminal) and once they cancel your flight you have to walk all the way back to the terminal to get customer ""service"", even if you use the internet to agree to the flight change. They can't email you the boarding pass? Nope. Then another kilometre back to the gate. To pass the 3 hours in this hinterland at the end of the airport they have a few vending machines and a tiny Tim Hortons. Forget getting a proper meal or a glass of wine. Westjet is the worst. Because being changed to the 8pm flight made it so that it would have been faster for me to drive from destination than to fly, there was nothing good about it.

I take at least 10 flights a year on this airline. It has gotten consistently worse for the past 5 years. The onboard services are non-existent even in premium economy. There are no tablets or other in-flight entertainment services. You have to bring your own device and pray that it might work on their low-tech system, otherwise you will sit for the entire duration of the flight with no entertainment options. The food is simply atrocious in spite of the fact that you have to pay top dollar for it. The only good thing is that the cabin crew are reasonably friendly.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,January 2016,2.0,4.0,4.0,yes,YVR to SNA,2.0,"I very much appreciate the convenience of the WestJet direct Vancouver flight to Santa Ana Airport (John Wayne). However Westjet needs to be aware of passengers who are bringing their larger pieces of luggage to the gate. On both legs of my trip recently, the flights were completely sold out - this is during a typical slow travel period so this direct flight is very popular. Some passengers are aware of this and do not check in their luggage to avoid the extra fees. I saw massive backpacks and certainly more than one piece of carry-on for several travellers. The airline rep then makes a preboarding announcement claiming that the overheard bin allowance is very limited and they would appreciate passengers checking in their luggage at the gate for free. This is annoying as I followed the rules (as did many others) and paid the check in fees per piece. Westjet needs to be more vigilant and monitor this. Some of the flights on this route have the tv screens, others do not. Seats are crammed in Economy and the back recliner buttons do not necessarily work - this is probably an advantage. Beverages are served in plastic glasses smaller than hotel bathroom cups, but it is nice that prior to descending, additional water is offered. For an Economy flight, 2.5 hours is tolerable and the staff is typically cheerful. The counter service at Santa Ana is very helpful.",Family Leisure,4.0,4.0

We then flew to Cancun and they got more fuel and then they tried again for 40 minutes but again unsuccessful because the airport was shut down. We then returned to Cancun. The pilot kept us informed the whole time which was very reassuring. They rented buses to take us to the Marriott for the night and gave us all a $60.00 food voucher. We were picked up at 11:00 a.m. the next morning and then flew us to Cozumel. We must commend WestJet for their handling of this situation they were absolutely amazing!

I had a very bad cough that I couldn't shake and staff ensured that I had bottled water or hot tea (he even refilled my tea when I was sleeping so I had it anytime I coughed and woke!) as well as offering me cough drops (Buckley's - they taste so awful but they really work!). This cabin staff member managed to start and hold a conversation with everyone who came up, myself included.

Front end crew had poor attitudes on both flights. On the 1st leg the Cabin steward was extremely grumpy with any guests that stood on his carpeted area at the front of the cabin while being next in line for the bathroom, which would force these people into the other people's sitting area. This happened numerous times throughout the flight. When the front end cabin crew exchanged areas with the rear crew briefly, this was not an issue. Although having paid extra money for 4 to be seated in the ""Plus"" section both directions, there was apparently only one blanket on the plane, and it had just been handed out to row 8. I'm sure it wouldn't break the bank for WestJet to ensure that there is always enough blankets on the plane for people seated in Plus. When my husband asked for a glass of wine (the 1st) only 3 hours into the flight, he was told that the alcohol cutoff time was 2:30 am. How convenient it was 2:30 am! Perhaps it was an inconvenience for us to interrupt her knitting. Having flown many airlines internationally, we have never heard of such an alcohol policy. Please inform me if this does exist. Will I fly WestJet again - yes, but only on regional flights. However, never again on a flight over 2 hours, and never will I pay for a ""PLUS"" seating again.

The new WestJet Airlines Plus seating isn't worth the extra money. Same seats with the middle seat blocked off. Don't be fooled by the Plus Seating boast of Premium food and drink. The food choices are negligible and are all basically sandwiches. I got a cold ham and cheese croissant with two cookies. Alcohol is also included but limited to cheap wine and beer and a few basic liquor brands. Cabin crew were pleasant enough but became tiresome with the lame jokes.

Boeing 737-600,Premium Economy,4.0,February 2016,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,YYZ to TPA via YOW,3.0,"Toronto to Tampa via Ottawa. 'Plus' fare class both segments, operated without issue, on time. Staff efficient, affable and accommodating. Have never experienced a negative in-flight encounter flying WestJet. The Plus fare class continues, in my mind, to be WestJet's attempt at 'premium economy.' I normally book it from the get-go as opposed to waiting to 24 hours prior to flight and checking for availability at time of online check-in , although there is a substantial saving if one is able to snag a Plus seat at that point; well worth it. Is Plus' class worth it at full fare? Obviously I do since I'm willing to pay for it at time of booking. However, would like to see an improvement to the on-board food offered for flights to Florida or the Caribbean. Despite fairly strong satisfaction with WestJet, an area of frustration for me continues to be their ground staff's confusion regarding priority security screening for Plus fare passengers. In my past several flights, there has consistently been a lack of understanding and confusion as to whether priority security screening is, in fact, a Plus fare benefit; on a most recent trip out of Toronto, a WestJet staff member argued with me at the airport that it was not available to my family and me even though I presented him a print-out of the WestJet web page that clearly said it was (learning from past experience). Despite the hardcopy evidence, this staff member unceremoniously dismissed me, stating the site is wrong and I was out of luck (although when I explained it at priority security, surprisingly my family was allowed through, saving us considerable time in the process). I had even contacted the WestJet call centre prior to the day of flight to confirm for my own sanity; the call agent had to visit their own web-site to confirm the benefit applied (which they did confirm, however, I sensed that was news to them). As I mentioned above, this issue has persisted on multiple occasions. On the return flights, gate staff in Tampa admitted to the confusion, at both the check-in and gate check counters, even going so far as to telling me for future trips departing Tampa to visit the main check-in counter to get a priority stamp even if already checked in online. Strange. I intend to contact WestJet's corporate office to seek clarification once and for all and to understand if WestJet management are aware there is a general lack of understanding for a benefit that is clearly stated in their Plus fare information.

Therefore while I used my Westjet ID to make the booking online and pay for the airfare I was never aware of the nature of the program. I used my Westjet ID because my wife does not have one.

From the rep I dealt with in Saskatoon who could not stop talking on her phone while checking me in (and giving me the opposite of the seats I requested) to the flippant customer service rep in Toronto when I found out my flight had left without me ten minutes earlier, this company has the worst customer service I have experienced in a very long time.

When my husband stretched his feet out to rest against the partition (as everybody does) she barked: ""Get your feet down!"".  We were in Plus seats so were offered the boxed lunch at no extra fee. However, the food was inedible. The food and snacks on this flight offer little nutritional value as well as being devoid of taste. There are no gluten-free or vegan options. The seat comfort was at a minimum even in Plus because the middle seat, which could have offered a little more wiggle room, is blocked off with a ridiculous hard table which cannot be removed.

Unfortunately, apparently due to some issue on WestJet's Calgary-Hawaii route, our return flight was cancelled, a new flight created and our aircraft type disappointingly replaced with one of two older B737 'rescue' flights to bring the full complement of WestJet's passengers back to Toronto. After receiving email notification of the change, and suspecting there would be some logistical challenges to keeping our Plus seat allocations, I attempted to retrieve our booking online, however, was unable to and directed by the WestJet site to contact customer support. While friendly and understanding, the call centre was unable to confirm any seat allocation as their internal system was 'locked', and I was informed I would only know about seat allocation at time of check-in. I figured the WestJet system could do the math: 24 Plus seats in the 767 equals 12 + 12 Plus seats in two 737's. But who trusts technology? At precisely 24 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart, accessed the online check-in and sure enough, our five seats were allocated in five different rows, in the middle and rear. No Plus allocation. Fortunately, I was able to 'upgrade' to Plus seats online, at $0, and print our boarding passes. Needless to say,  there were other Plus passengers on our flight who did ultimately lose their Plus seats, and ended up sitting in Economy. Only explanations I can come up with are that passengers not originally in Plus were able to 'upgrade' at time of check-in, or there were more Plus passengers allocated to the first rescue flight than the second. One would think with the technology we employ today, this would have been managed better. Boarding at MBJ was somewhat chaotic as gate staff appeared to have trouble processing and reconciling boarding passes, heard some talk of 'duplicates.' In the end, the flight departed about 15 minutes late due to boarding pass administration. The flight itself was the usual WestJet standard. Flight staff friendly, helpful and always available. No inflight entertainment, though, (aka free movies) as the system for this flight was not configured owing to the flight change (in other words, someone forgot to 'flip the switch' to load films for this particular flight).

Essentially our flight was cancelled and we were placed on another aircraft (Omni International) - which was a very old aircraft used primarily as a US troop carrier. There was no information from anyone about this prior to the event so we could make alternative arrangements. Different seat numbers and no entertainment. Absolutely no information from any of the staff. Despite all this they still wanted $5.99 for a blanket and money for meals. What was particularly galling was to watch the Westjet crew (who were also going back on this flight) get free meals and the pilots took all the extra leg room seats while families were split up across the aircraft. Really absolutely no notion of customer care or concern. Avoid using this flight at all costs. If you fly with WestJet to London you are basically soft in the head.

The holding area after our boarding passes got checked was too small for the amount of people waiting in there and the way they chose to board the plane was nonsensical as you couldn't get through all the people crammed into the tiny area. Once we did get on the airplane it became even more disorganized. There wasn't a set meal time (for our paid meals from a cart - no menus in the seat back pockets either so that was inconvenient and a waste of time as they had to hand each person a menu once the cart reached them and wait for them to make a selection) people were reclined while others were eating (taking up what little space you get) and I've never seen more people stand up to use the washroom while the flight attendants were in the aisle. I recommend that you bring your own food on board (they sell food on the flight but it was not good), bring your own pillow + blanket (not offered) and charge your devices and make sure you have an additional power source.

The airline boarding personnel refused to accept all of these IDs insisting on seeing my passport. After 40 min dispute (my 2:40pm plane had departed by then), I still wasn't allowed to fly.

I left the departure gate, went to another airline ticketing stand, and asked if I could buy a ticket to Toronto using my foreign driver's licence (government issued photo ID). The ticketing officer confirmed that I can purchase a ticket and fly to Toronto under my driver's licence. So I did!

We arrived into Vancouver two hours late, which is pretty poor for a long haul route. Once in the air don't expect decent service. Expect two hours for drinks. Strangely, food is served before drinks. On our outbound flight the chief attendant seemed more interested in showing off his comedy than providing good service. Otherwise the cabin crew are generally pleasant if not that experienced yet with long haul. The 767s are looking very tired. Cabin staff are resorting to duct tape to apply 'on the fly' fixes. The engines are loud and newer planes really put these old beasts to shame. Maintenance was cited as the cause of our outbound delays. Seats are reasonable in economy, and legroom seems fairly standard. The in-flight entertainment is okay, so long as you prepare in advance by owning a pad and downloading the Westjet app. Reasonable selection of films. Some problems with connectivity. Best to also pack a good book or magazine. In terms of price, these tickets are around £300 lower than BA in summer. Add on the poorly advertised additional charges and this brings you to a £150-200 saving. Westjet is the Ryanair of Canada.

Also was told incorrect carousel where to retrieve checked bags - told Carousel 1, then Carousel 3, then Carousel 1, then 3, then 1. All in all, this experience was a disaster.

Booking the ticket last minute, my dad and I were faced with a 270$+ one-way ticket which surprised us. Later, we did find out that domestic travel in Canada is generally expensive, as the only 2 airlines operating are Air Canada and WestJet. I decided to pay for a seat upgrade to their Plus seats (WestJet's Premium Economy product) for 50 Canadian dollars each. It was pretty much worth it. Priority boarding, the extra legroom, the extra space due to the blocked middle seat, first to deboard and first bags to come up. Since it was such a short flight, no actual meal was served, rather than a pretzel/cookie and drinks. Overall, very excellent service with professional and generous cabin crew.

After waiting for all of the luggage to come out on the carousel it was clear that my carryon as well as at least ten other passengers carryons were not there. I then proceeded to wait in line at Baggage Services to find out what was going on to be told that there wasn't enough room under the plane for the carryons so they were being sent on another flight. The clerk then proceeded to tell me that they would give me $100 voucher if I came back to pickup my bag or that they would be willing to deliver the bag to me later that night. I asked for the bag to be delivered and expressed my concerns about the efficiency of the process of checking carryons at the gate. Further I asked why they would make us wait at the airport for an additional hour to receive this information when we could have been told when we landed. She provided me with a guest services card and highlighted a phone number that I could call.

I told her she wasn't hearing me out and that I was trying to explain that the process I went through needs to be re-evaluated.

After taking a $60 cab ride and passing through check-in and security, I received an email via phone that my connecting flight was indeed cancelled. This was 10 min before boarding my first flight and 4 hours before the scheduled connecting flight. I was given the option of returning to my hotel or getting on the flight.

I chose to get on the flight, which was boarding already and figure it out in Calgary. I went directly to 'customer care' upon arrival and my pleas for assistance were met with 'there's nothing we can do' and 'that's not our policy'.

The only sincere apology I received for the long delays and inconvenience were from the pilot of the second flight when he addressed the cabin as a whole.

The ground staff was unhelpful and disorganized. One staff member told me to call a number on a card to be rescheduled on another flight. Another while I was waiting in line to see a desk agent told me to go home. I'm in transit, you've cancelled my connecting flight, I'd love nothing more than to go home. Next I get through to someone on the phone and they tell me they can't help me with rescheduling the flight because I booked through a corporate travel agent.  At every touch point I had with a WestJet employee I got the wrong or contradictory information. I eventually had to call my corporate travel agent who also encountered incompetence with her WestJet interactions and had to book a flight for me on another airline so that I didn't spend 2 days stuck in Toronto. To top it off WestJet could not locate my luggage for two days and had the nerve to tell me it was my fault because I ended up flying on another airline.

I flew from Grande Prairie on Friday morning to have a final destination in Abbotsford. It was myself and my one year old daughter flying. This was my first time flying with my infant so I did not know the procedures. As we arrived at the airport very early Friday morning we were checked in only to have us turned around at security for not having a boarding pass for my infant. So as we go back to the WestJet counter I was rudely greeted by a gentlemen trying to argue with me that my daughter wasn't registered to fly when it showed on my email that she was. First of all the first attendant checked me in knowing I had an infant with me and didn't do her job to even check it was correct. He then told another lady to deal with us because he didn't have time for that. So when the third attendant come to help me she finally made a phone call and got my daughter registered. On the plane then the flight attendant didn't even have an infant listed on the plane. As this being my first time travelling with my daughter it was very stressful and I didn't find any of the staff helpful. Which leads me to my departure today from Abbotsford, I arrived super early to make sure there was no complications again with my daughter and she said everything was fine, which was a relief but she again was very rude to me and told me I had to pay for my lugguge when I asked why when I didn't have to pay for my bag on the flight up and she again very rudely came up with some explanation. I wasn't impressed with my flights to and from especially the fact that I had an infant with me. I don't expect to have special treatment because I have an infant but what I do expect it decent service.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Now you have to stand line at the kiosks to print ones boarding pass and luggage ticket and then stand in line again at the luggage drop off.

Check in at Kamloops was smooth and efficient as always, but Calgary was a different story. Ground issues in Calgary made our flight delayed on getting to the gate by around 20 or so minutes, without any of us onboard notified about what was happening. My return flight from Calgary in the evening got delayed by more than 45 minutes due to ""ground issues"" with WestJet staff at YCC. Our gate had to be switched last minute, which left those of us taking the flight walking to another side of the terminal. I understand that there will be delays with traveling, but being left out of the loop is a complete joke.

The flight times changed also by over an hour making it not possible for me to make my schedule.

We stood in line for 1:20 hours, and once we were through customs we were told to board immediately. There were still about 50 people behind us, and because of this the flight was delayed. We were told by a flight attendant that things are a lot better at certain destinations, such as Jamaica, but that the Dominican Republic has a bit of a reputation for processing people inefficiently and very slowly. Such a delay would cause us to consider changes in our travel plans, and I hope the airline will work on improving things.

The staff both in the terminal and on the plane could not be more helpful and courteous. Never have I been made to feel like I was an inconvenience to them. Last year I fell as I was coming out the door of the plane. I was quickly assisted up and into my chair. Nothing hurt but my pride. The next morning I received a call to see how I was and if there were any after effects. I thought this was a very nice unexpected jesture. When traveling alone. They escort me through check in and security and get me to my gate. The only negative thing I have to say is that the area I was left in in encores waiting area. Was very cold (this was in the Calgary airport) you could see your breath. Even when traveling with someone. They assist with pushing me up and down the ramp. Can't say enough about how it makes me feel that I know I can travel comfortably and on my own if needed.,Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

SATA unfortunately partners with WestJet for Montreal travellers going to and from the Azores Islands. When we arrived at 6 PM from Azores, tired and jet lagged, we found out that WestJet had cancelled all flights to Montreal. Not a word of excuse, no help at all to contact a hotel, we had to insist to get a boarding card for this morning and were given a small card (flight interruption ) with a phone num to call but of course the nun was always busy. There were just a handful of STA passengers going to Montreal and Westjet not transfer us to Air Canada nor hellp us in any way to find or pay for a hotel. Air Canada was still flying to Montreal but Westjet cancelled due to weather conditions and does not help a handful of stranded passengers! The fact that the ground staff was of no help at all, that the number to call was always busy is inexcusable. We had to walk a long time in the airport to find WestJet counter but no help at all when we found them. They simply didn't care. My husband is an elderly man. No offer of complimentary meal, Hotel stay or ticket for any other trip ( not that we ever want to fly with them again) Very rude airline. We had heard so . Only reason we flew with WestJet is that they partner with SATA to fly to beautiful Azores. First and last time with this Airline. I am a frequent traveller and Aéroplan member with AC.

Decided to give West Jet a chance on a relatively low stakes flight from Montreal to Toronto Pearson.  The first problem is that Pearson was undergoing runway repairs so they were short of landing space. The second is that WestJet may not have enough clout to get priority in terms of space compared with Air Canada. My flight from Montreal was delayed twice to total 25 min in the same morning of my flight. My return flight had multiple time changes 5 times. And the worst is they don't publish those last minute changes on Pearson's site. So there's no way to know. I checked Air Canada's flights for the same period and only one of their flights were affected whereas West Jet had a handful of flights delayed and a few cancellations.

The customer service representative I was talking to even told me that ""In your world it might not happen ever, but in my world this happens all the time!""  Also the same customer representative told me that they will deliver my baggage to the place I am staying at even if it is late as they deliver until 2am.  But when my luggage finally arrived in the country after 2 hours of being delayed and after another 2 hours of clearing customs. I was told that either I pick it up or wait for it to be delivered the next day between 9am to 4pm. Again another fail in their part. Why promise your customers to deliver something you can't? The next customer service representative I spoke to said that the last delivery is only at 9pm. Different people, but one company saying two different things. No uniformity, it means someone does not know their own guidelines. Getting my hopes up and then crushing it. Even writing a customer feedback on their webpage takes about a week for them to reply. And also I get $100 a day to buy all the things I need while my luggage haven't arrive, but to get reimburse I have to wait 14 days for them to reply after I have uploaded the receipt of the things I have bought.

Here I am sitting in Toronto airport and WestJet staff want me to wait four additional hours to catch the next flight to Ottawa. I told them that there is an Air Canada flight that takes off in about 90 minutes to Ottawa, but they said the only seats available are business class and they can't reserve these for me. They can make me wait 48 hours in an airport, spend hundreds of additional $$ to stay alive in another city, and again make me wait four more hours in Toronto but they can't own up to their faults and spend a couple of extra hundred dollars to get me home to my family. I asked to speak to a manager 3 times, and each time the WestJet rep would speak to the manager by phone but the manager wouldn't talk to me.

I had had an issue on a previous flight to Dublin a few years ago but that was an unfortunate event and resulted in a short delay. The price of the ticket was great and with that price I understand that meals cannot be included nor are wine and beer. Coffee, water, soft drinks are complimentary and you can buy food on the plane is you wish. I think people should educate themselves on Airplane travel and that you get what you pay for.

Sitting beside someone with any normal width to their shoulders has us touching each other and I feel I need to keep my arms as close in as possible - making for a very uncomfortable situation. The seat in front has been moved so that it's difficult to read a magazine at times because it presses up against the seat in front. Flying WJ is now like flying Air Transat or other charter company flights. I also find now with the odd exception the inflight crew to be disinterested and not very friendly.

There was not queue at security and it would be no problem in getting to the gate. I could have got to the gate in less then 10 minutes. The CSA was very rude and condescending she lectured me and did not provide any quality customer service. As a result I was not able to go to Cabo and had to re-book for another day. This was all because WJ would not step up and provide some great customer service. I could understand if it was a very busy time when the airport is packed and their is huge line-ups everywhere.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,Recently flew from Saskatoon to Cancun. Departing Saskatoon we were boarded on time and then proceeded to sit in the aircraft at the gate for at least 60 mins. This was apparently due to freezing rain which had been falling from the sky 2 hours before when I walked into the airport. Why board us? Would be much more comfortable sitting in the airport. On the way home after boarding in Cancun we once again sat in the aircraft on the ramp for 60 mins. We were told it was due to the Mexican ramp hands having some confusion with the luggage. On arrival in Saskatoon we were to find out that they had off loaded bags in Cancun due to a weight and balance issue. Why couldn't the captain have been honest rather than blaming the Mexican ramp hands? The person I was travelling with was unlucky enough to have his luggage not arrive. He was told it would arrive the next morning. He has yet to receive it and we have been home for almost 72 hours. When we were checking in at the airport in Cancun a group of people approached the counter next to us asking to get on our direct flight rather than the one they were scheduled to be on. None of these people were standing at the baggage claim in Saskatoon wondering where their luggage was. This does not make sense to me. Their luggage should have been off loaded. I can only assume that the plane became overweight with the last minute passengers and their luggage. Also have to say that the food available on board is appalling. I am a vegetarian and can choose from a variety of junk food options. There is no veggie sandwich available. I asked for crackers and hummus and was told it was not available so then asked for the cheese plate and received the same answer. We sat on that aircraft for seven hours on the way home how can you expect someone not to eat for seven hours? I used to think that Westjet was the only option when choosing an airline. Not anymore.

Only thing to note is that a small roll on bag will not fit under the seat in front of your if you are seated on the aisle. That space is very small and will fit only a large purse or very small carryon bag. Middle seats and window seats seemed to have enough room under the seat ahead for a reasonable sized carryon. If you don't board the flight early you miss out on finding space in the overhead bins and even one flight when I boarded right after pre-boards people in the row behind mine had crammed everything into the overhead bins leaving no room for others around them. So be warned about this. The four flights I took from Ottawa to Toronto and then to Tampa and back were fine. The crew were very pleasant and the ground staff in all airports were equally pleasant. No complaints here. Seat space did not seem any roomier than other airlines I have travelled on and food like other airlines must be bought by credit card. It would be nice to see a small sandwich offered free of charge like in the ""good old days"" not that long ago. I'm sure it would not cost them that much.

Instead of trying to be helpful, all she did was lecture me that I was late and that I was probably going to miss my flight. I explained about the boarding pass issue and asked if she could help to expedite our way through the security line so we wouldn't miss our flight. Her answer was ""you got here late and you have to wait like everybody else. There's nothing I can do"". As we were finishing going through security they called my and my family member's names.

On these flights however, there wasn't an empty seat on the plane, either way and of course I had a very large ""companion"" in the middle seat. Really it did not feel much different from the regular economy, but at least I did not have to pay any extras. I note that Westjet are going to stop selling the middle seat. Too bad they haven't implemented that already. I was hoping for some level of improved comfort for the extra money, but really I was just crammed in like everyone else. Food is the same as regular economy, and nothing to get excited about: limp sandwiches and junk food snacks. Wine was drinkable. On the return flight, the aircraft had no seat back entertainment, instead they were renting out tablets (much like AC Rouge). This was, of course, free in Plus. Choices on the tablet were minimal.

However, definitely no complaints other than the slight annoyance of hearing some passengers brag about their $50 at-the-gate-upgrade while others, including myself, paid well over double the economy fare. As a shareholder in WestJet, the company should either fly the seat empty or charge a higher day-of premium. The flights were smooth on both legs. Toronto Airport (I refuse to call it Pearson) looked like a nightmare on the outbound with masses of people lined up, or milling about, but with a Nexus card and no checked bag, I was from curb to gate in 10 minutes. On the return leg, using online check-in, did not get the security pre-check at Tampa and the security personnel refused to budge even when I pointed out the obvious signs directing WestJet Plus class passengers to the expedited line. At the gate during passport validation, staff asked me if I had encountered difficulty and told me that I need to stop by the check-in counter to get the boarding pass stamped. Fortunately, the screening line was reasonable. Onboard service for both flights was efficient and professional if somewhat impersonal. The hot towel service is a nice touch and the snack box accompanied by a sandwich and other snacks satisfied the munchies. Had a seatback TV on the way down and inflight wireless entertainment on the way back, however, used neither as I brought my own distractions. As for the seating in Plus class, the bulkhead 2A on the outbound is a great seat. Plenty of leg room to stretch out although seat width is still somewhat snug. The refit of the middle seat to additional tray space is effective in providing sufficient separation from the aisle seat. The only downside to the bulkhead is, of course, no under seat storage although I observed a bulkhead passenger planting their handbag under their own seat effectively ‘stealing’ space from the second row. On the way back, I was 2f, second row on this particular aircraft, and the bulkhead passenger placed a bag under their seat. I hope they don’t mind the dirty foot print I inflicted upon it as I pushed it as far forward as possible in order to accommodate my own bag. While the middle seat is blocked, the under seat storage still exists although for the aisle passenger, an electronics box is situated on their side creating some difficulty in stretching the legs. Whether Plus class can be considered worth the cost or not will be a subjective call.

My two sons and I were not allowed on our return flight (WS2205) from Puerto Vallarta because my sons are high functioning autistics. The gate attendant accused my 18 year old son of being intoxicated so we were pulled aside and not allowed to board. I explained to her that my son was stimming (flapping) because he was anxious. The boarding was beyond the time stated on our ticket and there were no announcements so he felt anxious. She told me that it would be up to the crew to decide if we could board. We waited until the boarding was complete and then same gate attendant came over and told us that the crew decided that we were not acceptable. No one came to see us so we were never even considered. So disappointing. Not proud of my fellow Canadians. After that we were escorted to a lower part of the airport and waited for about 30 minutes (supervised) and then taken to a customs area where the Mexican customs officials started searching for our luggage that was removed from the plane. I sat on the floor and called WestJet to rebook for next available flight which was next day via Calgary. I did not argue the situation with the customer rep as my goal at that moment was to get my sons and I home. The CSR was helpful and nonjudgmental. I was very thankful for that. While I was on the phone, Customs located our bags which were then searched even though we had not left the country. We were escorted by Customs back to main terminal where I had to go to an ATM and get pesos to take a cab and the ATM kept my card but did supply 500 pesos. We found a hotel in PV and went there to await our next day flight. During the night, I wrote a long note on the WestJet feedback site about what happened but I doubt anyone cares. In addition, as a CIA, certified internal auditor, I am a specialist in business processes so made recommendations, including having a second opinion when disallowing passengers, especially international flights and also autism awareness training for all staff. The next day when we were checking in for our flight, a supervisor was alerted and came over to ask if we were feeling better today. I told her that we were as healthy as yesterday and that my son is autistic, not intoxicated. She told me that that information was nowhere in the notes from the day before. The supervisor treated us with kindness although blaming me for not disclosing. I told her that I fully disclosed. The gate attendant likely never passed that info on to the crew. Not our fault. No apologies from WestJet. The gate attendant appeared to have no understanding of what autism is and kept looking at my son like he was a monster. She must have deemed that information to be invalid. Of note, on the second day, when we were allowed to travel, our checked luggage had Standby tags. We were not flying standby, so my impression is that we were still not fully ""acceptable"" and could be disallowed from boarding. I am so proud of my 17 and 18 year old sons. Throughout this whole process, they hassled no one and were fully cooperative. We had such a fun week in PV but WestJet ruined our experience. I feel sad for my sons. My sons want privacy so will not go public with this so I must honour that. WestJet has so much to learn about customer service, due diligence and professionalism. There is also a loss of trust.

Not like the nexus line. Also, we found it surprising that families and emergency rows were seated first. There was a lot of confusion and somewhat poor communication at the gate.

Boeing 737-800 / 737-700,Economy Class,3.0,August 2017,3.0,3.0,nan,no,Honolulu to Montreal via Vancouver,2.0," | My first time flying WestJet. You pay to pre-book your seat as with many airlines these days (no problem), but if you want to change your seats after that and before check-in, they make you pay again and then refund your first payment, even if the seats are the same price (makes no sense). I tried checking-in on their app which would give me an error message a number of times saying that it couldn't connect with their server. On the day of the flight the inbound flight from YVR was delayed almost two hours, delaying our HNL-YVR flight by two hours, meaning we wouldn't make our connecting flight to YUL (no reason given for the delay only their flights to Hawaii were delayed, all others were on time) Before calling WestJet, I went to check for a timetable on their website so I was prepared with our flight options - absolutely no timetables on their website; only a list with a city and the cities they fly to from there and how many times a day or a week. I was astounded. No help whatsoever. I was on hold for nearly half an hour when I called. The phone rep was very nice and helpful (she herself couldn't find out why our flight was delayed), but the soonest we could get in to YUL was 11pm, nearly 7 hours later than originally scheduled and going from YVR to YYZ to YUL (WestJet has at the most only 2 flights a day between YVR and YUL). I asked if we could switch to the flight the next day - we could and for no fee. So we left one day later than planned. I was able to get an exit row when checking in for no charge (seat had no recline, though). Flights were fortunately on time. Baggage drop was quick and easy at HNL. Exit row seats are able to board first - a nice perk. Seats were an average width, leg room pretty good, no recline not really a problem. Cabin crew were nice enough, but, upon walking back to the restroom during the flight, my husband found all 4 of them asleep (this was a red eye flight). I didn't consume any of their food or beverages, but they use Dasani water. Ugh. At YVR, WestJet has a nice part of the domestic terminal (gates B14-B18) and a not so nice part (gates B19-B23). The flight to YUL left from the not so nice part. The plane was an older 737-700. No exit row this time so the seat felt more cramped. I purchased their breakfast sandwich (cold ham and swiss on a croissant). It was fine and not too expensive. Cabin crew again were nice enough. I didn't use their streaming IFE for any of the flights. I had high hopes for WestJet and I was definitely disappointed. Yes, their staff on all levels are nice and friendly, but we got to our destination 24 hours later than planned with really no explination. I'd rather get there on time with an indifferent crew who don't feel a need to make cutesy comments and on-hold muzak with dumb jokes. Plus their internet-based services for passengers are awful. It just felt like a third-rate airline. Air Canada is two leagues ahead and about the same price. I won't be flying WestJet again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

This is an international airline with the comfort and convenience of cattle class. I know they're cheaper than the likes of Air Canada but in my opinion it's a false economy. First they don't include free baggage and bizarrely don't allow you to pre-purchase baggage until you check in. Secondly we chose to have 3 gluten free meals but none were available - indeed no meals at all are included in long haul flights. Third we'd prepaid for seats together including extra legroom but they changed the plane and assigned us seats in the back row leaving us to claim a refund on our return home.

Recently Atlantic Canada experienced a complete meltdown due to Bell Aliant's service being cut, and added to that there were thunderstorms around the Toronto area. What does WestJet do to help their customers? Absolutely nothing. Rather than informing confirmed customers about possible changes, I waited in line for 90 minutes to be told that I was in the wrong line up. Then I was moved around several flights to finally get home. And that I wouldn't actually leave Halifax for 12 hours. Yet, other airlines were able to keep their flight schedules with some delays.

There was a passenger who had clearly drank way too much during the flight.  He and his friends were basically allowed to conduct a party at the front of the plane, out of their seats and sitting on the floor of the plane. The crew had to ask him several times to keep it down but they did not stop serving them alcohol. The drama started once we landed and this passenger started yelling, swearing and causing a major disturbance.  We were then informed, of all times, that there was a gate issue and they could not get us off the plane. For a good 30 mins this passenger continued to behave in a belligerent manor making other passengers irate!  The Westjet crew and captain did nothing to de-escalate the issue but let it continue the whole time we were stuck on the plane. I was travelling with my 8 year old son who was terrified by the passengers’ irrational behaviour! It was absolutely disgusting that there was nothing done, no security or police called to escort the passenger off the plane.  Since there were many angry passengers at this point, the situation could have easily gotten out of control on the plane, ramp, or baggage area. I am extremely disappointed by how this was handled (or not handled) by Westjet employees.  They are responsible for the safety of passengers and should not have had allowed people to be subject to this behavior.  At the very least security should have been called to the plane.  ",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

I've been flying with WestJet for years and been satisfied with their service. Recently, however, they have chosen to partner with AeroMexico and promote their flights on their site. However, AeroMexico’s standards and policies are nothing like WestJet’s. My husband is Mexican, and they refused to accept the documentation we received from the Embassy of Canada and didn’t allow my husband on the flight. They stranded us in Mexico City – at 2 am with a baby. As a result, what was supposed to be an overnight trip ended up being a three-day nightmare. We were forced to purchase last minute flights with a domestic airline to Cancun to catch a flight from WestJet that flew to Canada. WestJet's policies are up-to-date with Canada's policies and we had no issues flying into Vancouver, or with Immigration when we landed. After discussing this with WestJet’s Help Desk and contacting them through email, explaining the nightmare and asking for a refund for the AeroMexico tickets, they came back saying they do not have access to the funds so they cannot reimburse me and that my issue is with AeroMexico alone. They said it does not involve them in the least. AeroMexico refuses to resolve the issue. I passed that information along to WestJet, but they again said it’s no their issue. Now this is a company WestJet have chosen to partner with and promote these flights on WestJet website. WestJet customers trust you are going to partner with a company that will provide a service that is paid for, and in the least, have accurate understand of the policies of the country they fly into.

The flight itself was nice; I got a seat on Economy Plus, and the 9 hours from Vancouver to Gatwick went by quickly. But once I got out of the plane, it was completely chaos. I had a layover in London, before going to my final destination in Copenhagen, and I was told in Vancouver that my baggage would be sent all the way to Copenhagen, however I had to verify with a Westjet Agent in London. Arriving in London I looked and asked for my baggage, but it didn't arrive and I was told that it should have arrived, because it only said ""Gatwick"" and not ""Copenhagen"" on the baggage strip, thus I hadn't been told the truth in Vancouver. I went to Denmark without my luggage, which didn't arrive in Copenhagen either. Then, a long struggle to get in contact with Westjet started - I wasn't provided with the right number to track my bag from the beginning, so I had to contact Westjet by facebook, because I didn't get a reply via email. When I finally got the right tracking number, they hadn't written my email and phone number properly, and didn't seem to care to check (the first days I wasn't contacted at all and didn't know what to do). The correspondance on Westjet's website was quite random and insuficient. I asked several questions I never received any answers to, furthermore I wrote emails directly to Westjet that were never replied. I was suddenly told that my baggage had arrived in an airport in Denmark, even though I wasn't provided with any information of the flight number, date or the new tracking number to my luggage. I rushed to the airport, where I was told that my bag hadn't arrived, and furthermore that I didn't have the right numbers to collect it. Several days went by where I still didn't get any proper answers to my questions on my lost bag, when it finally came and I was contacted directly from an agent from the Danish airport, who had been obliged to look up my phone number because Westjet had given the wrong number. The whole situation was very frustrating and confusing, and it seemed like nobody within westjet wanted to take any responsability - I was in contact with 8-9 different agents during the whole period. I got tons of insufficient information; single phrases and random info that didn't match. Furthermore, from the beginning I got 5-6 different numbers and had no idea which ones to use.

It wasn't. I arrived in London without my bag. The following day, with up to 8 agents standing around in Gatwick's WestJet check in area, I had to wait for the 1 person that was at lunch to get my bag. This caused me to miss my flight to Ireland. WestJet is taking no responsibility for having ill informed employees. They want to give me a voucher for a future flight, as if I would ever fly with them again.

She was on the plane when my wife and I arrived! We never shared a single word! I couldnt even see her since I was forced to sit forward and sideways to accommodate her.

Upon arrival to Toronto after checking in 24 hours before our flights from Curacao to Toronto WS2689 and Toronto to Calgary WS675 we found out that our flight to Calgary was rescheduled from 10:35 pm on November 19 to 7:00 am on November 20, 2017. Apparently WestJet assumed we wouldn't have enough time to connect due to flight from Curacao being delayed by 1 hour as WestJet representative made an error when checking in luggage for one or more guest in Curacao. Furthermore they assumed we may have luggage to check-in and would't make it through the check-in counter and security check as lines were long due to other WestJet flights being delay. Not only they assigned our sits to other passengers from another delayed Westjet flight connecting Toronto-Calgary but they refused us on standby after we explained we have no bags to check-in and travel only with carry-on. The response from the representative was that we are last to check-in despite we did 24 hours in advance and had our boarding passes printed. After long negotiation process and explanation of the circumstances surrounding my surgery on November 20, 2017 they agreed to send me alone on my initially scheduled flight. Needless to say how poorly and unprofessionally some WestJet staff is trained offering $25 food voucher as a compensation to my husband. After long stressful conversation with 3 westjet representatives and a supervisor we were able to claim our right to be on that flight.

My husband & I paid $3847.12 for that privilege, and our friends paid just over &1700.00 for the both of them. I knew that we would be paying substantially more for the PLUS seats, and therefore I expected to receive a bit more than the economy ticket allows. What we received was the exact same food in the exact same boxes that the they did, only they had to pay $7.50 for their sandwich and we didn't. We were offered a cheese tray on one leg of the flight, the cost would have been $6.99 in economy, but in fact we didn't get the cheese tray we got the Lite-Bite, and that was $6.49 in economy. I am not sure why you would charge your ""valued customers"" $2100.00 more and then offer no perks to go with it. I was disgusted with the service and the exorbitant price that we paid for it.

This was not made clear anywhere.

Would have taken 50 minutes to board a Max 8 3x3. Took equally as long to offload. No problem though, because our 3rd leg was delayed 45 minutes. Then 65 minutes.

Our flight was delayed by 2 hours at 5:20am while we were already boarded so we had to sit in the airplane for those two hours. The leg room was atrocious. Then came the domino effect. Because of our flight delay we were not able to catch our connecting flight and got to the gate as soon as it closed. The airline obviously knew we would not make it, so they had already moved us to a flight that was leaving 4 hours after the flight we missed. The best part is (sarcasm) that we now went from a direct flight from Toronto to Ft. Lauderdale, to another connecting flight in New York. After arriving in New York we were informed that they were only using one runway and so our flight home would be delayed 2 hours on top of the 3 hour layover. After speaking to a manager in customer service named Jennifer, I was told that there was nothing they can do to compensate us in any way because the reason for the delay was uncontrollable due to weather conditions or other planes on the runway. However, we were the first flight to leave and took off with the same exact weather that we boarded the plane with. After expressing this to the manager she still refused to compensate us for the loss of money we paid for the direct flight that we missed due to their airlines delay. To recap, we went from a direct flight from Toronto to Ft. Lauderdale with an arrival time of 1:00pm (which obviously costed more than the connecting flight we were put on); were given another connecting flight with a layover of 5 total hours and 4 hours after our initial flights takeoff time; and given no compensation for being forced to take a flight that was cheaper and inconvenient compared to the flight we paid for. It is unfortunate that I paid for something that was not provided to me and had no control over why it was not provided to me.

I went through US pre-clearance in Montreal in an attempt to get to the gate to speak to a Westjet representative. Imagine my surprise when there were no Westjet representatives at the gate or in US departures section of Montreal airport. Instead, another customer and I attempted to call Westjet to attempt to enquire about our bags and alternatives, but were put on hold for upwards of 15 minutes and it was only after a United Airlines representative helped us out that we were able to enter Canada again in order get to the arrivals baggage carousel in Montreal. We then went to the Westjet counter at arrivals, again, the counter was empty and another United representative had to call a Westjet representative in Montreal. It took another 20 minutes for one to amble over to the abandoned Westjet counter at arrivals. It took over one and a half hours to talk to someone in person, by which time it was too late to even consider other Westjet flights to Boston. Of the four customers who were let down by your service, two are driving back to the United States and the other bought a last minute ticket with Air Canada. I am now stranded in Toronto until 1/5, where I was rerouted to. The process of ensuring I had a place to sleep and food to eat tonight was also ridiculous, I was only able to secure meal vouchers - despite asking specifically about them at Montreal and the Westjet rep there assuring me that they would be provided - after haggling with Westjet representatives at Gate B26 in Toronto. Again, another example of a failure at communication within Westjet. It is disgraceful that I was only able to access the right people via United representatives, who were infinitely more helpful than any of the non-existent reps at US departures in Montreal. Tight connections seem to be a recurring issue with Westjet. It is irresponsible of the airline to sell connecting flights when the second flight departs less than an hour from the landing time of the previous one. This would be an issue even without any delays but seeing as I have been delayed multiple times with Westjet (my previous flight from Boston > Toronto > Calgary being another example), it is frankly dumbfounding that the airline still has the gall to sell these flights.

Clearly not toll free, only when calling from Canada. This could have been smaller, but westjet had over a 40 minute wait and the call back option was not available. When contacting them about this they refused to even acknowledge anything, they are advising customers to call, only to wait (total time on phone was 85 minutes) and be charged. I called them to ask about this and was hung up on by customer service, clearly they dont know how to deal with their customers. Can't blame the customer service lady though, another 40 minutes wait to talk to them only to be hung up on. Our toll in extra costs is over $300 from just actual costs (phone, taxi, accommodations, and parking) but also extra day off work and missing appointment with renters).

Once there was notified our flight was canceled due to operational problem they kept saying. After some time they said it was due to poor weather in Halifax. They said we'd be flying out at 6.40pm that night. Staying in a complementary hotel getting taxi and food vouchers. Westjet does not work with several airlines and wouldn't even attempt to get us on any earlier flights. We knew air Canada had one. So were in the Quebec airport for 8 hours there are two stores and a really terrible bar with awful overpriced deli croissant sandwiches and little else. No other food options. While waiting for our flight we saw a flight leaving to Halifax, which is so crazy cause the weather there was the reason our flight was canceled. We get to the gate to check in at boarding time having been there 8 hours and the lady offers us food voucher for the bar restaurant! Why wouldn't you give those to us 8 hours ago before we paid for our own food at the restaurant. Arrive in Toronto for the night and had to argue with guest services to be provided dinner vouchers that were promised to us. They gave is $30 for 2 people. Next morning trying to get our tickets was a nightmare. Almost didn't make the flight because Westjet failed to reserve us tickets.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

His scooter was sent through as baggage which meant I had to transport him by wheelchair. Both of us are in our 80's which makes travel a challenge. To our rescue came a West Jet customer service person (think her name was Pam or Pat) who literally ran down the corridors pushing the wheelchair and him for what seemed miles of airport. She took us through US customs/immigration, passport control, and then to a shuttle. She had to follow in the next shuttle, then on the run again to our boarding gate. We made the gate just before our section was boarded, and she stayed with us right to that point. This is one excellent person who is a true credit to WestJet staff.

Other than pop or juice, everything was supposed to be paid for. I asked the flight attendant for a juice and she told me that they will start serving drinks to everyone soon. One hour later I finally got my juice. The approach of the flight attendant is its like they are giving you a favor instead of serving you. Mind that it is their job and profession choice. I flew to UK with Air Canada where food and alcohol were free. I find that any other airlines I flew, had a very attentive service where you feel like you are been treated like a customer. In here is pay for everything and whatever is free, you might get it at some point when they serve everyone - which is twice in 8-hour flight. Greatly disappointed.

They cancel flights despite all other airlines flying the same route being in operation. The problem was that it was ""too cold"" despite temperatures being consistent for the whole week (and they did not cancel all of their flights that week, so not sure the problem or why the short notice to cancel or adjust to temperatures). It seems like there is little to no organization for their flights. When they did cancel (we were notified an hour before we were supposed to board) we found out through the airport security, we did not receive any e-mail notification or anything. Then, they couldn't even organize us getting a hotel. We had to taxi back to where we were staying, and couldn't get reimbursed for it because it was too far away to be covered. It took over 2 hours to get rebooked on a flight, that was also delayed the next day. All flights taken by WestJet during this trip were delayed by at least 3 hours or cancelled, meanwhile other airlines we took before transfers were punctual. We also got a significant increase in costs for extended airport parking plus taxi and accomodation costs that are support to be looked at by WestJet. Not to mention being away from work for an extra day, for what seemed not to be a weather issue at all, more so just an unorganized airline. We have not heard from them yet, nor do we expect to at this point. Terrible service, terrible reliability. It may be different in the summer months, but if it is below 0 C fly with someone else. If saving a few bucks is worth sitting in an airport and being out of pocket because of cancellations then fly Westjet, otherwise go with someone else.

The first flight was delayed from Ottawa, sat for 2hrs then they said it wasn't mechanically safe to fly. We were re-routed from another flight from Winnipeg - then that crew had exceeded their legal flight time. We don't know why the original crew was not available anymore. After 4hrs, they cancelled the flight, said to get our bags and call them in 2hrs. The next available flight was 2 entire days later. When we called Atlantis, we were transferred 7x - then they presented no reasonable options to reschedule even though they acted as our travel agent. The only option was to pay $500-$900 in a downgraded room or obtain a resort credit for $300 less than we had paid for the trip. I also lost the cost of my scuba trip I had pre-paid.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Abbotsford to Calgary,1.0," |  Abbotsford to Calgary. I am livid right now with this airline. I have been flying exclusively with Westjet over the last year back to Calgary to visit my elderly parents and help them out during my father's chemotherapy. Every time I have flown with Westjet over the last 6 months my flight has been delayed at least half an hour to two hours. They always brush it off with their annoying brand of 'Westjet humor' on the plane which used to be kind of cute back in the day when it only happened here and there but has been an epidemic of late. I normally do not check a bag as I don't bring much with me. This trip I did check a bag because I had some things I couldn't check on the plane with me as gifts for a friend and some necessities my parents can't get in Calgary. I left for the airport with plenty of time and arrived almost an hour early to find the check in kiosks either busy or broken. I had already checked in online and paid for my checked bag, I just needed to print my bag tags and drop my bag. Once I got to the kiosk I inserted my card to get the tag and was refused check in because it was too close to my flight. Confused, I went to the customer service kiosk where I was directed by one of Westjets employees (she would have been better helping at an actual kiosk instead of wandering around). There were two people at the kiosk, plus another couple passengers who were refused check in as well. There was only one Westjet agent working. She was on the phone dealing with an issue with the two people at the kiosk who I found out were actually travelling on another airline, but because they didn't speak English well she was helping them out (???). Because of the line up forming I guess Westjet decided to bring in another agent to another kiosk. She proceeded to help the couple in front of me and when I got to the kiosk she said I was no longer allowed to take my scheduled flight because it was too late to check the bag. She said they need 45 minutes ahead and I was too late (6 minutes). I was at the airport on time, albeit right on time, due to some traffic issues and the BS I incurred at their kiosks. I asked if there was any way I could get on the plane because of my father's medical appointment and she said the only way was to bring my bag on the plane. I told her about what was in my bag and she said to check with security. I ran to security and was told I would have had to throw away over $100 worth of stuff, plus there was no offer by the westjet agent to refund my checked bag fee, so they would have taken my money for even though I wouldn't have checked it anyway. Even the security agent thought it was ridiculous. I made alternate arrangements for my father and went back to the kiosk to get on a later flight. I was greeted with attitude and indifference to my issues. I now get to wait for over three hours for a later flight. Westjet has gone from a customer friendly airline with no frills to keep costs down to a no-service airline with exorbitant costs and poor employee attitude. They have no qualms about delaying your flight on their end however when it comes to the customer they don't care. If they had enough employees working at their kiosks and were organized to deal with the immediate flights I would be on my plane right now. I will be looking elsewhere for my flying needs in the future and if I have to send anything to my parents I won't be bringing it with me if I ever fly Westjet again, I will give my business to Canada Post.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The second time we called, when we actually intended to use the rewards points and book a flight, we got someone awful trying to convince us a flight from St. John’s to Montreal for $900 was a great deal. I decided to wait a few days for the price to drop (which it did by 300$), but my boyfriend had already booked those crazy expensive flights on my card. I asked for that to be voided immediately and the woman said she voided them and to check my banking. I checked and the flights were still on my statement and her response was “oh, umm, it should go away in 3-5 business days”. This is where I should’ve gotten her name because I would’ve had her fired by now.

While at the gates waiting to board, the staff announced that they will be taking in baggage to check in free of charge. I wrote westjet to see if they can provide me with further customer service, but since they already have my money and I do not need to fly with them of course they did nothing but say ( I am quoting this directly from a response WestJet wrote) ""We only offer to check bags at the gate in the event that the storage space of the aircraft cabin is expected to fill up. At this point WestJet has no choice but to put the excess luggage in the cargo holds. We understand how it may seem unfair to pay for a checked bag while others do not, but it is outside of our guest’s control when the storage space in the aircraft cabin fills up. This is why we believe it is fairer to ask a volunteer to check in their carry-on items free of charge than, to force an unexpected fee they did not budget for. "" Then another response from  ""With all that being said, we are consistently monitoring this matter and looking to make changes to our airport processes. We continually monitor our guests' feedback in order to constantly improve our product and service, using text and voice analytics to watch for trends or opportunities. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. As checking a carry-on is different from checking a checked luggage, we will have to respectfully decline any request for a refund.""

Unfortunately after landing, the gate was not available to disembark and we all stuck in the aeroplane 1 hour after landing and during that duration the staff was rude to the passengers and ordered them remain in seats, no going to bathroom or ask for water or anything.

On the day of our flight, we were informed by the airline that our trip was cancelled due to mechanical issues with the plane. We were automatically booked on a flight leaving 2 days later. We attempted to call and speak with a customer agent on several occassions, however wait times were between 25 and 30 minutes each and every time we spoke with an agent there were no solutions offered. Missing this flight caused many downstream impacts to our travel arrangement in the US including lost hotel reservations, lost nights of vacation home rentals and lost rental car reservations. As you can imagine, cancelling at short notice generally meant that all other travel arrangement cancellations came with penalties and no refunds available. There was absolutely no recourse with Westjet and they only offered that I would receive an email from them next week explaining what their gesture would be for my trouble. A quick calculation has me out $1,100 for 2 days not to mention the fact that our family lost two days of holiday time. I fear that the customer service of Westjet in circumstances where things do not go right is dreadfully lacking. I have flown Air Canada for years and see a marked difference in how both airlines respond to difficult customer situations. Overall, I rate this airline terribly low on customer service. It should also be noted that the amount of misinformation provided to me by agents was astounding. As I spoke to different agents, each said something different than the last. First I was told there were no options for me other than to wait two days. I subsequently find out that a relative of mine on the same flight was rebooked on an Air Canada flight by Westjet for no charge. When I phoned back in to inquire of this possibility, I was told it was an option, unfortunately now all of the Air Canada flights were full. On another occassion I asked if it was possible to be rebooked on flight the next day versus 2 days out. I was told that Westjet only flies from YYT every second day. A second agent told me that Westjet flew each day, however the flight on the next day was already full. Overall just a terrible, disjointed experience.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

The device did not work as well and was very inconvenient. You had to stop watching 40 minutes before flight landed. We bought wifi, this did not work. We could not get a refund right away but had to send a note to the company that provides this service to get a refund. Finally I have never flown overseas where no complimentary meals were provided.

Complimentary snacks were either a choice of pretzels or a cookie, although they would give you both if asked for. Wifi costs 10$ for 3 hours of usage. Speed was acceptable, but no YouTube or Netflix though which is fine. Seat width and pitch was amazing, with the seat pitch feeling like Premium Economy for some airlines even. Power and user ports were available and IFE was available from gate to gate. Overall, an amazing experience and I now would stick with WestJet over Air Canada when flying domestically (or even internationally).",Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,May 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Calgary to Gatwick,1.0," |  I am furious with West Jet and will never fly with them again. I flew 9 hours from Calgary to Gatwick on a plane that was meant for 2-hour flights (at a stretch.) Not only did I have to pay for basic items, blankets so I don't freeze to death, I also had to pay for food and drinks. I didn't eat before getting on the plane and will be damned if I spend 10$ on a pizza onboard.  I had to pay for my entertainment. The couple next to me had spent 30 dollars on food and had to eat it without a drink because the drinks cart was on the other side of the plane. 40 minutes later the cart arrived and all their food had been eaten and still they had to purchase two cokes for another 10$. The seats didn't recline properly. I asked for water about 6-7 times because I had no money to get anything else and they looked at me as if I was greedy or something. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Mexico City to Victoria via Calgary,1.0," | WestJet, what is going on? On my last two flights I have never been so disappointed in about two decades of dedicated flying with your company! I, as are many, are aware that serious things are going on with the company, however this shouldn’t be impacting customer experience - especially on our own dime. We witnessed pilots caring less about their jobs, lack of service in the cabin, questionable delays causing missed flights (and work), inadequate response to the missed flights and issues surrounding accommodation etc. This is shocking! We have never seen this before. For what was such a great company I can see many people rethinking how they now fly domestic and international. How is the company going to rectify the current state? Hope a resolution happens soon!",Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,April 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,no,Toronto to Gatwick,3.0," |  Toronto to Gatwick. Employees were friendly but, overall the flight lacked in value. I booked through a 3rd party where I wasn't informed of all the extra charges WestJet likes to tack on. I fly to Europe at least every other year and made the mistake of assuming this would be like other flights I've booked to Europe. At check in I found out I have to pay $25 to check in my luggage. So I did and then I asked the WestJet employee who helped me with my boarding pass if this still includes a meal on the aircraft since I had to pay for my luggage. The gentleman said yes your meal on the plane is included. On the flight I was asked if I would like to purchase a meal and I told the flight attendant I was informed the meal is included. The attendant stressed that WestJet never includes meals and they can either be pre-purchased or purchased now. This was really annoying because if I had known, why would I pay for airplane food when I could have eaten a meal at the restaurant at my gate?! On the flight back I did end up purchasing a meal and I must say for 9.95 a small bowl of Mac and cheese, it should at least have some cheese - very disappointing even for airplane food! However, the attendant was nice enough to come back after an hour and gave me the meal I originally asked for but was thought to be sold out. The coconut basil chicken was tasty and tender and I'm glad she came back to let me know there was a mistake. Overall with the customer service and trying to scour the customer for every little thing, I would rather book with a proper airline and not have to worry about these things.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Our flight attendant was fantastic, polite and funny. Now we are in Calgary with a 4 hour layover. There’s a flight leaving soon that’s not full and they won’t put us on it. Well they will for $200. That’s ridiculous. They should just keep people moving whenever possible. I just don’t see the logic in this. Hope there’s no delays later on today.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1.0,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Boston to Paris CDG via Halifax,1.0," |  Boston to Paris CDG via Halifax. This was not a good experience. They were unable to get the Boston to Halifax flight to leave close to its original departure time. This led to my missing the Halifax to Paris flight. The delays were iterative so it was at first possible to take the Halifax flight to Paris, but then not. I called WestJet. The call dropped. After >100 minutes on the phone on a second call, during which the WestJet agent became increasingly frustrated and started yelling, I finally got a new ticket route on British Airways. By the time I got this, it was very late to get to the airport. They had no new ticket number, itinerary, terminal, or other details. I had to show up at British Airways and explain my situation. I was the last person on the British Airways plane because by the time WestJet re-routed me, it was already too late to check in at British Airways. I missed my next flight out of Paris. This cost me several hundred dollars. I thought I would save a bit for the sponsoring company of the trip when I booked this flight compared to a standard airline, but I lost more by taking WestJet in the end, didn't get to my destination on time, dealt with frustrated employees on the phone. WestJet doesn't have good partnerships with other airlines, so if they are late, etc., you are basically out of luck. It's a waste of money and time.",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,nan,3.0,2.0,no,Toronto to Montreal,3.0," | Toronto to Montreal. My original flight was a 3pm flight that has been cancelled. WestJet booked me on a Saturday (next day) 9 am flight that was not acceptable for me due to kids at home. I called my travel agent who has been able to confirm a seat on the 6 pm flight. In the meantime, I have been able to secure someone for my kids. But when I arrived at 4pm at the airport, the plane was overbooked and I had no seats. The customer service waiting line was so long that I had the time to call my travel agent again to secure an other seat. She has been able to secure the last seat of the evening before I had the chance to see a WestJet customer service agent. Then, the plane was late due to a lack of agents. Boarding at 8:30pm instead of 7:20. Really disappointed again of WestJet. This is why I’m a gold member of Air Canada. Sorry but with services like these, you won’t see me again for a long time.",Business,3.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Edmonton to Abbotsford via Calgary,1.0," |  Edmonton to Abbotsford via Calgary. I was on time for checkin and stood in line. An employee pulled me off the line to check in at kiosk. I was first one when she pulled me. I told her i am on the 1:45 flight and i have to get boarding pass. She took me to kiosk and asked me flight details. And said oh its time, stand in line. So i dont understand what was the point to take me to kiosk. She could have rushed me to front of line so i can make it to flight. In simple terms its called customer service. But i guess westjet charges the passengers enough to not care what is customer service. I was in line again but still had 45+ min on hand. The person to help took another 5 min to help me. Again no communication by the lady who pulled me initially. Many attendants were sitting on their desks they could pushed this through. He then, argued with me for another 5-7 min. I told him that i can make it through security it is not busy. And all said was no. It was not my fault. And things can be moved around to help passengers realize that when everything else goes wrong, customer service comes through.  I kept requesting and insisting as i had a really important event to attend and  was escalated to a manager,. She kept me in talk for another 5-7 min. Until she said, “oh you are not on 1:15 flight, but on 1:45pm flight. Okay”. Well, I said that to everyone.  By the time i was put on next flight which will get me to Abbotsford 2.5 hours late than my initial flight. She gave me the next flight boarding pass around 1:25 pm and i went for security. It took me literally 3-4 min at security. And I still tried but was refused saying departure is refused due to less than 10 min. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

You will have to do same for descent & are then stuck back there after the plane lands. Stewardess made no attempt to get us back to our seats & luggage after landing. If my husband had not reminded other passengers that we moved so plane could take-off & land safely, we would have missed our train home. Attendant should have asked other passengers to say seated until we got back to our seats in front. Completely unimpressed with lack of professionalism.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Dublin to Toronto,3.0, |  Flew Dublin to Toronto. The plane was sort of clean and the seats offered a decent amount of comfort. The main complaint about WestJet Airlines is that there was a delay of about two hours but the airline employees never offered an explanation for the reason. The flight attendants were rude and very arrogant. The higher up employees of the company need to address this. You could train them better on how to be at least somewhat decent.,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0
Boeing 767-300 / 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,London Gatwick to Honolulu via Vancouver,4.0," | Flew to Hawaii return from Gatwick via Vancouver. 767 to and from Vancouver was old and dated inside but very clean and comfy. Inflight entertainment is either on a rented tablet on board for small fee or free if you have headphones and the WestJet App on your tablet or phone. Good selection of TV and film, could do with some music but very user friendly and reliable. Watching it on your own iPad gives better screen and sound quality than normal built in Ife too. Flights all on time or nearly so, all connections were very easy and bags were transferred. There is a fee to check in a bag but this is fine. Airline is kind of a cross between a budget airline and a full service. Complimentary soft drinks and snacks are provided, meals, further snacks and alcohol are available for purchase. I tried a variety and all were good. A little on the pricey side but all airline food is. Cabin crew often come through the cabin offering water all through the flight which is a very nice touch. To Honolulu from Vancouver all is as above, only aircraft smaller and slightly less comfy for such a long flight (6 hours). All cabin crew and ground service staff were friendly. However Facebook team answering questions were wrong about a few things so would be careful with trusting what they say. Overall in general they are a perfectly ok choice, and for the price £500 return approx this represented very good value.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
