A380 / A330,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,London to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi,3.0," |  London to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi. The worst flight experience I have had in all 24 years of my life (inclusive of budget airlines). Mainly due to - upon arrival in Malaysia from London just 2 days before my relative's wedding, of which I was an organiser - my check-in baggage being left behind in Abu Dhabi, which had my wedding ceremony clothing and materials. Thanks to the worst possible timing for a baggage delay, I have had to sink my savings to get backup, subpar clothes for what was otherwise a perfectly planned wedding! This is not the first time I've heard of Etihad's baggage handling issues, and I regret not listening closer to friends' advice. To add salt to injury, stewardesses on the flight were rude, one of which said during meal service, ""we only have the vegetarian pasta option, is that okay?"", with her hand already half outstretched with the tray close to my table. She could have some common courtesy and ask for my preference first! I have had better and more courteous service on Easyjet and Ryanair. Unfortunately I have a return flight leg from Kuala Lumpur back to London and I am nervous thinking about what problems are going to surface on that leg of the journey. If I could afford it, I would rather purchase another airline's tickets and take a longer transit than fly this airline again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0

I logged online to upgrade 3 of our 10 travelers to extra leg room seats. My parents and my partner and infant. When one of the seats was not assigned, even though I had paid for it, I called the help centre to find out why. When I spoke to the agent he told me I had not selected extra leg room seats, rather standard seats. These travelers already had standard seats allocated beside the rest of my family, before I went online to upgrade, so I ultimately chose seats away from the rest of our family for nothing, because I thought they were extra leg room seats. When I asked could I still get the extra leg room and pay the difference they advised me I will have to pay full price, the money I already paid 321 odd euro will be lost in the process. I am shocked and feel like I have been robbed. An honest mistake, which they found out about with 10 minutes of my doing So, meant nothing to them. Also, the seat I assigned for my partner and my child in the same transaction did not get allocated but I got charged for it. So they are also in the wrong. I am just been fobbed off every agent I speak to. Policy policy policy is all I am hearing. They do not seem to take general misunderstandings into account. There should at least be some sort of grace where time is concerned. They were aware I had made the error within 15 minutes. Why is there no proper customer service within this company. Nobody cares that I am in more debt with nothing now to show for it. My parents will have to suffer on their first ever flight, 24 hours long, with no space. This airline has absolutely no consideration for their customers if this is how they treat us when a mistake is made. They keep saying it was my mistake but they never allocated a seat for my partner so they too made a mistake, where is their liability? I am in dismay by the lack of understanding in a genuine case. I already had seats before I went online. Surely they could see this was an honest error made. We paid over 10,000 for our group trip, now an added 321 for nothing. Worse seats than what I had initially.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

They overbooked our flight from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane, and the man who was telling us this was smirking the entire time. They were all very rude and not one person apologised for the overbooked flight. This route is a once a day flight so we had to wait over 2 hours for our bag to get back to us before they put us up in a 3 star hotel. I would never fly Etihad again based on this experience. No apology and no refund and the flight tickets were not cheap either. Avoid!",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,1.0,2.0,4.0,no,Abu Dhabi to Bangkok,1.0," | Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. This is a general review, I use Etihad quite often because it operates from my home city and the airmiles accrued through my credit card give me Gold Class membership which allows Business Class service prior to boarding the flight. About 8-10 years ago Etihad was my favourite airline edging out Emirates, Singapore and Qatar. It has steadily deteriorated since that point and for the last few years has felt like a budget airline. It feels like everything is run for the benefit of the airline and the customer is just a cash cow. It is the only airline I now that regularly boards the passengers one hour and 15 minutes before scheduled departure and is almost always late to depart. My last few flights menat that we were boarded almost two hours before take off and that makes a long haul flight that much more uncomfortable. During the two hour wait there are no refreshments and no entertainment. Two bum numbing hours without even a view out of the window as distraction. The refreshements seem to be fewer and further between, even the in seat call button frequently fails to get a response. During my last flight, the meal options were beef, chicken or vegetarian when I asked what the dishes were I was told again 'beef or chicken' I eventually established it was beef and rice or chicken and rice (I didn't ask about the vegetarian option). Airline food is universally mocked for being generally unpalatable but I remember that several years ago Etihad in-flight food as being something that I actually looked forward to. The food on my last flight (Bangkok - Abu Dhabi) was amongst the very worst I have ever had and I left all but small sample bites from the dishes. I also noticed on my last trip that Etihad are now offering an option to buy extra food items. A five star premium airline that sells snacks!! I'm sure that the decline in quality of the food and the introduction of paid for snacks is no coincidence. The entertainment system is still very good but it is switched off unceremoniously about 30 minutes before landing. Some airlines have the entertainment available from the moment you sit down until the time to leave and when I enquired why this isnt possible with Etihad I was told it was for safety reasons. Maybe Etihad have different safety regulations to other Middle East carriers but I suspect that it is so they can collect in the headsets early - which summarises the apparent Etihad policy of prioritising airline convenience over customer comfort. At every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with, into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff, disgusting food, poor service, scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line. In short a budget airline in all but name and price. Think twice before using this airline.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Their baggage policy is ridiculous even if you are just a little bit over the allowance they will charge you extra. It's as if they get commission on these extra charges. They weigh and add every bit of luggage you have even carrier bags that might contain a jacket! Lots of passengers packing and re-packing to meet the weight guidelines. The food selection is bad. Good entertainment system altho it suddenly stops 30 minutes before landing. All other airlines entertainment you can play right until taxiing.  Avoid Etihad.,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Perth to Rome via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  I traveled Perth to Rome via Abu Dhabi at the beginning of July alone with a one year old baby. I travel to Italy once a year and i usually go with Emirates or Qatar. This time I chose Etihad mainly because of the inflight nanny service. This service wasn't available on my flight and only found out on the day I flew out. The planes were both very uncomfortable, and no comfort kit or baby toys were offered (as Emirates and Qatar  do). Although I requested baby food, nothing was provided. During the flight no one of the staff came and asked if I, a mum traveling solo with a young child, needed help. (Last year Qatar flight attendants came several times making sure all was good and gave me baby food, toys and a pouch with baby lotions and nappies). The food for adults was barely edible and there was no meal choice. I think Etihad has to be considered a low cost airline not a 5-star and should definitely cost less, much less as it is so bad. Not worth the money! It cost more than Emirates and Qatar but it's worth zero compared to them. I will never choose Etihad again or recommend it.",Family Leisure,1.0,2.0

nan,Economy Class,2.0,March 2017,2.0,2.0,3.0,no,London to Perth via Abu Dhabi,3.0," |  London to Perth via Abu Dhabi. Etihad was disappointing for such a large airline with a great reputation. I had expected them to be amazing but have had quite a negative and frustrating experience with them especially when I had an issue with them. Overall experience with the ground staff were that they were nice but didn't go above and beyond to make me feel like a special guest. Cabin staff service was average. While the staff were nice, they seemed only do the bare-minimum. They were slow with my requests and at one point, forgot my request for tea, which after 30 minutes of waiting I had to get up and get my own tea. The airplane was nice and the seats were quite comfortable but the blankets and pillows were mediocre. The blankets were quite thin and flimsy, where I had to have two to feel warm. The meals were served quite often though but they were quite bland and I was generally not impressed with the taste or variety of the meals. While the above experience was not great, what made it worse was my experience with the customer service staff regarding my luggage and I would like to warn people the policies regarding checked-in luggage. I had checked in my luggage (after paying an excess baggage fee of £97.50 for being over the limit, which I accepted) and had expected my luggage to arrive at my destination in the same condition. However, when I received the luggage the handle did not come out anymore and was clearly damaged during the transfer from London to Perth. When I approached the ground staff, they advised me to contact their online customer service regarding the matter but there was nothing they could do at that point. I did contact their Baggage Claim customer service department and received a generic response telling me that their policies state 'they are not responsible for damage to luggage due to wear and tear or damage to handles and wheels' so they asked for my 'kind understanding' to accept that policy but they would gladly write a note to my travel insurer so I could claim through them. I was not pleased with this response because I would be out of pocket again to claim through my insurer and asked to be referred to someone that would be able to deal with me as a person and not reiterate their policies. The response I received was quite antagonising and frustrating, they said they couldn't do anything because 'they couldn't confirm the cause of the alleged damage' and they referred me to another department which after 3 days still have not responded to my query. This ordeal has been over a week and I have been pushed around to different departments and ignored and left with no satisfactory response to my situation. I'm quite disappointed with Etihad's response (or lack of) since other airlines would have quickly resolved this issue without making the customer go around in circles. Etihad has a good reputation but be warned that they do not treat their customers with respect and listen to their situation when things go wrong. They are generally quite unhelpful and will provide generic responses or pull policies on you. For such a big company, I expected some flexibility especially if an irate customer has approached them several times to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. I would not recommend Etihad, there are other airlines that can provide much more superior service for the same or cheaper price.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

This seat may be smart for reducing costs for the airline but it is like sitting on a wooden bench. Having recently flown Qatar Airways I would say the Etihad economy product is far behind. This seat is totally not suitable for a 14 hour flight and I would challenge the airline CEO to sit in this seat for a long-haul flight to see that it is not fit for purpose.

The staff at check-in and on the flight were all excellent, but the actual aircraft for both legs of my journey felt incredibly small and tight. I am a tall man (190cms), but the 787-9 was especially small and a struggle to fit my legs into the space provided. When the seat is reclined, the bottom part moves forward which gives me even less room. If the seat in front is reclined, it is very difficult to eat food from my seat tray. This has its advantages as the food is probably the worst I have experienced on a flight. If all the other airlines can provide edible food, there is no excuse for Etihad, especially as it constantly touts itself as a premium airline. I got the very distinct impression that they really do not give 2 thoughts towards economy passengers and its all about the bigger margins in business and 1st class. The Business Manager for Etihad could do themselves a favour by travelling with Emirates in economy and see what can be done for the same price. The 2 airlines are not even close in comparison.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The first sector Brisbane to Abu Dhabi was significantly better than the connecting flight to Edinburgh, however both were still fine. Check in was reasonable except our seats weren't together and when I asked for a seat map we still ended up being apart. However the crew were happy to help on board. The Air NZ lounge is OK while not the same standard as Etihad lounges but was pleasant enough. The 787 cabin is much nicer that the others in the Etihad fleet that I have travelled on apart from the bed is harder that the older A330. In every other aspect the 787 is a superior product and the high quality of the experience really ramped up once onboard with a wonderful and obliging crew. The food on the first 787 sector was superb, the beef fillet was perfect and the meal service top notch. Wine on both flights were exceptional. The second flight had a less warm and competent crew and the food for the main meal was overcooked and half of it not edible. It was still a pretty comfortable flight overall with the majority of time spent sleeping. Bags were off really quickly and with the free chauffeur waiting we were at our hotel less than an hour after the plane touched down. If the standards of the first sector had continued into the second it would be hard to beat Etihad, they still remain one of my favorite carriers.",Business,4.0,5.0

Got special assistance to get through passport and security-checks. Very friendly staff. Welcome on board was warm and efficient, the food and beverage manager even remembered me from an earlier flight. My seat was changed from window to a center-seat without even informing me. Seat (business-class) very narrow and under par from key competitors with a 50/50% divide of seat and a 'side-table' (where the guest behind puts his feet for sleeping). No head-rest cover (unhygienic). No amenity kit any more for a long haul overnight flight (staff informed me that they discontinued offering them). Eat-when-you-like option is nice but dinner is served on a tray like in economy-class. Flight crew were efficient and friendly throughout the flight. Bad sleep because of no eye-shades offered. Flight arrived on time so easy to make my connection to Frankfurt. Etihad lounge in AUH overcrowded, hard to find a seat. Service on my continuing flight from AUH to FRA was excellent again. My lunch-choice was not available, yet they managed to get it for me. Again no amenity-kits. One of the bathrooms was wet and dirty, so better to keep your shoes on (I didn't) because of lack of slippers. Couldn't sleep because of day-flight and no eye-shades offered. Could not freshen up before landing because no razor-set or even a tooth-brush offered. Arrived Frankfurt on time. My verdict: while service at Etihad is still excellent the seats in business-class are small and uncomfortable because of bad design and the airline seems to cut costs by lowering its standards in business-class.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I'm on the medication which makes me extremely thirsty and I have explained it to them after that they luckily brought a bottle of water. I pre-ordered gluten free options and on the flight from London to Melbourne I received GF sandwich (which tasted together with all other food served terrible) but on the way back to London from Brisbane I got an apple. When my boyfriend asked for snacks because I was still hungry the cabin crew asked him ""didn't you just had a sandwich?""

Well this is how life is, you can't have it all even from a 5* airline (for first class cabin, though). Flying economy didn't seem like a 5* airline at all. And the seats were incredibly uncomfortable, and in the Boeing 787-9 the configuration is bad. You don't really feel it until it is completely full, like the last haul when coming back (night flight) from Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf. When 3 people are sitting next to each other, no matter how big or small it is almost impossible to sleep. Another bad thing for me was that the entertainment system closes 45 minutes before landing (really?) and it is available only after take off after the proper altitude has been reached. You just have to do something else 45 minutes before landing. The screen were big enough and the variety of programs was good. As a platinum Etihad Airways frequent flyer I was allowed to use the very nice first class lounge in Abu Dhabi. An inconvenience happened in Hong Kong, when travelling with my girlfriend and being on the same reservation together, it was just me who got an invitation to join the departure lounge of Hong Kong Airlines. This I found really impolite and if this means customer satisfaction by cutting costs, then they are cutting in the wrong place. We refused to use the lounge and went for a drink at one of the cafes in the airport. The food onboard was probably not a lot but the quality of the products was the best in economy I had so far. I have prebooked a vegetarian meal and they were pretty nice and paid attention to these details. The best from all the flights was that they were ahead of schedule in all the flights (sometimes 30-40 minutes) and this means they are interested in getting you to your destination in time, which is a big plus. As an overall rating I would give them 3* for economy, this is where they are, according to my personal view.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

A380-800 / A320,Business Class,5.0,April 2017,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes,London to Doha via Abu Dhabi,3.0," | London to Doha via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. This was my return sector, a daytime flight from London. Check in was slow but the staff were very friendly but that did not give us time to enjoy the Etihad lounge at Heathrow. Etihad's business class on the A380 was nicely laid out but leg area is narrow and if you are over 1.9 meters tall you will have to bend your knees in the sleeping position, not so nice. The cabin staff were very friendly and helpful, the entertainment system was alright and the food was very good. I chose the chicken with edamame which was a very good choice. The landing was quite rough in Abu Dhabi but the Lounge in Abu Dhabi was superb. The short connecting flight back to Doha was uneventful.",Family Leisure,4.0,2.0

On all flights the service was patchy and non consistent you would think they were totally different airlines. Only on the first flight we were given a menu, on one flight we were told chicken or lamb when I asked Chicken or lamb what I was told with rice. No pre dinner drinks round on any flight just a glass of wine with dinner. I have travelled with Emirates and Qatar Airways both economy and business but this was the worst service I have received. The staff looked tired and could be heard talking about the bad working conditions. Some flights we received hot towels some we did not, on two flights the entertainment screen did not work (despite them resetting the system). The worse part of the experience was that I paid for an upgrade for extra legroom seats (£193), when I arrived at the airport I was informed they had no record of this so we were allocated seats at the rear, I double checked this at Abu Dhabi and was told the same. When I arrived home the £193 had been taken out of my bank account, I have since contacted Etihad numerous times by telephone and email and after 1 month I am still awaiting the refund. Terrible service from start to finish.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

It was total of 4 flights. So disappointed with service and attitude from the staff. Those stewardess looked like they not bothered to be there, so unhappy, rude, impolite. If we tried to ask them something, seemed everything was too hard for them, they even was not listening and not letting us to finish a sentence.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,April 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Toronto to Abu Dhabi,2.0," |  I was extremely disappointed in the service my husband and I received on our flights using Etihad Airways. We first flew from Dublin to Abu Dhabi using Etihad and thought that the poor service could have been a fluke but we were wrong. On our direct flight home from Abu Dhabi to Toronto the service continued to go downhill. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. It took over an hour for someone to come to us when we turned on our attendant light. Attendants would see the light and walk right past us. Passengers around us also had this problem and we heard chatter about how the staff was rude and they had received better service on other airlines. The food was not good either. I understand that plane food usually isn't great but after following Etihad on Instagram and reading other things online I expect better, especially on such a long flight. I have had better food and service on one hour flights with other airlines. Also, there is a lack of organization at the airport for this airline. Getting through the gate was a logistical nightmare and the Etihad staff did not communicate effectively with patrons. Everyone was everywhere and did not know what was going on. All in all, poor customer service and poor organization led to a very negative experience flying with Etihad.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

This was easily the worst economy long haul flight that I have experienced despite being on the new Dreamliner. The seats are narrow and the seat pitch is minimal. But the worst aspect was the 'food' being offered. I know thst airline food is notorious but I am not that hard to please. But Etihad have sunk to new low levels of inedible and unappetizing. The so-called breakfast was a soggy little meat pie soaking in potato mash. On the bright side the cabin staff were cheery and did as much as they could with what they had to work with. The second leg of this journey from Abu Dhabi to Milan was with Alitalia and the staff, comfort and catering were excellent in every way. Next time Alitalia all the way or Qatar.

A340 / Boeing 787,Business Class,3.0,April 2017,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,Edinburgh to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi,4.0," |  Edinburgh to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Inconsistent product, the first leg was 9 out of 10, apart from check in being slow and some uninteresting food on board a very obliging and caring crew who looked after the cabin perfectly. Check in was one of those times when 2.5 hours ahead of the flight joining the economy queue would have got you to a check in agent faster than being in the Business queue. Redirected to another agent after about 15 minutes, the delay at the Business Class counter being a complicated upgrade. The lounge at EDI is really poor, you are better going shopping. However on the plane, despite the older cabin, for the most part it was what flying should be where you felt spoilt. Lounge at AUH was quiet and the food was OK, lots of variety and a good bar service. On board the 787 the service to BNE was much poorer, while the crew were pleasant they weren't proactive. No water offered at night, had to ask for salt and pepper and a glass of wine with the meal. The second meal was not offered and had to be requested close to arrival. The food on this flight was of a much lower standard and was overcooked both times and cold the second time. If you asked for two things (e.g. jam and cutlery), the crew member came back with only one of them stating that it was a long flight and they were tired, knowing they had forgotten something. Except for a refresh of bubbly before landing you had to request everything. Tone however was very pleasant and apologetic tone. Wine was really great on both flights and on the second flight I decided to sleep in any case given my fatigue and the lack of attention being paid to passengers. Bags off really fast. Limo at both ends is a wonderful service. Sadly the expectations from the first flight were so high and the second flight was a let down as more of a 4 out of 10.",Business,3.0,4.0

They did not even give the standard kit offered by every other airline, I have been very loyal with Etihad but it seems they are going to start losing passengers now. Their offers for breakfast were very poor, I choose the pancakes which came very dry without any sauce. The entertainment system was the high point though the choices were limited when compared with the top of the line offered by Qatar or Emirates, the seats were very hard and the fabric coarse. The area where Etihad beats everyone is in their checked baggage policy two pieces 32 kilos each is very generous and with their unbeatable prices you kind of overlook their shortcomings.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

The big size PJs were back in stock and the service left on time. I'm a big guy, the business class seats are only just big enough for me. The table is a bit tight on my guts so I lean the chair back. Qatar Airways tables have more room, I have no issues with them.

The flight was empty only 50 passengers on board. Nobody was sitting beside making the flight really comfortable. The screen in front of me was a low resolution and small screen. After an hour, they served curry chicken meal. It was quite awkward to have lunch at breakfast time. At landing at Abu Dhabi, the plane did not stop at any gate bridges. The passengers were transported in busses. I saw a lot of gate bridges empty but I don't know why they did so. It was hot in Abu Dhabi at that time and the air conditioning was not functioning. The second leg (AUH-CAI) was also an A321. The flight was full and there were a lot of carry-on bags on board. We got boarded from a non-gate bridge as well. The gate was in the basement of the Abu Dhabi airport. The air conditioning was terrible and it was really hot. The air conditioning in the buses to the plane was bad as well. The cabin crew was pushing the passengers during boarding the plane to put all our duty-free bags underneath the chair in front. The passengers behind me were two kids with their mom on board. They kept opening their table tray and slapping it back several and several times. I asked one of the cabin crew to just talk them. To my surprise, she told me that she couldn't do anything with a big smile on her face. I had to rotate back and shout at their Mum. The kids stopped for a while but then they started to kick my chair during the whole flight. I convinced myself to watch a movie in that bad screen to watch a movie to forget about that kid. Every 10 mins, the movie stopped automatically and switched back to the main menu. The passenger beside me had the same thing with his tiny screen. The second leg was an annoying flight.

A recent family trip to Frankfurt gave me the chance to travel with Etihad Airways and I had high expectations in terms of their service. Unfortunately, the experience was an unforgettably horrible one. As I was boarding the gate in Manila, Etihad’s ground staff informed me that my seat did not recline and had no light or power. To add insult to injury, the seat area had a pungent odor. Since this was a family trip with a connecting flight and nobody could offer me a workable solution, I had to have the seat manually adjusted to a flat recline and endure a 9-hour flight without lights or power. To cap it off, the stewardess directed me to go to the toilet at the back end of business class when I went to the business class toilet near the cockpit, as if I was bothering them. To make up for my discomfort, I was handed a letter saying that they have given me free miles equivalent to a polo shirt from their souvenir store. As a frequent flyer, I found this an unjust compensation for the level of distress I experienced on such a long flight, so I decided to return the letter and reject the offer. I then proceeded to email a formal complaint to their customer service only to receive the same proposal despite my objections the first time. I decided to raise my concern to their CEO and was surprised and disappointed to get the same reply from a customer service agent who continued to insist on their offer. I just want to share how let down I felt as a customer of an airline as purportedly reputable as Etihad Airways.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

The first leg from Cairo to Abu Dhabi was an empty flight. Only 50 passengers were on board. I stretched my legs on the three seats. Breakfast was great as well. The screen in front of the seat is a low resolution and small. You can barely see the movie on the screen. The screen was also bad in the next leg as well. The problem began on the 2nd leg, Abu Dhabi to Bangalore. The flight was full. There were a lot of carry-ons on board. There was nearly no space in the compartments. I had to put my bag four rows behind me. I looked at my seat number and found out it is a window seat, not an aisle I selected when I checked in online. Three kids took my seat and requested me to swap with another middle seat. Four hours in a middle seat was really annoying. I ordered water before serving the meals but the flight attendant told me to wait for a while since they are preparing the meals. I had to wait for more than half an hour. The meals available were either vegetarian or chicken since most passengers were Indian. I took a chicken meal and it did not taste good at all.",Business,3.0,1.0

I was told by the booking agent that the route from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg is operated on a Boeing 787-9 which was true on my outbound journey but on the flight back I was surprised by walking onto an A330-200 which if anyone has flown on Etihad is their worst configured aircraft because it does not have any central overhead storage! When I inquired with one of the flight attendants why the change of equipment he insulted my intelligence by saying the outbound service is on a Boeing 787-9 and the return is on an A330-200 which is impossible as the same aircraft that leaves has to return. The seats on the A330-200 are better than the 787 but the entertainment system is outdated and the toilets are tiny and have an annoying angled wall that makes standing awkward! The service was very good but the steak I had for dinner was badly done and had strange smell to it just before arriving I had a cereal . Arriving in Abu Dhabi was slightly delayed and we had to use the staircase which is always annoying , the connecting flight to Doha was also delayed and for a strange reason the pilot took us for a rather long taxi which seemed more like a tour of Abu Dhabi Airport, actually it felt longer than the short flight to Doha, but the service was also very good and the arrival in Doha was smooth.

This is when the policeman yelled at him for not taking off his shoes. I was visibly upset and I told the policeman so. He was enraged that I questioned his treatment of my father and asked us to step out of line. He also threatened to jail us.

Second flight out of Abu Dhabi to Kozhikode was light load and early morning departure crew were very attentive and smiling throughout which I was very much surprised to see. Especially the supervisor everytime she pass by the cabin, was found smiling to the passengers. May be because the flight was not full and they were not under stress.

Generally excellent albeit I was avoiding the horror that is a transfer at Abu Dhabi airport. Check in was slow with only two desks open for economy passengers, a long queue ensuing. Push back was precisely on time, as it generally is at Perth - which must be among the best performing airports in the world on this measure, with a 30 minute early arrival in Abu Dhabi on an airbridge - a rarity. With the flight less than half full plenty of space to stretch out. Notwithstanding, leg room on this newish plane was ample, far better than Qatar for example, the seat comfortable enough. Excellent IFE selection - I passed the time watching the men's semi finals at the French tennis open live from Roland Garos / BBC news reporting on the election - with large high quality screens though these were not without issues namely light and distraction, I question whether it is appropriate for films with extreme violence such as The Revenant to be made available on IFE, especially when you have no choice to switch off. Crew attentive throughout with regular water runs but no recognition of my Gold status. The two special meals supplied - vegetable curries - were tasty if a little basic, no sweet. Extra plus point, however: I was provided with my choice of drink with the meal, a matter invariably 'forgotten' by crew on previous flights. Wifi was available but not used.

After not hearing from them by the evening of the following day, I decided to call them and see what the current status of my luggage was.

The focus of this review is purely on the flight, not the (rather uncomfortable) airport Abu Dhabi. Etihad (at least in Germany) seems to follow a lowest airfare strategy for Business Class flights to Asia. You pay this with a transfer (usually during night hours). During all four legs of my recent trip, Etihad's personel were very friendly but also seemed all relatively inexperienced. During two legs, I asked the flight attendants to hang my suits. After arrival, I had to ask for it. This would for sure come automatically with other airlines. All flights very punctual. Boarding well organized, never stressful. Food was OK. One time I was told the Arabic appetizer set was already out and 20 mins later I saw another passenger getting this set. Wine selection was good - they could work on their choice of fruit juices. Airplanes: all brand new 787. For me, the most comfortable plane currently on the market. IFE: OK, selection of movies limited compared to other airlines.

The departure from Doha was an early morning one so I could not get much sleep. An uneventful flight being a very short one and arrival in Abu Dhabi was earlier than schedule but because of the congestion at the airport we had to remote park and use the stairs which is very annoying when you have a sleeping child. The connecting flight was the same story but a much higher the staircase, the seats on the 787 are nicer than the A380 and the whole experience was better. Etihad falls short of both Qatar Airways and Emirates on the entertainment scale but surpasses everyone on the baggage policy. The food was great. I really liked the steak sandwich and their chicken.

I am extremely disappointed in this airline I have had numerous problems occur within one trip with them. Firstly they overbooked my flight by 4 people and I was one of the people who had to go on a different flight, I was unhappy so they gave me a $300 Etihad transport voucher to compensate. That was fine however when I landed in my destination my luggage had been mishandled by Etihad in a transit through Brisbane. I didn't get my luggage until 2 days after I had landed. When my luggage arrived to my house the handle on my suitcase had completely broken off and it was fine beforehand. I tried to at least earn miles from this awful experience. I joined the Etihad guest membership online and followed the instructions to claim miles with them through email. I sent an email to them 3 days ago still no reply other than an automated message saying ""we have received your email we will reply asap"". So I wasn't able to claim miles for my flight. I wanted to use the voucher given to me worth $300. I often fly to the UAE so I found a flight to Abu Dhabi partly operated by Etihad airways via Hong Kong from New Zealand. I called them to confirm I could use my voucher on a flight which is partly operated by Etihad and I was told I could but I have to call them directly to make a booking. I called again to make a booking and was told I couldn't use my voucher on a flight partly operated by them. I can't use my voucher on any flight operated just by them because they don't fly in or out of New Zealand which is where I live.

Boeing 777,Economy Class,3.0,June 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,Sydney to Manchester via Abu Dhabi,4.0, |  Flew Etihad Airways from Sydney to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. Going out I would have said it was one of the best airlines I had flown with but changed my mind on the return flight with the abysmal treatment I was given by a belligerent staff member at check in at Manchester airport. One of the reasons for picking the airline was that I had a 30kg allowance and on fronting up to the desk my bag weighed 29kg. The staff member said it was too heavy and when I explained I had the 30kg allowance she would not accept this and told me to empty some into the rubbish and queue up again. I did this and 2 1/4 hours later I was at her desk again. My bag now weighed 26kg and she said I had to pay 94 pounds and could have 32kg. Not only had I run out of time to retrieve my goods from the rubbish I then had to pay this amount and carry on. I was appalled at the treatment and really disillusioned by the whole process and would be reluctant to fly with this airline again! My hand luggage complied with the rules.,Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0

I realise they are entitled to a break but they entered the cabin twice during the flight once with lunch and once for a snack near the end of the flight. My sister could not even get any water, the crew ignored the bell and switched it off without even coming to see if there was a problem.

So here I am in Business class and everyone is ordering off from the menu and when I asked for something from the All Day Menu, they tell me I cannot order anything at all as I will get only the two fixed meals. No snacks, no appetizers, nothing at all except for the 2 assigned meals that they have on board for me. Am so very disappointed and upset.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,May 2017,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,Paris to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi,2.0," |  Paris to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi. I had booked a return journey 8 months prior to the trip. Before the trip I had received 3 emails about my return flight stating that my flight has been rescheduled, but the difference was 10 minutes only. (ie. my 10 pm flight was rescheduled to 9.50 pm). I had booked the meal and everything was fine. On the day of the travel, me and my wife boarded a below par airplane from Hyderabad to Abu Dhabi. The charger point was not working, the food was served 2 hours afted the departure with no refreshments. Even after pressing the call button to get the flight attendent's attention i did not get any response. The food was not great and nothing except the dinner was served. My next flight from Abu dhabi to Paris was slightly better but again food served was mediocre. The main story started in the return leg. As mentioned, i was suppose to travel back at 9.50 PM from paris. when i arrived to drop my bag, I found that my flight had already departed at 10 am that morning. I was told that the same was informed to me via email. Luckily i had not deleted any mail from etihad and i was able to show them that the flight change was for 10 min not 12 hours! I was scared as this was the first time such thing happened to me. They told me to talk to the reservation website. Luckily i had booked the flight from etihad website itself and therefore I was able to push them to call their reservation desk. The manager came to me and started talking to the reservation office. It was realised than an email was dropped to me 20 days before the travel date with the mentioned changes. I was able to find the email but it just provide the receipt of payment with no mention of details of change in time. Etihad was not able to explain the reason and as there were seats available they were able to book us on the same flight after a lot of argument. Even though it was the airline that was at fault the manager had the audacity to tell me that I should be more careful next time. Then one more issue presented itself. The flight I booked had 2 hours of waiting time in Abu Dhabi. For the flight that etihad gave me later I had to wait 8 hours at Abu Dhabi airport. I was so frustrated and tired that I did not argue and just wished that i reach my home. Again the food and service in the return flights were mediocre. ",Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0

It is our third time with them. The primary consideration is fare and convenience, and Etihad checked the boxes again. The flight itself was very comfortable, on time, but it was the staff and service that makes them our favorites. The small but useful convenience kit even in economy is a nice touch. The seats were standard, the entertainment more than adequate and the food average. Slept 8 hours in the 13 hour flight. Comfortable blankets and the head support on the seat is a nice thing to have. Check in was smooth, baggage arrived intact, connection was a breeze, and the US pre-clearance meant that exit at JFK was easy.

There is no space to place any item anywhere unless you open the small table but this preclude you from laying down flat the seat. I was expecting at least an amenity kit with ear plugs (777 is very very noisy) and a toothbrush but nothing was given.

After a good and pleasant flight on Air Berlin and a much needed shower and rest at the Al-Reem Lounge at the Abu Dhabi airport, the journey on Etihad in Economy Class felt like a prison.

My partner who is 6'4"" had to put his legs to the aisle to avoid pressing onto the chair of the person in front of us. The saving glory was that the entertainment onboard was good and cabin crew was pleasant. Food was only ok.

When i contact Etihad Finland, they say ""we have no idea of my issue and therefore I should contact back to Etihad Tanzania"". I decided to contact Helsinki airport and they confirm that they don't have my luggage.

We returned to Abu Dhabi on 9th August. We are booked to fly to Lahore on 13th August 2017. This was a family holiday and we were all very excited. We had heard great things about Eitehad and had very high expectations. Unfortunately our experience with Etihad has been just average. The only incredibly positive point was the immigration at Abu Dhabi Airport which saves the hassle of long waits at JFK after a long flight.  The flights on the 20th of June had a staff which was curt and not at all interested in going the extra mile. The staff on the 8th August flight was much warmer. But we had another disappointing experience when an elderly lady who was traveling alone, felt unwell and was weeping with extreme cold and discomfort we reported it to a female stewardess. She gave her hot tea and told her, rather firmly not to weep. My husband asked a fellow lady passenger to put on some socks on her and comforted her. The lady stewardess never returned to check on her even once. This was when 6 hours of the flight were still left. This is not the kind of care and attention one expects from any airline, especially the one which claims to be the best. The food quality and taste was below average on all the flights. The flight to Abu Dhabi on 8th August served a meal which was vegetarian only, had no other option, and the taste was disappointing. They had nothing for the kids other than the kiddie meal, which was the same Pasta both times. There were no extra Chocolates, crisps or cookies available. Kids do tend to get hungry on a 14 hour flight. ",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

Flew Cochin to Zurich via Abu Dhabi. Hugely disappointing. Had in my head that Etihad would be as good as the other UAE airline. I was wrong. Etihad has a confusing business strategy. They purport to be a premium airline (which perhaps they are in the premium cabins but the best airlines get it right across all products. These were my first flights with Etihad, there was nothing really bad about the flights but there was just nothing really right about them either. Seats on both flights were tight, not very comfortable. Food on the first flight was ok but the food on the second flight was awful. Drinks selection very average. Abu Dhabi airport is at best underwhelming, chaos, perhaps the new terminal will improve things. I don't drink booze flying but had I wanted to I didn't see any on offer. Service was lacklustre on the 787. The 787 as with everyone that uses this aircraft should have been a chance to really improve customer experience, with Etihad there was nothing dreamy about this dreamliner. I got the flight with miles so at least it didn't cost anything to find out that its not an airline I would choose to fly with again. Very average all round.

The legroom was far less than on the B777 we had on the outbound flight, and I also felt the seats to be narrower. Food was very average, with only two meat options offered and not even a piece of cheese. Service was also minimalist, as no one bothered to offer us any drinks outside of meals, on a 7 hours flight.

On the second leg of the journey, the meal served was awful. Rice and lamb served was inedible as it was very salty, the salad tasted stale. Traveling with a child I thought Etihad might provide a toy / colouring book to keeping them engaged for sometime, nothing was provided.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2017,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,Jeddah to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  I had a flight from Jeddah to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi, and finally from Melbourne to Sydney. I specifically chose to go the longer route via Melbourne so that I could get to Sydney on Tuesday night as I had a day full of meetings on Wednesday. I got to Jeddah airport 3 hours before the flight and was able to easily get through the check in and immigration procedures and was on the plane by about 4.15pm with the flight due to depart st 5pm. Unfortunately the flight did not depart at 5pm due to Etihad deciding to wait for passengers and eventually departed over an hour later at about 6.15pm. We were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi at 8.40pm and my connecting flight to Melbourne was at 10.10pm. I anxiously hoped we would pick up speed and get there on time but we arrived at about 9.30pm instead. I desperately needed to make my connecting flight so I checked the gate number on the screen before we arrived and it was gate 61 which was in Terminal 3 and we were arriving in terminal 1. As soon we disembarked I ran as fast as I could to gate 61 and made it to the gate and through security while others were still boarding. As I was about to get on the flight the Etihad personnel said that I was rebooked and could not board the flight. I explained that I had run from my previous flight and there was still 25 minutes till the schedule departure and that I should be allowed to get on this flight. While we were debating several other people who came after me were allowed on the flight which I thought was just wrong. They eventually sent me to the transfer desk who arranged a hotel and meal voucher for me. I was expected to sleep in my already sweaty clothes and come back in the same clothes with no compensation or allowance for some temporary clothes. I asked them to allocate me the same exit row window seat that I had on my original flight and they were not willing to do that. They did not even arrange for me to have my special meal on my rebooked flight. I eventually ended up at the hotel which required me to pass immigration and leave the airport and then after about a 20 minute drive get to a hotel. There is a Transit hotel in the airport which would not require you to leave the transit area or the airport and clearly to save money they booked me into a Holiday Inn outside of the airport. I then about the meal voucher and it was limited to 50AED. That amount would only pay for a sandwich but not even a soft drink which is again ridiculously cheap. I then had to be ready for pickup at 8am in the morning for my flight at 10.45am. I was taken to the airport and as my bags were checked in I was sitting at the gate over 2 hours before the flight which was completely unnecessary as I had to rush out of the hotel and didn't have a chance to shower before I left and now I was stuck waiting at the gate. If they has just booked me into the transit hotel in the airport I would not have this situation. I asked if I could use the lounge to pass some time and was refused. I then realised that all of this hype about Etihad being the world's best customer service airline was a big scam. I would advise anyone who expects good customer service to stay away from Etihad.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

My luggage has also disappeared and we are still not closer to getting this back. We have been informed it is at London Heathrow, but cannot contact anyone there to confirm this. Etihad has left this to the passenger to chase up - and after more than 50 calls and several messages left, there is still no active response in place to assist me. I am a 68 year old lady with medical conditions. Some of my medication is in this suitcase. Quite frankly, the service on this occasion has been dismal. I note from a recent review that this was also experienced the same issue on a completely different flight with little resolution shown from the airline. I am disappointed and disgusted.

Even though I had to go to another desk to pay cash for my excess baggage, I was through to my gate in 20 minutes! On the plane, I was asked if I could move to a seat behind so a mother and child could sit together which was fine. The food was good, I had mac and cheese although I did not like the bean and peas vegetable mix and would have preferred a salad. For entertainment there was a good variety of Hollywood, European, Indian, and some Asian cinema as well as TV shows. I would quite like to see more Asian movies as there were only around three. Seat-wise, I had enough legroom in a normal seat as did the gentleman seated next to me. After a while, I got a little sore but who doesn't when they are seated for hours on end?

A380,Economy Class,4.0,July 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,London to Male via Abu Dhabi,4.0," |  London to Male via Abu Dhabi. My wife, myself and our two young children (2 years and 6 months old respectively) flew last night from London to Abu Dhabi. Had our flight left on time we would have had two hours to catch our connecting flight to Male. This didn't happen and our flight left London roughly two hours later than it should have done which put our connecting flight at risk. That said we had made up some time and landed at 8am with our connecting flight was at 8:40am. The warning signs appeared on the flight when the crew were evasive when asked for advice, simply telling us to talk to the Etihad 'transit staff'. After we rushed off the plane we were apprehended by the transit staff who made us sit in a waiting area for ten minutes without offering an explanation. We gave up on this and ran to our gate, arriving at 8:25 only to be told we needed to have been there five minutes prior to this point in order to Board (20 minute limit is imposed). We were carrying exhausted young children and at this point my wife burst into tears. We were then shuttled to another transit area, on foot which took ~30 minutes, half dragging/carrying our poor kids. The line at this location was about an hour and a half long with one staff member dealing with ~60 similar issues by themselves. If you ever need to see how a company treats its most vulnerable, captive passengers this place gave it all away. Most of the women were in tears. At this point our children were close to breaking point but we were fortunate to find a kind Etihad employee walking by who took us to alternative transit area. There we were told we had been re-booked on a 00:55 flight and we would be put up in a £40 a night hotel 37km away. The staff in the transit area were aggressive and refused to discuss the logistics of how we were supposed to get two small children, without buggies/strollers, to this destination. Most importantly they refused to discuss why we would have to wait 15 hours when the airline could not have waited five minutes for us to board. Eventually we were able to relocate to a closer hotel but I write this 7 hours later and we are yet to receive a call telling us where our luggage is. We critically need this because our 6mo old son needs milk, nappies and a change of clothes. Taking him outside in 45c heat to try and find the above is not really acceptable. My final gripe, and I appreciate this is a high quality problem, is that we have now missed a night in a hotel we spent a year planning and saving up to visit. Etihad refuse to discuss compensation and their website doesn't offer any advice. I also believe we are entitled to EU flight delay compensation but they're attempting to use the loophole that since we were changing flights outside of the EU this doesn't hold! Please take care when flying in economy with this airline. Their regard for passengers below business/first class is appalling as is their indifference to the conditions young children travel in.

Boeing 777 was a tired old cabin with very cramped uncomfortable seating and my knee kept knocking against the tray table support. Food was below standard and the IFE was pretty awful with very limited choice, hardly many up to date films available unlike Qatar Airways. Although the seat transformed into a flat bed it was so narrow you had no space to turn over and the blanket just kept getting dropped into the aisle way of the plane. Crew were good which was a saving grace, but this plane on a major long haul flight of 13hrs+ desperately needs the new model of business class and a more spacious seat when it comes to sleeping. The A320 from Abu Dhabi to Dammam was a more modern aircraft and pleasant to seat even if it was designed for short haul.

Staff seemed reluctant to offer any service, food had to almost be demanded and once served they leave you alone to the point of forgetting you. What they did serve seems to confirm everything I had read that Etihad is in trouble! Small meal portions, poorly heated and well below biz class standards. Part of my trip out to Singapore GP this was a cheap late ticket, and I am so relieved we are booked with a group to fly back on Qatar Airways, who seem to be one of few airlines to maintain their quality standards.

That happens occasionally, and in itself would have been acceptable. What is not acceptable is that Etihad took many escalations over 8 days after arrival to trace and deliver the bag. Further, Etihad is trying to avoid issuing the nominal reimbursement I sought under the guise of legalese. This is absolutely unprofessional behaviour all around. Once the bag arrived in Chicago airport, it seems to have vanished into a black hole. The status file disappeared from the baggage tracing link on Day 2. On Day 3 and 4, Phones to the number at Airport were not picked up. Emails sent to airport got no answer. Tweets to etihad got no response. It took three calls to Customer Service (over next 4 days) before I reached a manager who could reach airport manager who initiated delivery. Its been nearly 5 weeks after the travel date, but Etihad is unwilling to initiate a reimbursement. My mistake that I was trying to be nice in making the claim. On tweeting about the reimbursement, Etihad said their records showed baggage delay of only one day.

Food was excellent, as was the service. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and helpful. Bathroom for business class was not as cramped as economy, with hand lotion and face spray on offer. Questionable: The entertainment on offer fell far short of virtually any other airline I have flown - there were very few quality movies or TV shows to watch.

I have flown this airline a number of times in the past, but I will do everything in my power to avoid doing do in future. This airline has been cutting corners for a while now, despite the contention that it is a five star airline. This is a long distance budget airline. It cuts costs by, for example, in Dublin, sharing the budget terminal with Ryanair. Recently, like other budget airlines, it has been enforcing carry on baggage rules - 7kg for a carry on bag, 5kg for a second bag. They will force you to juggle weight around your various hold/ carry-on luggage until you meet the required standards. They quote ""safety restrictions' despite the fact that even other 'budget' airlines allow a carry-on limit of 10kg. They won't listen to reason if you point out that the plane will carry all the combined weight of one's luggage in any case. They will insist that you go to the end of the queue to carry out this farce. And finally, if you have anything fragile, they won't, of course, allow you to carry it in the cabin, but will force you to put it in the hold. They broke my guitar in this way. They even forced me to sign a waiver, stating that I was not entitled to any compensation if it should get damaged on route. When I refused to sign the waiver, they said they wouldn't take it. The result, of course, was a cracked and unplayable guitar. Thanks Etihad, thanks for breaking my guitar! If this isn't enough, the old terminal in Abu Dhabi is an outdated, confused mess, with constant queues for malodorous, inadequate toilets, and smoking rooms that resemble old telephone boxes.

Again, everywhere it states above and nowhere it states that you have to buy the ticket separately for each leg to apply the fair rules. If I knew or it was clearly stated, I would have bought two legs separately because there is no concession if ticket is bought with return. So, we bought the ticket by paying more for return leg because we wanted to have the flexibility as stated for free change and refund. When we called Etihad to cancel the flight on 07/16/2017, the representative maintained that refund would not be free because we bought it together with economy saver and most restricted rules apply. This rule is not stated anywhere under the rules of economy flex class rules. I canceled the ticket and they kept $200 although it supposed to be a free refund. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I've flown Etihad many times over the years and at one time the food and in-flight service was very good in my opinion. That's all changed. The fodder they dish out now (in mean portions) is dreadful. In years gone by you received a little menu describing the meal choices available. That has been replaced by the cabin attendant shouting, ""chicken, beef or pasta?"" over the noise of the engines.

Whilst I stated that I have been using this in many flights none had any objection they did not budge. We are different was their response. Then to add insult to injury asked me to pay £160.0 as it was the airline fee for additional bag. As my first check in bag hardly had 16kg, I was told to transfer stuff in it and throw the hand bag away. When I tried to transfer stuff in checked in hand bad it became 24.0kg and they would not even allow for that. I have been trying to contact their UK office and spoke to them three times regarding my luggage issue. They make notes but when you ask them to refer to those they come back saying we do not trust these notes we will listen to the recorded communication and get back to you. They never come back.

I have been gold with them for some time and always sang their praises. Overall all flights on time and in some cases early. The crews a mix of engaged to those who looked panicky/disorganized to didn't want to be there. Lounge in Abu Dhabi fine, but the airport is creeking at the seems, all flights were by buses with the exception of BKK. Lounge in Bangkok small but fine. It is now evident cost cutting is now severely in place, no more Limos, no more wash bags, cheaper wines and the food onboard is Economy. It was a joke, outbound to BKK was a two egg omelette, with a tomato/ bread and tea. I kid you not, they have reduced the snacks to three offerings being chicken and crisps. The return was soup or mezze, mains were insulting with Biryani (rice), chicken breast with mash or Veg pasta. I must say the outbound crew were super and professional but the return looked like they all hated each other and the atmosphere was evident. Standards are slipping badly but to top it off the attitude of the ground staff has never been good in Abu Dhabi, they all need intense training on customer service and get them engaged or else fire them as they have a rude, lazy, arrogant attitude. One particular was the man boarding the outbound flight to BKK, he snatched my passport, didn't even look at me, was too busy laughing with his colleague and then with out looking at me still, thrust the passport back in my face still laughing with his colleague.

Not anymore. Since Etihad is in financial turmoil and cost-cutting became its No. 1 priority, lounges are closed, service turned sour and savings on dining and wining even in Etihad’s First Class are the new, disappointing standard. Because of staff-reductions, we had to wait 15 minutes at check-in at SGN-airport. Reason: staff was checking in Business-Class guests at Etihad’s First-Class counter. Formerly an absolute no-no. Boarding was chaotic, as well: no priority boarding and we had to queue with all other 200+ passengers. The welcome on board was warm, yet the standard of service is dropping down: instead the traditional collection of 3 different snacks only nuts were served and even though it was only 3 passengers in First, my wife and me could not get the requested mixed vegetables, because they ‘run out of it’ already. The amenity-kit, formerly a traditionally designed and waved pouch of high quality was replaced by a cheap plastic version and mine was used already (pouch with lip-balm, etc. missing). The interior of the aircraft, an old A340 was outworn and some of the buttons for the remote of the Personal Entertainment system and the seat were not working properly any more. Staff, however, was friendly and caring. On the stopover I also visited the Etihad 1st Class lounge in Abu Dhabi, which is excellent. But waiting times in the restaurant increased significantly and waiting more than 2 hours for a morning-shave is unacceptable. Our continuing flight to Frankfurt was on a remote gate. Yet, 35 minutes before boarding no bus for 1st and business-class passengers was available. Had to wait with all other passengers for more than 20 minutes. No seat available, thus standing. Entering the aircraft by stairs was hectic, people were squeezing each other, so we decided to board last. Pre-flight service was hectic because the bus arrived just 5 minutes before departure but at least the inflight-service was flawless. Upon arrival no arrival service and our luggage was delivered late, even though we had priority and first-class stickers on them. I always have been a fan of Etihad and enjoyed its perfect lounges, services and friendly staff. But cost-cutting effects even Etihad’s most loyal (Platinum-member) and revenue-contributing (flying 1st-class) customers to such a degree, that the great flight-experience, I am paying for, hardly exists any more. No first-class lounge-access except Abu Dhabi, long waiting lines, worn out cabin interior, bad catering, no luggage-priority, no free chauffeur-service (except Abu Dhabi, were taxis are offered instead).

Another bad experience with Etihad which is definitely not on the right track. We flew MRS to AUH via Paris CDG, arriving in AUH at 7.30pm, and in spite of a 2 hours transfer lag our 5 pieces of luggage did not make it to Abu Dhabi, like the luggage of another 20 people, even if our luggage were appearing as loaded in Etihad system. After being asked to wait for an hour or so, as they were confident they would locate the luggage in AUH Airport, we were finally asked to file a report as the luggage were definitely somewhere in Paris CDG Airport. Finally left the airport after 2 hours and a half of confusion and chaos as the baggage claim department is undersized, especially since this was a very busy week end. We had high hopes that our luggage would arrive on the next morning as an Etihad flight arrives daily as well at 6.40am from Paris, but unfortunately we saw in the baggage tracking website that they were planned to arrive only on the 7.30pm flight. So 24 hours after our original flight we rang Etihad who informed us that someone would get in touch this same evening to arrange the delivery of our 5 bags. The next morning, as we had not heard anything from Etihad, I rang the luggage service a dozen of times, before getting an answer, to learn that they finally only had 4 of our 5 bags, in spite of what was told us the night before. After insisting, and shouting a bit, they finally went to look for the 5th bag and rang me back to tell me it was finally found and that we could come and pick our 5 bags. Delivery was not possible due apparently to some new requirements of customs who want people there in case a bag needs to be opened. At 6pm, so nearly 48 hours after our original flight, we reached at the airport to collect our bags and there they tell us they have only 4 bags out of the 5. And the cherry on the cake, is that the missing bag is not the same as the one that was thought missing in the morning! So they had found all 5 and lost one again. After another bit of shouting and a couple of hours, we were promised by the supervisor that they would find the bag and bring it home the same night. Drove back home with the 4 bags, and at 9pm received a call from a guy on his way to deliver the 5th bag, which finally reached us at 10pm. Apparently the ""you need to come and pick up because of customs” rule had mysteriously disappeared. I could sincerely not believe to have this type of service and complete lack of professionalism from a so called 5 Star Airline. No information if we had not called (on line tracker has still not been updated 2 days after), understaffed baggage department that never picks up the phone, complete disorganization, poor management and complete lack of customer service. If you add to this the very poor service onboard and the low quality of catering, this leads to a clear decision : never again Etihad.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

After a few security questions I was checked in and directed to the fast check security , I did so and was greeted by the most welcoming man with a warm smile (a Heathrow staff member) who checked my boarding pass and wished me a safe flight. After browsing the duty free shops I made my way to gate 10 where the Etihad Airways lounge is located. On entertaining the lounge I met two lovely welcome hosts who asked if my luggage and suit bag would like to be stored. She then offered me the WIFI slip. The first impression of the lounge was dark and small. I passed about 6 staff who were standing there like zombies no more then a smile. I had a walk around before I sat in the ala carte section where I thought I would have a nice lunch. There were pre set menus on the table so I had a look and went for the salmon salad of which I ordered after attracting the attention of one of the staff. I asked for a glass of Chardonnay and some sparkling water and was told I had to help my self from the buffet area. I found that very strange considering I was sat in the restaurant area expecting restaurant service? The salad arrived in super quick time (with no salad only x2 baby potatoes cut into 4 pieces, green beans, 2 cherry tomatoes also cut into 4 pieces and a splash of balsamic dressing) -  the salmon was very moist clearly being sat in a steamer until an order came in. After my salad-less salad I fancied a coffee so decided I leave the lounge and head to Costa Coffee as the Etihad coffee machine had seen better days. Boarding was called and like you'd expect everyone marched up to the gate in one go only to be turned away as there zones were not yet called. A warm welcome from the crew as I boarded and found my seat 16A. Business seats are incredible and should be rolled out on all Etihads long haul business class. The flight was fantastic, service standards won back from that I had in the lounge. Only downside they have taken the wash bags away and only offer these on night flights! Explained by the crew member with a nervous smile. Items like toothbrush, socks were available but you had to ask. Cutting back things in the premium cabins never goes down well with crew or the paying passengers who expect it.

After 11 hours comes the second meal where I was expecting a decent one but Etihad Airways continued to surprise me with a vegetarian meal saying that this is only what is left, which i didnt accept. One of the senior cabin crew members came for appologies and offered me a crew meal saying that Etihad Airways will contact me about this issue but that never happened. My return flight September 4th, I checked in online and chose my seat which was 45D.

I asked the guy at the gate and he says that seat 45D is a paid seat and he had to move me to 67D. How did you let me check in and choose a paid seat without telling me that or asking for an extra fee? And how do you change my seat without at least notifying me or asking me where i would like to sit? What if i wanted to pay for that seat even though the plane that day was half empty.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2017,1.0,2.0,2.0,no,Los Angeles to Tehran via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  Los Angeles to Tehran via Abu Dhabi. My daughter and myself had a return flight (Economy class) from LAX to IKA. The flight was scheduled for 4:55pm. We arrived at the airport around 2:15pm and waited in the line for the checking-in process. After around 50 minutes, it was our turn. When the lady with light brown and skirt weighed our 4 luggage pieces, each had between 2-3Kg overweight which was a bit higher than what we had found in home weighing them. In fact, by seeing the overweight of the first one, she did not want to weigh the rest of them which we insisted to see if the total was lower than the maximum allowed weight when she finally agreed. When she saw the overweight, she asked us either to pay the overweight fee or reduce the weight somewhere else and then go to the end of the line and said that it was the policy. This was unfair to us which had waited in the line for about 50 minutes which was long and also the check-in line had not been shorten by then anyways.  Also, nobody had told us about the policy and asked us to check the weights before it becomes our turn for check-in. We reduce the weight to below 46 Kg for each of us. Then, I complained to the lady who said that she was the supervisor and finally, as an exception of the policy, she directed us to a different line than the normal one which took us the same time as that of the original line. The check-in finished around 4:00pm (close to two hours for the check-in process) and we had to go to the passport control and security check with the 55 minutes left for us. This took longer than usual. Finally, we got to the gate five minutes to departure gate when luckily there was about 30 minutes delay of departure time which we did not know. Now, that you very strict on the maximum allowed weight, you should let your passengers know ahead of time about this and ask/direct them to weight their luggage pieces in the airport with scales that are in the counter before staying in the queue. I guess that that is the minimum that I could expect. The airline might consider us as just two passengers not caring about this insulting experience but this was my first and probably the last flight with Etihad Airways and I will not recommend this airline.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I was initially told when I booked my tickets that bassinets were given on a first-come-first-served basis and I couldn't book them in advance. This was wrong. When I phoned a few days before the flight the customer agent said I should have requested the bassinets with my booking and that my child would have no bassinet on the Abu Dhabi-Kochi flight. Rather shocked to hear this I asked her to confirm the bassinet arrangements for my infant. She was rude and petulant - unbecoming of a good customer service agent. The service on board was nothing to write home about. We had an A380 on the London to Abu Dhabi sector and an A320 for Abu Dhabi to Kochi. The stewardesses hardly cared or bothered how we were coping with our little baby. It seemed just giving us a bassinet was the most they could do. One Arabic boy who cried a lot got a lot of attention. I felt there was preferential treatment toward people based on their appearance and ethnicity. Most of the cabin crew seemed to be Eastern Europeans or Arabic. The meals were disappointing: portions were small and not very tasty. The only good points were the aircraft, which were in good condition, and the inflight entertainment systems.

And the worst of all - the check in process from Abu Dhabi to Riyadh, it's highly disorganized, first time I've seen such check-in chaos in my more than 20 years of air travels.

I have to share the sentiment of most of the recent reviews about Etihad posted here. I was happy to get an A380 from Paris to Abu Dhabi compared to a. ageing 777-300 I flew recently and then a 787 for the second flight. Both aircraft were nice and new but the service and food were just lacking. What was particularly frustrating was that the entertainment system offers a food and drink section but it was always unavailable and never worked on either flight. Food was average and as others said I wasn’t given a choice for the second meal on the Brisbane leg of the flight. The in-flight service was very disappointing as I rarely saw the flight attendants at all and I had to press the call button just to get a tiny cup of water. I have flown other airlines that have been very attentive but Etihad seem to train their staff to do as little as possible in order to save money on snacks and beverages. The entertainment on offer is also limited compared to other airlines. I’ve been with Qantas and Emirates who have a much wider variety of films and tv shows to watch than Etihad do. What also annoyed me is that on the Paris to Brisbane leg they locked the tinting on the windows so it was really dark on the aircraft despite being daytime. I was looking forward to seeing the beautiful Western Australian coastline from my seat but was prevented from doing this by the flight crew. I was unable to edit the window settings as they had been locked out. There does seem to be an element of cost cutting at play which has resulted in poor service. I feel that Etihad may have once been a good airline but they have gone downhill. Avoid and fly with someone else.,Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0

After 1,5 hours airborne, meal service finally commenced. Annoyingly late when you want to catch up with some sleep too. The soup was tepid and the spoon missing, had to wait another five minutes to get cabin crew's attention. The pasta was dry. No refill of glasses, made it even more dry. Had to ask again and wait another ten minutes before the wine bottle came by. No amenity bag, but ear plugs offered on request! Cost saving measure? Cabin crew seemed to be a bit inexperienced and swamped. Not visible in cabin other when rushing back and forth to seats, which may explain they were on a minimum number. More cost cutting? The Miracle lounge prior to departure was okay, rather a bar with snacks than a fully fledged business lounge. The outbound flight was okay but not any of the ""wow"" experiences I have had in the past with other airlines. Altogether, not overly impressed.

I had no check-in baggage with me on this flight. During boarding in Abu Dhabi my hand luggage was taken from me by the cabin crew due to lack of space in passengers compartment. When luggage was confiscated in Abu Dhabi I was not provided with any luggage-ticket. I did not know if the bag will land in main trunk or maybe the crew will manage to compact it somewhere in passengers compartments. Only information that I was discarded by the crew was negligible ""you will find your bag after landing"". After landing I approached again one crew member and asked him about my bag. He instructed me to proceed to the airport ""and I will find it on the belt"". I was transferring in Minsk to another airline, and there is no belt for transferring baggage. Airport staff was helpless as well. Eventually I received my baggage after two days in my destination airport after frantic private phone investigation at airlines and airports. The issue was created by negligence of Etihad staff consisting either of following: - assuming that there are no transfer passenger and sending all collected bags to final belt, not providing any receipt for collected baggage, taking no action in request to return of find missing baggage.

The First class seat is such a big disappointment as its only on a par with Qatar's business class seat. No mattress was offered, no proper pillow either and these seats have aged a lot, it was very uncomfortable lying down I hardly got any sleep.

I had one single trip booked from SGN to JFK, with worst experience ever in my almost 30 years of flying. I've read good stories and recommendations on Etihad, and conveniently there was a good flight from SGN to JFK with one stop at (Abu Dhabi) a very convenient time at 8:00pm, arriving around 10am at JFK. Flight got cancelled and booked for another flight 9 hours later: aircraft issue - understandable. I was offered hotel and rides back and forth upon my arrival at the airport - still understandable. I did not take this offer because I wanted to spend more time with my family. Due to this flight delay, my whole itinerary changed: SGN-AUH-IAD-JFK. There was another flight straight from AUH-JFK but regretfully missed by few min, but they weren't going to let me on that plane anyway - I paid for a one stop flight. I was boarding for flight from AUH and heard an Etihad staff yelling at a passenger in a line to move away? The passenger looked so dumbfounded. Extremely unprofessional behavior. Arrived and found out flight was cancelled from IAD to JFK. They did not offer me hotel (did offer a discounted rate), nor another method of ride to JFK that night. Had a meeting at work the next morning, how inconveniently arrived just a night before the meeting due to delays and cancellations. Therefore, I decided to take a train, but I had to wait for my luggage at an office, and the lady there, who was associated with JetBlue, got me on a free shuttle from IAD to JFK (Which I truly appreciated). Overall, my flight was extended by 12 hours, arrived 15+ hours later than expected, extra costs I spent at the airport. After this incidence, I requested for a refund of my ticket or at least get compensated for the cancelled flight that I never took and for the major changes (one stop flight -> two stops). They did offer me some compensation after 2 months, and I received 15,000 miles on Etihad. I can't even go anywhere with 15,000 miles. I argued that I deserve more, but they reviewed and concluded that was enough for me, they said. I received the miles just because I might be able to transfer these miles to another airlines that I take, if not, it's just going to rot there. I will never be taking Etihad again, and will strongly recommend against it. Just thinking about my experience with Etihad makes me so angry..",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
A330,First Class,5.0,September 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh via Abu Dhabi,3.0," |  Ho Chi Minh to Frankfurt return via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways losing its stars and reputation. After a disappointing outbound experience I hoped for the better this time. But check-in in Frankfurt was very bad, again: Staff seemed to be demotivated, overworked and arrogant. Our request to add an extra bag within our maximum weight allowance was rejected and ground staff even started to argue with us that the information on this matter given to us by Etihad before in writing was wrong and that we were lying to them. The Etihad-lounge in Frankfurt, before one of the best lounges in the world, was shut down. Instead we have been offered Lufthansa Senator-lounge, which is a business-class lounge only. So no first class lounge access even for a fully paid first class flight and instead of a steak grilled to order or other individually cooked items only turkey sausages were our hot dinner-option in Frankfurt, since we wanted to sleep on the short night flight to Abu Dhabi. The next bad surprise was that Etihad – in order to cut costs – does not even cater on board any local newspaper or magazine from its departure-countries any more. Only English and Arabic language papers from Abu Dhabi were available – which were outdated. Staff on board was friendly and professional, and we had a good sleep on board. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi, priority delivery-service was not working and we had to wait for about 45 minutes for our luggage. Etihad also cancelled it’s free chauffeur service. The counter after arrival was closed and we have been sent by a cheap 8-seater-taxi to our hotel rather than a limousine. Check-in at Etihad’s 1st Class counter in Abu Dhabi was again a disaster: bossy staff that neither greeted us nor helped re-packing our baggage because one piece they said was overweight, even though we checked in the same piece with Etihad in FRA 2 days before with no problem. My request for helping us with some Scotch-tape to re-seal the 2 boxes we had to open for re-packing was ignored, the check-in lady did not even leave her chair to look for it, and instead we were requested to seal them for a hefty fee by an outside supplier. Because of the request of re-packing without proper packing materials some valuable crystal items arrived broken. Communication was very unfriendly, too: instead of asking my wife for her passport, the check-in agent was just waving my passport at us and asked us: ‘who flies’? The agent also checked not our seat-requests and we first did not get our assigned seats. Our flight was leaving from T1, yet no information at check-in that Etihad only has one first class lounge in T3 - where we checked in. So we walked more than 15 minutes through the hectic Abu Dhabi airport from T3 to T1 and back to T3. At least the service on board was spotless, even though you could feel the cost-cutting when it came to the food and beverage-selections. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the airport manager, who helped us through passport control. In conclusion, savings in catering and staff, resulting in overworked and arrogant check-in agents, stop of chauffeur-services and denied access to a 1st class lounge are making even 1st-class flying with Etihad a pain. The only good thing is that the staff on board still remains friendly and professional, as before. Other than that Etihad does not live up to its 5 star rating.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,October 2017,4.0,2.0,5.0,no,Jakarta to Abu Dhabi,2.0," |  Jakarta to Berlin via Abu Dhabi and Belgrade, I was looking forward to enjoy a pleasant flight. The first flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was an Etihad operated flight, the last two flights were Air Serbia operated flights. For those, who do not know Air Serbia: Etihad owns 49% of that airline and manages it. The first flight was a night flight, departing 0:10 am. My seat was not reclining as it should. It was going back to normal position, when I leaned forward a little. The flight attendant confirmed that the seat has a defect, and told me, she would try to find a solution. Well, nothing happened, not even a feedback. After 23 hours of travelling with Etihad (including waiting times at the airports), I was about to start my final flight to Berlin at Belgrade on time. While waiting in the airplane I fell asleep, just to wake up 20 min. after regular departure time, because of the pilot's announcement: All passengers would need to leave the airplane due to a technical error. Then, we needed to wait, without knowing, what would happen next. This took around 3 hours. The airline provided water and apple juice for free but no information. Then, the flight was cancelled. The ground staff told us, that we would get new tickets immediately and after that we would stay in a hotel to catch our new flight connection on the next day. What they did not tell us: Everybody would need to wait until all new tickets are issued. No option to buy food is available at that part of the airport. After that, we would be transfered directly to the hotel. This happened another 2 hours later. While waiting for the new tickets to be issued and in the bus for the other passengers whose tickets have not been issued yet, no food was provided. So 5.30 hours after the regular departure time, I was checking in at the hotel. It was 11.40 pm local time and they were about to pick me up at 4 am the next day, so that I could catch my flight in the morning at 6.35 am. At the hotel we were finally provided a food bag, with a sandwich in it, an apple, drinkable yoghurt and chocolate mousse...The hotel kitchen was closed already...too late. The spa was also closed by the way. Well, I did not get any sleep that night, because I was so afraid of missing my next flight, because I was super tired. All in all, the way I was treated as a customer was semi-professional. I would probably choose a different airline next time.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

The team had a very hospitable and caring attitude and never seemed like we were bothering them at all if we needed anything. My husband was very sick and had sinus pressure pain in his face, one of the girls kept coming to check on us and got us a hot towel, and followed up later on to check on him. They really went above and beyond compared to other airlines we have been with before. I even forgot my phone on the plane when landing in Chicago and the captain and manager took it and saw me running back and returned it to me, then followed up with us a few minutes after about our baggage just to check on us.

I flew Eithad to the US twice before from the UAE in first and raved about the food, service and comfort on its 380. So roll on three years forward and a business class booking where I spent good money to upgrade to first from Munich to Abu Dhabi​ where​ the experience could not have been more different and disappointing. The outbound flight EY04 Boeing 777-300 seat was the first shock since clearly these seats had seen a better day and for the most part unless fully extended was uncomfortable. The leather padding kept moving around and thus prone to slide in the sitting position. Unlike the two prior trips where the first class seating was big enough to seat two people these seats were not. The aircraft seemed old and worn unlike the new 777’s which are great to fly. The food options were greatly diminished from prior Etihad flights and I was a bit shocked to see just how uninteresting the menu was. I ordered food but then decided to cancel since sleep was needed. I did not feel like I missed anything and other reviewers confirmed it. I would have liked something to munch on even though the plane had less than an hour before landing but the answer was no. Really not even a breakfast roll? I had to keep asking for coffee refills but at least I got that. Very different from my prior Etihad flights​ where service was outstanding​.​ ​ The movie selection was mediocre and not worth turning on to watch the films available. The other on board surprise was the FC toiletries that were handed out. An oversized bag with tiny samples of lotion or toothpaste. Etihad no longer carries the Bergamonte brand it did ​previously​ and clearly my bag was exactly the same as business. Etihad use to be much more generous in its offering both size and quality of products. Once I passed immigration I decided to stop into the arrivals lounge for a bite to eat since I missed my meal and the food offerings there were a joke. Some tiny sandwiches tea, juice or coffee. So I passed and decided to wait until I reach my hotel. Etihad has also cheapened its car service by insisting you buy a full fare ticket before you have access to the service. At first their worthless customer service said no but I tried requesting again online and got a confirmation of service so I was able to use it. The supervisor in the line of cars awaiting Etihad passengers had to argue with four of the drivers before one would agree to take me as I was not that far from the airport. I was shocked to watch them go back and forth. The value if I had booked a car service they recommended for the discounted FC passengers from AUH to ​the Intercontinental​ $35. Now Etihad has become so cost cutting that on a $5500 ticket they didn’t want to cover the $35 cost or even pay for the $20 taxi ride to my hotel? So average service, mediocre food, worn out first class seating, unnecessary rules for first class car service; just adds up to a second class airline in all major categories when looking at their competition. It was the initial pricing and prior experience which hooked me into grabbing a seat.

This is not review about the flight itself but the customer service and the user experience. The problem for me started when I arrived at the airport and they noticed that my wife switched my name and surname when registering the ticket. They notified me that the ticket is invalid and I cannot use it at all. I had to buy a new ticket which cost me 2x more than the one I already had. Since the problem was that only name and surname were switched, this is something that is totally unacceptable to me. When I arrived at Bangkok I tried to get in touch with the airline to learn if I can be at least partly refunded for the ticket that I was not able to use. On the web they say to contact them over Facebook page so I did. The response on the messenger took a few hours but they said to send the question over email. So I did. No responses after 5 days. I found online also the email address to where I wrote the same question. No responses yet after 3 weeks except the autoreply that they will look into my request. After not getting any response I tried also calling them. Their phone service is terrible. You are guided through multiple level of selections such as ""for english press 1"", ""if you bought your ticket online press 1"". At the deepest level you always reach a stage where they say they explain that you should find you answer somewhere else and that the call will now end. Horrible service, especially since these are all international calls. At just one of these deepest levels I was able to finally get a person to whom I was able to speak. They explained to me that the ticket cannot be refunded and that I can even be happy that they don't charge me additional money for not showing up. The last straw for my dissatisfaction with the airline was the checking in to return back home. I tried to check in online one day before and all seats were already marked as non-available. I assumed I simply need to choose the seat when I check in at the counter. I was one of the first people at the counter 4 hours before the flight. The person who checked me in was a trainee without any experience. She said that there are no seats available anymore next to the window on the two connected flights that I had with the airline. This is simply unbelievable and it's simply a way for them to charge additional money for people being able to choose seats.",Business,1.0,nan

The next leg to Manchester was very different with a much older plane, rather poor entertainment and food was no where near as good as from Singapore. Then, when flying back from Manchester it all went rather wrong. We had to queue up for well over an hour and a half, when we eventually arrived at the at the check in desk the guy wanted an 150GPB to check in the bike I had brought from Singapore to Manchester without any extra cost. He stated we were only allowed one bag each, there seemed to be time so I wanted to repack my bag slightly and only check my bike bag, he would not allow me to do this an insisted we paid the 150GPB or we would miss our flight. On the next counter to us a couple were having similar issues. We tried our best though there was no other airline staff around and the check in staff are not employed by Etihad so there was nothing they could do really. We paid up and then got to the boarding to find out the flight was delayed an hour, then it was delayed even longer which meant we would miss our connecting flight. It wasn't all bad as we were put up in an excellent hotel with great food and the plus for me was that I was able to now watch the McGregor vs Mayweather fight. The other upside is that we chatted with the other couple who had isses in the next isle to us and they informed us about the regulations. If a passenger flying out of the UK is more than 6 hours delayed they are entitled to 600euro / person. After lots of emails and proof of our flights we eventually got our 600/each from Etihad.

I had a combination flight of Business (Manila to Abu Dhabi) then Economy (Abu Dhabi to Brussels). In both flights, service was almost impeccable. There was also an impressive and much-welcomed amelioration in the lounge for Gold members who can now access more exclusive lounges: if flying from Terminal 1, it is now the one beside the Al Reem, which is much cosier than the latter and the food choices are a plenty. If flying from Terminal 3, Gold members are allowed at the Business Class Lounge. Before, I would only have access to this lounge when I flew business. Now, on economy flights, Gold members are welcomed here. The only area that still need improvements are the ground crews in Brussels. You hardly find anyone friendly here in the past but maybe now, I probably was just unlucky to be attended by someone new. Nothing of what I requested was arranged and he was not aware of the protocol for Etihad frequent flyer members.

Because Etihad code share with Air Berlin, with Air Berlin going into liquidation, our return bookings were cancelled and changed around 4 times. I was supposed to be flying out of Berlin, but they thought it would be easy to just fly out of Dusseldorf or Munich - both 5 hour train trips or maybe to get across to Serbia and fly from there. The final solution offered was to fly from Berlin with Alitalia to Rome, hang around in the airport for 8 hours and then join up to Abu Dhabi and fly back to Melbourne - this equated to a very long journey. On checking in with Alitalia, they decided that my 15kgs of extra luggage would be charged at Euro 344 for the journey. Note that I had tried to put in the excess baggage through the Etihad website, but it does not allow you to do this - so you are zapped at the airport with a large charge that you are then not in a position to find options for. The travel documentation indicates that the cost for an extra bag is US$ 185.00, however this is not the case. I shipped a 30kg suitcase door to door from Germany for Euro 280 so you can see how bad this charge is. On the flight, once again no special meal so the crew had to find bits of fruit for me to eat - they blame this on Flight Centre and Flight Centre say the meal request was definitely in the system - who is lying? Both totally incompetent. A totally dreadful experience and will never fly with them or recommend them again.

After travelling for 30 hours and waiting for our flight to Portugal from London we were denied access on the plane for this reason. They cancelled my ticket and refused a refund or to help in any way. My boyfriend then had to forfeit his flight to help me get to Portugal.

Due to such bad customer service we have lost so much money. We had to then spend 250 euros for a new flight just because of such bad customer service and being told false information.  So after 30 hours of flying we are down another 500€ and have to spend another 22 hours waiting in an airport for our flight.

Since I opted for fish the only offer I got was the salmon from business-class instead the cod from First. The ‘new’ amenity-kit was another disappointment. While it’s still the same cheap plastic-kit in a fake (now blue instead of black) leather look, the quality and number of items inside have been reduced and the nice little pouch containing skin care products disappeared. Not even a razor is supplied any more. It now basically contains only what the Etihad former business-class kit contained (which has been discontinued). The whole flight through I was never addressed by name, drinks have been only re-filled upon request and even for a hot towel after dinner I had to ask for.

Every seat on the return flight in Business Class was full and the air temperature in the cabin was at least 75 degrees (24 Celsius).

While Manchester Airport staff handled things very well and Flight Attendants were very good on Manchester to Abu Dhabi segment things deteriorate once you reach Abu Dhabi Airport to catch flight to India.

When I boarded I saw people with even bigger carry-on luggage then mine. At Delhi told my bag would be with on Luggage Belt. On return from Delhi again staff were taking carry on bags. I saw many people returning their Special Meal when it comes to our choice choices were very limited and many has run out. Between Delhi-Abu Dhabi I found staff a bit rude. Full marks to Manchester Airport to Abu Dhabi flight crew and also the staff managing Abu Dhabi Airport to Manchester flight. Unless they sort out this fiasco about carry-on bags between Delhi to Abu Dhabi I will avoid travelling with Etihad. Food is good and they give complimentary drinks.,nan,2.0,nan

When we arrived at the airport and checked in I found out that I did not have the extra leg room. I got on the plane and spent the next 14 hours with my leg up on the food table which was extremely uncomfortable. While on the plane the hostess also had to take away my crutches so they were out of the way of other passengers.

All their efforts are spent on their first or business clients so if you are going economy you can only expect the bare minimum of customer care and comfort. The entertainment system is very good but lost baggage seat comfort pre-assigning seats and being able to easily contact a helpful customer service when things do not go to plan are also part of the service I consider myself to be paying for and Etihad do not deliver on these points. Also they code share with airlines that are well below Etihad's standard its very disappointing to believe you are paying extra for a good airline only to find you've been code shared onto a second rate partner airline.,nan,1.0,nan

Both Etihad flights were excellent comparable service to Qatar and Emirates really. FA's extremely courteous and attentive for both legs excellent IFE and seemingly very well executed landings. Only gripe is the rather inefficient process of attaining boarding passes due to the code share with Air Berlin. At first Air Berlin staff informed me something was strange about my booking and they could only check me in as far as Dusseldorf after making me wait 15 minutes they then told me they could check me in as far as Abu Dhabi. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi had to line up again to get my boarding pass for onward flight to Hyderabad. Surely it should be possible to check passengers and their luggage through to the final destination from the point of first departure. I didn't understand the logic in that.

The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight.

The space is the major gain you have what seems the equivalent of 3 seats you can stretch out have places which to store books glasses and water bottles and certainly the amenity kit is worthwhile. The service also improves with a higher staff ratio and they were certainly attentive to all needs from extra blankets to late night snacks (I can recommend the steak sandwich).

As you approach the airport the streets are filled with signs to guide you on where to go. When you reach workers with trolleys will be waiting for you to help with the luggage. While you're entering the terminal the security check is after the luggage check therefore it will be comfortable for the passenger to go through security without having to worry about the luggage. After the security check and when you are ready to board you will walk through a fairly small duty free which requires improvement. The shops were not organized and small and the food court is very small and does not have the variety that would make the passengers have a good experience at the airport. I boarded the Boeing 777 which was very large compared to the other airplanes I went on. There are two lines before you enter a line for economy class and the other for business and first class. The line for economy was much longer than the other line. I did not have to wait because my ticket was a business class ticket. The flight welcomed the passengers with smiles which was a great start. The passenger is guided to his seat and helped with placing his hand luggage. The seats were small as my expectations were higher for a highly priced ticket that cost 8130 AED. However as the plane took off and the passengers were allowed to move the seats it turned out to be very comfortable as the seats can turn into a bed. The service was very quick and I had access to food at all times during the flight. Overall it was a great flight that I recommend for all.,nan,4.0,nan

When the person in front put their seats back it was most uncomfortable and the staff only begrudgingly asked them to put them upright when the meal was being served. The food was not very good. There was no clean up of the toilets during a 7.5 hour flight. There was no way you could walk around as if you went to the rear of the plane the staff frowned if you went into their space.

I suppose it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between this flight and the Emirates 777 economy service to Dubai. Having done both now I would say they are fairly level pegging apart from the fact that Etihad uses an A340 600 with a 2x4x2 configuration much preferable to Emirates 3x4x3 for couples. The A340 is very quiet and surprisingly comfortable even on a 14 hour leg. Clients wanting to stopover will prefer Dubai. While boarding was orderly and relaxed the experience was spoiled a little at check-in. I had booked through Virgin Australia using points and pay - and assumed travel on a major partner airline would be seamless. No such luck. First the check-in guy had to call Virgin - then the airport duty manager got involved and eventually phoned Abu Dhabi for approval. Meanwhile we went for a long walk - it was that or be stabbed in the back by the anxious horde waiting to be checked in. Finally all was fixed - but it took about 40 minutes. The welcoming crew were bright and chatty and flight EY461 left Melbourne on time. Note that the bins above the window seats are smaller than the centre aisle. Safety instructions are via animated video and crew demos. The entertainment screens are a good size and the touch system really easy and simple to use. Emirates ICE is also great but the touch controls don't always work all that well. About a half hour out hot paper towels were served and dinner started 40 minutes later. I had Moroccan beef casserole in couscous not the most appealing looking dish but quite tasty thanks mostly to the black olives. I was pleased to see Australian products were used. The meals are medium in size the other noteworthy point is that steel utensils are used. I had a glass of red wine and asked for another when the trays were taken but the bottle had gone. To her credit the hostess did fill my glass later. Breakfast was scrambled eggs with the lot - fine for me. To summarise: Apart from the hiccup at check-in smooth good value flying.,nan,5.0,nan

After seeing the pictures online and flying on what seemed like a lawn dart with AA I was so excited to fly on the Etihad Airways. However that quickly ended as soon as we landed in Chicago and had to get in another line to check in. A man met you before you even went through the line and placed your bag in the carry on stand to check if it fit. After seeing him give one lady a hard time with hers since the handle grazed the side I knew we were done. Sure enough all 4 carry ons we got on fine with AA were ""overweight"" and exceeded everything else they could possibly find wrong. So $700 later we had to pay for all 4. Absolutely no care about it and the guy needed a manager to override it. She even shook her head at the ridiculous fees but still did nothing. Although they present this put together and professional staff the unfriendly crew poor meals and lack of overhead complements as we saw a few quarrels over space it was anything but. I'd much prefer my laid back friendly JetBlue or Southwest staff any day. Needless to say we plan to travel extensively while living abroad in AD but will not use Etihad again.",nan,3.0,nan

We were told they had been reserved. I understand that airlines have different bassinet policies and accept that. Over the next 2 hours we were told it was our fault for not buying another seat that they wouldn't have a look to see how full the 2nd flight was and they wouldn't speak to our travel agent who was trying to help us.

The second trip was a little less so less attentive the calibre of meals had deteriorated somewhat and service was definitely in decline. So this time we thought we would go First Class. Such a disappointment. From the check in at Sydney Airport - where apart from not being in a queue we could have been anyone for the level of attention and reception received. Thank heavens for the Express Passes to get us quickly through customs and immigration. The cabins in First were excellent the flat beds long and as comfortable as you could get and the beds were made up with sheets. Cabin crew were efficient but certainly lacked the warmth of previous flights. The chefs advised that they could prepare anything for us where in fact the meals were very ordinary and unimaginative. It also took a long time to be served. I know they were striving for a 'dining experience' but when you are tired and hungry you don't want to wait nearly 4 hours as we did on our flight home. I also don't want to hear how tired the staff are how busy they are or any other excuses as we did on several flights.

Even my 9 year old was not comfy the seats are hard and narrow. The flights from Abu Dhabi to Male were better more room bigger seats however toilets are at back next to galley so a nightmare squashing in and out. Food on all sectors was disappointing given a brown paper bag with a sandwich. Had run out of our choice on one leg. Found staff in general to be very abrupt. Also one drinks service coming into London. I also don't like that when I asked for a gin and tonic they mix it themselves instead of giving you the mini bottles so you have no idea how much they have put in. Thought the entertainment was okay but nothing amazing. Apart from the minimal leg room the worst part was being stuck for 3 hrs in Abu Dhabi airport. It is small with very limited eating areas Abu Dhabi to male we didn't even have seating at the gate everyone was on the floor then straight on. Queues for transit both ways were horrendous and badly organised we were in the end taken through the business express lane. If you are used to Dubai airport I don't recommend it.

I guess I can check 1st class but don't hold your breath'. I was polite to all staff but was ignored on more than one occasion.

The articulating seat pan makes the problem unbearable - when you recline the seat back your seat cushion moves forward thrusting your knee into the seat in front of you. The worst part is that I had to endure with this on a 14+ hour transatlantic flight. Understaffed - slow service. They only allow 7kg/~15lbs for carryon baggage.

Snack after take off was adequate given the time of departure (chicken wrap or pumpkin and fetta) I was just given one and had no idea which it was until biting into it but took a very long time for anything to be served or offered. Breakfast was quite decent although served extremely early before arrival. Service took a long time to complete due to only one crew operating my side of the cabin. There seemed to be a distinct lack of crew throughout the economy cabin. Nothing else was offered between services. Blanket and pillow were good as was amenity pack. What lacks was the seat comfort.

Nowhere did anyone tell me about rechecking in. I waited patiently. Elderly passengers who were also connecting from different cities in the US were annoyed. A rude man walked up and asked everyone with AA boarding passes to queue up separately. I was to fit my industry standard carry-on bag in a non-industry standard bag frame. I was told that I will have to check my bag. Having already paid in Buffalo for excess luggage it seemed like a way of making money out of people's miseries.

The food was as good as it can be under the circumstances and the in flight entertainment was excellent. I didn't need the book I had brought with me at all.

If you are flying at 9.40pm and don't see your dinner before 1.30am this can't justify any cost savings. I have been on shorter flights before and mostly they are able to provide full service even on flights of less than 2.5 hours. The crew were so small that even a small emergency can totally disrupt the service to whole plane. There was a health emergency and I must say the crew did pretty well. Other leg (of 3 hours) also had the same problem. I got my lunch in the last 40 mins of the flight that was after asking for it again.

Chengdu to Abu Dhabi: While the ground crew at Chengdu were clueless the cabin crew on this flight were excellent. Attentive and interested in the well being of passengers they conducted regular cabin walks and brought water every hour to passengers in economy. They even conducted a chocolate run going through the cabin during the night to see if anyone watching films or reading would like individual chocolates with another drink.

The boarding process following a restful hour or so in the Airline's dedicated lounge at Heathrow was smooth efficient stress less and punctual. Aircraft (a Boeing 777-300) was as expected clean and in pristine condition. Although the seats in this cabin class were somewhat narrower than many other major carriers they were well appointed and functional as was the in-flight entertainment system. Food was of a high standard and served with a smile. My few requests (via the button) were answered promptly and I did not feel that they were in any way considered to be a nuisance. Arrival at Abu Dhabi and transfer to the next flight was seamless and I was soon on board. Cabin attendants were as professional as had been on the first leg as was the food. My in-built clock nudged me to operate buttons and turn my seat into a bed. It was time for some sleep. This was when the narrowness of the seat became more noticeable a pity really as a couple more inches would have given much more comfort. Following my tour”of Vietnamese culture and cuisine I returned to Bangkok - placed the top layer on and prepared for my return to London. This time after check-in I was directed to the airport's Apricot Lounge prior to boarding. Although quite a peaceful refuge its facilities fell far short of the Airline's own lounges. As expected the journey times against the prevailing jet streams were much longer but they were offset to some degree by the good service and ambience of the aircraft's business class cabin.

The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem.

We booked the limo service from Suffolk to LHR and this arrived on time and dropped us outside T4 for an additional charge of just £20 since our home was just outside the 100 mile trip limit. Quick check-in having pre-booked our seats and apart from the pretty useless Fastrack courtesy of Heathrow's disinterested staff we were in the lounge shortly thereafter. As lounges go it was fine - quiet comfortable and good service. Boarded 15 mins before departure with no delay and the gate was conveniently opposite the lounge. Jacket taken and champagne provided. Settled into comfortable seat in the Airbus 340 the excellent cabin staff explained the menu and took orders alongside after take-off drink requests. Flight took off on time and the rest of the inflight service was outstanding. The freshly made steak sandwich as a snack from the kitchen was as good a snack as I have had on any airline. Arrived into AUH on time but we had gated at the old terminal and had to transfer to the new one for our flight to Bangkok. Business lounge was very busy so we went in the First Class lounge and had a shower. Boarded EY408 on time and had a trouble free flight to BKK in a 777 this time but pretty similar set-up. Steak sandwiches just as good. Arrive BKK slightly ahead of schedule and given card to use its Premium lane so was cleared of immigration and collecting bags of carousel in quick time. Return leg was exactly the same with excellent service throughout and punctual arrival into LHR. My only gripe? The complimentary chauffeur. I initially booked one for arrival in BKK to our hotel but never got confirmation and when I tried to it seemed their was some confusion as to eligibility (2 journeys per adult passenger). Since it is hardly an expensive taxi from the airport to downtown Bangkok I cancelled it to make sure that we had the return from LHR to home but given the confusion wanted to make sure this was understood. I had to call Etihad in AUH in the end and it took ages and then started getting calls from the limo company in Bangkok advising what time they would be collecting us! When we arrived back at LHR they had organised a car for me and a car for my wife! We declined and continued our journey together. Seems like the system on these could be improved but it did not detract from the superb service.,nan,5.0,nan

I had to wait 30 mins at the check in desk for the bassinet seat as they told me there was none available. Later they gave a bassinet seat for my wife/infant and 3 rows away a seat for my toddler. Finally all completed in 30 mins and we were let go with bassinet seat and seat beside for my toddler son. My wife and kids boarded without issues. However their cabin baggage was put elsewhere because the flight was full it was total chaos. The flight took off 3 hours late. As the flight left 3 hours late connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to Chennai would be missed if the connecting flight was not delayed. The stroller for the infant was sent to the connecting flight directly. My wife had to carry the infant and walk with the 4 yrs old 2 cabin bags and laptop bag. Why was there no service offered.

I've flown a lot on many different airlines and I found the seats in this one incredibly tight and uncomfortable so much so that I woke up in the middle of the night once I got home because my back was so sore. The food was pretty ordinary in the middle of a 14hr leg to Sydney we got a cold bread roll with three thin slices of tomato on it. I have never been so hungry on a plane! The final service before landing was rushed with the staff basically tossing the food at us from piles in their arms there was only one choice and half the contents of my tray were missing but the staff were so stretched I didn't bother to harass them about it.

Meanwhile nobody else could get past to get to their seats. Service on board was extremely slow we had the wrong menu card. Even though the Cabin Crew were wearing 'Happy new year' hats when we boarded there was only a passing reference to it being 2014 as we passed over Romania. Abu Dhabi airport experience was an awful chaotic shambles. Multiple flights arrived simultaneously and they clearly could not cope with the thousands of passengers in transit. Nobody knew what they were queuing for or even if they were in the right terminal. Airport staff were taking no notice of those who were trying to tell them they would miss their connection if they stayed in the queue luckily we had a 3 hour wait so we were not worried just bemused at the chaos. Security control was a joke only 6 manned and shouting to us to 'leave everything in your bags'. Not looking forward to going back through on the way home.

The lounge was good but Terminal 1 was crowded and poorly organized. There was a long line up to check in and business class passengers were not given any priority. On our trip back the 13 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Toronto was a disaster. They only served dinner and did not serve any food afterwards in business class!

The majority of the passengers were freezing sitting down covered with all available blankets and some even using their winter jackets! This happened on both flights.

Transfer in AUH again chaotic and disorganised with unfriendly a very cramped boarding lounge bus transfer to plane.

Seat is equipped with IFE (E-BOX) headphone jacks a variety of charging docks (USB Power plugs). 10 mins before push back the Captain announced that the flight was experiencing a problems with its power source and a restart of power unit was required.

E-BOX had a selection of Movies Audio Live TV (CNN and some news channels) TV (nice documentaries) games etc. There was a decent collection of movies (multiple languages) and documentaries although not as big a variety as ICE on Emirates. The headphone jack on 36B wasn't working so my co-passenger had to move to another seat which gave me 2 seats to relax. Snack and beverages were served 30-60 mins after departure.

The return flight on 04/01/2014 was nothing short of a nightmare checked in at Sydney with Etihad partner Virgin Australia. Flight to Abu Dhabi was superb service etc very good. Our cases booked right through to Manchester but told to pick our connecting boarding card up in Abu Dhabi. On arrival the problem started we were told our flights did not show on their system and we were basically cut adrift by Etihad in the middle of the night. Told to pick up our cases from a deserted luggage hall at 3am then had to find the Etihad booking desk managed to book tickets for myself and my wife.

The were people to meet and assist at Abu Dhabi the connection was very smooth and the onward flight was on a newly refurbished A330 with the newest product in Business Class and the food was superb as was the IFE. Cabin staff were excellent and addressed us by our name I would like Etihad to give a much better amenity kit than the very poor one they give out right now. On the return it was nothing short of a disaster on all levels after arriving at JNB airport and getting our tax work done and checking in our luggage the lady at check in tells us that we will not be flying on Etihad but on Air Seychelles. I would have appreciated it if Etihad would have contacted me before I left my hotel and told me of the situation and given me a choice. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable and very hard though the leg room was good the sleeping position was terrible as it was not straight and the IFE was terrible the screen was very small and the selection was poor I refused to have a meal and just had a glass of Orange juice.

Etihad lounge at Manchester is first class with very attentive staff. Etihad business class seat is a little bit narrow and anyone over 6 foot won't be able to lie flat. All seats have direct access to the aisles. If you want privacy I recommend the window seats. The paired seats are very intimate.

Leaves and arrives on time. Now my only issue was when I am flying AUH-KWI. At Abu Dhabi Airport terminal waiting area Business Class passengers were being treated as Economy Class. For the past 2 flights going back to Kuwait I experienced that there is no special or separate bus for Business Class passengers. We were all being mixed with Economy Class passengers on a single bus. Before Business Class passengers always had a separate bus and had priority on boarding the bus and plane. There used to be a lane for Business Class. As I had mentioned for the past 2 flights I had AUH-KWI this does not happen anymore.

At every boarding I had to actively look for someone so I could hand them my coat. No welcome aboard and guiding to my seat and nobody addresses me by my name anymore. The Champagne used to be Bollinger but has been downgraded to something cheaper. The quality of the food can vary dramatically depending on the skills of the on-board chef. Despite my request for breakfast yesterday I was not woken up in time and had to do without! The worst perhaps is the chauffeur pick-up  which stressed me enormously. Nobody called me to arrange a time for pick-up in London so I had to call the UAE to arrange it myself. They did not send any text message or email confirmation despite another call to request it. The pick-up was confirmed (orally) for 6.30 am but I was woken up by the driver at 5.15 am. My flight was at 10.30 am and I was a 15 minute-drive away from the airport! On the next leg of the journey Etihad left me a message that a pick-up had been arranged for me in Dubai but the time turned out to be less than 3 hours before take-off and it takes at least 90 minutes to go from Dubai to Abu Dhabi if there is no traffic. It took me countless calls to Etihad. Luckily the driver came on time. All in all I do not envisage traveling 1st class with Etihad again.,nan,2.0,nan

Planes are modern and the seats in cattle class are acceptable. The in-flight entertainment is ok but not spectacular being too limited in content for long haul. Emirates are better in this context. Abu Dhabi is not one of the better airports to change through and isn't well organised. Each time involved a bus trip to the aircraft. I think it is an airline trying to climb up the ladder and the service was the standout. I would happily use them again.,nan,4.0,nan

Originally booked the entire trip in economy but bidded using Etihad's online upgrade auction that is sent out to select customers. I was successful in all 3 bids. Quick note about economy - the 777-300ER aircraft used a 3-4-3 seating as a lot of airlines are doing these days. The seating is horrible and a massive step down from J of course. Leg room was just adequate. The business class legs were great. The individual 'suites' are very private although the window seats are better and more private than the aisle seats. Seat was comfortable and very comfortable when in 'relax' mode. My only complaint was the bed. Fully reclined the bed is 185cm and I am 184cm. There is no scope for letting your feet hang out over the end of the bed. For a premium product the bed simply isn't long enough for someone who only slightly above average in height. However due to some careful manoeuvring I did manage to get plenty of sleep. Overall the airline was fantastic although transiting between terminals in Abu Dhabi is a pain. The food and service from the cabin crew were wonderful and all flights were on time except or the AUH-MEL leg which was one hour late. The Arabic mezze I had for starters on each J leg was excellent and the lamb shanks were restaurant quality. I didn't drink much alcohol but on the MEL-AUH they had a very nice shiraz that I enjoyed 2 glasses of. Champagne is offered pre takeoff. Amenity kits were basic. The economy section was standard economy. No better no worse and for 7.5 hours wasn't too bad even with a full plane. The trip back from London was very painful for me emotionally as I had lost my mother the day before. The cabin supervisor couldn't have been more helpful.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight out was okay I had very high expectations as this was my first time with Etihad and I had heard great things. Return flight forget about it. I'm stuck in the mess at Abu Dhabi airport at the moment where technical problems closed the airport briefly.

The airport wants to play with the big boys but it lacks the facilities to do so. Way too many passengers than they can handle so extremely long queues. It took me two hours just to get from one plane to the other. Long bus rides from the plane to the terminal and vice versa. Wifi doesn't work properly.

You really feel like a leper having to walk all the way through the lounge to get a drink. The lounge even though recently refurbished is dirty and already looks tired. Check In was good but everything else until leaving was very poor as MAS also handle boarding and baggage checks at the gate. KUL-LHR flight superb great food staff service wine and the attention staff give each passenger is impressive. Aircraft interior looked like it had be recently refreshed and that was nice Etihad were starting to look a little tired. So well done there. AUH lounge is a disaster too busy and for a flagship it really let's down one of the best airlines around. Boarding was a mess and we ended up standing (no seats) at the gate for 45 minutes. Flight AUH to LHR great as above save for a child in Economy who decided to scream for most of the flight - but the airline can't be held responsible for the bad behaviour of passengers children. Why do people with children believe it is acceptable to trouble everyone else? All in all another excellent trip marred only by the MAS lounge and the transit through AUH lounge. Definitely recommend Etihad as one of the best - hope that now they do KUL twice daily they will invest in their own lounge at KLIA.,nan,4.0,nan

Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls.

These flights and the return in March were booked with Trailfinders UK in summer 2013. Seats were requested on the LHR-AUH flights both ways but seats on the AUH-HKT sectors could not be requested as it was operated under a code share agreement with an Etihad partner Air Berlin. The day before departure I visited the online check-in site at the permitted -24 hours to find seats on the first sector had been allocated window and aisle as requested. There was a very limited option for change so it had been well worthwhile requesting at booking. However second sector seats were allocated as 16K and 15D in opposite aisles making travel as a couple impossible. No option for change. I made a request for more equitable seats at baggage check-in LHR and the agent was able to offer us seats together in 20AC on the second sector less attractive seats due to the missing window in this row but otherwise fine. Once underway on time service on the first sector was in the modern CX/SQ mode a little better in some respects a little less so in others. Food was acceptable even tasty with a pre dinner drink and wine with the meal. Missed was the CX mid flight ice cream. Great IFE. Abu Dhabi was a work in progress crowded busy and confusing with the need to pass through security again. Better is promised for 2015. The second sector on Air Berlin was OK reasonably efficient slightly brusque cabin crew attitude and edible rather than tasty food. No pretence of offering a superior service. No alcohol offered on this breakfast flight but I believe it would have been available on request. Slightly primitive IFE. A quick route from Heathrow to Phuket slightly under 15 hours including stopover. Competitively priced 30 kg baggage allowance and service levels as you would expect but such a pity you can't pre-book seats. So home at the end of the return trip and time for a final verdict.

I chose to travel business class for the reason that Etihad have flat beds some help with how to flatten them would have been good.

On the return I did first class from Abu Dhabi to New York and the experience was outstanding. The seat was extremely comfortable and the service outstanding. The food was good and varied while the privacy doors around the seat were perfect for a 14 hour trip. I was extremely happy and wish more of the international airlines (American carriers will never get their act together) would provide similar first class experience. I look forward to my next visit to UAE and I will avoid the connection through Chicago and instead use NY.,nan,5.0,nan

This is the second time we've used this airline the first being Business Class to and from Australia from London last year. Our overall feelings? The reputation of the airline as 'the best' seems to us to reflect (if true) on how bad other airlines must be though our experience of Emirates flights London/Melbourne have always been better. We had ample airmiles for upgrade on one leg back but were told these classes were 'sold-out' which on observation passing the seats on exit was patently not the case! The Etihad seats for a tall man like me are a nightmare no way to get a headrest into high position to rest head. The space is confined and restrictive. Although Silver Guest card holders we were never advised that we could book actual seats well before the 24 hour on line service. Whilst many of the aircrew really are very nice some are poor at communicating. The food? Well this time much worse than before mostly inedible and boring. I'm afraid we feel this airline is terribly overrated and will never travel with them again.,nan,1.0,nan

Our major points of contention with the airline and Abu Dhabi airport are: Poor or non existent communication with any of the passengers poor or non existent communication between various members of staff inconsistency of information especially on the airport display boards rudeness from some of the staff (ground crew) although many were polite friendly and tried to calm passengers as much as possible. Abu Dhabi airport does look very impressive from the outside (viewed due to need to use a transit hotel in the city) the duty free/shopping area looks smart and there is a good deal of high tech equipment but: it is small and cramped for the number of passengers travelling through even if the flights are on time staff are either incompetent or badly trained. Communication with passengers is abysmal - PA announcements are limited and the display boards are very inaccurate. The abudhabiairport.ae website is inaccurate and not kept up to date catering facilities would make a small village shopping centre look impressive - and they do not cater for either the volume of passengers or offer them much by way of choices. The idea of queuing in order to get into a departure gate lounge is pathetic at the least and you do not make passengers queue for over an hour just to get to this point. On the plane the service started well with a very attractive stewardess taking our food order but after that they all disappeared. We are used to cabin crew walking thru regularly to check on passengers but with Etihad you have to use the call button! We would not recommend Etihad.,nan,2.0,nan

All flights were punctual. The lounge in Dublin is fantastic. All flight sectors were very busy. Food onboard was OK. The food service onboard seems to take an extortionate amount of time. Also Etihad leave the main lighting on for too long on red eye flight. They should make better use of the mood lighting for those that want to sleep. The seat pitch on the A330 was not good and I could not sleep. The Boeing 777 aircraft with 10 abreast seating and narrow aisles feels cramped but easier to sleep on. The crew were friendly and professional on all sectors. They currently appear to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. I was impressed as I was greeted by name on one sector. IFE is good. Etihad now seem to have a policy of boarding almost an hour before scheduled departure which seems excessive to me. We were sitting on the tarmac after boarding for a least 30minutes on all sectors and I was one of the last few to board. There are still issues with the landing slot in Dublin airport in the morning as no stands are available to park at. Another delay after a 8 hour flight.,nan,4.0,nan

Last trip I had was on EY18 from London to Abu Dhabi in business class. The lounge in London was the best lounge I've been to following the one in Abu Dhabi. Onboard I was in seat 9A a window seat and being able to lay down flat is great. I slept then woke up for an excellent meal.

The tiny plane from BOM-AUH (courtesy Jet Airways) did not feel anything special other than a slightly stretched economy seat. The Business class lounge at AUH felt stuffy scruffy and least inviting. Couches were occupied by sleeping passengers and food was so spartan it made a mockery of a proper business class lounge. At boarding there was no special fast track for Business Class travelers and we simply had to wait in a long queue. During long haul sections the standard business class stretch seat and cabin did not quite infuse a sense of special feeling and the cabin attendants were barely doing their routine duties and food was no more than ordinary. Really very disappointed. The distinct feeling is the Business Class has been washed down these days to be nothing special even though the price compared is almost 3 times that of economy class.,nan,3.0,nan

The worst was my recent flight to Morocco from Abu Dhabi. The flight scheduled to leave at 2 am finally left at 7 am. Not a single announcement was made to inform passengers or to guide them to some desk to get assistance or a voucher. Up to 7 am the airline's website kept listing the departure on time at 2 am. The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen. No attempt was made to bring order to chaos. Things did not get any better once I finally arrived in Morocco. Being so late I had missed my connection.

Great customer service by staff in Australia and Germany but the UAE headquarters in Abu Dhabi is the one that pulls down the whole airline performance.

This was unbearable especially on the 15 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Chicago. No concept of boarding zones. All 4 flights were delayed by at least 1 hour. Connecting in Abu Dhabi is a nightmare. They make you go through security just before boarding which is a primary reason for delays. Buses take passengers to smaller planes. Too many passengers are packed into one bus for a very uncomfortable 20 minute ride. Neutral: US CBP pre-clearance is nice to have but adds to delays.

I wonder if the airline is cost cutting with check in staff. Then there is the issue of the queue at Abu Dhabi. After alighting the aircraft it is necessary to stand amid a slowly moving sea of humanity all awaiting a re-scanning of hand luggage. On my last trip this wait took over an hour.

I spent a lot of time (and money) on calls trying to resolve commitments in the UK accordingly. In the end rather than pay for accommodation and similar for (I estimate) 100 passengers they simply made the AUH flight wait two hours and thus inconvenienced over 300 passengers! Investigating their schedules and the way they handle their aircraft (in this case A6ETB) it was clear that they had elected to deliberately run this aircraft late for three consecutive days. When I say late I mean hours not minutes: you can imagine the difficulties that passengers face arriving at LHR and getting out around 10 pm at night rather than at 7 pm. I would and urge everyone who is considering using Etihad to be quite careful they may have an equipment shortage or simply be electing to mess people around as they know that there is limited legislation for a non-EU airline of this nature.,nan,1.0,nan

The food was excellent although I did expect breakfast to be served a bit earlier on when flying from SIN-BNE. I was slightly disappointed with the Inflight Entertainment system. It was not as good as British Airways simply because there was not as much choice. On the return journey it seemed like I had watched everything twice over. However I rather liked how the system did not turn off when the plane was beginning it's descent as it often does with other airlines. The steward was very helpful when it came to disembarking the plane. I was struggling to unload all my things and manage to my two young boys. He took my boys and led them off the plane.

At the same time an elderly lady perhaps not as old as myself but using a walking stick also had difficulty going down to ground level. There ought to have been a handrail. Thursday 1st May on my return at Sydney airport I attempted to find the Business class lounge prior to boarding EY455 Sydney to Abu Dhabi. I walked almost the length to Gate 60 before I found that it was near the Duty Free section. I had waked past with a number of people. The signing was poor and needed an overhead indication. On 3rd May EY021 Abu Dhabi to Manchester I asked for grilled beefsteak from the main menu only to be informed that it was not available. The alternative from the Anytime Menu was adequate.

Now the return leg on 18th May from BKK to AUH. No member of cabin staff identified me as a gold member each request was declined and the stewardess was totally out of her depth. for example when I asked for a glass of dessert wine I was told I would have to wait until business class was finished and see if there was any left. One hour and 25 mins later it arrived. By such time I had lost the will to complain . On the flight from AUH to MAN I was boarding with business class passengers . As I entered the aircraft the cabin crew manager said to the gentleman in front 'lovely to see you again sir through to the right' - to myself ""in there to the left"" with a look of disdain then to the next two behind lovely to see you etc. As a frequent flier and gold card holder I feel the treatment I received was abysmal.",nan,3.0,nan

Its so easy for Etihad Airways to dump a customer off the cliff. Happily they try so hard to take your money when a deal is made but engaging in solution is something you are poor at.

But the staff service I received from Etihad Airways was so bad that I am writing this immediately after my travel. I was travelling with my 1 year old daughter and was surprised by the attitude of the Air Hostesses and other cabin staff. They were least friendly and least helpful when you ask them anything. I needed some help with my bags to be put in the compartments above the seat and I asked a staff to help me as I had my daughter who was not very happy either. But I was told point blank that she cannot carry my bags. During the flight I asked for some warm milk for my daughter and the staff gave a cup of cold milk (after asking a couple of times). When I asked if they can help me get the milk warmed I was again told clearly that that is all they can do and they can't warm the milk. Then I had to request them a few times to finally get the milk warmed. I am just putting down a couple of things here.

The Etihad ground staff knew about this problem but still issued us both the Boarding Passes Colombo to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi To Munich. On the flight we asked the Purser and the Air Hostess to check with the Pilot about our connecting flight in Abu Dhabi. All three assured us that we will be able to catch the connecting flight. Upon landing at Abu Dhabi airport we were met by a Etihad ground staff who told us that the connecting flight had left for Munich 1.5 hours ago. So all that assurance by the Pilot and the Purser was a lie. We were made to do immigration formalities and brought to the baggage collection carousel. The baggage took exactly one hour and twenty minutes to arrive. We were not offered any water nor a place to sit no one was kind nor helpful at the airport. We were handed over to Etihad Airways staff who was the rudest I have ever known. Just because she is of Arab origin she thought that everybody else are low down. She took us to the taxi rank at the airport and handed us over to a taxi driver who drove us off to Dubai. She also told us that there will a person from Etihad who will take care of us at the Dubai Terminal. Finally we reached Dubai Emirates Business Terminal and got ourselves checked in.

When I pointed this out to the air hostess she was apologetic though it was not her fault. For a flight of 9 hours my husband and I were made to sit apart. On our return from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi we a group of 9 adults who are strict vegetarians had to make do with bread and juice and a couple of packets of nuts as our meal request for avml or asian vegetarian meal was not showing in their system.

Unlike the other airlines I have flown with I did not feel 'looked after'. I have a gluten free diet and at the first meal the cabin crew apologised not only for there being no g/f bread but also for the very tired looking meal. The standard of food was not what I expected. I loved the configuration of the seats affording excellent privacy but was glad I am neither claustrophobic nor overweight. At Abu Dhabi the walk to the gate from the cramped lounge was very long. I felt quite ill and asked for some water to take some painkillers but was told to walk 'downstairs' to buy some. A member of staff eventually produced a bottle of water. The next leg was a repeat of the first apologies for lack of bread (I do not need bread it would have been simpler just to say nothing) and very poor food. However I slept well and there was wifi on board which for me is a huge bonus although there is a cost to this. This flight fell below my previous experiences on the MAN - MEL route.,nan,3.0,nan

I would not want to sit in one of the 'couple seats' with a complete stranger. Seat size was below optimum for a 1.88m/6'3'' person like me as in the maximum reclined position I wasn't able to stretch out completely. Putting one leg in the aisle was not causing a problem due to generous space especially when compared to the extremely narrow economy class aisle in 3-4-3 configured 777s. Power sockets and USB-Plug-in were somewhat randomly put into several areas and the table was too far from the person to enjoy the meal in an upright Position. The layout was clearly lacking storage room for something small like earphone case or iphone. No noise suppressing headphones were provided although announced in the ad (Website). I used my own ones and was able to sleep rather comfortably for most of the six hour flight. Food was ok but nothing much to write home about relatively small choice (again not really according to the advertised super cuisine).

This resulted in a mad dash transferring through AUH to get my connection to NRT. Flights to and from NRT were on A330 which seemed much more spacious in terms of legroom. As the flight to NRT was half-empty there was plenty of room to stretch out. Arrival at NRT spoilt by the non-arrival of my baggage. Credit where it's due the Etihad representative was straight on the phone to track it down but this has happened to about 12 people on the flight.

The return journey was okay initially the flight left BKK on time and arrived in Abu Dhabi as scheduled.

Oh the voucher only entitles me to what? A doughnut and a coffee! A 6.5 hr delay and this is all that was offered I was pretty disappointed and felt like this was in contradiction to Etihad's excellent reputation.

After discussing our need to make a tight connection in Brisbane with the cabin crew we were assured each time we enquired (3 during flight) that our daughter would be bought through from economy so we could exit quickly that the ground crew had been notified and that there would be ground crew to assist us to make connection. None of this happened! We fly on average twice per month and will not fly Etihad again!,nan,3.0,nan

Both flights were late (although not significantly) with no explanation. The seats are quite comfortable although a bit narrow and clearly it is better than flying economy. But the service was very below par. On the first leg the crew were pleasant and attentive but got several things wrong (eg bringing the wrong meals). On the second leg though (a long one) the crew were awful. In my view we didn't even get economy class service. Nobody introduced him or herself they staff were off-hand to the point of rudeness the meals took forever to come and the staff didn't respond to any minor requests. For example I wanted a little sugar to sprinkle on my breakfast cereal-I was told that only sugar lumps were available and it wasn't until I suggested that I could go myself and collect some from economy that some appeared! This is just one example of the inadequate and even offensive service. My main course at dinner was almost stone cold and because I had waited so long for it I didn't send it back but it was really horrible. This has never happened to me in scores of long-haul economy flights. Also our trays did not have the correct cutlery on them so we had to keep asking for appropriate utensils. Again this doesn't happen in economy! Another issue was that when one pushed the button for service nothing happened. On two occasions we waited for over ten minutes and nobody appeared. Altogether - very poor we would never fly Etihad again. I have no idea where they get the good ratings that they boast about. The only good thing about the airline is that the call centre staff are very pleasant and helpful.,nan,2.0,nan

We had a bassinet seat and were told on the phone that we could use a bassinet but when we got there they said the baby was too big. The baby never got fed on any of the trips without asking and literally begging. After one hour and 40 minutes after adult meals were served and asking six times we were given tinned baby food! Buzzers elicited no response. After a huge unexplained delay with no food or water for the children we were allowed on the plane. The food situation was disorganised and haphazard-the food was awful. The missed connections were covered but there was more waits for hotels and transport etc. After all the fuss we got about 2 hours sleep before our connecting flight the next day. The two trips that were better were shorter (6.5 hours) and had less people on them. On both these trips we got help from an excellent nanny and some good service from that person.

AUH-GRU and return was on an A340 - the planes felt a little old but there was plenty of space compared to most economy seats I've been in. However AUH-SYD was on a B777 with quite possibly the worst economy long-haul seat I've experienced. The plane was nice and new and the IFE was excellent but the 3-4-3 layout meant the seat width was very narrow and uncomfortable even for a skinny guy like myself. It was hard to walk up and down the aisles to get to the bathrooms due to lack of space - kept bumping into people and I'm glad I wasn't sitting in an aisle seat otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed by this.

I was trying to secure a single window seat throughout the journey but I kept receiving error messages on their website. I had to call their call centre multiple times to get this sorted. Chauffeur service in London was great. Check-in was smooth and staff provide you with Express cards for security and immigration. I saw that I was assigned a new seat and when I questioned this I was informed that there was an aircraft change but that I still had a window seat. Our planned B77W was substituted for with the A346 (F1 livery) in old Business Class configuration. The inbound flight from AUH was delayed over an hour but the Etihad Lounge at T4 was excellent with great food and very friendly staff. Upon boarding a steward approached me and asked if I would like to change my seat with a mother and her kid since I had a bulkhead seat (11A). I asked where the new seat would be and was told it would be a middle seat. I politely declined but he kept insisting. Following a lengthy argument he finally decided to leave me alone but whenever I encountered him later on in the flight he gave me nasty looks. The old Business Class seat was ok not too comfortable and quite narrow (and probably not suitable at all for tall passengers). Once in the air service commenced and I was fortunate to have a lovely English lady serving my row who provided excellent service. Food was excellent and offered in generous quantities. Abu Dhabi airport is absolute mayhem. The walk from the gate to security was too long and it wasn't quite clear while standing in the security line that premium passengers enjoyed a separate lane. Once cleared I asked a member of Etihad staff for the whereabouts of the smoking lounge and she sent me on a goose chase to a closed lounge which was 10 minutes walking distance. When I came back I informed her that the lounge no longer existed and then proceeded to the Business Class lounge (which ironically had it's own smoking lounge). The lounge was excellent and there were tons of food options available but really very limited seating. The flight to Sydney was on a B77W with the new Business Class configuration which was a marked improvement. Seat was bigger and wider and quite comfortable but you can't help but regularly bump your legs into the tray which is a design fault. Once again flight was late to depart but service was top notch and all meals of outstanding quality. On the return flight I had the pleasure of experiencing the Etihad Lounge in Sydney one of the best I have ever been to with superb staff and a la carte dining. Flights to AUH and LHR both departed and arrived late. Overall Etihad is a great airline.

We have both had far better meals in economy on other carriers! The service from the flight attendants was also very mediocre with requests for tea/coffee going unanswered. There was little recognition of business class with priority boarding etc. When you pay extra I think it is reasonable to assume you would expect extra.

We turned around frustrated and came back to the Transfer Desk. Cries from 20-25 passengers were ignored. We had to wait another 2 plus hours before we could talk to the ticket agent. He found seats for us on a flight 14 hours later but to our surprise they could not provide us with accommodation. After about 20 minutes of pleading they agreed to give us rooms outside the airport so we were transferred to a limo waiting area. We waited there for about 40 minutes and got transferred to a hotel. Eventually the 2.10am flight took off at 3.40am. They started to serve the meal about an hour later but to my dismay turbulence started and the pilot ordered the cabin crew to return to their seats.

I have been a loyal Gold Member supporter of Etihad for many years and written many positive reviews so I guess it was only a matter of time before a negative one would take place! Traveled with Etihad Gold Guest Brisbane - Melb code shared with Virgin Australia. Check in easy at Brisbane lounge quite good (maybe 5.5 out of 10) and no glaringly obvious issues. Melbourne - Abu Dhabi upgraded to business class. (8 out of 10) good service. However business class beds really not as big or comfortable as represented in advertising (I am 6ft1). Abu Dhabi to Dublin - average - 6 out of 10. Arrived Dublin and luggage not there. Farcical is a polite way of describing what happened next. Assured it would be on next flight ex Abu Dhabi. All problems were blamed on Aer Lingus. Went to service desk at Dublin airport prior to leaving. Left Dublin for France a week later with still no luggage. Two weeks later return flight to Brisbane. Check in at (CDG Paris). Business / Gold member lounge excellent (10 out of 10). Flight CDG to Abu Dhabi (freezing cold) IFE Good meal service amateur at the most and they ran out of meals. (2 out of 10). Abu Dhabi airport on return trip a total complete and utter shambles. Completely out grown what it was designed for. Flight one hour late and using the same excuse that has been used for my past 7 flights. Arrive Singapore - excellent - good staff who want to do their jobs. In round and out quickly and professionally. Flight Singapore - Brisbane (4 out of 10).

Maybe because of the dark brown color scheme that it felt so cramped. Also that distinct Middle Eastern aircraft smell made my allergies act up throughout the flight. I wasn't able to enjoy the inflight entertainment because of my allergic condition. The meals were ok but nothing spectacular.

Not much explanation from the Captain. Staff were not so polite service average on this flight. They left the menu card when passengers were sleeping and when passengers asked (including us) what was for Breakfast they said look in the menu and all of us were looking for this menu.

My food service was poor and the flight attendant kept bringing me the wrong order.

Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one.

A320 plane supplied for the MCT-AUH flight was tired filthy and should not be in service without a complete cabin redecoration. Seats were stained carpets filthy and the seat pitch was best designed for circus midgets. We were delayed 30 minutes at MCT with absolutely no explanation in English perhaps one was given in Arabic. In AUH I hurried to my next gate for the AUH-GVA leg of the journey I made the plane which pleased me. The A330 was noticeably cleaner although the seat pitch was still better designed for research monkeys than human beings. After being rushed on board we sat for quite a while until someone from the flight deck finally explained that there had been an oil spill on the airport and that we would be sitting another two hours at the gate until the runway was open again. Being a sound and reasonable man I understood why passengers could not be let off the aircraft again. Water and paper ""hot towels"" were their only attempt at service in 150 minutes? Their first step should have been prompt announcements in both Arabic and English explaining what was happening then informing us that we would be served beverages and that the inflight entertainment system would be turned on. Food served was a joke on this flight - first a snack (late night flight) consisting of awful sandwich rollups with the advice that we would have a ""full breakfast"" an hour before landing in GVA. The full breakfast was tired and ridiculous - nothing approaching a full breakfast anywhere. Upon arrival at GVA I was one of about a half dozen passengers whose baggage hadn't ""made the flight"" despite 150 minutes extra time at the gate. It took three days to get my bag to me. Now let's turn to the return trip flown two days ago from ZRH-AUH-MCT. In ZRH we were boarded promptly and the aircraft another A330 was cleaner than the A330 from AUH-GVA. That sort of tells me that you need to better supervise or replace your cleaning staff at AUH your home airport. The flight was not full so there was room to spread out which many passengers did immediately after ""boarding completed"" was announced. We pushed back with Swiss precision on the dot. Food served was delicious plentiful catered by Swissport/LSG. In AUH I made my way to my departure gate in another Terminal weaving through what have got to be some of the longest walks in any airport anywhere. Luckily here and there were moving sidewalks although these were usually clogged so I was actually worried I would miss my connection in the relatively short transfer time allotted by Etihad of only 70 minutes between flights. I needn't have been worried. After reaching the gate it was again a story of sit sit sit. No explanation. No communication from the airline. Suddenly almost an hour late we were rushed onto the bus to the aircraft. The air conditioning was not on. After 10 minutes of waiting there was a terrific lurch and air conditioning came on. On the (same) plane familiar conditions - filthy tired upholstery dirty carpets ridiculous seat pitch. And again we sat. This time however the captain communicated with us in excellent English. He didn't provide any explanation for the delay but at least gave us accurate estimates of when we would actually take off. And he apologized which surely must have been regarded as unusual by the crew as they seemed shocked when he did so. The only silver lining in this very cloudy tale?

Most importantly the toilets were clean on most sectors. Very disappointing that passengers dirtied and water clogged toilets on the Istanbul - Abu Dhabi sector. The IFE was adequate even though I found it repetitive during the 3 week period. I feel the content should be changed every 15 days. I had ordered special meals AVML and was served on all 4 legs. However I also found that the person in charge of menu planning needs to look at a little change. On all 4 legs I was given Green lentils in the salad. I am sure a little more variety will not cost anymore. On one leg I had a Green lentil salad and a yellow lentil dhal curry so two lentil items in one meal. On the AUH-MEL sector the flight took off 2 hours late. The boarding commenced late and were kept seated in the aircraft for over an hour. Were advised due to congestion.

The pillows were proper pillows and the blankets very comfortable. Amenity pack also provided. Throughout the entire journey all staff were friendly and helpful whether it be at check in aircraft or the lounge. I do believe Etihad are in the process of having dedicated lounges which will also add to the whole experience. The Melbourne lounge is shared with several other airlines and not the greatest but its quiet and offers the basics. Abu Dhabi lounge is to small but for an hour stop over was adequate and had a large variety of food and drink on offer. Meals were very good and having the anytime menu is also a plus. Inflight entertainment was excellent. I would have liked noise cancelling headphones as is offered with some other airlines in business class but they were nevertheless comfortable.

Nothing special and what meals we did have were almost inedible - although we had particularly requested seafood the only seafood was baked salmon. Years ago lobster tails but no more. The staff were very pleasant. The seats that turned into beds were not as comfortable as we had in Business and the noise from the aircraft was so bad that we ended up trying to sleep with noise cancelling head phones on. One entertainment unit did not work properly and had very little choice for any TV or movies programs. The staff could not fix it. Also the selection left a lot to be desired as it seemed to cater well for children but not adults. When you have a 14 and 9 hour flight you need a good selection. The first class lounges in both Sydney Abu Dhabi and London were all shared with Business and all were every full. We were advised at the time that the First Class lounges were being 'renovated' - and in both London and Abu Dhabi the queue for the ladies was very long.

My wife and I were on our honeymoon and these flights were such a disappointing way to begin and end our honeymoon. Check-in at Perth airport was fine and easy but I think that was simply because we were the first in the queue. There was no control around boarding in Abu Dhabi or Paris it was simply get in line and walk on the plane most airlines will board based on rows so that there is not a hold up inside the plane but Etihad don't seem to grasp this concept. Our flight from Paris was delayed in departure by over 1 hour because the plane was late yet we were not informed of this until 30min after we were supposed to board. The food on all 4 of our flights was almost inedible on our Paris to Abu Dhabi flight the chicken that was served to me was cold and we actually had to ask for our meals as the staff bypassed us completely when we complained we were told they thought we had already been served. When we got to the gate in Abu Dhabi on our return flight we were told that we either had to leave our duty free purchases from Paris behind or have them added to our checked baggage because it was an Australian Government regulation when we argued with Etihad staff and showed proof of what the government regulation actually is they denied it and said we either had to leave it behind or check it in. Luckily our duty free purchases made it onto the plane as checked baggage but we were not impressed. 3 of the planes we flew on were A330 the toilets on these planes were certainly smaller than usual on an A330 and I have flown on quite a few. The Boeing 777 we flew on kept having the overhead storage compartments open during flight so obviously the plane required maintenance which had not been undertaken.

Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but ""disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience.

The in-flight entertainment is great personal screens and a wide variety of entertainment choices. The seating is incredibly tight and uncomfortable. I had to sit on my travel pillow to alleviate the discomfort. Regarding food service my daughter had ordered the gluten free meal but on both long haul flights there was nothing for her first meal. Something was scrounged up by the second meal but that is a long time (over 10 hours) without any food and no one seemed concerned. It is hard to get any assistance from the flight attendants but that is understandable as there are only a few of them and a LOT of passengers to deal with. We managed an upgrade to business class on the shorter flight from Paris to Abu Dhabi and I must say here is where Etihad shines. The attendants were attentive and helpful. Once again there was no gluten free meal available however something was put together straight away. The seats are wonderful (with inbuilt massager) and a real sense of space is created.

We found the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the 777-300ER to be cramped and not particularly comfortable especially if the person in front put his or her seat back. The AUH to SYD leg was on a A340 which didn't feel as cramped (2-4-2) although I found the seat to be harder. Meals were average and of standard fayre but my wife found all of her pre-ordered vegetarian options to be very poor. The IFE was acceptable. Cabin staff were OK but nothing special. Abu Dhabi airport was transited with ease although we remained within Terminal 3 throughout. Flight delays were minor. If price was the sole determining factor I would recommend Etihad however on this overall experience I know there are much better options to be had elsewhere.,nan,4.0,nan

Check in F 4 people sitting or sleeping there a bad business card for the Airline. F-Lounge closed due to renovation. Very unfriendly staff at the Airport including immigration officers. Boarding fine and again 75 minute delay in departure. This airline is no good if you do business as most flights are delayed. F Class service is very mechanical nothing you would write home about. The food was acceptable. The seat is extremely hard. Conclusion Etihad is an airline who invested money in other airlines but has not after so many years brought there on house in order. I missed a number of connections (with no assistance) in the past nothing to write home about and very little features and benefits. The Airport is a mess the staff are extremely unfriendly.,nan,2.0,nan

We was put on a coach to Dubai and had to fly MH DXB-KUL really good service on MH. We made our connection with 13 min to spare. Service was very slow and if you pressed your call button it was just ignored food wasn't that good only good part was AUH-MAN. The staff on this flight were really good.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,Took 4 flights with Etihad in October Perth to Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi to Rome Paris to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Perth. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and these flights were such a disappointing way to begin and end our honeymoon. Check-in at Perth airport was fine and easy but I think that was simply because we were the first in the queue. There was no control around boarding in Abu Dhabi or Paris it was simply get in line and walk on the plane most airlines will board based on rows so that there is not a hold up inside the plane but Etihad don't seem to grasp this concept. Our flight from Paris was delayed in departure by over 1 hour because the plane was late yet we were not informed of this until 30min after we were supposed to board. The food on all 4 of our flights was almost inedible on our Paris to Abu Dhabi flight the chicken that was served to me was cold and we actually had to ask for our meals as the staff bypassed us completely when we complained we were told they thought we had already been served. When we got to the gate in Abu Dhabi on our return flight we were told that we either had to leave our duty free purchases from Paris behind or have them added to our checked baggage because it was an Australian Government regulation when we argued with Etihad staff and showed proof of what the government regulation actually is they denied it and said we either had to leave it behind or check it in. Luckily our duty free purchases made it onto the plane as checked baggage but we were not impressed. 3 of the planes we flew on were A330 the toilets on these planes were certainly smaller than usual on an A330 and I have flown on quite a few. The Boeing 777 we flew on kept having the overhead storage compartments open during flight so obviously the plane required maintenance which had not been undertaken. The only good thing about this airline was the on-board entertainment selection. Everything else stunk I will never fly this airline again and would never recommend it to anybody. In hindsight we should've paid the extra couple of hundred dollars and flown Emirates.,nan,1.0,nan

I was in Economy on the A340 for both legs. Things didn't start off well. The check-in process in Sao Paulo took a full hour. Told that their system was running extremely slowly that day. Both flights were late taking off. About a hour each. The communicated progress pretty well. Food was good headset very nice blanket and pillows good quality and the entertainment options were good. I lucked out and had an entire row of four seats all to myself so I was able to lie down. I was disappointed by one of the flight attendants during the service. Despite the flight not being crowded she was quite surly. Dishing out drinks without even looking at the passengers terse frowns all around. The other flight attendants were fine. United gets poor marks for service but I think the service I experienced on board was comparable or less good than what I usually get on United. It's just one flight though. They collected headsets and turn off the entertainment way before the flight ends - 40 minutes. I can understand collecting the headsets but why turn off the movies so early? Will I fly Etihad again? I don't see why not but it wasn't the most amazing experience. Perhaps my expectations were too high since I'd heard and read so many good things.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,2.0,Perth to Sao Paul on Etihad via Abu Dhabi. Now economy travel is pretty basic on any airline. We had some positive and some negative experiences on this trip. The positives well the flight was delayed leaving Perth by about 4 hours how can this be a positive? Well flights can be delayed we received some food vouchers and when I complained about some consequential costs to us of this delay the customer relations people on the internet were very quick to respond and to offer compensation and they followed through. Negatives the communication at the airport could have been better (the ground staff were pretty invisible) all people want is some information about what is happening and know when the plane will depart having someone around taking the questions is the best way to keep people happy. The real negative was the legroom. I am comparing economy to the economy of other airlines on the trip we took and we travelled on 5 other airlines in economy. It makes quite a significant difference to the comfort of a long distance economy flight. The in cabin service on the two sectors was variable in quality and sometimes (in the evening ) you had to wave your arms to get some water or attention. It is a good airline and they were responsive to my concerns for which they get a 10 out of 10 but really tight legroom makes for an uncomfortable flight. I would fly with Etihad again probably not on such a long leg as Abu Dhabi to Sao Paulo.,nan,4.0,nan

In the plane the seating was fine and so was the entertainment. We were seated around row 30 in both directions and at meal times choices of meals had run out by this stage. The onboard staff were polite though very abrupt with their mannerisms. The flight was smooth and punctuality was great. As a Velocity member I will continue to fly with Etihad into Europe as I was pleased with the whole experience. There was a discounted offer to purchase a Business Class seat however at the end of our holiday 900 Euro each on top of what we had already paid was a lot. As a Platinum member perhaps a further discount may have enticed us. Economy seats could have had a footrest built in to help with the long flight. IFE sound was poor - I could not reduce the volume and there was a lot of background noise.

Second you clear US customs in Abu Dhabi so you enter the US as a domestic passenger. I fly out of Washington Dulles the absolute worst US gateway and not having to get stuffed in a ""people mover"" waiting a half hour for the entire plane to cram on the bus and then get dumped into immigration after a 14 hour flight is incredible.

I travelled from Jeddah to Narita and back last month and still regretting the decision to fly Etihad. The business class beds on the Abu Dhabi-Narita sector is the narrowest that I ever travelled in. What was most apalling and disheartening was the arrogant attitude of the ground staff on my return journey from Narita. As I had a 9 hour transit time in Abu Dhabi we had requested hotel accommodation. We had got a written confirmation that hotel accommodation was to be arranged on arrival at Abu Dhabi. However when we reached Abu Dhabi at 5am - we were told that there was only 1 room (we were 3 business class passengers) available! The staff refused to entertain or make any efforts - their simple response was their system says 1 room. When we wanted to speak to Duty Manager - we were told he will be available in an hour and will meet us in the Lounge. There was no sign of Duty Manager until 8am! We were finally given rooms in the Airport Hotel at 930am. When I sent a complaint on the airline website the responses did not even attempt to explain why they could not provide rooms after confirming or why the Duty Manager never showed up.

Like most airport terminals there are loads of shops but I made my way to the lounge. The lounge was nice and I was welcomed at the reception desk and given a slip of paper with the wifi code. Plenty of space and great views of aircraft. There is a staffed bar and the barman was happy to mix up any cocktails if he had the ingredients. The champagne and port were both nice. The toilets seemed much better than the ones in BAs lounge in T5. In fact everything about the lounge - including the staff - seemed more welcoming. Lunch was being put out in the food area. Fairly good selection and it was tasty. I got to the gate after most passengers had boarded so don't know if priority boarding was used. Found my seat and was offered a choice of champagne water or fruit juices. Had the champagne and it was nice. I found the seat very comfortable. Food is served when you like. Mumm champagne served once airborne and it was cold and fresh. It did look like the individual cabin crew on each aisle were a bit stretched especially as each order is taken for drinks fetched from the galley and then served. Looked like a lot for the crew to do in a full cabin and with the result that it took a while to get topped up. The food was delicious. Just the right amount and very tasty. The IFE was ok.

Manoeuvring through the cabin trying not to disturb sleeping passengers is tricky and I'm just a 1.80m 78kg guy. That same average goes for the food served. Flight crew was friendly and efficient. But the worst is that you have to transit Abu Dhabi airport when flying with them. By far one of the worst airports I have ever visited and I travel extensively for the last 30 years.

nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,3.0,I recently flew Etihad from the US to India and Maldives. Overall a very disappointing experience. While three of the flights were unremarkable / average for business class three of them were downright abysmal. Among other things Etihad doesn't seem to comprehend the concept of on-time departures - all six flights were delayed by an hour or more. Yes it happens but 6 times in a row?. The Jet Airways aircraft have seen better times and this is Etihad's way of making an entry into a new market. The airport in Abu Dhabi especially Terminal 1 is awful. Three of my six flights all international involved a bus service and a hike up the stairs. The flight crew were a major disappointment on most flights - they try but in most cases don't come close to the class and experience of world-class airlines (e.g. Singapore Asiana Cathay). In 20 years of flying for business I never had to wait 10 minutes for a flight attendant to answer a call. In the end my conclusion is that regardless of how much money Etihad spends it can't buy class / elegance - perhaps one day they will get close however I don't think that day is near.,nan,3.0,nan

The flight departed SGN ca. 1 hour late which still left enough transit time in AUH. During the descend into AUH the cpt announces severe problems with fog and was ordered to circle till further news. On top the lighting system on the runways broke down due which further circling needed. After ca. 30 mins circling the plane is diverted to a nearby airport where we stand at the ground for 3 hours. We then head back to AUH (15 min flight). The crew assures us that no flights departed and all connecting flights would still be there. Ground staff guided us to the premium lounge at T1 where the desk clerk told us the BRU flight left already anyway and she would rebook us onto the next flight. Whilst I wait for the rebooking I see the original BRU flight appearing on the screens for departure 13hr. I notify the clerk who denies the screen data but confirms it after checking again anyway. It's ca. 7am at that moment. She tells us to move to the T3 premium lounge. The desk clerk there confirms the 13h departure and tells us to sit and wait in the lounge till the boarding is announced at gate 44. At that moment gate 44 shows boarding for Brisbane. The next few hours I check on a regular basis with the staff for any change (AUH is in total chaos at that time). Each time they confirm the details. At 12h still no boarding and we're told flight is further delayed but they will announce boarding in time. At 13h30 I go to the gate where the screen still says Brisbane flight is boarding. I ask the boarding clerk if BRU is next after Brisbane to which she tells me she is boarding Dublin at that moment and the BRU flight left 30 minutes ago. What happened then is just too much for words to describe. We ended up being moved to a hotel at 6pm rebooked to the next day's Alitalia flight to Rome with a connection to BRU. Arriving in Rome the next day it turns out we're not in the system for the connecting flight to BRU and both Alitalia and SN flights are fully booked. As a last resort I went to the Vueling ticket counter where they had luckely still 3 seats left on the 18h05 flight which I had to pay for myself. So instead of a planned arrival into BRU on 03/01 at 7am we finally arrived at 04/01 at 9pm. Needless to say without luggage.

I travelled from Jeddah to Narita and back last month and still regretting the decision to fly Etihad. The business class beds on the Abu Dhabi-Narita sector is the narrowest that I ever travelled in. What was most apalling and disheartening was the arrogant attitude of the ground staff on my return journey from Narita. As I had a 9 hour transit time in Abu Dhabi we had requested hotel accommodation. We had got a written confirmation that hotel accommodation was to be arranged on arrival at Abu Dhabi. However when we reached Abu Dhabi at 5am - we were told that there was only 1 room (we were 3 business class passengers) available! The staff refused to entertain or make any efforts - their simple response was their system says 1 room. When we wanted to speak to Duty Manager - we were told he will be available in an hour and will meet us in the Lounge. There was no sign of Duty Manager until 8am! We were finally given rooms in the Airport Hotel at 930am. When I sent a complaint on the airline website the responses did not even attempt to explain why they could not provide rooms after confirming or why the Duty Manager never showed up. Instead they appeared irritated by the complaint and added insult to injury by unilaterally closing the communication. Welcome to business class travel!,nan,1.0,nan

Although flight experience was OK from JFK to AUH but upon arrival at AUH they informed that flight from AUH to LHE is at least 12 hours delayed because of heavy fog at destination.

On nearly every sector they locked off one of the toilets and this made it difficult as all flights were full.

They were friendly smiling and engaging the whole way. Food was good and drinks were also good. Crew answered every call immediately. Only drawback was long bus journey to terminal building. Flight EY416 was with Jet Airways operated by Etihad. A lot of confusion having boarded the bus to aircraft and then waiting on bus for 35 mins and again a further 15 minutes at plane.

Its highly rated cuisine was not on board - there were no Arabic dishes offered. At Abu Dhabi you clear US customs and immigration. While this in theory is great in practice it is far from it. They request that you be there 90 minutes in advance of its scheduled departure. Unfortunately once you get past immigration you are stuck in a rather bleak boarding area with no shops or lounge only a small canteen. All-in-all a underwhelming experience.",nan,3.0,nan

Check in was a breeze the crew were great helping us take turns so that both me and my wife could have our meals while the other one kept the baby. The food was below par. The next leg of the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dhaka was deplorable. First of all checking in was annoying. Another thing that stuck out to me was yes they had a lot of multi-lingual crew members but if you are headed to Bangladesh it probably would help if someone inflight spoke Bengali. On our way back check in was again easy and that's the only good thing that I can say about our return flight. Inflight service was horrible on both legs of the flight. We were flying on Jet Airways not an Etihad carrier and the crew did not know the first thing about customer service. On the longer portion of the flight from Abu Dhabi to JFK after the first two hours of the flight all the crew had vanished and the only way you would see them is if someone rang the attendant bell at their seat.

Tried using eye shades and they worked for a while but the cabin will never be dark. Absolutely horrible design - everyone complaining across all cabins that can't get to sleep. It's like having a bright LED lightpost light on all the time. 2) Food: ordered rib eye medium-well. Came out super-well. ""Oven baked French Fries"" are stodgy and not tasty. The beef jus was good. 3) Service is ok. Friendly but still a bit clinical. 4) Seats are fine and better than the Jet Airways cloth. The headphones though have a slight hiss.

My previous longest flights have been in the six hour range to and from European destinations while my Etihad flights were in the 12 hour range. I'm 6' 3"" tall so legroom is always an important consideration. The legroom on Etihad wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad either. When the passenger in front of me fully reclined my knees were just touching the seatback on an Air Canada flight several years ago I had to contort because of the lack of legroom on a flight from France to Canada. Regarding inflight entertainment there were enough movies and TV shows to keep me going when I wasn't dozing. I also really enjoyed the food as there was a selection of Indian cuisine throughout and I was never at a loss for drink including wine. On my return flight before we took off we had to return to the gate because of a sick passenger; this delayed things by about an hour and a half causing me to miss a connection in Toronto.

A few minutes before take off another passenger came and claimed that he had reserved seat 44A. Finally they asked me to vacate this seat just before takeoff. I was given another seat which was not a window seat. The new seat did not have the sound system working for the entertainment. Finally I was placed in seat 55A in the very last row seat close to the toilet and food preparation area. When the flight took off I tried to watch a movie the audio was not working for this one too. I moved to the adjacent seat 55B which was unoccupied however the audio did not work there either. I informed the flight attendant to reset the audio or do something about it however they looked helpless and were unable to resolve this problem. After the meal I tried to move to yet another seat (54F) this time to try to watch a movie but had to get up to make way for the original user who wanted to spread out and sleep using all the 2 seats I was once again forced to leave this seat. This entire experience was very frustrating. Entertainment system is a very basic and fundamental thing on any flight. Looks like there is no procedure to ensure that this basic functionality is available to all the guests.,nan,1.0,nan

I am usually on OneWorld and prefer Qatar but was most impressed with Etihad. Not as flashy as Qatar in some instances but genuine sincere and excellent hard and soft product. The Jet flights have good seats - I was worried about the herringbone seating but was excellent. The 787 business studio is world class - first class quality and beats Qatar business. The food is very good - Qatar may be a bit better here and also in the amenity kits etc but Etihad flies first on most routes and Qatar does not so that may explain the difference in the business product. The lounge in AUH is good - Qatar is slightly better but Etihad has an excellent spa and the services are excellent and so is the food. Bombay lounge is the shared lounge and is excellent!

Abu Dhabi airport is extremely busy when the morning wave of flights arrive.

Still given the limitations and the use of buses to take passengers to and from the aircraft it seems to work okay. Flights from BNE to DUB were full. Very good service on board. Easy transit stop in Singapore and very efficient boarding process. Transit in AUH was easier as it was the second wave of flights at the airport and much quieter.

Jet Airways staff were curt and not properly stocked. Had ordered kids meals for my 3 kids but none were given - I had to go up to the galley and ask for them personally. Food was well below my expectations. Returning AUH-JFK was terrible. Check-in took 45 minutes because the agent couldn't print our baggage tags. Boarding and the US ICE Pre- clearance was a breeze and we were among the first to board. My wife a doctor herself 6 months pregnant and traveling with a letter from her physician clearing her for travel suffered the most. Once onboard and in our seats a flight attendant noticed my wife was pregnant and asked for her letter. Flight attendant said that the letter was insufficient (remember that this was the return flight - had already been allowed to fly to AUH and had checked-in at the desk gone through two security checkpoints US Customs and the gate agent) and tried to kick her off the flight. After a ground crew member came to ask about our bags (to remove them from the aircraft) and realizing that they would have to remove 7 passengers and 14 checked bags they allowed us to stay but only after delaying the flight for an hour. Food on the return flight was terrible. Small portions poor selection (didn't give us a menu at all). Considering that the return was a 14 hour flight they should have given us more food during the voyage. At least the rest of the cabin crew was relatively nicer but not overly so. Lavatories were actually kept in decent shape and they gave us plenty of water to drink. Upon arrival at JFK the gate staff was rude pushy and noticeably cranky.

In 31C there was a terribly cold draft on the aisle seat which resulted in my arriving in Perth with the most severe sinusitis I have ever had and my right shoulder was very sore. I wore a long sleeved shirt a woolen jumper and had the blanket pulled up but despite that it was freezing. On the way back my husband sat in 31C and he had a T Shirt long sleeved shirt and woolen jumper and still had to get his raincoat down and wear that with the hood up. Other parts of the plane were not so cold so there must be a problem with the cold air vents blowing on 31C. It would be useful for one of your crew to fly long-haul in that seat so that you can get the measure of the problem. On this plane there are no individual air vents so presumably the cold air comes in at one spot and that must be just behind 31C. I would recommend this airline to others but not that seat.,nan,5.0,nan

Etihad maintained regular communication about my travel and allowed me to upgrade to Business class. I skipped that offer and decided to travel in economy class. The day before travel I did online check-in and printed my boarding pass. On the day of travel all I had to do was to drop my bags. I thought it was a simple process of dropping them off. No Etihad agent checks the cabin bag for its size and weight and it can not exceed even 1/2 pound. There was no delay in the flight. There was a 10 minute delay. However passengers were greeted by crew members and they helped me to place the cabin luggage. They were cordial and helpful. We were given a hot towel upon arrival as well as the meal menu card. Crew were very cordial and willing to help. After serving the food they ensured the blinds were closed and there was no service for next couple of hours unless called by passengers. There were some empty seats and I was quick to use them up. I was surprised when the crew handed over my special meals to my changed seat. Flight arrived at Abu Dhabi an hour earlier than scheduled and hence we got an extra hour to browse through airport shops. My next flight was in 2.5 hours. What I noticed is that no compliance to ADA rules for Seniors and others who requires wheelchair access to rest rooms or showers. Passengers have to climb three steps to use the rest rooms. The rest rooms at the airport were not clean. Maybe that's the standard AUH airport maintains. I boarded my next flight to Bangalore (BLR) and it was a smooth ride with a different set of crew and services of crew was excellent. I traveled back from Bangalore to SFO via Abu Dhabi and had an even better experience. Overall I am very satisfied with Etihad and would be happy to travel again.,nan,5.0,nan

The aircraft was clean and tidy and the pillows blankets and comfort kits were more than adequate. The new style pillows were particularly comfortable. Abu Dhabi airport was probably the only slight negative. We were crushed into a small holding space and let through into security a few at a time. It was far too small a space to accommodate the number of passengers passing through. Hopefully this will be sorted once the building work is complete.

It was fine in BLR-AHU. 5) The worst part of the entire thing was the staff experience. In the SFO-AHU flight at least 4 times I had the staff lady tell me ""I will come back to you"" when I asked something and then disappeared. This happened for simple things like water or when I asked her to take a used glass from my seat. Both times I walked to the area and got the work done.

On the way back I decided to try Economy class from Abu Dhabi to USA and found out it was the most horrible flight experience I had in the past 26 years flying back and forth from USA to other countries. Let me make it clear it was all about flight attendants. Sixteen hours of journey itself is not that easy. One needs to be hydrated constantly to keep with the long journey.

I put it in perspective I had 14 hours with nothing to do but watch movies read books and drink wine. People brought me food and I didn't have to do anything for anyone else. No phone emails or pager to distract me. The aircraft was clean seats reasonably comfortable food was fine and the entertainment was good.

For all the hype about their premium products their Economy product is nothing short of dreadful. We chose to fly Etihad with our 2 young boys (3 and 1 years old) from Manchester to Sydney because of their so called ""Flying Nanny"" service. Unfortunately we felt let down by the lack of attention our children got from this apparent qualified nanny who seemed on most occasions to be missing in action and when this Nanny was about she seemed less than enthusiastic wanting to interact with the children. I thought nannies were supposed to actually like children. Now I know food on airplanes isn't supposed to be amazing especially in economy but the matter they classified as ""food"" was about as tasty as a smelly sock after football practise in fact a more accurate description of what they were serving up would be slop with a fancy name. I'm pretty sure the sautéed potatoes was cardboard and that kofta isn't a sausage that has had the life shrivelled out of it. The drink selection wasn't better with a smorgasbord of typical commercial larger which leave a disappointing metallic after-taste. In total we flew 4 legs with this lame imitation airline and on each occasion we were delayed by an hour. That's 4 hours in total that. Part of the reason is a lack of staff at the check in counters and the other being the shambolic nature of Abu Dhabi airport where planes are parked willy nilly along the tarmac waiting for a gate to load the latest bunch of impatient and weary travellers while arrivals are ushered into buses like cattle and given a tour of the entire airport before finally dropping arrivals at their intended destination.

On the first case I was booked business class, but when I got to check-in, Etihad did not have me on the flight list on a full flight, despite SAA being able to provide the codes. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure to know whether I would be able to fly and then it was in economy class. I was promised follow up - the flight controller even confirmed my email address - I am still waiting. The second time, today, flight EY471 from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was delayed by three hours. I fly a lot, and I know these things happen. The proof is in how the airline treats you when they do. I am carrying a letter saying that hotels are booked if the new connection required more than eight hours waiting time. Mine requires fifteen. As I could not access a hotel (transit hotel full and I need a visa for any others) I was given food vouchers and told to wait in the terminal. I had to argue for lounge access (this time I am flying economy, but it seemed logical as lounge access Appears to me a notch down from the promised hotel accommodation). I was told it is full. Eventually the desk took pity on me and granted me five hours in the lounge. When I got to the lounge, lo and behold, it was empty. And just now Etihad refused to renew my voucher - from the mouth of an uninterested and unapologetic desk officer. I was also sent to and fro from the SAA desk to Etihad to sort out boarding passes. I have flown SAA for many years, and with many of its Star Alliance partners. I have two thoughts coming out of these experiences, one that I would not choose Etihad or an Etihad code share flight ever again if I can avoid it: even if the in-flight experience is good enough. And secondly, SAA, this partnership and the systems that support it is not running smoothly. The protocols are not sorted. Fix it.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

There was a ground staff assigned to help us when we landed in Abu Dhabi from Kuala Lumpur.  He simply pushed my wheelchair bound family member as if it was a 100m sprint. Later we had to line up to cross security check, however he led us to cut the line which the security officer was not agreeable to and everything was such a mess and the experience was so unpleasant.  The flight attendant was impolite as well. On the flight, there were a group of travelers that seemed new to flying. One of them was struggling to adjust his inclined seat while the stewardess spotted him. At first the stewardess asked him politely to adjust the seat. The man answered that he had already adjusted the seat by pressing the button. At the end of the situation, it was realized that the adjustment button was not functioning well, however the stewardess did not change her attitude. On the journey back to Kuala Lumpur, the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was delayed and caused me to miss the transit flight. There was a group of 20+ of us from the same flight stranded. The airline arranged a hotel for us, inclusive of shuttle and meals.  However, the arrangement was poorly done. Little assistant nor direction was given and after we cleared custom, we were just left waiting in the lobby. It took 2 hours for the airline to arrange the shuttle to send us to the hotel and by the time we reached, it was already past 4am! Similar poor coordination during the pick up from the hotel as there were 2 sedan cars picking up 8 designated passengers and later the same shuttle bus arrived. We had all boarded the bus but the driver would not leave the hotel as he was told to pick up 21 passengers and 8 were missing (obviously picked up by the earlier sedan cars).",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I missed my flight and I was given a boarding pass for the next flight which departs at 2.10am on 15th June. This was almost 18 hours at the airport. I was given meal vouchers and a facility to sleep in a sleeping pod. The staff at the transfer desk said that they don’t have enough resources in the airport for staying and therefore gave me the sleeping pod. In fact I found that they have an airport hotel, which they could have made available for hapless passengers like me. I was not the only one and many like me were stranded. Etihad was handling this procedure of managing stranded passengers so efficiently that I think that their stranded-passenger-management system is much more efficient than their airline management and scheduling system.  This seems to be a routine procedure for Etihad. I boarded my flight and it reached Munich and I was more than unpleasantly surprised to find out that my baggage is missing again. I got my baggage a few days later. The air stewardesses were a grumpy lot, maybe they are overworked, I don’t know. The food and service was not good and this is a completely overrated airline.

Next leg is on EY73 from AUH to ZRH on an Etihad A330 (EY73). All the reviews about seat being cramped in Economy are definitely true but I would say it's not totally unbearable given that I've sat on seats with similar width and legroom before. But I must say the amount of things they give to you (blanket + amenities kit + inflight magazine + duty free mag) does make the space more cramped than usual as you need somewhere to keep all the items in.

Not sure where they get trained and they seem to select passengers to whom they like to give attention and care.

Many times they forgot or ignored requests for service and acts as if they are doing the passenger a favour! Food excellent. Arrival delayed but the journey was smooth.

I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past.

Lounge en-route very good, but busy. Lounge in Heathrow has good service and food as well, the staff there should be commended. Service enroute was efficient. So overall quite good as the schedules are convenient, lounges and food are good, I think the seats/beds are okay too. The bad part of the experience. Ticketing. Booked through a travel agent but had to confirm a change with ticketing in Heathrow as it was after hours for my agent at home. The ticketing agent Heathrow, could not have been less helpful from the start. Firstly ranting about how it is against IATA regulations for her to do anything, how the change would cost 3000 pounds, etc. Luckily my agent made the change in minutes for 100 pounds. Inflight entertainment. Definitely bring your own if you are from a western country. Almost no recent movies or TV shows. Long flights are the only time I get to watch movies in peace, so that was very disappointing. Quite a long line for check-in at heathrow. Business class waited close to 30 minutes for check-in which is unusual. I do understand it is an A380 but there were lots of empty check in counters further along. So overall the inflight entertainment and just a very unpleasant experience with my only contact point being Heathrow ticketing I will probably avoid flying them again.

There were empty seats but another class. On such a long haul flight no one should be so crammed in and so uncomfortable that the experience becomes unpleasant.

We went to the baggage reclaim section in Male where the Etihad staff member was totally disinterested in our problem. She was ineffective, offered no apology or useful information. Having travelled business we expected a far better service - we appreciate that there are high volumes of luggage but at least an apology and regular updates are not too much to ask for. Also once on the plane (A320) my husbands head rest was broken and he has to stand for around half an hour whilst an engineer was called to fix, once on the second part of the flight his foot rest was broken.

Before booking my flight to Hong Kong from Manchester (with a 2 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi), I researched Etihad Airways on here and I was surprised by the luke-warm and even negative, response. But having travelled with them, they are understandable reviews. Leaving Manchester, the aircraft was late boarding, and late taking off - due to the fact that the plane arrived later from its previous journey. It was a farce when queuing. Most airlines wait for clear space before allowing you to go through the gate, down the ramp and enter the aircraft. Etihad, however, started checking boarding passes well before the aircraft was ready, meaning we had a 25 minutes wait inside the airplane access ramp, waiting while the stewardesses finished off their preparations and loaded the disabled passengers. Perhaps we could have waited in the lounge? On the flight, those at the back of the cabin soon found that they ran out of food options - the chicken was the first to go. That said it was the best airline food I have had.  Seat room was limited for a tall guy like myself, but not too restrictive. However, when people in from of you recline your seats, you have no other option but to do the same yourself, such is the lack of space. Most of the films are not new, and there is a limited range of choices. With the Milan fashion week coming up at the time of departure, the airline (a sponsor) had presented the in-flight entertainment along the theme of fashion. Most films were based around that theme. I would prefer just a bunch of movies where I can control the theme of what I watch. Finding your way around Abu Dhabi Airport is fairly straightforward, clearly laid out and information desks if you get stuck. From Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong, there was not much support for the Chinese speaking passengers on the flight. The menu,and the entertainment system, was in English or Arabic, with little for Chinese. In the end, being a basic speaker myself, I ended up translating the menu for a group of around 25 Chinese people. I would not call Etihad a 'top airline' as they claim, especially not for Economy travellers, where airlines like Virgin and Cathay Pacific do a better job on the same route.

The aircraft on the Delhi to Abu Dhabi sector had newer and better business class seats than the Abu Dhabi to LAX sector. Flight was delayed taking off from Delhi and again leaving for Los Angeles from Abu Dhabi. On the second leg of my journey (which was 16.5 hrs), they only had one assigned meal and the rest were optional (which meant, order whenever required). While taking our order, the cabin staff mentioned that they had run out of the chicken option. When I enquired about how that could be possible since I was the in the second cabin (the one after first class), they simply stated that they start taking order from the back of the plane and hence they ran out. I thought this was a one off and didn't really care at the time. Later during the flight, when I tried to order something from their round-the-clock menu, they mentioned that they had run out of everything besides the baklava. It was kind of ridiculous that they expected passengers to eat only one meal during a 16.5 hr flight! On my return journey, I had the same experience. Flight delayed - after getting on the flight, they said they had run out of the mezze platter which is served as a starter. Later again, their round-the-clock menu didnt have enough to keep me (or others for that matter) satisfied. The second leg from Abu Dhabi to Delhi initially had a 2 hour gap but due to the flight getting delayed, this was reduced to about 45 minutes. Had to really hurry in order to catch the flight even without the unhelpful nature of Etihad staff on the plane and their ground staff. No one was ready to guide us through the waiting lines early for us to make it. They simply just shrugged it off. Further, after asking them repeatedly, they didn't hand out landing cards, which are required to be filled out and handed over to immigration at the Delhi. Right before landing, they made an announcement that they didn't have the cards but that their ground staff would have them as soon as we arrive at New Delhi. There was no one from Etihad Airways handing them out and the whole plane had to manage to find the cards and fill them out before finally getting into line at 03.30! Overall, regardless of their lower price than competitors (Emirates etc), I would not recommend flying Etihad again.",Business,2.0,3.0

The check in process went ok, when it came to boarding we were late boarding and late leaving - pilot did say it was to do with traffic at Manchester but if you check this flight daily it does not often leave on time think it is due to the fact the plane has come in that morning about an hour earlier, not enough time to get passengers off and plane cleaned. When it came to the food there was three options for main choice, but by the time the stewardess got to us there was only one choice left. The seat space was tight. On our return journey the initial check in was great - but then it all turned into a mess, as we got called to the gate and had to stand in a long line and queue to have our passports checked, various hand luggage was also been checked here. Why is this not done at security? Once we got our passports checked we were then stood in the gate area which was filling up fast, people all stood in front of the glass doors - when boarding then started they called for passengers in zone 3 and we had to fight our way through the crowds to board the plane. The food came round and once again they had run out of out the chicken course again - I did not like the other options and the stewardess then said there was some crew meals we could have, so she went away and came back with a meal which she described as a low calorie chicken dish - it turned out to be fish! One dish I do not eat good job I did not have an allergy to fish! I appreciate menu did say if your first choice is not available they apologise, but this happened on flight both ways. Me and my partner then tried to use the headsets both of these did not work.

Before we had gotten on the plane they searched our bags and made us throw all liquid out (even though we had already done this in customs). This meant entering the flight without anything to drink. For a 14 hour flight I like to stay hydrated so this was extremely frustrating. After take off I asked for a bottle of water. I was told I couldn't have one, I could only have a plastic cup that they filled a quarter of the way with water. Apart from our drinks with meals this was all we got. I rang the service bell and waited 1/2 an hour and got no reply even after pressing twice. I had to walk down the other end of the plane just to get another tiny cup of water. For 14 hours on a plane this is ridiculous and for the amount of money you pay for a ticket I would think you could at least be given adequate amounts of water.

You pass through a maze of gates and when you reach the desired gate, you see a waiting area of people which should have given me some hint. They had collected our boarding passes and were calling out names as and when our luggage was transferred. Chaos to the core and added to it is the fact that if you don't get a seat to sit, you end upstanding like me and a few others for almost 45 minutes. Finally you get the boarding pass and clear security and rush down to the US immigration counter where again after a long wait you finally get to the gate. Boarded the flight, unfortunately, after the flight took off was when I realised that no amount of pushing gets my seat to recline. After a while, looking around I realized that a lot of seats had to be manually pushed to recline by the stewardess. When I checked with one of them, she said that I can move to any other empty seat in the coach but I couldn't find an empty one that reclined.

And-to my utter surprise, they did it again. They completely messed it up. Hard to believe, but they did. It reminded me of last year when my wife was booked on the exactly same flight out of Narita and arrived 3 days after the scheduled arrival date in Dusseldorf. This time, during check-in my wife was told nonchalantly by the Narita Etihad Airways ground staff that although her flight data is stored in the Etihad system it cannot be found in the Air Berlin system. In other words: they will not let her take that plane for the simple reason that the link between the Air Berlin system and the Etihad system is missing. One of the staff told her that this sometimes happens and that she should call Air Berlin. What, are you kidding me? Anyway she called them and the Air Berlin call center staff told her that everything is fine and that maybe she checked in too early.  Well it wasn’t ok and the Etihad Airways ground staff continued refusing to hand out a boarding ticket. Maybe one day I will write a book about what a lousy company Etihad is (if anybody hasn’t noticed yet). My wife had to listen to their Narita ground staff and later she was issued a temporary Ticket and had the privilege to board the plane for which I had already paid, after they let her wait for three hours. Last time when this happened I thought they are just a bunch of losers, but by now I think they are either completely incapable or they are doing this intentionally.

I flew round trip AUH-DUB-AUH and the subpar experience started from Abu Dhabi Airport, the fact that most of the airport is still under major renovation and construction alone does not justify the cost of the ticket Etihad charges. Let's start with check-in, the online check in can only be done via website as there is no app that would do it for you (EK or QR have great apps, for example), therefore, there is no such a thing as an online boarding pass integrated into the passbook of the phone. Here are the positive points about the ground service at AUH: Escort service could be provided to sort out the documents and immigration. The Premium Lounge is indeed very nice, albeit not many options for the buffet. Negatives about the ground service at AUH: Being bussed to the aircraft is not luxurious however you try to market it. The Airport is just horrendous The in-flight experience AUH-DUB: Lovely food, I loved the option of eating whenever I chose to. Lovely options for beverages. Crew could be hit or miss. On both legs of my journey, some crew were nice and others were not so great. One of the crew even went as far as to lie: ""Captain just informed me we were above Ankara."" I later found out we never got close to Turkey, which left me puzzled. The reason I had this conversation in the first place was the fact that E-BOX did not work properly and had no flight information. Ground services at DUB: The check in was the same as in AUH. Nothing great. The Airport is wonderful and a joy to go through. The lounge was wonderful too. Great ambience, quiet with attentive staff. In-flight experience DUB-AUH: One word, horrible. No drink was offered to me and my colleague simply because the crew never passed by our side of the cabin. Amenity kit was used by someone else, and I had to ask for a new one. I had to ask for my glass of champagne 3 times, which thankfully arrived 30 minutes after take off. Some meals were not available. I was not asked when I would like to have my food, nor was I asked for my preference of drinks. The food arrived with still water (not ordered by me), the wine I had asked for was not served either. When I asked for sparkling water, the guy just poured some into my half empty glass of still water. No questions asked. Cheese selections consisted of one type of cheese decorated with fruits and berries. The name should be changed to ""Fruit section with added cheese"" The overall feel was as if I had to beg for the service that is supposed to be provided. The cabin had also not been cleaned well as I found a crushed dry bread loaf under my seat, which thoroughly covered the floor under my feet for the remainder of the flight.

In A340-600 and A330-200, there was no overhead compartment in Business Class to stow luggage for passengers in the middle seats (B777-200 doesn't have this problem). The wi-fi on Etihad works like a charm. Etihad's Business Lounge in Abu Dhabi has something for everyone when it comes to dining. Having said that, the operations at Etihad's Abu Dhabi terminal are far from perfect for transit passengers. So, if you can look past the hiccups at Abu Dhabi Airport, flying Etihad Business Class is a special experience.",Family Leisure,4.0,5.0

First flight (MAN-AUH) I asked at checkin if we could have exit seats as me and my travel partner both stand over 6ft tall. Was told this was not possible unless we paid an additional £75 per flight. I expect low cost airlines to charge for exit seats, not a premium airline. Boarded the plane (A340-600) which has a 2-4-2 seat configuration. Decent seat pitch but minimal legroom. Our steward for this 7 hour flight had an appalling attitude, sulked and even refused to give us a full can of tonic water to share as the flight was full. Passenger in front of me full reclined for the full flight even when dinner was served, wasn't asked to put her seat up once. Later overheard him telling another passenger he had been bumped from a flight to the Seychelles, thus the reason for his mood. Only received one drink during this flight. Second flight (AUH-BKK) on Boeing 777-300, no real issues. Staff were friendly and courteous. Multiple drinks runs. Worth noting that this plane was half full. Seat pitch noticeably poorer with a 3-4-3 config but we were lucky that the seat between us was empty. Returning (BKK-AUH) was when the real problems started. Full flight on an A340-600. Plane was 45 minutes late leaving due to refuelling. This wouldn't have been an issue had the following 18 hours not been so spectacularly bad. Screen in front of me was omitting no sound whatsoever with my headphones or my travel partners. Made the stewardess aware of this and she said she would reset the system. 45 minutes pass and still nothing. I asked again if she would reset it and was told she had already. The screen didn't switch off once, so its impossible this had been reset. Sat for full 7 hours with no inflight entertainment. Drinks came round and again, massive shortages. Was restricted to 1 Gin and 1 Beer each. Asked for ice with my Gin and witnessed the stewardess scratching around the tub for tiny shards of ice. They had none. There was another drinks run later in the flight, if you liked tea, coffee or mango juice. They had run out of everything, including water. No water on a flight with 300 people on board. Last flight after a 4-5 hour layover in AUH was to Manchester. Flight left half full again, on a Boeing 777-300 on overnight flight. My plan was to sleep most of the journey. I went to sleep around 90 minutes into the flight, with my seatbelt on as not to be disturbed clearly visible. I was awoken maybe half an hour later by the stewardess who jabbed her finger into my chest multiple times asking me if I had my seatbelt on (lights had come on). I looked down and saw it was clearly visible and fastened. She scuttled off down the aisle embarrassed. Meanwhile my travel partner next to me is sat there asleep with no seatbelt on! We were left well alone after this and I was allowed to sleep. A completely embarrassing performance highlighted when I sent a tweet to Etihad asking if they wanted my feedback for my recent flight.

The one simple issue to illustrate how poor they are is they have not credited my air miles (including an offer of 5000 miles to compensate a cancelled flight!) for these flights, I have written to them 3 times and received no response - this appears to be their normal procedure judging from other reviews. Obviously not receiving air miles would not constitute a bad experience on its own, but this was just to illustrate just how little they care. The crew are dysfunctional, they do not operate at all as a team. Their service is sloppy and carefree and not at all professional.

The plane being new and cutting edge, sold itself. The service was at best, mediocre and the cabin crew showed their lack of experience in confusion and getting mixed up. With a ‘light’ flight, there seemed more a gossip and snacking culture rather than a commitment to looking after their ‘guests’. I had pre-ordered AVML, but was told I should have the veg pasta on the menu, which I did. Then they discovered that the AVML was in the oven, so I agreed to try it out. The AVML was awful! It was as bad as a hospital meal, bland, tasteless, half cooked and not at all AVML. More like kosher or post recuperation food served by nursing staff. The crew apologised for not having AUH landing cards on board – another example of Etihad Airways lack of organisation. Had it been a full flight, I am sure utter mix ups and confusion would have prevailed. The cabin crew did the minimum work and apart from the ambience of the new A380, this one really felt like a budget airline flight. Abu Dhabi to Delhi was a one-off experience! Long queues prevailed at the gate as staff was not able to handle the various combinations of passports, visas and baggage. The process was extremely slow with officials running around, and when we were bundled off the buses onto the aircraft, a compact A320, the cabin crew were not able to handle the seating of passengers, who were allowed to freely roam, change seats, bunch together, shout across the aisles at each other – in chaos. The cleanliness of the aircraft also left something to be desired as one could clearly see grease on windows and unprepared seat pockets (litter in torn literature, left over chewing gum etc.). My seat cushion kept on slipping away forwards, coming off the seat frame. Its Velcro had seen better days. The cover on the seat cushion also came off – a thoroughly uncomfortable situation throughout the flight. Once airborne, Etihad chose to serve dinner. The choice is clearly yours, but at 3:30am (AUH) (4:30am DEL), would it not have been better to have served a substantial snack or a light breakfast rather than dinner, serving which was an ordeal for all in cramped cabin space on this plane. My meal was once again comic. The Serbian hostess told me that they had run out of the veg option, so she ‘could offer me lamb or chicken’. She obviously had no idea! What was the point proudly distributing the menu? I was served flat Coca Cola out of the last remains of a bottle of Coke and she insisted it was ‘fresh’ and not ‘flat’ as it sure was. When I said that I had pre-ordered AVML, she said that might be in the front galley. When the trolley service finished ten minutes later, I was half way through rice salad, bread and Coke, the ‘special’ meal arrived. It was OVML and had clearly been opened previously – I thought it may have even been from another discarded tray! The most uninviting chow mein in it was clearly not my request. Putting Serbian and Swahili speaking staff on a AUH-DEL flight where passengers are likely to be 90% Indian, puts unnecessary stress on the crew despite their brave ‘plastic smiles’, and doesn’t help anyone on the flight.

Undoubtedly the worst ever check-in I have experienced anywhere in the world. Due to some technical issue relating to the check-in computers which was not conveyed to the passengers, it took 4.5 hours to check everyone in; the check-in procedure required pushing, shoving, shouting and general aggravation as no barriers were erected to facilitate fair queueing. I have never in my life watch passengers carrying their baggage over their head, barge to the front of the queue, shout, get angry and then achieve their desire in such an outrageous way. To see the Etihad staff shout and abuse some passengers was also totally unacceptable; quite clearly they could not cope. I was virtually the last person on the plane which was delayed for 2.5 hours and as such missed my onward connection in Abu Dhabi resulting in a 9 hour stay at the Airport Premier Inn and missing my first night in my Bangkok Hotel for which I paid around USD100 which has still not been reimbursed. The customer service has been dreadful since my emails and forms to the Etihad system were ignored. Eventually I received 20,000 air miles after writing to the boss and an apology. 20,000 airmiles are not the same as flying 20,000 miles in the air mind you.

Initially as a young and still growing airline it was understandable that there would be staff training issues and indeed they did improve over time. Not having flown on Etihad Airways for some time I was very disappointed and annoyed with the service - or rather lack of service on my recent flight. My husband was seated in the same row and I watched as he was greeted, offered a drink towel etc whilst service remained notable in my aisle only by its absence. Oddly the gentleman sitting across from me received the same level of service as my husband! Drinks towels nuts, more drink! Order for snack was taken and I placed my breakfast order. Food was below average standard. Drink was refilled by male steward from opposite aisle who seemed to be popping across to lend a hand. Morning arrived and I awake to the sound of food being served so I sat up and got ready to receive my food. Again I watched as my husband who's not ordered food awoke and placed an order which arrived in under 10 minutes. And still I waited as people around me were served but it felt like I was once again wearing my invisibility cloak. Finally in exasperation my husband called the steward who seemed to be in charge and asked if she could find out what had happened to my food. She went off and then came to explain that they had an inexperienced staff and apologised for the delay. She returned with my food shortly afterwards. It was as bad as the night before's offering. The female steward responsible for not bothering to offer me any service did come to apologise claiming that she'd misunderstood. I do not like complaining but this level of service is not acceptable. It is not my problem Etihad Airways staff are inexperienced. One would assume that they should receive the correct training before letting them loose on the paying public. And why did the man across from me get such attentive service when I was bypassed time and again until I had to voice a complaint? Does anyone bother to read these comments?

I refused this option and was told we would be put up in a hotel in Abu Dhabi. My daughter holds both Irish and Thai passports. She was travelling on the Thai passport but we needed a visa to leave the airport which we were told would not be a problem but eventually was.

My long name was not printed fully on the boarding pass but the staff said it was alright. Yet, the TSA refused to let me in and back I went to the counter - where I was made to wait in line again! Then, the staff wrote the missing characters of my name on the pass with a pen, signed it and said that should work, and it did. Why could this not have been done earlier? This might not have been new to them since long names are fairly common where I fly to! Past this, my disappointment got much bigger towards the end of the flight. Both ORD-AUH EY150 and AUH-DEL EY224 were delayed, because of which I missed my DEL-BLR Jet Airways 8 pm flight. Etihad had no single point of contact at DEL while Jet Airways refused to put us on the next flight without 'talking' to Etihad. Some guy, supposedly the Etihad staff at DEL (though he had an Air India name tag and no Etihad naming at the counter) wrote down our names and booking reference in a used piece of paper and disappeared for the next three hours. The stranded passengers were left at the Jet Airways counter. Jet Airways staff never cared anyway and left work as it got late! So much for the hyped Jet-Etihad partnership. Another group of stranded passengers found the absconding Etihad guy and his colleagues somewhere else in the terminal, informed us and then we were given connecting flights the next morning and a room at a hotel. Still, no proper arrangements were made to transport us to the hotel and every 4 passengers and all their baggage were dumped in a tiny midsize sedan to be taken to the hotel with multiple trips. There was more mix-up the next morning - Jet Airways said the bookings made by the Etihad guy were not confirmed, and refused to commit to us our flight timings.

One even put her hand up to a man's face when he aimed to clarify how many vegetarian meals his family had ordered. You would have thought he had directly insulted her. The staff seem a bit on edge and do the minimum in the department of friendly service. I must say how unacceptable it is that they serve warm drinks with no ice available, including hard liquor. People were getting hot sodas, and uniced straight whiskey. Why is there no ice? This is ridiculous. It was like this to and from Asia from North America. It seems to be a planned thing. Never order 'vegetarian' meals, they are the most flavorless, fatless meals ever. They believe vegetarian means 'vegan' and they gave me a meal of a bunch of pasta balls with a boring dry minimal tomato sauce and a bean salad that looked beautiful but was not fully cooked. I should have ordered ""Asian Vegetarian"" which would included cheese. On one flight that was only partially filled, the staff were kind enough to find an Asian vegetarian meal to replace the very bland tasteless 'vegetarian' (but really bland vegan) meal and that meal was delicious. They had no tv shows that weren't fiction dramas - I would have liked some talk shows or news shows to learn about current events in different countries.

I also cannot work out why Etihad only had four Arabic Mezze's onboard when the flight had 22 business class passengers onboard. The other choice was soup that most passengers rejected. Seventy percent of the meals were served by the more experienced crew member due to the other three crew members not really having either the energy or enthusiasm to carry out this particular task. The seating arrangement is tight due to a lot of wasted plastic in the cabin. The flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok started in a scrum like manner due to the Ground Crew not adhering to their announcement that certain seat numbers would be boarded accordingly. On board again a bit chaotic this time the right hand side of the cabin was working well whilst the left hand side was non-existent. Again the more experienced members on the right had to help the left side out that were again clearly lacking in experience. The seats designated for couples on 777-300 I would avoid due to both plastic sides restricting your movement, I would choose the outside ones even if you get bumped from time to time.

The Manager onboard made sure her crew provided a seamless business class service. The food was prepared to perfection and laid out exquisitely.  The seat was fine albeit a little bit tight.

The B777 (3 class) is another story - the seat width is ok if you take the window seat (not as claustrophobic as I read). The legroom was however limited by the support bar of the seat in front and it is not possible to fit your leg in between the bar and the side of the plane. This makes it rather uncomfortable for a 13h flight. Maybe an aisle seat would have been slightly better. Service from the staff was very good on the flights between BRU and AUH. Friendly with a smile, and frequent drinks service. Between AUH and MEL it was not as good but still okay. Food was good except for the breakfasts. It’s announced as a ‘light breakfast’ on the menu but it is heavy and sweet. IFE was ok but lacked comedy shows episodes.

The cabin crew were attentive and worried about me during this time and being a girl travelling alone, this was very comforting. On arriving in Abu Dhabi, I was taken to the medical assessment area where I was taken care of and it was recommended that I did not take my connecting flight.  I was taken to the Etihad Transfer Desk where ground staff organised a hotel for the night and booked me on the same flight 24 hours later, all complimentary. I had a great rest and was feeling much better to travel the next day. I wanted to say thank you for your assistance and care.

Everybody was herded into a small entrance with hundreds of other people in the same queue from other aircraft disembarking.

The A380 upper deck is quiet and the business suite is excellent, it is worth noting that if you are traveling as a couple you should book the forward facing centre seats as the other options will not allow you to sit together.

Some weeks ago I bought a ticket from Belgrade to Thailand and back via Etihad. I chose to travel with Etihad. Before I purchased the ticket I've checked with Etihad Airways about having 2 pieces of baggages 23kg each, using lounges on connecting airports and they confirmed all of that. When I bought the ticket I choose type of meals and seats for the flights. During my route out to Thailand everything was as expected without any problems. A few days before I was to fly back I received e-mail from Etihad reminding me about return flight, offering to check-in online and confirming my seats. My suffering started the moment I arrived at Bangkok Airport. The flight was operated by Jet Airways and they refused to check me in without paying extra for excess baggage (200USD) although they are Etihad partner. They didn't provide me seats and food that I had already confirmed in e-mail and was provided on my way to Thailand. Staff was rude. In Mumbai I thought it would be better since there is Etihad Airways staff but they were worse. Not helping with seats nor food, nor being polite. Also I was denied excess to lounge in Mumbai without a reason although I have right and I confirmed that before buying ticket. Finally I thought in Abu Dhabi everything will be resolved but the headquarters are the worst. There was an employee yelling at me for their mistakes! It's been a month and no resolution.  They say they will refund me money but it's been a month and they didn't even asked for my bank account number. They replied to me only after I shared my experience online and when I found their CEO's e-mail and included him in correspondence. On every step of my trip there was a problem. My last flight back home was Air Serbia so I was relieved because I am their frequent flyer and that is my national airline, (unfortunately owned by Etihad Airways) but they still have old standards of hospitality and good service - unlike Etihad.

I know that still leaves me ample time to transfer, but you usually need more time at HKG because of how far terminals and gates are.

We often choose to fly out of Abu Dhabi rather than Dubai, where we live because EY provide a convenient two way limo service and we find Abu Dhabi Airport less stressful than Dubai. It's usually a B777 which is fine. The flight was fine. Late push back because of arrival scheduling and the usual 1-2-1 offset seating in Business Class. If you are travelling alone it's best to go for the odd numbered rows (5,7,9 etc) which are more private window seats rather than the aisle focused even numbered seats (6,8 etc). Likewise, if you are with a partner and you want to be together, go for the odd row numbered central seats which are actually together. The usual pretty good cabin crew and the Cabin Manager was efficient. The IFE is pretty poor - that's one element that lets them down and the food was a bit cold to the table but maybe that was my fault for asking for a short delay in serving. The onboard phone service was a bit hit and miss as usual. I can't help the impression that the overall product offering in Business Class is not what it used to be, probably to save costs. Poor content but pretty bag amenity kits, no pyjamas, no little flowers in their vases, no cologne in the bathrooms etc. It seems that the intention is to provide a ""premium economy"" experience rather than a downgraded first class but I suppose that is what happens when an airline starts to cut costs.

After all this was done, once you pass security and are about to board the flight, there is an Etihad rep standing there with a weighing machine to weigh your hand baggage again. There were so many upset customers, 1 passenger had reshuffled things between her purse and hand baggage and the weight went up. She was asked to put items back in her purse so her hand carry weight was 7kgs - it didn't make any sense.

On the outward first leg my entertainment system didn't work - no great problem, wouldn't complain, brought it to the attention of cabin crew who said they'd reset it but never checked. On the next leg our luggage was left behind at Abu Dhabi - apparently a regular occurrence. I understand that this is an occupational hazard of flying. We had it delivered 24 hours later having been given three different times for its delivery to our private address. On the first leg of the return journey I was trapped in a seat which was unable to recline, causing acute discomfort and backache. This was what prompted me to complain in the first instance. I received a holding reply then a request for further information and now heard nothing for eight days in response to that information being sent. Cabin and ground crew were generally pleasant and reasonably efficient but I agree with others that the meals are pretty poor.

The seat could not recline and rendering the seat being worse for comfort than an economy seat but cost a lot of money. It felt like sitting in an emergency door exit economy class seat but could not recline. Despite the crew’s attempt to fix the seat before and after the meal they could not fix it. I expected to be offered a different seat or  upgraded to  first class given that all business class seats were not available but nothing was done despite my complaint. Ittook the crew nearly four hours after take off to serve the main course, which was more than half of my flight duration where I had planned to have to a good long hour of sleep after the meal. There are also minor points such as the use of buses to transfer passengers from the gate to the plane in AUH. Whilst I have been offered by the ground team in AUH a compensation of 15,000 Etihad miles, which I did think it was adequate for my troubles. I subsequently made a written complaint to ensure that my inbound leg of the trip would be trouble free, and I had expected to hear further assurance prior to my inbound flights to BKK, (which was a week later), but I received nothing, other than an email that the airline would investigate and get back. The airline did not take my complaint seriously and I could not believe it that I was assigned to the exact same seat with the outbound flight that had the problem on a similar aircraft that I have made a complaint, I was very upset fearing that it might be the exact same aircraft and I had to face the same problem all over again (a good evidence of the airline ignorance to my complaint) and to make it worst, one of my travelling group, had the same issue with her seat that I had on the outbound trip and could not recline at all. Fortunately the crew eventually could fix it.  I followed up again a few weeks after the trip. They offered me the total of 20,000 miles which cannot even upgrade me from economy to business class on the same route. I  asked for the equivalent mileages (which might not guarantee that I can upgrade my seat as the mileage upgrade is subject to quota and availability, not to mention that if I choose to use the miles I will have to pay for another flight to the airline that I do not want to fly with again). I wouldn't ask for any complimentary mileage if I had gotten a properly functioning seat that I had paid a lot of money for!

What on earth possessed Etihad to squeeze 10 seats across their 777s? Many airlines (Thai, Singapore etc) have 9 across, in a 3-3-3 configuration. The 10th seat on Etihad makes for a very narrow seat indeed. The flight itself was ok. Good meal, IFE had a reasonable selection. This flight was operated using a Jet Airways 777, which has an identical seating configuration to Etihad. Cabin crew helpful and friendly, and especially good with our young daughter who was very tired. If only Etihad didn't have those ridiculously narrow seats.

The Etihad flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi wasn't great either, cabin crew seemed to be stressed out and unsmiling. Drinks were hard to come by, food portion size was small and not every option available. They ran out of vegeterian food. When we tried to order a veggie meal online beforehand it didn't work. When we booked we didn't even know that half of the flights would be operated by Air Berlin, because Etihad sells them as Etihad flights. So sad that we went for Etihad as there were other options for the same price when we booked in the first place. Stay away from Etihad and Air Berlin! ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Check in was swift and the Radisson lounge is acceptable for an airport which is Tribhuvan Itnl. The equipment used was a narrow body so the J class seats were no better than long haul premium economy class. The duration of the flight is 4.45 hrs so a wide body with better seats and F&B service is being missed.

Courteous and efficient cabin staff. Food good with a choice of three main courses, and complimentary drinks. Disappointing seats by long haul economy standards. Ten across (3-4-3) seats are uncomfortably narrow with a very modest seat pitch.. I am six feet tall and my knees pressed into the back of the seat in front throughout the journey. One other weakness, lengthy announcements, for example before take-off and after landing, appeared to be well paced and clear in Arabic; in English they were very staccato to the point of being unintelligible.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,June 2016,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,ZRH to DEL via AUH,2.0,"Zurich to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. When I checked in at Zurich airport, I was not given my 2nd boarding pass i.e. from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi. On asking I was told you are on priority and will be given the boarding pass at Abu Dhabi airport. This was a bit strange but I left it. On reaching Abu Dhabi airport, I approached the Transfer Desk at the arrivals terminal. I had wait for 15-20 minutes before my turn came. This was as bad as checking in all over again. But had no choice. When I finally reached the counter and presented my papers, I was told that the flight was full and there are no seats. I was surprised. I had a confirmed seat in my hand but no seat. My flight was scheduled to leave Abu Dhabi at 10:00 pm and it was around 7:45 pm. The counter guy made a call and after a long time told me that he can put me on a flight next day after noon at 2:00 pm which was 16 hours after my scheduled flight. When I told him that was too late, he made me wait for more time and finally offered to put me on a flight to Mumbai and then from there to New Delhi - so I would again reach New Delhi late afternoon the next day. This was appalling. In the meantime I realised that all the counters at the transfer desk had the same problem. Etihad had overbooked all flights and passengers were being harassed. People were going to Egypt or Australia or Hyderabad. There were other flights during the night and early morning from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi but Etihad had overbooked all and I could not get a seat on any flight. Finally the counter guy told me that they could not help me and I should go to transfer desk on terminal 1. By this time the airport security area through which I had to pass to go to Terminal 1 had become extremely crowded. There was no air conditioning.  No queue and total chaos. With great difficulty, I managed to pass through that and reached the Transfer Desk. The guy at the counter quickly offered me a seat on a 2:55 am flight, a meal voucher and 200$ compensation. I quickly accepted the deal. But now the set in the surprise: 200$ voucher could be used only on Etihad Airways travel. Not much use if I did not spend another 1000$ first to book an Etihad airways ticket. After handing over the above voucher the guy came up with the bomber that there are no seats on the 2:55 am flight and he can only put me on the 2:50 pm flight. This was crazy. Since then I have tried my level best, spoke to the supervisor and Etihad personnel on phone. Everyone promised the best but did not deliver anything. And here I am sitting in the lounge. They haven't even provided me with a hotel voucher so that at least I can get some much needed rest. If this is called first class service than what can be more pathetic is anybody's guess. Anybody planning to travel Etihad - please think twice. It's highly possible that you will get stranded like me.",Business,1.0,nan

Easy transfer in Abu Dhabi, no queues but the place was packed. Flight to Edinburgh was fine though breakfast was below average. In Edinburgh all priority bags were off last, from exiting the aircraft to getting bags was 50 mins.

This last trip to Abu Dhabi was without doubt the worst. Settled in, had a drink while waiting to take off and gave the chef my meal order. 2 hours from landing and a 13 hour flight, no food, no drinks and even my potato chips were removed from my cabin! I was offered no bedding, and only had a neck cushion and rug which became unbearable. Asked where my meal was and told that nothing could be served as the chef was on his break - thought it was dining on demand? I couldn't have breakfast because I didn't order any! Went to economy looking for food, but it was full. Found a seat at the back of business and sat there for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. I was at least given a pillow and a blanket! Was offered a steak sandwich 1/2 an hour before landing and that was all I got all trip. When I arrived at Abu Dhabi airport, I went to the lounge and refused to leave until management addressed my concerns. After about an hour and a half a manager came and promised me the world of empty promises! Asked my travel agent to book the return flight in Business as First was so bad, only to be told it would cost me $2,000 to downgrade. Email after email was getting me no where, so went on facebook, and Etihad then blocked me and removed my posts. ",Business,1.0,2.0
A380 and A340,Economy Class,1.0,January 2016,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,SYD to AMS via AUH,1.0," |  To begin this review, it must be noted I am a tall guy, measuring in at 202 cm/6ft 8in and 130 kg. Travelling out, comfort: Travelling from Amsterdam to Sydney, with a short lay over in Abu Dhabi, we were on two A340-500's. The leg room wasn't ideal, but it was doable. Service: The servicing staff was ok. Nothing fancy, but okay. At the end of the flight, they offer vouchers for their air-miles service, and it is clear that the stewards/desses are paid extra if they can sign on new people to the air-miles scheme. It was a little intimidating. Travelling home, comfort: Travelling Sydney to Abu Dhabi, we found ourselves once again on an A380-800. The leg room was appalling. My girlfriend at 173 cm was under pressure from the legroom. But there was simply no way for me to fit in those seats. Add to that, that my seat couldn't extend back, which meant I was stuck between the reclined seat in front of me and my own seat. I could literally see the forehead of the guy in front of me. We were told stories of how the legroom on the A380 is larger than normal. But the legroom on the A340 is better by at least 5 cm. During our flight, my entertainment system broke down, and it took 50 minutes to bring it back online, and no one seemed to understand the problem or offer a solution better than ""we have to restart the system - we dont know how long it will take"". If this didn't make us feel like cattle, the patronising crew, that seemed almost forced to serve us drinks, did. Etihad clearly caters for the wealthy with their first class videos, that everyone gets to see before takeoff. In the end, Etihad made us feel like cattle, like never before.

The return journey mirrored the outward trip. The leg between Perth and Abu Dhabi outward and Abu Dhabi to Perth inward was with Etihad Airways who codeshare with KLM / Air France. On the outward bound we chose to have dinner (we took off shortly after 5pm) at 7pm but when the time came we were told that the food had largely run out and all that remained was some soup. This was accepted in our stride as sometimes even with the best of intentions things can go wrong. However the service by Flight Attendants on this leg was very ordinary. On the way return journey (Abu Dhabi to Perth) we came off a KLM Boeing 787 where the service by the Flight Attendants was simply superb and then boarded the Etihad Boeing 787 for the last leg home. The difference in standard of service in the Business Class cabin between KLM and Etihad was like chalk and cheese. The Etihad cabin crew were all but invisible. I finally gave up waiting for a meal to be brought around and went to sleep. Whilst the Etihad aircraft was new, clean and comfortable the standard of the cabin crew was probably the worst I have ever encountered. Where the Flight Attendants managed to hide during the trip is a mystery. To say that Etihad Flight Attendants are not on the same page as Singapore, KLM, Air France, Emirates or Qantas is an understatement. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0

I had taken same airways from Cochin to Chicago with the same two bags and did not have a problem. Then how can they deny my bags when I am flying back in the same carrier.  The lady in the counter was not even ready to consider our case threatening us that if we don't check in by 1155 flight will go and if we have to take bags we need to pay additional money. There was a delay of more than one hour for take off. The food onboard was horrible with very less choice. For a thirteen hour flight they served a lunch, a bag of pretzels, a bun and a vegetarian light meal with no choices. We did not receive all four bags after reaching Kochi. If they want only first and business class passengers to fly with them then they should stop the economy class. Regarding in-flight entertainment the less said better it is.

The check-in is easy, the lounge is lovely, the service onboard is wonderful and then arrival procedures are always simple. I always travel in Business Class and love the seats and layout on the A380. I was in seat 16F on this occasion as I was travelling with my Mum, who was is 16E. These seats are perfect for people travelling together as you can push the partition down and chat. But if you are travelling on your own, its just as easy to press a button and put the partition up, so you have privacy. Onboard the IFE is great, the large tv is awesome and the choice is superb. So many movies to watch. I also love the fact that you can eat whenever you want. You do not have to wait for the cabin crew to tell you when to eat. The food onboard was impeccable. I had lentil soup and crusty bread, followed by fillet of beef with fondant potato, followed by cheese and biscuits. All washed down with an amaretti. Perfect. Sleep is easy as well, as the fully flat bed is comfy and I was able to get about 3 hours sleep. The cabin crew are lovely. So smiling and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Always coming to ask if I needed anything or simply if I was ok. The only fly in the ointment I suppose is luggage handling as for the third time in a row, my cases did not make it on the flight from Abu Dhabi back to Muscat. I was however updated regularly as to where they were and they arrived the next day. Wifi can be a bit sketchy at times. I would say that it doesn't work more often than it does work.

We took the middle seats as we're travelling together, seats are front and back-facing, odd rows are front-facing. Front-facing seats are also set close together, so if you're travelling alone, choose either a single seat or a back-facing seat to avoid sitting too close to a stranger. Seats slid down to a very comfortable bed - some business class seats slide into a somewhat claustrophobic space for your feet, but I didn't feel it with the Business Class Studio. Pillow and comforter were great and I had a good sleep on a 6+ hour flight. Food service was prompt and friendly, attention to detail by the steward/stewardess was very good. Food itself was excellent - had a gnocchi dish that could have been served right out of an Italian restaurant kitchen. The magic kind of ends when you land at Abu Dhabi airport and realise that you are not parked at a gate, and you actually have to go down the portable steps into a bus that drives you for another 15 minutes before pulling up at the terminal. Although we did get a 'business class bus' (complete with leather seats) for one of the legs, it's not a great experience after being on the 787. Next leg was on the A330 on the older Business Class seat. Much narrower seat but can't say that I was a lot less comfortable - obviously if given a choice, I would have picked the 787 Business Class Studio over this seat!). Still had a good sleep and a good breakfast, other than the fact that the plane did not have running water on board (they had bottles of water sitting in the toilets, thankfully the toilet did flush). They couldn't serve hot drinks on board without running water, so everyone had to live with juices and water for breakfast. The Business Class Lounge at Terminal 3 had the spa and shave service - my husband got a hot shave for US$15 and was pleased with the result. I tried to book a spa treatment but they were full for the hour - additionally, they must have removed the 15 minutes complimentary treatment for Business Class passengers (which I had read about prior to our trip) because the notice at the spa only mentioned First Class passengers receiving the complimentary treatment. Having read some horrible reviews of missing/delayed luggage, we're happy our three checked-in bags arrived safely on the way out and on the way back. However, we did experience flight delays on our flights out and back to Singapore - on our flight out from Abu Dhabi, the airport baggage tracking system broke down and all flights were grounded because all baggage couldn't be traced. Flight delayed by about 1.5 hours. On the way back to Singapore from Abu Dhabi, air traffic was apparently too heavy for us to leave on time. Flight delayed by about 1 hour.

The IFE on Etihad Airways does not compare with Emirates or Qatar Airways who both have a much larger collection, but this does not mean it is lacking or the selection is not up to date - I was comparing them to the best of the best. The food was a very good selection and you set the time and they will deliver the portions are generous too, all cabin staff were very attentive and introduced themselves to the passengers by name and were prompt if called.

Connecting staff in the airport tried to be helpful, but they tell lies in order to get rid of customers. The worst, they appeared to differentiate customers with different passports. For the same connection to Frankfurt, they gave hotel rooms inside airport to passengers with German passports. When it came to our turn, they asked us what are our passport countries, mine is Vietnamese and my husband is Greek. So he said he would give hotel voucher for my husband to stay in a hotel outside of the airport, while giving me a lounge voucher to stay inside. We excused him that we are husband and wife so it's very inconvenient to stay apart. He apologized that he didn't know we are couple!  We asked him if he can give us a hotel room inside the airport, he said its already full. My husband asked him since we have to take the train from Frankfurt to go to Berlin, and we may miss it, if he could connect us to fly directly to Berlin instead of Frankfurt. He said there was only one flight per day, which we might have to wait 24 hours, because the flight just left. Later we found there was a flight with Air Berlin (their partner) to fly to Berlin the next morning. I talked with some Vietnamese passengers inside the airport, who were on the same flight with me from Ho Chi Minh City, they connected to fly to Switzerland and other locations. The connecting staff gave them only meal vouchers, not even access to lounge like me. I told them they could ask for lounge or even hotel. But they didn't want.

Its actually by far the most superior economy product I've experienced. The aircraft is beautiful from the inside out with mesmerizing mood lights and brown and beige colors filling the cabin. I was looking forward to trying out their A380 and it didn't disappoint. The IFE on the A380 is fantastic with good responsive touch, nice camera views and a user friendly interface. On the second leg it was a Boeing 777, probably not that fancy as the A380 but was better than a lot of airlines. I do believe the 10 abreast seating gets a bit cramped but on a short haul it was fine with me.

In flight the crew were one of the grumpiest I have seen, especially the chief steward who definitely had forgotten to smile or speak properly leave alone being efficient.

The champagne was warm and of low quality, wines so-so and the food offering more akin to economy standard, and small portions at that.

IFE was good but I preferred to take advantage of the lie-flat bed instead and slept during most of the flight.

For two entire 8 hour flights I could feel passenger behind me kicking due to seat layout. When I lay flat, person behind has feet next to my head. With feet on ottoman in front, whenever passenger in front moves, I am shaken in my seat. Result was almost no sleep. Seat also barely long enough for me at 6 feet tall. First flight from Hong Kong the cabin crew very cold and uninterested. Second flight AUH-EDI, entire family clearly bumped up from economy replete with crying newborn baby.  I was surrounded by them. Man behind me kicked my seat the whole flight, snored loudly and farted repeatedly which continually wafted its way toward me. Baby cried nonstop. Same family also held up the biz class bus to the remotely parked aircraft. Result = Biz pax on the apron waiting in the bus while economy boarded first. And throughout the night the cabin crew checked on me zero times despite clearly being awake. Received one meal of breakfast. No respect for people paying top dollar to fly in comfort by bumping up economy pax. This is a joke of a business class. I am flying the same circus on the return leg next week.

The seats are wider but very firm and I could only sleep laying sideways. The cabin service is nice but cannot be compared to Cathay or Singapore or even Garuda and Etihad needs to work on this. The food choice was wide and since I was in the Far East for over a month I choose the Gnnochi to change my palate, but it was an awful choice and I could not even have two mouthfuls. I am not going to blame Etihad for this, as there were safer choices of noodles or biryani but I decided to be adventurous! The flight was short as we had a strong tailwind.

At Abu Dhabi when leaving the Bus into the arrival Hall it was so crowded that we could not walk inside. I noticed that it was the queue to security check, it took more than 1h to get through. On arrival to SGN the pilot announced that due to thunderstorm we would need to circle some time before we could land. After a while the pilot made an attempt to land, however aborted it again. Passengers were not informed about following step for 1hr. On the screen we could see that we were flying back, we finally landed in Pattaya airport which is 90 min way. After waiting for 1h on the runway the crew finally informed us that we would need to stay overnight and would continue the following day. I finally arrived in SGN with a near 24h delay. I do have understanding for security of all passengers, I wonder why the pilot took decision of re-routing to another country. I later learned that 10 other planes could not land on time due to weather, but none of them had to re-route. They all landed safely that evening with a slight delay. At the airport the waiting persons were also not informed about this re-routing and were left without any information about this flight. There was not a single word of apology of the pilot nor the crew.  On the way back (SGN to FRA) at the check-in counter in Saigon my luggage had a weight of 26kg, 3kg more than allowed.  The girl at the check-in insisted that I had to open my luggage, remove 3kg and store in my hand luggage.  I tried to explain to the check-in person that it would not make the plane heavier if I repack the 3kg from my check-in luggage to the hand luggage. and since it was rather inconvenient to open the luggage at the check in counter and re-pack all with a long cue behind me, I asked her if she could check-in my luggage with the 26kg. The lady was unfriendly, I understand that she is not Etihad staff, but a hired ground staff from the airport.  She finally left me with two options : either repack or go to the other counter to pay 100$+ for the overweight, otherwise she would refuse the check-in for me. ",Business,1.0,1.0

Hyderabad check-in was super smooth, and as our intended carry-ons were way heavier than the allowed 7 kgs, we checked in all bags. We were concerned about missing baggage as we would leave Venice in 36 hours to go on a cruise, and any missed baggage would probably not make it to us. Thankfully, all bags arrived intact at Venice. The flight to Abu Dhabi was an A320. Seats were standard, entertainment had many options, including fairly recent movies. Kids selection was decent. The food was standard, but service was outstanding, with cabin crew going out of their way to make the kids comfortable. They got some extra goodies. Abu Dhabi was better than the reviews suggest. Only thing was that there really was a long bus drive to terminal 1, and a longish walk - 10-15 minutes to get to terminal 3, including a security check. But if you are okay walking a bit and have atleast an hour and half between flights, you should be ok. The shopping is ok. The main atrium is a bit crowded but the gates had enough seating. We found the toilets free and clean. The Abu Dhabi to Venice flight was comfy as it was practically empty.  As a result, adults slept flat on the 4 seats in the middle while the kids slept on the 2 side seats. Very comfortable night, restful sleep. The food was ok. Crew was again very efficient.

I had been looking forward to trying their much hyped Business Studio on the A380 from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. What a let down! The term ""studio"" is purely marketing hype. The seat is very similar to the Emirates A380 business seat although way too firm and lacking the personal mini bar. The TV screen also seemed a little smaller than Emirates and it just didn't have the same luxury feel. The biggest let down of the flight was the catering. When I saw the menu I thought they had given out the economy class one by mistake. The only starter on offer was a bland fattoush salad and the only dessert a rather tired red velvet cake. There was a choice of 2 mains, a lamb kebab (tasty enough) and a vegetarian curry. Shame on Etihad for serving such a poor business class meal. The other big let down is the on-board lounge, which is basically just a round table next to the galley, seating at most 6 people. Compared to the bar onboard Emirates A380 fleet, this is poor.

What's really bad about IFE is that it doesn't turn on until like 30 mins after take off, and it shuts down well over 30mins before landing. It's 2016, I thought airlines could manage better. What was also below expectation was the flight attendants. The AUH to MUC leg was the best, I felt like attendants were happy and cheered up, but the others I felt like I shouldn't bother them for anything, they just don't smile.

To be fair, as observed previously, all the Middle East airlines love the bus. Notwithstanding, on-time departure and arrival in both directions. Seating in the cheap seats I found to be cramped compared to the Chinese domestic airlines I later experienced, and the 330s are definitely showing their age. I'm not liking Etihad's practice of throwing out my 'special meal' (vegetarian) - which was fine - as if I and others have some form of disease therefore not worthy of a drink with our meal.

All flights departed on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Cabin service friendly, efficient, and helpful. Quality of food above average. In flight entertainment offers more than enough options. Overall a very positive experience, and one needs to consider the price of the ticket. For around EUR 500 return you can't expect business class service, and any review must take this into account. Flown business class on Etihad before, and that is a different story altogether (in a positive meaning). Just one negative remark. On the return flight from FRA to JNB we exceeded the luggage weight limit by 1.5 kgs between the two of us (i.e. 750 grams each!), and the check in clerk forced us to to unpack two books and transfer them to our hand luggage. I agree that there must be a limit, but a little bit of leverage would really be appreciated. On the other side, when you see what some passengers bring on board as hand luggage, you wonder how they got away with that.

Flight crew extremely bored upon boarding, no welcome, etc. I am of average size (1.75m - 75kg) and usually do not complain, but the size of the seating space is a joke for a 13h flight. I did the similar distance from Brisbane to Doha or Dubai, but never felt that locked into a seat. The seat rows are that narrow, that you can't appreciate the decent screen as it is too big for the distance you have. So watching movies is not really enjoyable. Reclining and sleeping is not really doable. Food quality is definitely not more than average and quantity is not enough. IFE with a big and good screen, average selection of movies. Wifi OK. Crew were bored and not particularly helpful, poured beer over my pants and instead of saying sorry I was explained why it happened. Toilet cleanliness for the amount of passengers quite good.

A380,Economy Class,3.0,September 2016,4.0,1.0,4.0,no,RUH to LHR via AUH,3.0," |  Riyadh to London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. First leg of the journey was with FlyNas (Riyadh to Abu Dhabi) chartered by Etihad which arrived 50 minutes late and resulted in me missing the second leg to London, I was forced to wait in the airport for nearly 5 hours for an issue that was not my own. I arranged to sit at the front of the economy section / took no 'hold' luggage and arrived at the airport in Riyadh 3 hours early all just to be on the safe side. The irony is that the initial delay in Riyadh was down to a passenger clearing security! Selling flights to London with a 1hr transfer time at Abu Dhabi is nothing short of irresponsible, and it’s the passenger who has to suffer. The transfer desk in Abu Dhabi was appalling with a scripted comment and a voucher to stay in a hotel which when you consider the transfer to the hotel and back and the need to attend the airport two hours before takeoff, the whole thing was nothing short of a waste of time. The return trip from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was marginally better although late again. Where I and fellow travelers were expected to run through the terminal, scan our bags at the security point and join the bus for the plane connection with just 5 minutes to spare - do Etihad really expect their customers to worry whether they will arrive on the date or somewhere near the time printed on the ticket, experience the added anxiety of wondering whether their late arrival flight will make the stand in time for a sprint to the aircraft or suffer the indignation let alone the sheer inconvenience of a significant wait. Direct flights only people or you may get burnt - you have been warned. Thanks Etihad - not impressed.",Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0

Abu Dhabi to London on the A380, the studio seating is fantastic and slept most of the way with breakfast served 1 hour as requested before arrival. We didn't eat after takeoff as we ate in the lounge before the flight. Fast track service meant I was out of the airport with luggage and in the chauffeur car within 30 minutes. Every time I fly Etihad my luggage is coming off the belt as I arrive. Return was more of the same with no problems and slept from London to Abu Dhabi (A380) since it was the night flight with breakfast before arrival. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok (777) was great.

I will confine my comments to the Abu Dhabi to Melbourne leg of my journey - 13 horrible hours. This was on the A380. I had an economy seat which was an extremely narrow 3-4-3 configuration. When the seats in front of you recline, there is barely enough room to get in or out of the row - extremely claustrophobic. Also not enough toilets - there was always a queue. I was given the same sub-standard vegetarian meal twice through out the journey. They had a far better vegetarian selection on the main menu which they could have set aside for me.

This review is not so much about the flight but more about the rudeness and lack of service. As a business class flyer you pay a premium for the little things such as seats, chauffeur pickup and service. Our experience so far has been far from what we thought Etihad would deliver. In Singapore the allocated pickup time for the chauffeur was not suitable so we spent time calling and explaining this and requesting another time. We understood that this had been done and waited the following day for the car, which never arrived as it was not changed as per the conversation we had, so we had to make our own way to the airport. The flight from Singapore to Abu Dhabi was fine but the staff were not friendly. The staff and food from Abu Dhabi to Rome was much better and pleasant. In Venice, we called Etihad to book the chauffeur service and were told it by their staff to call Alitalia as it was a Alitalia flight even though we booked and paid through Etihad, it is an EY flight number, plane and ticket. The care factor of the staff member was zero. We then had to call Alitalia. After four separate conversations and Alitalia confirming the water taxi on a return phone call, we have now been advised by the external company that we have a car booked. We explained it is Venice and we need a water taxi and that this was confirmed by Alitalia staff to be told by the external chauffeur company that we have to pay our own way to a designated meeting place on land to take a car. Numerous emails later and lots of time later, we are now left with no chauffeur service and each company blaming each other. If this is the business class service you get with Etihad then is it any wonder people choose to fly their competitors. We are Platinum and Platinum Plus flyers and travel constantly and wanted to experience Etihad. But we have been so disappointed in Etihad's service and the extra costs we have incurred. When a service is advertised as part of a ticket price and is listed on their and/their partners websites it should be delivered.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

The reason was it was not heated. They did not provide blankets when asked at the start of the flight as the crew informed me that the temperature was ok and if I need it later they would give them then. When I asked later, they said they had ran out of blankets. The kids bags that they give were not given to my kids despite being asked several times. Being a frequent traveler, my kids know they get a bag and expect one (spoilt I know). I got the bag only when I purchased a duty free item which when checked the very next day at Yas mall was cheaper. When I contacted the airline all they said was sorry and they will checking with the purchasing team. The ground staff in Abu Dhabi are good.

No company could go further out of its way to breathlessly fawn over its business and first class passengers whilst utterly disregarding its other paying passengers other than to force-feed them constant marketing about how luxurious and amazing Etihad can be, if you're not a pauper in economy. Furthermore, they outsource major parts of long, international flights to low-cost airline partners to save money, meaning that you pay for a supposedly premium airline, but spend over 8 hours of your flight crammed onto a short-haul, low-cost airline plane.

We have just returned from a week in Abu Dhabi. This is the first (and last time) we have used this airline. Our six year old son was with us as this was a family holiday.  Etihad oversold the flight, so when we arrived 2.5 hours before take-off to find we only had 3 of the 4 seats we had paid for we were a little unhappy. We had pre-reserved seats but as they had also changed the aircraft this reservation didn't stand. The manner in which they dealt with it was appalling. They have a designated ""Rebooking Desk"" adjacent to the check in at Abu Dhabi which may suggest they do this a lot? Their response (including their senior supervisor) was ""sorry there aren't enough seats"". I’ve never posted a poor review before. In fact I've just left the Westin Abu Dhabi a 5 star review as they were superb. Etihad unfortunately are at the other end of the scale. They are so much smaller than Emirates (who we've flown with 40+ times) so don't have many flights operating. They said ""we are confident we can get you on the 2.30am flight"". Not ideal to hang around the airport for 14 hours then fly all night with a 6 year old. No apology was made. They made no suggestion on how they could resolve the issue or help it was very simply just tough luck. I have experienced overbooking in the US when travelling with work. Quality airlines hold the check in process then ask passengers if they are willing to travel on a later flight or codeshare. Offering upgrades and compensation. Etihad don’t even offer an apology. They won't compensate you (other than a voucher that can only be redeemed with Etihad). If accommodation is needed (as they operate so few flights) they select where you stay - and there are onsite airport hotels which I suspect aren't great so be warned. OK - then on board. The flights were also both awful. Outbound from London they decided to wait 3 hours before serving dinner (we took off at 20.45)! This meant they woke 1/2 of the plane up as they served it at midnight (3am Abu Dhabi time). They then let everyone go back to steep, then 1.5 hours later turned the lights? This was still 2 hours before landing. None of our party of 4 ate the food. It was dreadful. The inflight entertainment is very, very poor compared with leading airlines. There are limited films and many are very old. The children's selection is poor too. I'm unsure why the inflight entertainment doesn't start until 1/2 hour after take-off (once you start cruising) and they turn it off before starting the descent. The two times when you really need something to focus on are take-off & landing. Again other airlines allow this to run for the entire time you are seated. Why can't Etihad? For some reason they have opted to use wider than normal trolleys. The consequence is that if you have an aisle seat in economy you are likely to get hit by the trolley quite often. As they barely fit down the aisle. I was hit 3 times on the return flight. Never did the steward say sorry. This seems to be Etihads policy. As we taxi’d across to the stand at LHR I got a quote for a taxi from Dubai to Abu Dhabi. It’s circa 1 hour drive at £100. Next time we go to Abu Dhabi we will fly into Dubai and get a taxis.

But the service of the FAs often does not follow the kind of service-oriented profile the airline aims to put forward. I am often tempted to go back to other competing airlines due to this. The FAs projects a feeling of boredom with their jobs and and an obvious lack of passion. In my recent flight for which this review is anchored, service was no more than okay.

Etihad needs to do a better job to incentivize their staff to encourage them to perform better, keep passengers satisfied and build their frequent flyer base. If not, this will ultimately lead to their demise in a currently challenging market that is seeing even the best airlines making huge losses. The dismal service is ironically more apparent on business class and first class flights rather than economy class. Aside from the service, the range of beverages have taken a drastic turn for the worse, with Johnny Walker being left out of the menu and San Pellegrino sparkling water being swapped with a local cheaper brand 'Al Ain' water as part of an obvious budget cut (even on First Class).

Really dated and I almost couldn't fit down the aisle (I am a size 10 woman) with my handbag it was so narrow. There was no organisation from staff during boarding. Zones were called too close together which caused busy queues and confusion. The flight itself was smooth however the food was absolutely terrible and even my partner who will eat anything could not finish.  The service was also below average. There was one notable flight attendant who had a smile on her face. The others were distant, providing no customer service to the passengers, no smiles or anything. They were even leaning over passengers in the middle section of seats to reach another air hostess because they had ran out of items. Too busy talking between themselves to care for the customers. On our second flight from Abu Dhabi to Heathrow we were about to take off and a man stumbled on and plonked himself in the spare seat next to us. He was drunk and I was shocked they would even let him on the flight in his state however I have a feeling the stairs had been taken away and it was more hassle to remove him. As the plane was taking off and accelerating (no exaggeration!) he was falling into the aisle and crawling to the toilet at the bag of the aircraft to be sick. He moved seats several times as he couldn't remember where he was. That was pure luck however the reaction of the staff was terrible. They obviously helped the drunk passenger however no apology was made to us for the inconvenience or the smell. Not a single acknowledgement. We didn't want an upgrade or anything but a simple smile and a sorry would have been nice. I was shocked that for an airline supposedly up there with Emirates this was our experience.

However, we were quite disappointed with the on board service. In the Abu Dhabi flight to São Paulo there were 3 options in the dinner menu: lamb with Indian rice, chicken and a choice of pasta (gnocchi). We were in row 24 and when the service reached our seats, there was only the lamb option, all the others were already over. Most of the passengers around us would also like another option, other than the lamb, the only one available. The crew politely told us that due to the profile of the passengers, the menu had been constructed as having lamb as the preferred option. I believe that in flight to Brazil, the menu profile should be improved. Following meals included a frozen chicken sandwich, a pack of sliced apples and a snack of sweet popcorn. Light dinner at the end of the flight had one option only: chicken with penne. There were no small snacks available during a 15 hours flight. The lack of vegetarian options for those on board, came to my attention, since some people in row 23 were out of meals at the final light dinner. Onboard service is incompatible with the company's reputation.

The plane is old, with no inseat power, and is configured in the herringbone pattern which I find claustrophobic and does not allow you to converse with your travelling companion. In addition, Etihad entertainment offering does not compare with that of Singapore, Emirates or Cathay. ",Business,3.0,1.0
A330,Business Class,3.0,November 2016,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,AUH to MAN,3.0," |  Abu Dhabi to Manchester. A very average business class flight on Etihad. The A330 had a dated look and the business cabin feels cramped when its busy, as was the case on this flight to Manchester. All seats feel narrow but aisle seats are to be avoided as aisles are very narrow and you are likely to bumped by everyone who walks past. The crew were ok, not particularly warm or friendly and there was no personalized greeting from the purser or cabin manager. Food was okay. Better than on the flights to Asia, but with apparent cost cutting from previous standards. The tomato soup tasted like tinned and the beef cheek was ok, but not business class standard. The supposedly ""ripe boutique cheeses"" were a joke. A wedge of tasteless cheddar and very unripe and flavourless brie. I had a steak sandwich later which was ruined by a huge piece of gristle which I almost choked on. Etihad don't have separate boarding for business class passengers so you have to queue up in the airbridge with everyone else. On a positive note the flight departed on time and arrived early, helped by a heavily padded schedule. In both hard and soft product Etihad lags a long way behind Qatar Airways and Emirates with the food particularly in need of improvement. Not worth paying for unless you can get a free upgrade or use miles.",Business,2.0,1.0

A cramped old narrow bodied A320 was deployed on the Cairo-Abu Dhabi sector. I had paid extra for an exit row seat but felt cheated as it only gave me an extra inch or so. Cost cutting was evident as Etihad have cut back on all the touches one would expect from a decent airline. No menu cards, no hot towels or even cold wipes, no blankets, no desert with dinner (only a small low quality chocolate bar). Most of the crew were grumpy, although some passengers did stretch their patience. The 2 cramped toilets at the rear were not in a pleasant state by the end of the flight.

Cabin very clean and tidy with a very comfortable seat. Service and food very good. When I came to my seat at the time of boarding there was a medium sized cake box on the empty adjacent seat which I assumed another pax had left with intentions of returning to their seat. When doors were closed, I mentioned to the cabin crew checking seat belts that the box on the seat next to me did not belong to me. They asked passengers nearby and nobody claimed it as theirs. The box was then placed in an overhead locker near the galley area. I was surprised they did not make a cabin announcement requesting ownership prior to departure. The sector to London was on an A380 and the flight seemed full in economy. Seat was comfortable and cabin very clean. Entertainment system excellent with a wide choice of programs on both flights. The economy food on the AUH-LHR sector was not as good as expected from a 5 star airline. Room for improvement on this front. Disembarking at LHR seemed to take a very long time for pax seated to the rear of the aircraft. I guess this is the peril of flying in such a large capacity aircraft.

I had 2 seats for me, so I had no problem to sleep on the 13 hours journey. The tv was later working, but there were no sound. So I watched on my macbook.

I eventually became regular with Etihad and silver class. This time I tried their Business class from Doha to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. I was surprised with the staff attentiveness and availability in business class which was far lower that in economy class staff. During the 4 hrs night flight the cabin became too warm and business class passengers became restless pressing the calling button for help, but in vain - no flight attendants were available for long time. At that point I felt economy class was better than business class for attendees availability and service. On contrary my return flight business class was fantastic. ",Business,5.0,nan

Lounge in BKK is very badly managed. Few passengers but no table available because full of rubbish and not cleaned. AUH lounge in T3 was full and had to wait 10 mins to get a seat. For return flight the lounge in CDG was very good with great service. On board I did not get a welcome drink or hot towel when boarded the CDG-AUH flight despite the flight being slighty delayed by fog. Flight crew where not caring when calling them thru the ""call "" button. Flight was late at AUH and no information where given about transfer. Security check crowded and I had to tell the staff I was a business passenger as there was no dedicated line. For AUH-BKK flight, again, no welcome drink or hot towel. After ringing cabin crew with no answer several times I had to stand up and go ""disturb"" two female cabin crew chatting in the galley to get my welcome drink. The plane config was old with very tiny business class sleeper seats, no space for personal items to put even a newspaper or glasses. The only good thing on this flight was a cabin manager who was very caring and without the good service provided by this person my flight would have been a totally disastrous experience. Thanks god I had this ticket at a discounted price. Will certainly not choose Etihad if i have to pay a full price business class ticket.

I was sitting near to where the flight attendants sit and the whole time one of them went on about her personal life and affairs.

Once I showed them the email with my original seat and after a lot of standing my ground they finally gave us seats behind and infront of my child - I still couldn't see him but was at least close to him. On boarding I had to deal with an angry passenger who said I had taken his seat, the cabin crew did not assist in anyway, thankfully once I explained we had lost our seats he calmed down. They couldn't explain why they had given my prebooked seats away. The food on board was awful and half way through the flight they ran out of lots of the food - I don't understand how this could happen when the flight had left from Abu Dhabi which is their home, so if anything it should have been better then the flight that left Heathrow.

Nobody even looked to see if my seatbelt was fastened, once the crew were realeased to do their duties, I was ignored again so I got up myself and walked to the rear galley to tell the attendant, who said she'd restart my TV to try and sort it. It didn't work and I couldn't use the option bar at the bottom of the screen as it was non existent, fantastic for an 8 hour 35 minutes flight, not. I realise it's not the crews fault but ignoring me and the fact I'd flown from Australia to Abu Dhabi earlier that day really annoyed me. With only 9 spares seats (spread out) on the aircraft I stayed put and slept. In the end we landed with a flight time of 7 hours 50 minutes into Edinburgh, but horrendously had to stop on the taxi way for 45 minutes as Edinburgh airport wasn't ready for our early arrival. We then waited an hour for our bags.

As living in Abu Dhabi, I always wanted to fly Etihad but now it's enough. Crews and ground staff are not helpful or friendly and need to be more trained.

Extremely disappointed with the poor service and below average standards on our flights. We visit family in Germany every year and having flown other airlines (business class) we took our agents recommendation and flew Etihad Airways for the first time and most definitely the last time. I am taking the time to write this review just on 24 hours from getting home because my husband, daughter felt that we were (and other passengers) inconveniencing the crew. Their negative attitude and lack of professionalism were not acceptable. On a positive note checking in at Frankfurt Airport was excellent, easy and staff were friendly. However, from the moment we entered the aircraft we noticed the cabin crew rushing around, looking very stressed and un politely pushing passengers aside saying, “please move” to get past. At no time were we properly greeted or welcomed on board. The aircraft on our first leg of the journey was old and a bit shabby and the seats were not really comfortable. When we ordered our meal (I requested the lamb dish) I was told they had run out! After dinner was served the staff disappeared and were pretty much non-existent. Fortunately, it was only a 6.5 hr flight. However, the second leg of our flight 12.5 hrs was dreadful. Larger aircraft and seat/bed comfortable, our biggest disappointment again was the cabin crew. Except for one crew member who was somewhat polite the rest of the crew were unprofessional and just not visible during the flight. I requested a meal at about the 6-hr point of the journey and had to wait an hour – the food however (Grouper) was really good! My biggest shock came 1.5 hrs before landing in Melbourne when I woke up and requested a cup of coffee and some breakfast (they did not come to me I had to go to the galley). I was told by the female attendant that the ovens were turned off and they had no hot meals left. I explained that I had several hours in Melbourne to connect to Sydney and asked if I could maybe have a coffee and some toast to which the female crew member said, “you could get some breakfast and a better coffee in Melbourne”. I could give you more details about our whole journey but want to limit by saying I will not recommend Etihad to family and friends and certainly not fly Etihad again. I know that it is not Etihad's fault but Abu Dhabi Airport was also a nightmare - understandably a larger airport than Sydney but even though we were in transit everyone had to go through security checks (applaud this) but was chaotic and over crowed and understaffed.

Howeverthe surprise came when we got told that if we do not take this flight 'Jan 3' we will lose the tickets since they were booked with miles. I called the Etihad contact center but there was absolutely no sign of cooperation. The tickets in dollar value are worth more than $5,500 - and I now had lost them all without 1 cent being returned except the tax which was around $510. I have tried all possible and proper ways with Etihad but not one time i was shown any kind of cooperation, their call center agents are all always in a hurry to finish the call as this is a dead case for them.

The cabin crew were pretty serious and not even saying 'hi', overall pretty average. The food was surprisingly nice, the leg room was alright and the seats were comfortable enough. The entertainment system was ok, but it didn’t work for the first half hour and the last hour of the flight, when I questioned I was told that’s Etihads Policy, which didn’t really make much sense to me. It was pretty boring to sit and watch the flight map for the last hour of the flight. The other interesting thing was the first officer announced that we are traveling along the “Arabian Gulf”, I thought it was called “Persian Gulf”, I checked my google map again and I am certain it is Persian Gulf, it is like saying welcome to Qatar or Saudi once we land in Abu Dhabi. This was pretty stupid to me as I suppose the airlines must be accurate with their announcements. The last thing is Abu Dhabi Airport itself, I know it isn’t much to do with the airline or flight quality, but when you travel with Etihad you have to go past the airport and that airport is terrible, small and cramped with people with super dirty toilets. Overall, I would rather fly with Singapore Airlines, Emirates or Qatar much more than Etihad. A little saving not worth it.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

The entertainment system is great - lots of excellent movies and music, not a single chance to get bored. Quite interesting inflight magazine too. There are things to work on, though. The food quality have dropped significantly during the last couple of years - the meal was surprisingly mediocre and not tasty. Also, the Etihad mobile application tends to crash and depict errors causing the necessity to dial the call center for simple operations. The call center is rather useless though. For example I had failed to change my seats via application and asked to do so via call center, but the guy there was trying persistently to convince me, that the seating I required was not possible.

I would classify the service provided by the airline as very poor. It all started when my meals had to be served, I was offered a vegetarian meal, and I told the cabin crew very specifically that I would like to get a Non-veg meal. She made me wait for about 15-20 minutes and came back and firmly told me that there was no other option but a veg meal. I then requested for a drink, and was told that it would take about 15 minutes, I waited for about 30 minutes and then pressed the attendant button, the next attendant took another 15 minutes to fetch me a drink.

On the final route from Abu Dhabi to Toronto, I was confronted at the entry gates by a person who weighed by cabin bag, which was about 1 kg over the restriction, and they turned me back asking me to have the weight adjusted. I couldn't believe that they would be so strict with 1 kg. My overall experience puts me to think if I ever want to fly with this airline again. The cabin crew and the check in crew appear to be doing all the passengers a favor by working for this airline. I am sure if things don't change fast, this airline wouldn't last too long.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I will never suggest any Handicapped or the person needing assistance to travel with Etihad or its partner Airline . Etihad treat their passengers who are handicapped with no respect and the service is degraded. I have been the loyal customer for Etihad for past 4 years and flown only their business class multiple times a year. This time I had the health issues and noticed the service they provided was really bad. Asked for the wheel chair and the reply was they they don't have one and I have to walk. This time I requested the wheelchair and the service I got was very poor. ,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I'd have thought with 2018 the IFE would have been improved sadly not with hardly any proper up to date movies available and a poor selection compared to Qatar Airways. Service by the crew on this flight was very slow indeed and staff all seemed to be Indian and serving Indian customers first. Took an age to get my dessert even after a gentle reminder. Food was pretty good though. I used the wifi internet for messaging and it's not bad value $5 for 30MB and is very useful for notifying family of status etc. Connection remained stable so was quite impressed but then I was only messaging not browsing or any heavy file download etc.,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0

Etihad Airways delayed its flight from Perth to Abu Dhabi for 7 hours due to a technical issue with the plane and finally took us to Abu Dhabi via Colombo, where we stayed for another 1.5 hours. Upon reaching Abu Dhabi, I was given a hotel room for 12 hours for a layover of 17 and a half hours as I had missed my connecting flight and my new flight was arranged via Bahrain with a layover of another 7.5 hours and no arrangement for hotel or meal vouchers.

I flew with Etihad last month from florence to Abu Dhabi and I was flying Business Class. My first comment was on the food as the quality dropped big time. The second and main comment was regarding customer service and how Etihad Baggage claim center handled my claim of lost luggage. The luggage was missing with no tracing for 10 days, and I was trying to call claim center with no luck. I sent emails but the response was not up to the expectation. Finally, after 10 days I received a call from the driver who is delivering my bag with no previous communication and during my working hours. I was really disappointed from the way that Etihad Airways handled this case. I sent them an email last month and till now no one responded back to me nor call me to make sure that I received my bag or if anything is missing. I really hope that this review can reach Etihad so they can pay more attention to these details as they are my favourite airlines till this moment.",Business,4.0,4.0

I was very disappointed, seat space seems smaller but my husband had no leg space. He's 6ft and so is used to be restricted but this seemed much less than Emirates or Singapore Airlines, I ordered a low lactose meal and was given vegetarian which was just cheesy vegetables. I explained that cheese is lactose and was told I should order the right meal. I told them I had but they had the wrong one, which they were very nice about but strange they didn't think of this before and instead assumed I made the mistake. I ended up getting a vegan meal which was fine. Also they ran out of diet coke at the first beverage service before they reached us. Not the end of the world but quite random seeing as we were 20mins into the flight and surely not a surprise that diet coke is quite popular? A sign of poor preparation. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Colombo seemed to be a very old aircraft but was fine. Entertainment options good but you cant start using it till after the flight has taken off. FYI all films are censored. Also you have to pay a lot extra for everything, extra leg room was £200 for one leg of the trip (4 legs in total- London to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Colombo and return). It seems a bit of a budget pricing model. All round super average and not better than Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways or even BA (I know!).

Etihad was once perhaps the best airline in terms of service, value, food, in-flight services, and miles program. After years of loyal service with Etihad, I can honestly say they all of these once great features have become degraded to the point where I could rate many budget airlines better in every feature than that of Etihad. Only recently I had an issue whereby they increased the amount of guest miles required to make bookings to most destinations, and this happened to occur whilst I was making two online bookings, and happened a day earlier than it should have. After many back and forth emails and calls to Etihad, the outcome was that I was to blame, and that I made up the story to try and gain extra miles. They robbed me of 45000 hard earned miles and refuse to acknowledge any fault from their system or at the very least come up with a resolution or compromise. And I am apparently a loyal Gold customer and also a government employee, where we are given privilege treatment. I can only imagine how a ""regular"" customer would have been treated. This is only one of many issues I have faced as their services decline along with their money hungry cost cutting approach to virtually all aspects of their business. It is a real shame. Sadly they assume that customers do not see through their ways, but I can see from the ample bad reviews that customers are not at all happy with Etihad. Perhaps it is time they listened to their loyalty base. I for one will be choosing alternate airline wherever possible - there are many cheaper airlines which have better services now than Etihad.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

The girl on registration desk saw with attention my documents about pregnancy and gave us seats no. 8. This line located in front on evacuation exit. It means the back doesn't turn down. We knew it just in plane, unfortunately. To be pregnant and seating during 4 hours in one pose impossible! Our return flight has a 18 hours transit on Abu Dhabi.

I needed to make sure that my partner could pick me up from my destination so i had to hang up and call again the following day. I had no choice but to pay for the change. I then proceeded to call the customer services again the following day and they said that the cost is now £357. It was explained that the £260 was a special price on the day.

Collected by boarding passes for the 2 outbound legs and headed to departure area. I was sat in boarding zone 5 so lot of people in gate area. Handed pass to be scanned and was pulled to one side and given a new boarding pass having been given an upgrade to business class which was a very nice surprise. Boarded via the upper jetway, warmly welcomed by cabin crew and took my seat. Had a glass of orange juice and made my food choice from the menu. The whole upper deck on Etihad A380 is premium seating and was very comfortable. 4 seats across in 1-2-1 arrangement however some seats are rearward facing. Seat was comfy and converted into a lie flat bed. Seat has a lift up space for anything loose you might have ie phone or book etc. Large touch screen with side control for the inflight entertainment system. After take off more drinks were served and food service began. You can specify a time to eat on the menu as well. Crew member prepared the table for my meal which I thought was delicious. After clearing away the meal service I settle down to watch a film or 2. Choice is good and operation of the system is quite straightforward. The external cameras on the A380 are a nice touch. Flight departed on time and arrived on schedule and after clearing security made my way to my next flight. Abu-Dhabi to Manila is a Boeing 777 which was looking a little tired inside (12 years old) and I was back in economy. Still a good flight with reasonable food and good cabin crew. Managed to sleep. Flight on time Manila - Abu dhabi flight was the same Boeing 777 and again the food was fine and crew attentive. Flight on time Abu dhabi to London - again on Airbus A380 and was upgraded to business class again. Flight was very good. Food was excellent. Choices were made from the menu before departure. The only minor snag I had was that my seat would not convert to lie flat bed. Cabin crew were able to resolve quickly.

Not only did they not supply my requested vegan meals on either connection, on the second leg one of the cabin crew spilled very hot coffee on me. Of course accidents can happen but despite letting them know my arm was actually burnt and I needed something for it I had to ask 3 times and wait over 20 minutes before I was brought a poultice. The flowing days my arm was red and a small section blistered. Not supplying requested vegan meals appears to be pretty standard as exactly the same thing happened on the same route almost exactly a year ago, and my colleague who flew the same route in reverse also did not have his vegan meals supplied in March of this year. A complaint to the customer service team was met with a pathetic response - 3000 air miles as compensation. But my flights were booked with Virgin Australia where my air miles are based, and they were not transferable to this program. And what kind of totally inadequate compensation is 3000 air miles to me anyway? As a Gold Velocity member I expect better of both Virgin (whose response was also inadequate) and Etihad.

In fact, we had to fight to get them to put us up in a hotel and get us on the next flight. It took 3 hours to sort out everything. For me, they are the worst airline. This time I had to fly them for work - I had no say in the process and had to go with it. Wear and tear on the plane was obvious, food was mediocre and you could tell they had some cost cuts based on the amount of food that was served and the lack of menus.

There was no vegetarian meal option, despite the fact that our fares included a meal option.

Customer service is virtually non-existent. Even as a Gold member flying Business Class who had spent $25,000 on seats, I was treated by Etihad staff, with utter contempt and disdain. I flew with 6 family members, 2 of whom were infants. We spent more than $25,000 and 400,000 miles on our seats We were all in Business Class. I have been a gold member of the Etihad Guest rewards programme for 3 years. Despite repeated calls to the customer service line before we boarded, they did not manage to sit us together. Furthermore, the cabin crew did not help us to sit near each other, refusing to ask other passengers to move, even though those passengers were flying alone. The plane on the Singapore to Abu Dhabi leg has been replaced. Rather than the B787 which Etihad is quick to pretend flies on this route, it has been replaced by the aged A330, in which the business class offering is old and outdated. The plane is loud and most of all, extremely hot. When I complained about the offering, I was told that ""Etihad has the right to choose which planes it flies on its routes"". That is of course fine, but when you go to book the ticket online, the website clearly states you are paying for a seat on the Boeing 787.

I have flown Etihad business in the past and what a fall from grace. As a frequent flyer who flies internationally at least 6 times a year and often in business, flying with Etihad is mediocre at best. 4 years ago it was fantastic and couldn't be faulted but now it is very average and nothing special. I travelled on points this time. The points for this Etihad flight are 30 - 60K more than their competitors which is a lot for their entry level business class points tickets. The crew on the CGD to ABU were average and did nothing to make you feel special. The plane was older and nothing special. The food was seriously no better than economy and in fact I have had better food in economy on other airlines in the past. The main meal I had I couldn't eat due to the meat being so full of gristle. There was so little food as well. On the flight from ABU to Sydney I asked what time breakfast was so I could set an alarm to wake up. I was told that Etihad no longer serve breakfast. The reason, 'people are on different time zones'. I said to the hostess that this is ridiculous and it was nothing but cost cutting. I also asked has management changed because something is clearly happening with this airline. I was told it is under new management and the staff are bearing the brunt of disgruntled customers. Maybe this explains why you don't see them much anymore. I must say the hostess I spoke with was really trying and stated I could I lodge a formal complaint with her. I felt that this would possibly be more effective and seeing by the amount of complaints on this site, maybe I was wrong. With regard to breakfast, you can order from the all day menu which includes pastries (2 small), cereal, egg white omelette, noodles or a steak sandwich. You cannot get a real egg omelette and breakfast is lack lustre. The main meal (beef) was so bad again it couldn't be eaten. It was as tough as a brick. I was informed this is because everything is reheated. Food is very poor. Apart from the food, the staff are not often seen like in the past. A few years ago, travelling Etihad business was a treat. Staff were attentitive & polite, food was wonderful and business was worth the money and/or points. Now it's get on, get off. Having flown Premium with another airline late last year, I can honestly state that their Premium was far more superior than Etihad's business class. C",Business,1.0,nan

The service was poor at best, staff quite rude, food scarce and of average quality and whatever you do, don’t dare ask for a second glass of wine on what is almost a 14 hour flight! Whilst we don’t expect much flying economy, basic service, respect and food would be an expectation. It’s back to other carriers for us.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
A330 / A380,Economy Class,2.0,June 2018,4.0,1.0,4.0,no,Edinburgh to Sydney via Abu Dhabi,2.0," | Etihad is the epitome of 'okay'. The first leg of our flight was on a tired looking A330, the cabin of which was looking decidedly dated and the IFE hardware not particularly responsive. The flight attendants were not overly friendly or helpful which was fine but they did not give the impression of working for a premium, full-service airline and I've probably had friendlier crews on easyJet flights. The best that can be said for the meal on this flight was once again, okay, nothing to complain about but nothing exciting either. Although, the use of steel cutlery is nice to see. The primary benefit of transferring at Abu Dhabi is its small size meaning that its relatively easy to get from one gate to another for connections but it was also easy to tell how cramped and crowded it would be to spend more than an hour here for a stopover as the airport certainly needs to expand to meet demand. AUH's most interesting feature is its security policy whereby hand luggage is scanned and passengers made to go through metal detectors which every, single, person seemed to be setting off, including myself, despite having nothing on me and not having had any issues at EDI. This then means being patted down in a small curtained area with an unfriendly and unspeaking member of security staff. Not only this, but once passengers arrive at their gate everyone on our outbound flight (though only certain people on our return, we were waved through without searching strangely) was having their carry-on hand searched which seemed slightly excessive giving all the security measures passengers have already been through up to that point. The next leg of the trip was on a relatively new A380 which had a modern cabin and great IFE system despite the seats being uncomfortable this felt like a much better flight. The crew were marginally more friendly than the EDI-AUH leg but still did not go out of their way to be courteous or helpful for passengers. The most disappointing thing on this flight was the food, not its quality but lack of quantity. There are no menus in economy which is fine but would have been a nice touch. We were served a dinner after takeoff of which there were only two options left so I chose the pasta which was delicious and came with a salad, roll and small pudding. But during this 13 hour flight we were only given one more 'snack' of popcorn and then a breakfast of cinnamon roll and custard before landing in Sydney, at half past five in the evening. This was not enough food for the length of flight. Our return flights were of similar quality the only issue being the check-in staff at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Passengers were queuing for check in as it was shown as being open for this flight on the overhead monitors however, the ground staff were all standing behind one desk chatting, laughing, hugging each other and not one desk was open yet. After standing for half an hour and a now huge queue having developed with several people going over to ask what was going on check-in finally opened. Once we eventually got to the bag-drop counter we were greeted by an unfriendly man who answered my request to print off our boarding passes with 'obviously'. Not a good impression. Overall the experience of flying with Etihad was just fine, nothing more or less but I would definitely try another carrier for a long-haul flight before ever choosing them again as even though they were the cheapest option it certainly shows.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

It clearly states on the website ""As an Etihad Guest Silver member, you also get lounge access, priority check in, 25% extra Tier Bonus Miles and so much more."" Apparently this is only in Abu Dhabi so I asked if they would make an exception today as this clearly needs rectifying on the website but was still refused.

The worst part came when we were about to fly back from London to India my friends 2 year old baby started crying as he was not comfortable sitting with the belt so her mother took her into her lap - the air hostesses came and started shouting that you can’t do this the baby has to sit on chair with the belt. My friend told her get the extension and let him sit on my lap but she never agreed and forcefully held the baby and strapped the belt very tightly around him and he started crying loudly because of pain but she said let him cry but he will sit like that only.

The aircraft in the DMM-AUH sector was an old 320. A small snack was offered on that short flight and the IFE was unresponsive which annoyed me. We landed AUH on time but the connections in AUH is horrible. Very long queue for security check and I hated this terminal. The flight to BLR was delayed by 2 hrs because the aircraft arrived late. The boarding was extremely chaotic and there was no AC in the boarding area inspire of 46 C heat along with humidity later in the day. The aircraft was a newer A321 with good touchscreens but the selection of movies is not great The cabin service was good and food was excellent along with drinks offered. The downside was that one lavatory wasn't working which led to queue across the aisle .We landed 2 hrs later than our scheduled landing time .The cabin crew were really good.

There was a bit chaos at Chicago while boarding and once we entered the aircraft it took 2.5 hours for the crew to serve food and water. They should take a look into this as there were old travellers and toddlers on this flight. Cabin was good and leg space was ok. Food was some of the worst I have had in my travelling experience.

Much more refined than the Emirates suite, and in a different league from Qantas or BA First. The separate seat and bed set-up is excellent, there's a great feeling of spaciousness, and lots of storage. The vanity unit is a nice touch. The whole thing exudes class. Unfortunately I didn't find the bed desperately comfortable. It is extremely hard, even for someone who likes a firm bed. They need to invest in some thicker mattresses to deal with this as a priority. The shower is good, though not close to the quality of the EK bathrooms. Amenity kits were nothing special and didn't include deodorant. When I used my own, the spray set off the smoke detector and I was interrupted when only half-dressed by three crew members rather aggressively demanding to know if I was having a cigarette while showering. The toilet lighting was very dim on all four sectors which was a bit frustrating. The on board chefs were all exceptional in their attitude, and happy to make bespoke dishes (within reason), the F&B managers more varied and I didn't really see the point of them. Other crew were consistently very good indeed. IFE was ok with a pretty good selection of recent and older films. Transfers in AUH were speedy (though not well signposted) but First Class priority at security was not open. The (shared business and First) lounge at LHR was quite small but ok. Spa treatments for First passengers complimentary. AUH lounge not especially spacious either but with spa where I enjoyed an excellent massage and paid a small amount for a traditional shave (which was superb). A la carte breakfast was very good. SYD business and First lounge pleasant but no spa. Very friendly staff. Flights on time and any issues always explained. One big annoyance - at check in in Sydney I spotted that my confirmed seat had been changed to a much less attractive one. The senior customer service representative couldn’t work out why and after several conversations and calls discovered a couple travelling together wanted to be in adjacent seats, but hadn't reserved ahead. They had persuaded somebody senior, who should have known better, to displace me without asking. I was extremely displeased, not least that the change had been made unilaterally, for non-operational reasons. I had it changed back and received an apology from the agent (though not the person responsible), but it left a sour taste. Overall, however, easily now my favourite first class, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Movie selection really poor - around 30 English movies only. Food poorer quality than I'm used to on long haul flights, and on an 8.5 hour flight we only had a ""snack"" (inedibly dry cheese roll) then 6 hour gap before breakfast of pasty eggs just before landing. Alcohol service awful. Surly and annoyed looks from cabin crew when we ordered a glass of wine to go with dinner - huge sigh, ""well I'll need to get a piece of paper"", then long wait until after dinner service finished to bring drinks. I understand it's an Arabic airline but surly attitude from crew unnecessary and Emirates etc much better for this. Cabin horrendously cold - everyone around needed extra blankets.

I'm a Virgin Australia platinum flyer so I get to use the first class lounge in AUH which is a bonus. For the Edinburgh flight you need to get a bus to the plane which adds time so not ideal. Food and beverage onboard is good with a broad selection and my first choice has always been available. The one beef I do have (and this has happened to me twice now) is that the concept of priority baggage seems to not be a benefit. Twice my bags have been last off which defeats the purpose of being first off the plane. It's a stated benefit so they should make sure they deliver on it. Not exactly the worst thing but it meant I waited 45 mins for my bags. One other thing, still not been credited with status points and I flew three and a half weeks ago.",Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0

After another six or seven hours had passed, I had to ask when the next meal would be served and was told that passengers request on-demand meals in Business class. The second meal was skimpy (I had ordered a vegetarian meal) and there were about 8 hours still remaining in the flight. During this time I had to make do with chips and tea.

The person I spoke with over the phone was very clear to emphasize the USD 200 change date fee, however, he didn’t disclose any amount related to “taxes and fares”. He simply dismissed me with the standard statement: “I cannot provide an exact figure at this stage”, which was not true. He could have provide me with a reasonable expected amount by simply check on his computer. As it turns out, Taxes and Fares summed up to an extra USD 392. The total amount I was supposed to pay for one way only, was even greater than the original return ticket! No need to say that I have booked the one way tickets for me and my wife with a better company, Cathay Pacific.

The  A380 packs a lot of people but the service does not commensurate. For nearly 45 minutes services does not start and once the stewards come to your seat after a long wait you ask for as simple thing as a Ginger Ale for myself and my wife and they just give one saying that there is no stock. Also if you have a connecting flight there is no one at the airport to guide. The A380 Mumbai to Abu Dhabi flight on 20th January was bit delayed and by the time it arrived the boarding time for the connecting flight to Cairo already started. Given my experience with other airlines, I was hoping there would be someone after we come out from the flight to guide us to catch the connecting flight which might have aleady commenced boarding. There was none, the security is so crowded. I seek a help of one of the airport guys saying that I need help to reach the gate quickly to which he asks someone to help only to find that guy is busy over speaking on his mobile. Seeing that, the airline staff guides us to go through a lane that could clear the security fast and it was such a haste and hurry in the process forgot to pick up a few things that were put to security check. Since many passengers have a connecting flight, it is important that the airline and airport extend guidance and help instead of leaving them unattended and force them to scramble scurry all by themselves.",Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0

I have travelled several times in the past on Etihad and I always rated it above many other airlines. However, that impression was totally destroyed with just concluded travel in January 2017. Self and my wife booked our tickets 3 months in advance. The airline refuses to pick a seat unless you pay for it, so we allowed the airlines to allocate the seat. We were on a Boeing 777 (Toronto to Abu Dhabi) and quite shocked to see we were right on the tail even though we booked the tickets 3 months in advance. The seat was very narrow and extremely uncomfortable added to that the seat I was sitting was defective - would not move, so I had to travel 12.5 hours in upright position. Added to that, the entertainment unit was flickering non-stop so I could not use the unit as well. The airline requested us to update our profile so that they know our preferences in advance. However, it looks like a gimmick. The menu card was provided on one side but not to us. When the crew came to serve us, they said all that they have was vegetarian and we accepted but the quality was just horrible. Overall, it was horrible experience. Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai was on A340, the seat was better but service was a stinker. Again, we were seated right at the tail end and they could only serve us vegetarian! On the way back we were on A380 on BOM-AUH. Great experience, the seats were good but again, we were on seats 85E/F - the tail end. They could only serve us Vegetarian but this time we refused to eat. We asked for a glass of water and my wife took a glass of Sprite. Mysteriously, after 3 minutes the waitress comes with non vegetarian food! My question is what is happening with this airline? Are we supposed to fight for our food option? That is it. I have decided not to fly on this horrible airline again. I advise whoever wants to travel on Etihad on economy, think twice. I am sure they pamper Business and First class passengers though they get their cream from Economy. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

As we were in time for our original flight I asked to speak to a manager to which I was told that no managers or supervisors work at Abu Dhabi airport. I checked this several times and the woman was insistent this was the case and we had to get on the flight to Bangkok otherwise we would have to stay in the airport for 24 hours. Reluctantly we agreed. The flight to Bangkok was awful. The inflight entertainment system wasn't working. We got given breakfast and then left with the trays for over an hour before they bothered to clear them away. The first drinks were served 4 hours into the flight. At Bangkok we were then put on a Vietnam Airlines flight to Ho Chi Minh. Upon arrival, 3 hours after we should have arrived, we found our bags had been left in Abu Dhabi. Everybody from Etihad had left for the night. We were left without our luggage for over 24 hours. Just the winter clothes we travelled in (not pleasant in 30+degrees). Etihad refused to reimburse us for any essential clothes and toiletries we had to buy as a result. Took over 4 weeks to respond to a complaint.

Did not make the connection in Abu Dhabi because of a minor 30-minute delay departing from Kolkata, and the pre-clearance was already closed for the second leg from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco. The pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi is Etihad's main selling point however, it's actually a huge pain and causes lots of passengers to miss their connecting flights. Etihad automatically rebooked me on a later flight to LAX, then LAX to SFO with American Airlines, adding 10 hours to my original trip. All they did was take my boarding pass to SFO and give me the new boarding passes to SFO via LAX without any explanation. No lounge access or hotel was offered to me. No one was able to tell me if my luggage would follow me, which was really frustrating. Got a middle seat for the Abu Dhabi-Los Angeles which lasted 17 hours. Also, cherry on the cake, the LAX-SFO was cancelled due to ""air traffic"" and no one told me, so I ended up flying United back home, arriving 13 hours later than originally planned. Finally, my luggage did follow me - surprisingly after so many obstacles. Anyway, easily the worst trip I've ever had. Not flying Etihad ever again, the onboard experience was a 3/5 but the ground experience 1/5.

First impression was the absolutely enormous check-in line (which has been the case for every Etihad flight I've taken). It took an hour to get to the ticket counter. For some reason, this is always the case with Etihad-not sure if they are short staffed, have antiquated systems, or just simply do not care about the 95% of passengers who fly economy (of course, there were copious staff for business/first checkin who were doing nothing). Flight was on a new Dreamliner-seats were much tighter than other Dreamliners I've flown with other airlines, but not terrible. Great entertainment system.

The breakfast snack was a joke and they are very stingy when it comes to drinks - all drinks, including water, are served in plastic cups. Crew were nowhere to be seen, except chatting at the back, after the meal was served - to few juice and water rounds.

Assurances and results seem to be very different from management at the ground to the sellers on the phone at the head office. On the new flights it seemed completely unorganised and irresponsible that Etihad Airways thought it was perfectly fine for my 2yr old daughter to be sat on her own without myself or my mother who was attending the flight just to help with the children. The ground staff in Manchester worked tirelessly making sure that this was corrected before we boarded. However it seems that Abu Dhabi staff are less interested and treated me with disrespect and disgust. I stood at the gate for over an hour trying to sort out the mistake they had made to be told by their manager that I can either board the flight and have my 2 yr old sat alone or I can stay in Abu Dhabi, my choice. I was also traveling with my 1 yr old son who I bought a seat for as the flight was too long for him to not have his own space. Now I as told that passengers with infants get priority seating i.e. The space and the options of bassinets for baby's which was one of the reasons for booking with Etihad. However I was not given this either other parents were but I wasn't. I boarded the flight to be told on board that my daughter could sit alone and my mother alone elsewhere on the flight and myself to sit with my son on my lap. Without the seat I had paid for him! And this to the staff was completely acceptable and because I was getting increasingly distressed at the prospect of my 1 yr old without his seat or a bassinet and my 2 yr old sat alone for a 14hr flight, they dealt with it by stating my son doesn't have his own seat and that if I didn't calm down I would be escorted off the flight! The air staff took my 4 boarding passes from me and never returned them. An Australian member of ground staff, who treated me very disrespectfully told me as I had no proof of my 4 boarding passes lost by the staff I had no right to the additional seat for my son. If it wasn't for a couple giving up their seats for me and my children I don't think I would have ever taken that flight. We took off with my son without his seat and my daughter sat beside me and with me in an attempt to try and hold down a 1yr old and 2 yr old myself. All in all my family and I paid up to £6k for these flights which I have to say was possibly the worst 32 hours of my life because Etihad Airways have no respect or helpful approach to traveling families in Abu Dhabi. They were awful to deal with and deny that they made mistakes like sitting a 2 yr old on her own! Or giving me a seat which I paid for. Terrible service and never fly with them if you can help it.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Since this was booked as a package holiday it unfortunately only included economy seats. So we asked the check in agent in Munich for a paid upgrade, which we were granted. I paid the approximately 700 Euro (for one of the four segments) by credit card and was handed over the business class tickets. We went off to do some last minute shopping at Munich airport when about 10 minutes later an public announcement (probably airport-wide, since we were already in the central area) was made that asked us to return to the checkin counter. At the counter we were told by the Etihad ""Guest Services Agent"" in charge that ""unfortunately"" our initial tickets were not upgradable and we cannot not keep them (not even by paying more etc.). No choice, no regret, no sorry. While I do understand that there are corporate policies regarding ticket upgrades, the described behaviour (of recalling already issued boarding cards) is unacceptable. It doesn't even make sense from a corporate standpoint since the seats remained empty for the flight. Furthermore our initially reserved economy seats were given to somebody else in the meantime. That also meant that we didn't even receive our pre-ordered special meals. According to the cabin crew member somebody else got it instead. I complained to Etihad about this but got nothing but a dull and worthless standard letter. By no means was this middle eastern hospitality or ""five star"" service. Two lessons I learned from this experience: Book business class right away and avoid Etihad Airways (not only for the experience described above but also for the horrible and dirty airport in Abu Dhabi which would be another story for itself).",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Even though I had an economy ticket, for such a long distance, I expected a slightly more comfortable travel. Everything was at its very basic: narrow, cramped seats, low-quality food, broken headset. The amount of money charged for the extra luggage was too much. I had to pay more than 300 dollars at the airport. Moreover, it was my first flight experience where I was allowed to have 7 kg cabin bag with me and not more (it is usually from 8 to 10 kg). This also caused me trouble. All in all, this will be my last experience of travel with Etihad Airways and I don't recommend it to anyone else.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

Aircraft to travel to Munich is very old. We are not allowed to use the entertainment services until take off despite the delay in departing. Etihad travel mall for bus shuttle from Dubai to Abu Dhabi does not pick up phone calls outside of working hours (though buses are departing at any time).

After flying with this airline in the past both business and economy I vowed never to fly them again. However, as I was looking for a cheap flight back to Thailand after a trip to the UK for a family bereavement I went for the cheapest one-way and they were the cheapest at the time of looking. In Manchester, at the check-in which was in itself an ordeal, I arrived 3.5 hours before departure only to be in a huge queue that stretched back around coffee machines and public toilets due to lack of space. This was because only 3 check in desks were supplied for economy, the rest were for online check in. In other words, don't check in online and you will be treated to being tended to last and at the back of the queue. I wouldn't have minded but those who took a chance and went to the online check in were still seen to despite not having checked in online, which resulted in chaos for the rest of us who tried to go by the rules. Then, I had to put my hand luggage into this metal cage to check for size. My hand case was 3kg under the 7kg allowance, but wouldn't go in this metal cage lengthways as it was 2cm too long. They then informed me that to take my hand case onboard, I would be required to cough up GBP155. Due to my wife's quick thinking, as the case wasn't new, we discarded it and put the contents into plastic bags. With reluctance, they agreed this was ok so I lost my case yet didn't give them the satisfaction of stripping me of GBP155. After trying to recover from the stressful check-in, once on the aircraft, we had to sit for 1.5 hours due to the usual delays. Then, chaos ensued at Abu Dhabi transit. Hundreds of people fighting to get through with no organization and a gate area so small that everyone was queuing for what seemed like miles outside the gate area.  To be fair, the crew on both legs were attentive and very good and no complaints with regard to them. Etihad are a disgrace and I won't be flying with them again!",Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0

The inflight entertainment system needs to be updated since its an older version and cannot handle the new E-Box version. The cabin crew seems not too much interested to respond to requests.  The economy class did not have a mobile / laptop charges, the same segment flight to Kochin has these amenities. The same double standard is felt in the business class sector.

Unlike others, Perth appears to have little difficulty organizing hassle-free check-in and loading using an air-bridge to ensure a prompt (on the nose) push-back. Can't be faulted. For the flight, the seats on the 787 offer room enough for a six-footer, if a bit hard, but remember to bring your own eye mask and earplugs as these have been consigned to history by Etihad in the name of cost-cutting, probably best to use your own headphones too as those offered were defective. The ordered special meal - vegetable curry - served on departure was perfectly edible but likewise the little extras that Etihad once offered have disappeared. Deja vu as exactly the same meal was served again prior to arrival, which I could not be bothered with - some variation would have been nice, the second meal is not necessary on a 10 hour flight, a good quality snack / sandwich far preferable. Crew attentive throughout so no issues there. Like the live TV on the 787 but otherwise the IFE has similarly been cut back of late. Touch down at AUH was a few minutes early. However, as is the norm, for operational expedience the plane was subsequently parked at a distant location. Suffice it was an hour and a quarter before I eventually arrived in the terminal for the most part stuffed like a sardine in a cold, chronically overloaded bus with many elderly passengers and children. 5 minutes to whisk through the e-gate to pick up my bags that had arrived long since.

Due to time constraints, I had to purchase an airline ticket in a hurry, I chose Etihad, and I paid $2600.00 for a round-trip ticket for what was listed as Economy Flex. It was economy alright but the Flex part was an extreme exaggeration or someone's idea of a cruel joke on the unsuspecting traveler! I saw absolutely no difference between the economy class or the economy flex when it came to the room, as claimed by Etihad. The service was quite below standard, I had ordered a Kosher meal and when I got my meal in a box, half of the items in the kosher meal box were frozen.

They wouldn't give us a boarding pass until we entered the airport. During the flight the stewardesses were really nice, but the food was very limited in economy.

The flight from London was delayed by 1 hour which is no big deal. During the flight as we approached Abu Dhabi, we ended up circling due to bad weather. On asking the flight staff, no one was able to advise what the next steps were. We eventually landed at Abu Dhabi and were advised to go to the Transfer Desk. They told us our plane was still there and to go to the gate. We go to the gate only to be told our seats had been given away and we had been offloaded. We questioned why and they were rude in their response and told us to go to the transfer desk. Someone 'helped' us by walking us to the transfer desk. All we wanted to know was when our next flight would be, which we only found out after queuing behind a 100 people and found out that it was in 7 hours. At no point was any rest place or accomodation advised or given and we had to argue in getting food vouchers rather than being offered them. We managed to see through the next 7 hours only to be confronted with more difficulty. We queued for our connecting flight only to be told we need to check in our hand carry. We insisted we were carrying medicine which we needed to keep, at which point the attendant shouted and threatened to deboard us from the plane if we didn't comply. After much stress managed to eventually get on to the flight. We arrived in MNL and waited for 2 hours in baggage only to find out 2 out of 3 of our checked in suitcases did not make it. As a result we were unable to give gifts and presents to our relatives for Christmas plus our clothes and personal effects were missing. On questioning where are luggage was, there was no explanation and we had to wait 24hrs before they could track our baggage. Etihad eventually got our luggage to us 3 days later although frustratingly no arrangement was made to drop it. They decided to call at 3am and demanded they drop it, irrespective of how inconvenient this was. We decided to rebook our return as the issues and delays stopped us from doing some important things. We called Etihad only to be told it would cost the price of 1 full priced ticket for us both. We explained our challenges on our outward trip but no attempt was made to assist us with our return flight. When we asked them to proceed on the back of the conversation the previous day they opened our ticket (essentially cancelling our original return ticket) they went on to explain it would actually cost the price of 2 tickets rather than 1 which they had previously advised. We argued that we would have only been happy to pay for the price discussed the day before and was not happy they had misinformed us. They left us no choice but to buy new tickets at full price due to an error on their part without considering the previous problems. A lot of this could have been avoided if they looked at helping their customers. Issues happen but under no circumstances should the customers be dealt with such blatant disregard. We have been lucky enough to have travelled with Emirates, Cathay Pacific, KLM, and Singapore whose customer service has been great and unfortunately Etihad do not deserve to be held anywhere near the same level as them. Their lack of professionalism and customer care left so much to be desired.

The journey from SFO-HYD was decent. They have comparable cabin service to Emirates, but their aircraft are somewhat old. The problem was during the return leg HYD-SFO. Don't ever go to their HYD check-in counter with even a single KG of extra baggage. I had just 1.1 Kg of extra baggage in my combined check-in luggage of 46KGs. I should have accounted for the Finance Textbook I added at the end. But little did I know that it would cause me so much hassle. First I thought they would be lenient and just let it go, but the guy was at the counter was rude and wanted me to pay the extra fee. I agreed to pay the additional price for the extra KG, but supposedly they have a flat rate of $125US. The guy was hurrying me to pay the additional fee and threatened me to get out of the line and to come back after throwing my luggage. He even mocked me that I will get further 15KGs if I buy the extra baggage and I can fill my bags with the Karachi biscuits they were selling at the airport. Terrible service. I was upset by this treatment as I didn't pay so much for such service. I called the manager, who was nice, but he wasn't helpful either. I was ready to throw my luggage, but I was not going to pay after the humiliation. I read their luggage policy and decided to carry my Textbook as a personal item (since they are not allowing an additional laptop bag, but a personal item now which they don't tell you about).

First time flying with Etihad and will be our last. Flew business class with my wife from LHR to Abu Dhabi and then onto Male. First flight was late leaving by an hour and despite being first off the plane the transfer at Abu Dhabi, it was shambolic. I have never seen crowds like it or so disorganised. It took one hour to get through and when we arrived at the lounge we had 5 mins there before boarding, time for a coffee only. Boarded the Male flight that departed at 8.40 only to be surprised they were serving lamb and chicken for in my view breakfast. We had lamb at 10.30pm UK time on London flight, was really looking forward to breakfast so ate nothing for a further 4 hours. No snacks, sandwiches or any savoury option available. So thank you Etihad I had no food for over 10 hours. You should be totally embarrassed by the fiasco at your main hub. Clearly you have significant transfers here and it is not fit for purpose. No priority channel until you get 2 yards from business security. This is entirely unacceptable and your food choice should be so much more on a business class flight from your hub.  I paid for business class for my wife and I on a wedding anniversary trip and got a poor economy service from Etihad. I had heard so many good things before flying, my experience is entirely different. Finally seating in business class was a fiasco too, we booked flights 5 months ago and still couldn’t get seats side by side in either flight.

Upon asking the stewardess if she could find a seat next to my partner (which we had been assured was sorted on checking in), she just said “ flight is full”. They are very mean with the drinks, no miniature bottles, just a bottle on the trolley which was sparingly measured (I got nasty looks when I asked for a “ large” one) unlike Emirates who were very obliging with anything you requested. Toilets and aircraft overall seemed grubby. There were no menus to check what was on offer and what was on offer inedible unless you were starving due to queuing for hours to check in (even after online check in). The in flight entertainment was very poor compared to Emirates, mostly geared towards Arabic travellers, esp the music. Very limited selection of films and the “news” was about Etihad,  what a joke!

Got an upgrade on the AUH to SYD (A380) leg which was an amazing experience. Cabin crew on all flights were excellent, attention to detail is great and they were really engaged. The free style dining service on Etihad Business and First really works as your body clock can differ on each flight.

Food was excellent, design, easy check-in through the app and good information in general. Clean aircraft, nicely equipped. In-flight entertainment had its bugs, had to restart it a couple of times during the flight. So everything quite good, but why do you seem to have only unfriendly cabin crew members?

The first flights to Bangkok everything was smooth and perfect then the last leg of the return flight was terrible! We had paid for extra leg room seats as it said on the check in and when we boarded the plane we were sat in regular seats. The flight attendant told us that we paid to sit closer to the front of the plane - I explained to her multiple times that, that’s not what it said on the website but I  will take it up with customer service because obviously she couldn’t do anything about it. Once getting back to DC I called the Etihad customer service and was put on hold for 20 mins - when someone finally picked up the phone she was extremely rude! Was no help and then once i asked for a manager she said there wasn’t one. She referred me to an email address and hang up. So I send the email and still get no response! Today i call the airline back and get somebody else who also tells me there is no manager and that the lady gave me the wrong email. And there is nothing he can do. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Check in slowed by difficult passengers intent on shipping luggage far in excess of their allowance with consequential prolonged debate with the local agent. Etihad use a generic lounge at Bangkok which is adequate and no more. Early boarding so ample time to settle into my seat and a prompt departure. Although only six years old the more traditional seating arrangements on the 777 appear dated compared to the 787s, for example, but actually to my personal preference, more private and ample room to stretch out. Cost cutting evident, no amenity kits distributed with only basic eye-pad / ear plugs / flight socks available on request. Food and drink menu limited compared to what was available in the past - no offer of food on demand, the vegetarian fettuccine dry and tasteless. Staff attentive though not proactive with the distribution of water or other soft drinks during the flight. Entertained myself watching live English football and an early James Bond film. No free wifi. On time arrival on an air bridge at Abu Dhabi, which is exceptionally rare for Etihad. Unfortunately a one hour delay recovering baggage due to, as I subsequently discovered, intervention by Customs.

No chauffeur service except in Abu Dhabi or generally have first class facilities at many airports. The first class seating is  good although the narrow beds are desperately hard. Food has never been at the best standard despite great efforts by many of the crew. First class check-in at Sydney Airport was shared with economy passengers the reason given that there was only one first class passenger. In reality there were several upgrades. The lounge is shared with business class and is underwhelming. Service was poor. Upon requesting assistance to the aircraft I was advised as I was not a Residence passenger no assistance would be available. The person was close to being abusive. In flight crew were helpful and polite on both legs. At Munich Airport a car which had been ordered failed to turn up and a circus like series of telephone calls commenced. The airport bus proved more reliable. There are all the signs of serious cost cutting at this airline at every level and premium passengers are paying the price for seriously flawed management decisions made in the past. The ground staff at Munich have been wonderful, at least those working for the airline. There have been many forced redundancies and sadly some who have left were the competent and service oriented professionals at different locations. London staff are particularly unhelpful. The airline is clearly not interested in maintaining high level service. After perhaps fifty flights in the front section one has to wonder if it is worth the loyalty.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

On the first segment (B-777) the seats were very tight and the food service poor, to be charitable. Worse was the biz class to Paris. Though the A380 seating was fine, the cabin service was terrible - disinterested and abrupt flight attendants and an incredibly limited selection of food and drinks, given the price and the 7.5 hour flight.

I ordered a special meal when booking the flight as I am gluten intolerant, I checked 2 days prior to the flight to confirm it was on the itinerary which it was and called the day before the flight to confirm. On the flight however it was stated that it was not ordered and I must not have ordered in advance, I explained that I had ordered it several months in advance and confirmed but the impression they gave was that I was not telling the truth. The Senior on board provided me with some fruit and the salad from the meal but no real meal was able to be given. She was very apologetic and took note of it on the system so that on the return I would receive the meal. However on the return the same issue happened, the crew member was far less apologetic and insinuated that I had not booked it properly. I was given only an apple for the flight. I complained and Etihad stated it was a system error, just not sure how the error could have happened twice. Staff should be made aware that system errors happen and should not make assumptions that the issue is on the passengers side. Should possibly have more information of the ingredients (allergen list) in the meals provided so if the error happens you can see if any of the meals on board would be suitable.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

We paid more for the flights with etihad over a lesser-known airline as we wanted to guarantee a seamless journey. Wrong. Firstly, we were sat separately on 3 out of 4 legs of the journey The online check in didn’t work, so we had no choice. 3 our of 4 of my seats did not recline, but the seats in front did. This meant that on each leg of the journey I was cramped up for several hours. I am fairly small, so I can only imagine how frustrating this would be for anyone of a larger stature. Next up, they overbooked the final leg of our flight by over 20+ people and point blank refused to let us on. They rerouted us resulting in a 12 hour wait in Abu Dhabi airport. No hotel. No apology. One extremely rude member of staff dealt with us who was nothing but arrogant about the whole situation. This delay has had major implications on us both financially (kennel for an extra day for 3 dogs and business implications) yet Etihad merely issued us a ‘meal voucher’ which afforded us a soft drink and pack of grapes. Utterly disgraceful. Also, do not be fooled by the ‘luxurious’ lure of this airline: the aircraft are old and uncomfortable. The screens are older than me and on each journey we heard at least 2-3 people near by whose screens didn’t work at all. No chance of changing seat in that case, they overbook each flight, remember!

On my way to India, we were allocated different seats in different rows on our transit flight from Abu Dhabi to TRV. I was very upset that to be seated separately so we tried to do the check in again so we can be seated together on our way back. I tried check in online and also tried to contact the customer services over phone but I couldn't do it, so we went to the airport very early and requested seats to be together and they passed the buck and requested to talk at the transit desk at Abu Dhabi Airport. The staff at the transit counter said the same thing that the flight is full and told me she would put a comment on system for the boarding staff and they may be able to offer seats together. At the boarding gate, staff mentioned that I will need to speak to the cabin crew. Cabin crew was very hesitant to speak to other passengers and finally I had to personally request passengers if they can swap seats so we can sit together. One of the passenger was so kind and he volunteered to change his aisle seat and took one of the other middle seats that was allocated to me. This is the worst airline I have travelled so far, although they had sufficient time to sort my request, they kept passing the buck and left me with passenger's mercy.

However, on Tuesday March 20th, I found out my flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles was overbooked when I arrived at the airport, and I was forced off of the flight I had purchased months before. Typically, airline companies will ask for volunteers to take another flight. In this case I had no choice in the matter. Secondly, airline companies will usually re-book customers on comparable flights. In this case I was re-booked on a connecting flight even though my purchase was on a non-stop to Los Angeles with minimal compensation. When I emailed Etihad’s customer service, their response was that they would do nothing more than what they already had “in the event of denied boarding.” If Etihad feels that denying people who have purchased tickets is their right, I will no longer be flying with them.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I routinely fly business class and have flown business class on Etihad on many occasions but this flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was the worst ever. Dreamliner does not accurately describe the aircraft and the cabin crew seemed less than enthused to be on board. The seat was extremely hard and very uncomfortable, although there are apparently features which should allow a passenger to change the softness/lumbar support etc they failed to make any difference. Previous flights on other aircraft have been better thanks to passengers having the ability to alter cushioning etc to suit. The ergonomics for using the seating area are not good. Tray table extends sideways from the console and cannot be moved back or forward, you have to move your seat to gain access to the table, touch screen tv or handset. Etihad has also downgraded the service, no decent amenity pack, no mattress, no pyjamas and food listed in the menu was not available even immediately after take off. The reduction in cabin noise was minimal in my opinion and the cabin was rather cold throughout the 14hour journey. Cabin crew did ask when I wanted to eat but ignored my request to wait for two plus hours and my meal was presented shortly after take off! I have indicated that I would recommend Etihad because of numerous previous journeys but although I have been happy with Etihad in the past I’m no longer convinced that the passenger continues to be considered as important and am not sure that Etihad will be my airline of choice in future.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

I been calling Etihad and emailing them since January and even until today (end of March) there has been no resolution, just the run around and telling me to wait. Why does it take so long to credit miles to an account, the flight is already in my account but displaying zero miles. Poor service and poor management within Etihad.

I have been using Etihad for the last 7 years, initially we were happy with the service. Later on we joined Etihad guest programm, as 4 of us from our family traveling often , and that helps to earn miles. In the past we often didn't get credits for our flight, so we tried to do retroclaim by ourselves but sometimes it didn't work when we upgraded from the economy into business class. We would write to retroclaim centre and that would help, but sometimes even that wouldn't help and we had to ring, but eventually the problem would be sorted out. The last flight of my wife hasn't been credited for a long time but now we need these miles soon in order for us to book the next flight. Despite writing to retroclaim and ringing Etihad which has got the call centre in Belgrade, nothing helped. In the last 7 weeks I rang the Etihad call centre in Belgrade four times and was disappointed how they handled my concern. When I rang for the third time I explained tat I needed these miles in a 10 days time in order to book the next flight. I expected help as I earned the gold Etihad guest card after all these years. The operator  promised to me that she would personally take care of the situation and in 10 days she would update me with the progress by phone call. After 10 days nothing was done so I decided to ring. After waiting for about two and half hours and no one ringing me I rang back and this time spoke to a very rude person who kept interrupting me and basically told me to just wait as they can't help.

Lady at luggage drop first discussed whatever it was for 10 minutes with another passenger, then let a couple unpack and repack their suitcases instead of sending them away to do that elsewhere. Luggage drop is luggage drop, please! My aisle seat that I had chosen during online checking was changed to a window seat. When asked why, no proper answer was given except that the plane was full, the plane is no more or less full whether my seat is changed or not, so this could obviously not be the reason and my aisle seat hat been free when i had checked in. Obviously, they gave it to somebody else who had checked in later than me. After boarding, cabin crew tried for a full half hour to find an aisle seat for a drunk passenger because he said he might need to go to the toilet quickly. I see, drunk hooligans get their wishes filled, on the expenses of other passengers! Then the crew ordered five (!) different people to take the seat beside me, only to make them change again to yet another seat and another seat. What good is online check in if you the crew changes the seats whenever and for whatever reason they please? If a family with 7 people is too stupid to check in online in due time, then let them sit in separate rows and distant seats and don‘t make it the problem of other passengers. Next, the crew chatted again and again with a mother with two young kids instead of serving my and other passenger‘s food. All in all, flight was heavily overbooked, check in and boarding complete chaos, and the crew openly and heavily preferred some passengers over others.

Etihad heavily promote the A380 on all their media platforms. I have paid on average about £3,500 each trip with my decision based equally on the aircraft as well as the airline. What is most disappointing is the lack of engagement from Etihad when I have complained. It appears the concept of customer service is quite an alien one. Oddly on both occasions when Etihad have used 777s instead of the promoted A380s, citing “technical issues”, the. A380 appears to be far from full as a 777 could not accommodate all passengers.

I booked my tickets over the phone with a call centre and the experience was excellent. I was assured as a Velocity Gold Member I would have lounge access in Abu Dhabi both ways, in Sydney and in Rome. I was told only that my changed booking from Bangkok to Danang would not be with Etihad but with Bangkok Airways. I gave the call centre staff member all 3 Velocity membership numbers as we are a family pooler. They were recorded duly. So, all good. I then also, as a precaution, emailed Velocity and Etihad again to confirm lounge access and received a response from both airways advising of lounge access details. Everything was great at Sydney except I was told they could not print off my boarding pass for Abu Dhabi to Rome as there was a problem with their software. Never mind, these things happen. We experienced the lounge in Sydney and it was, it has to be said, pretty solid. Food and drink were on the mark, and service was good.  On arrival in Abu Dhabi, however, things started to unravel. We were shuffled to 3 different places before I was able to be issued my boarding pass. Then off we went to the lounge. On arrival at Al Rheim lounge we were advised we could not access as our forward journey to Rome was operated by Alitalia. Despite the emails I had from both airlines, no go, as it was a codeshare flight. I was advised to write a complaint to Etihad once we were back. So, we wiped our losses and paid for another lounge. On the way back, no lounge in Rome, but we were allowed access to the Al Rheim lounge in Abu Dhabi. However, when we arrived back, things grew worse. I lodged a complaint with the details and evidence. Then we waited for our points and waited. And waited some more. Finally we lodged a request with Velocity and waited the 2 months. We then contacted Velocity again and they said they would need to escalate the issue with Etihad. We were also told by the attendant at Velocity Gold member inquiries that Etihad were ""known"" for this type of behaviour and often allocated points and status credits incorrectly. It has been a lot of work to try and get this mess sorted out. Since January when we wrote a complaint to Etihad we haven't even had a response.

For 7hrs they did not even go around with a tray of drinks!  There was nothing made available in the galley.  No menu. In previous years they would hand out a menu. Not anymore. So they go around and say ""Chicken or lamb"" up to you to work out what it is served with. No cheese, no bread roll. This is cost cutting taken to the extreme. You will also not see any wines or spirit on the trolley, by hiding it they certainly hope to reduce cost. (Remember you have no menu to see what alcohol is on offer) Small toilet bag is now an extra at $22usd (from memory). This used to be complimentary. This was my last flight with Etihad. They have taken cost cutting too far.",Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0
Boeing 787-9,Economy Class,3.0,May 2018,4.0,1.0,4.0,yes,Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi,4.0, |  Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. Even if the Check-In was pretty fast the staff was unpolite and hard to understand. Boarding however was starting early and as a result of it it was completed 10 minutes prior departure. In my opinion the Economy of Etihad is good.  Entertainment has a huge variety. The flight crew was alright however the scale is -1 since several crew members were busy checking their whatsapp messages instead of saying goodbye to the passengers upon arrival to AUH.  Food was very acceptable and drinks have been served 3 times and at any time at your seat if you called them. Eventually the seat was comfortable with beyond standard space. The flight was punctual and safe.,Business,4.0,4.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,London to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  London to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. I flew to Mumbai in February 2017 and submitted a retro claim for the air miles. This claim was submitted only 9 days after the flight but Etihad guest failed to credit the miles. When preparing for another trip to India this year I noticed only then that my guest miles were too low, the legitimate claim for my previous journey had not been applied. I rang customer services who understood my situation and could see my claim on the system, they emailed the retro claim department and suggested I do the same attaching the original claim email. I received an email saying simply that because the flight was more than 6 months ago the miles cannot be credited. I appealed; I once again attached a copy of original claim, and got exactly the same response. I spoke to customer services again. They seemed incredulous that this could not be resolved as it was their error, and they sent another message to the retro claims department. I appealed again myself. And got another email saying the claim is over 6 months old so tough luck. I complained. And received yet another email worded exactly the same as the others! No apology! No acknowledgement of their error! Not even a recognition that my claim was submitted correctly within the 6 month period! No explanation of how my legitimate claim was not processed correctly in the first place! No suggestion of how else this matter could be resolved or compensated for! Just awful customer service.",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,Karachi to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  Karachi to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi. The seats were very uncomfortable and small. The food was worst. They skipped breakfast. I asked why they did not serve breakfast, there was no answer. On a 16 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles, they served a meal twice times and the second meal was served only at the last moment. The sandwich served between the two meals was not edible due to very poor quality. We were hungry throughout the flight. There was no backup plan. There was no fruit basket during the flight while the crew were enjoying eating fruit. The crew were not friendly and had no sense of care for the passenger. If a passenger is hungry or not able to eat their low-quality food, they had no issue.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0
A380,Business Class,1.0,May 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,no,New York to Cairo via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  New York to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. Very unprofessional. They changed my checked in seats and had to fight in both flights to sit next to my wife. They put us all the way at the end of the business class next to the kitchen. 11 hours of kitchen noises / flight attendants in and out. We felt so much pressure just talking to many people in order to get your service done. Food was average. Breakfast was not offered and I guess you have to ask them. I have been through many airlines flying first and business class, I never experienced such unprofessionalism. Filed a complaint, no one even bother to contact.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,Bangkok to Heathrow via Abu Dhabi,1.0," |  Bangkok to Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. I am very unhappy with the airline website and their chaotic seating selection and bidding system for upgrades. I am an older flier and the seat comfort and accessibility is very important to me, but you are unable to book seats until 48 hours before take off, which I think is unacceptable. In addition to this you can bid for upgrades or neighbour free seats. We did this and were offered neighbour free seats on the Abu Dhabi to London leg of the flight, which were subsequently withdrawn. In the meantime we had paid for extra leg room seats and charged for these. On check in we did not have the extra leg room seats, and had been allocated individual seats in different sections of the cabin. The ground crew person at check in could not change this, so we were told to go to the transfer desk in Abu Dhabi where we were given the neighbour free seats we had asked for. It has since taken me 2 months to get a refund of the first seats. In general the seats were very cramped and uncomfortable, and on the first section of our journey we had no option but to sit in an ordinary seat. We are also vegetarian and I ordered an Asian vegetarian meal which is normally acceptable on most flights, however it was very poor. My husband found his lactose-ovo meal disgusting, and could not eat it. Abu Dhabi airport is also awful. It is cramped and scruffy with hardly any comfortable seating, and extortionately expensive food. I will never fly with Etihad again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Boeing 787,Business Class,4.0,May 2018,2.0,1.0,3.0,no,Abu Dhabi to Singapore,4.0," | I was traveling on Etihad Airways to Singapore. I am a Platinum guest with the airline and some of the perks include 20 kg extra on top of my 40 kg. I had a total weight of 64 kg total and being a frequent traveler no airline would even stop at that. At the check-in counter I was asked to pay for the extra weight a total of 450 AED (approximately $120) even if I had 1 kg extra! The check-in staff were indifferent about anything I said and I had to remove everything and carry in my backbag. I ended up with back pain and at the end the weight ended up in the plane, only on my back! I don't see what's the point beside having unhappy customers (even premium ones). Etihad is on self-destruct mode after they posted massive losses and what's worse is that it was not due to operational costs but rather poor investment decisions that are being taken on their customers.",Business,1.0,1.0

Horrible airline and dismissive snobby staff. Will never fly with Etihad. Fly Emirates, they actually pay attention to you. Food is mediocre and you feel as if you’re not valued.",Business,1.0,2.0
