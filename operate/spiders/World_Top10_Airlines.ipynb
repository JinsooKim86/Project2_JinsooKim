       "'   my recent experience in business class was very subpar. first off the seats were angled weird and made it difficult to sleep comfortably. the entertainment remote was also not very responsive. there were way too many announcements causing frequent interruptions in watching movies and dont tell me they are necessary as ive never experienced so many announcements on any other airlines. i booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. on none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that i had preordered my meals. they always asked me what i wanted to order and i had to remind them that i had booked the cook.  on my last leg back home seoul to lax same problem occurred but this time they forgot to serve me breakfast despite being awoken almost 4 hours before landing. they served me the preliminary stuff but then i sat for another hour with no meal served. i went up to one of the flight attendants and she notified me that she accidentally gave my preordered meal to someone else. however 10 minutes later she came out with my correct meal which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me. the head flight attendant was apologetic and offered me a 100 singapore dollar voucher to use on in flight shopping. he told me it was good for one year but i have no idea if i am going to take another singapore airlines flight within the next year and especially not after this poor experience. this was such a disappointing experience.     singapore to london heathrow. efficient boarding process was let down by abrupt manner of cabin crew on entering the aircraft. hot towels were almost thrown at passengers. the lack of finesse continued throughout the flight. the meal choices at dinner and breakfast were poor. on this route it is reasonable to expect one western choice of food. hot drinks were also served with the meal trays so by the time meals had been eaten he drinks were cold unlike on other airlines where a separate drinks service is offered.    i had an unpleasant trip back to singapore from hong kong. firstly the boarding time was 7.15pm. we ended up boarding at 7.30pm. secondly the cabin crew were not that friendly. thirdly the whole entertainment system was down about 34 of the time. yes they compensated us with a 75 gift voucher but the fact is this was my first time with singapore airlines and there were so many problems. before take off the tv that was supposed to show us the safety procedure was disrupted by a technical error. the food was not that tasty compared to korean air who i was flying from korea to hong kong. the ticket i bought was cheap but i believe service could be better.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n singapore airlines was always noted most for their cabin crew attentiveness you read it still in their proud history in the inflight magazine. i think the slogan was singapore girl what a great way to fly. nowadays if you are lucky enough to be in business you will still come across one of these amazing women. however you are more likely to get the totally uncommitted new fleet of cabin crew in economy who view the public as a bit of a nuisance and eye contact has gone. tragedy that whoever is in charge of training cabin staff for this airline is doing a terrible job and losing loyal customers. on my flight sq217 singapore to melbourne 10.45 on july 7 i had a rude male steward ever who did not smile once. back to qantas for this frequent australia to europe passenger.    singapore to auckland paid to fly air new zealand. singapore airlines was the code share. a little disappointed with the singapore leg which was the return flight. business class practically empty so crew were not run off their feet. my husband sitting beside me was served quickly but for some reason i was left waiting on both meal times. he had nearly finished before i was attended to. when the meals arrived dinner and breakfast they were the worst i have had on a flight. the seats are quite comfortable and you have privacy the way it is set out. the movies are quite a bit out of date and the screens arent touch screen so hopefully they will eventually have that.     travelled from new delhi to manila via singapore. the ground crew did not mention anything about the flight delay and did not bother to ask if we had a preferred schedule for our connecting flight. the inflight service was terrible. i asked for earphones from three different flight attendants but was only given one when i typed my request on my ipad. the food was nothing spectacular. the ground crew on my flight from singapore to delhi insisted that i have my backpack checked in and argued that it was too big. i have used the same bag on my flights with klm and emirates and they allowed me to carry it inflight. i have high regards before with this airline but sadly their service has gone downhill.  check in at melbourne airport was efficient. terribly disappointed at the inflight service quality and quantity of food offered and i dont have a large appetite plus the age of the aircrafts. sq tickets are not cheap and not having travelled with sq in a while i was so looking forward to my flight given the inflight service reputation which in my opinion has gone to the dogs.  aircraft was old and used my wet towel to clean the tray table and mess. no bar service  just a round of juice beer and sparkling wine before the meal which was a beyond belief. hot casserole and bread and nothing else  not even salad or dessert. asked the steward for bottle water and was told they only offered tank water.  i said i dont drink tank water and he brought me a small bottle from bc. breakfast was a terrible meal too. on the return one round of bar service provided this time. same story with bottle water request and cabin staff brought me a few extra sealed cups of water off other pax trays.  again horrible breakfast with a hard cold muffin and a poor fruit salad. seats were small and cramped.     rome to melbourne via singapore with singapore airline. the aircraft on both sectors were old and dirty. my seat had bread crumbs and coffee stains and was generally uncomfortable. the meal card says sit back and relax in your luxury seat it was certainly not in economy class. i was made to believe that singapore airlines offered great service however i was unimpressed. food was average drinks sparse and you had to ask and wait for a while for them to return with a drink. some of the flight attendants had no warmth or smile. you would think on long sectors there would be more attention to service however this was not the case. overall disappointing on sq and would think twice before booking again.    \\r\\r\\nwe flew out premium economy and back economy from johannesburg to kuala lumpur via changi. i havent flown with singapore airlines for about 10 years so was expecting a very pleasant flight. the aircraft was brand new and it all looked good and it was except for the attendants. i cant really put my finger on it other than it was impersonal efficient but impersonal. they seemed to be in an awful rush to get us fed and watered and turn the lights off. you didnt see them after that at all and we were in premium economy on the way out. on the way back the flight left at 2am and after hanging around in the airport i was hoping for some good food. however it was not too be  a sandwich was it  you could ask for snacks but who wants crisps at 3am  i felt rather disappointed    not so much if at all premium. i flew with singapore airlines from singapore to melbourne 29072016 in premium economy as part of a return trip to colombo. this was my first time flying premium economy with singapore airlines though i have flown it before with another large asian carrier which was a good experience. i usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. im also tall 194cm and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. i had read a few reviews before the flight all positive about the new premium economy offering from singapore airlines and was interested to see for myself. the boarding at changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. there was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. the seats in premium economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. while they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner and forget about getting much sleep. the foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. the staff were on the positive side not rude but generally unhelpful unfriendly looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra eg. another glass of wine a second cup of coffee authentic hospitality etc. the main meal was very small and surprisingly untasty. the snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but i struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. the meals were so small and mean i was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. the winechampagne if youre very lucky you can get one glass they serve in a plastic tumbler unlike the ad. the staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour which i can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. the entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. it has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. overall singapore pe appeared to me to be a very average economy with a slightly fancier looking seat though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. the service is anything but premium in fact ive had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars. my experience was nothing like the reviews i have read. hanoi to singapore with singapore airlines. i feel that my expectations were really high and i dont feel like there was anything special about singapore airlines. the seat was wide and the ife system was fantastic but i found the food to be terrible and the flight attendants kind of rude.    brisbane to london via singapore. would not recommend flying with singapore airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as i went to book into my flight at brisbane i was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that id have to stow it under the plane. after a long discussion with the manager about how ive never had any trouble before and that itd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 930 when the crew would arrive so i could ask them if i could be made an exception. i came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so i would have to stow the instrument i was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. i was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and i tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. upon arriving back home im sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. what made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldnt be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. i know its not singapore airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but im less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline ive flown has had no problems with it. apart from the guitar the flight was lovely food amazing staff were very friendly and the stewardess knew how to make a mean white russian just wouldnt advise any musicians to take the risk and lose their beloved instrument.   hong kong to singapore. i had high expectations of singapore airlines and may be that contributed to feel very dissapointed towards this overrated airline. majority of people have an pre conception of this airline that is not true. the ground staff in hk is not singapore airlines thereafter when i asked for something as look at my star alliance account they were unable. the plane b777 was old uncomfortable seats. the food was poor and the ife limited. thr flight was late so i had to run from one terminal wing to another to not loose my connecting flight to delhi. appalling customer service in india. when searching for flights singapore airlines is ranked as an expensive airline compared to others in the same route. i dont see why poor service on ground and in the air old planes uncomfortable seats and terrible food. lack of customer service.    in september  october 2016 i flew with my wife around the world using in sequence virgin atlantic air nz and singapore airlines. all in premium economy. the principal airline booked was air nz and their service in premium economy was excellent. unfortunately our flights from auckland to london via singapore were very poor. the standard of singapore airlines premium economy was inferior to air nz and to a lesser extent virgin atlantic. singapore airlines premium economy is marginally superior to economy class and vastly inferior to their business class. during the first hour of my flight from singapore to london i made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. he made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foiltopped water on the food tray. he explained that singapore airlines were relatively new to offering premium economy class. no welcoming drink no menu in seating area alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups meals of appallingly poor standard coffee disgustingly bitter wines of a poor standard. apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and i only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. singapore airlines offers very little in terms of premium service in its premium economy cabin service.    bangkok to singapore. my first time flying with singapore airlines  check in ontime and no queue at all. the ground service i was satisfied with. the aircraft was nice and the seat very comfortable. the inflight entertaiment was not that good and the earphones were also poor. the food is standard but compared to garuda or emirates it is not as good. the cabin crew not that nice  no smile just a straight face.    singapore to brisbane. i am a star alliance gold member for the last 4 years and regular traveler on this sector. recently singapore airlines has decided to replace the regular a330 service with an older much worse boeing 777200er service. i am surprised they would use such old dated cabin in this aircraft my main concern is the poor qaulity entertainment screen also the poor meal service now converted to a brunch and every poor standard better meal served on budget airlines. there was no drinks service before the meals. i hope they review this and revert back to regular a330 service.   melbourne to london via singapore. if you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the terms and conditions. i have been an elite gold krisflyer member for 15 years and have previously considered singapore airlines as one of my preferred airlines. not any more. all i wanted to do was buy an economy class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class my daughter was the passenger. so i went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. the web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that i subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class e tickets are eligible for upgrades. what they dont tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a premium economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. this little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions section f para 24 sub section a which almost nobody ever reads it is 20 pages long. and if you want your money back then there is a 200 cancellation fee. i have cut up my elite gold card and will never fly with singapore airlines again.   singapore to auckland with singapore airlines. this was one of the worst flights i have ever flown. the premium economy area was terrible. firstly no toilets specifically for premium economy. we had to use economy class. the seats were ok but when the person in front reclined their seats we could not move. my husbands seat in fact was broken. the service was terrible  the worst i have experienced in 45 years of travelling. the food was awful and service was too rushed. the staff were unfriendly.  we will not be flying singapore airlines again.    i flew from heathrow to singapore then denpasar to singapore to heathrow. my outward flight was appalling. i am a deafblind traveller the airline was advised of my condition and requirements by both my travel agent and my mother. on boarding the aircraft with my cane i was told where my seat was and nothing else. i had no access to safety instructions or menus. no access to entertainment system no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. i did not know how my chair worked. i was completely ignored on the outbound flight. a complaint was made and i was advised my return flight i would be made comfortable that i would have my needs taken into account. this was not the case again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. singapore airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make reasonable adjustments to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. i could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. i could not use the toilets as i wasnt told where they are. the crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort. i was denied access to all inflight entertainment and felt unable to leave my seat for 13 hours. this is totally unacceptable. singapore airlines have acknowledged their errors but not offered appropriate compensation  an absolute disgrace. my worst ever experience flying.    trip not up to singapore airlines standards behind me and my wife there was a couple with a child sitting the seats with them. three people in two seats the child was very noisy the whole 15 hour flight. we told the flight attendant several times that they had to do something. nothing was ever done. the flight attendants just stayed back in the galley and had a five hour rest in the middle of the flight. not much attention paid to anyone.    singapore to hong kong. outbound leg on singapore airlines a380 stuck in the dreaded middle seat which was awful. attendants were unfriendly and telling me to check in 10 minutes earlier online to get an exit row seat despite me having said i was on the website and it didnt allow me 48 hours beforehand. only 1 friendly member of staff during the trip. fish pasta for special meal was a let down  overcooked and too many bones. inbound service was a little better. standard and expected for the price of ticket i paid but a little too plastic and fake smiles.    melbourne to london return via singapore. have always singapre airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to london. when we booked in january 2015 we could not book premium economy on the mel to sin leg as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. this has now changed but only on some flights. mel to sin in economy an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. the screen was awful so if you flying on another sia flight hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. service was very average ife was poor food was very poor. singapore to london in premium economy the only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. this is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. inflight entertainment was poor a much larger screen so great for movies the only plus. my small hand held control panel did not work. the entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. one ear in the headphones did not work. service was poor  in premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. the service is provided by the economy cabin staff. could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. the toilets are down in economy none near premium economy. food was very poor   economy class food. the only reason why ive given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service but that is still economy class standard food. remember you are paying double the price for this seat. flight arrived 25 minutes late. return legs london to singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. singapore to melbourne in economy  the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. a cold bread roll hard cold butter cold muffin cold unripe fruit.  the tv screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. we had a seat between us so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. i had made a complaint to sq a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. on all counts sq have really dropped the ball. i would not recommend singapore airlines especially if you are looking to fly premium economy.    london to singapore return and the premium economy experience was very poor. despite booking some months in advance they neglected to allocate us any seats together and our party of 4 was distributed throughout the cabin. the seat configuration is 242 and there are no toilets specifically for premium economy. rather than a separate cabin curtained off premium economy is just the front section of the economy section. the seats were functional and inflight entertainment good but seat pitch is less than air nz. the food was terrible. we used the book the cook option on the return flight and this was no better though they did manage to accomodate an allergy in our group. the staff were unfriendly and snacks on the 14 hour flight 2 meals were offered the second 6 hours before arrival had to be requested via the call button. the flight arrived early and the plane was quite new but would not fly singapore airlines again long haul.\\r\\r\\n   moscow to sydney via singapore with singapore airlines. our airplane had a technical issue on the moscow to singapore a350 sq361 leg. passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in moscow airport. sq did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. crew provided little and infrequent information. some passengers panicked and disembarked. we missed our connecting flight to sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. as a result of the delay i was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. the airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened. i spent my time and did that. in return i received a standard email with apologies.    perth to munich via singapore. this is a review of the flight sq328 from singapore to munich on 10th february. the ordeal started in singapore. while the flight was not marked as delayed the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. when i inquired the answer was that we are using the first available aircraft. nice indeed. singapore airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. the flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. however once on board nothing happened at the departure time. no announcements were made. after inquiring again the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. when inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at i got told that the captain is unable to tell. after an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. however while several other aircraft passed us and took off we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. this time an announcement was made that we have a few aircraft ahead of us  after about 20 minutes the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. the result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. this exercise cost another hour. in summary it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. however the captain should have communicated honestly and in particular never taxied out to the runway. it is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. he could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. his lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengerss view. what does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air to add to the picture the aircraft was worn old and super noisy. the service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous singapore airlines standards. this was the second encounter of disappointing singapore airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. things seem to go south at singapore airlines. in general i question the justification of sq having a five star airline rating.    singapore to paris cdg. its been nearly 5 years since i last flew sia and although just a single flight so far i was bitterly disappointed. a380 business class section was looking a bit tired seats worn and not the standards i remember. the biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was almost from start to finish. yes they got the service done but there wasnt a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. i fly a lot of other airlines around asia and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times things seem to have gone the other way for sia. have the return flight next week and will update after that.    singapore to london heathrow. ive flown singapore airlines in economy class long haul several times and been satisfied. on this occasion i decided to opt for premium economy. i was flying from auckland to london via singapore but the first leg was on air new zealand and i recommend their premium economy service. singapore airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than economy and the inflight entertainment screens are bigger but otherwise everything was identical to economy class. im a vegetarian and i had the exact same two meals i had in economy class three weeks earlier and i didnt enjoy them the first time around. my companion ordered the book the cook and his meals seemed better quality but none of the available options were vegetarian. for the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. the service was bored and impersonal throughout the flight attendants were rushing around and didnt smile. the toilets are shared with economy class. for sleeping i didnt find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular economy and the fixed central console means you cant stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. that said im only 53 my 61 companion did appreciate the extra legroom. the entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. however we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme. allinall extremely disappointed didnt feel i got valueformoney compared to regular economy class. this experience has really put me off flying singapore airlines again.    singapore to munich. a recently renovated 777300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. all crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. it started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal i had preordered at both dinner and breakfast indicated that they werent paying much attention. not called by name once just sir with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if i would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was being told i have no idea you ordered a special meal. dinner was very watery as i dont think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. breakfast omelette was cold. after i asked for the regular cereal to be taken away i think that they began heating the special meal i had ordered only at this point. when it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. not offered water between meals had to go to the galley each time. while not the fault of the airline it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. there was no immigration officer at the crew only queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. we were behind a very slow moving contingent of air china passengers. by the time i got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to. landed at about 600 am and was in a taxi at about 900 am which is far too long. the slow processing on arrival in munich reflected the poor quality of the whole experience. luckily the seat was so comfortable i had slept really well.    singapore to jakarta return. i always had a good experience on singapore airlines until december 4 and again december 8 2016. i flew from singapore to jakarta and then back to singapore. when i booked i gave sia my united mileage plus account number so i could get credit for the two short flights. i was told it was in my profile and even showed up on my two boarding passes for both flights. when a month went by and i did not see any credit in my ua mileage plus account for the two sia flights i contacted mileage plus to look into it. i was told by ua that i was not getting credit because my flights were in k class economy and that was ineligible to get miles on united even though sia is a star alliance partner. i then took my complaint to sia who told me something i had never heard of when you book in k v q or n class you only get miles on sia. what i flew on the plane i paid for my ticket and sia only gives miles for their kris flyer program lame .stupid and unfair. part of my flights to singapore part of my trip was on ana and they gave me full mileage credit on ua mileage plus for the nrtsin leg. i will never fly singapore airlines again. lhrsin. i couldnt book the openjaw route i wanted on sqs awful website so booked it as a codeshare with virgin atlantic which made online checkin impossible  vs site said the operating airline was someone else and sq said the booking had been made through a different airline. i phoned vs and they were worse than useless sq at least sympathised and the gent i spoke to said he would send a message to lhr requesting the seat i was hoping for. i was one of the last to checkin and indeed a window on the left had been saved for me so kudos for that. boarding was ok although the cabin crew in my area didnt speak much english which complicated some pax requests for reseating. first meal service was ok lots of movies but not many good ones seat comfortable and managed some sleep. one reason i booked sq was to enjoy an asian style breakfast so you can imagine my frustration that despite distributing a lavish eight page printed menu to economy passengers which included three breakfast options including a tastysounding pork and noodles exactly what id had in mind they were only able to offer chicken sausage with frittata which was as disgusting as it sounds. arrived on time and customs and baggage claim was pretty quick. beyond being deposited at the destination safely and on time sq fell short of expectations. will not go out of my way to fly them again. sq232 30 june syd  singapore sq366 1st july singapore  rome. economy was ordinary on my flight sydney to rome. sound quality from the headphones awful seat recline was terrible and the flight attendants gave dagger looks if you wanted a drink throughout the flight if it wasnt during meal service. business class sydney  singapore  delhi  mumbai  singapore  brisbane. sydney to singapore was the only leg which had the newer style business class seats which are good although in seat power was not working for the entire duration of the flight. each of the other legs were on dated planes with the older style business seats not so great. of particular concern was the singapore  brisbane flight where the seat and its surrounds were visibly dirty. my biggest gripe was the mumbai  singapore night time flight. upon boarding the crew handed out menus and asked if i wanted to be disturbed to eat dinner  which i did after the atrocious mumbai lounge experience standing room only. sure enough i fall asleep and wake up when tables are being set for dinner  i request my meal only to be told that they hadnt heated anything for me so i would just have to wait until after they had served everyone else. no offer of a drink or anything from the crew. being a late night flight the idea of starting dinner 45 minutes after everyone else was not good. i ended up having to ask the crew to give me a bread roll and that the only food i got will never fly again. subsin with sia in economy class. flight was delayed by one hour due to late arrival from sin. once on board the crew distributed hot towels but not all passenger got it. food was edible and the entertainment system worked well. the inflight service was not so good some fa were just friendly whereas the others were not. a steward even raised his voice while asking my little boy to switch off his ipad around 40 minutes before our arrival at the changi airport. all in all for the price i paid it was not what i expected from a 5 star airline. sin to zurich. return amsterdam to sin. as usual when i fly on singapore airlines the food service is their strongest suit  excellent except for the wine which is closer to vinegar than alcohol. seats are alright but not any more comfortable than on other airlines. ife system awkward to use and earbuds uncomfortable. their weakest point staff service. flight attendants polite but extremely robotic and not particularly friendly. they always seem to be reading from a script when talking to passengers. crew on just about any other airline do a much better job of making customers feel welcome. sydney to singapore 27th july 2013 sq232 and returned 13th august 2013 on sq211. outbound flight was good on the a380. attendants robotic but efficient nonetheless even though they took their time responding to request buttons. seats arent the worst but not the best. recline was good seat pitch not so much. i enjoyed the meals on this flight especially the western steak cooked perfectly. nothing too troublesome. the return leg however was very disappointing on a tattered b777 aircraft. seats were extremely uncomfortable with small recline and an industry standard 32 inch seat pitch. crew were far less attentive than the first leg. it took different crew trying to ask for some basic toiletries or a glass of water. seat back tvs were tiny and intermittently froze throughout the flights. overall whilst the first flight was above average the return was far from acceptable. a380 singapore to milan. sub standard champagne average at best food average wines with food. this was a night flight. cabin attendant allowed children to enter from economy and exit their parents in business class near me and this resulted in a minimum of sleep for me and perhaps others around these parents. flew bali to lhr via singapore on 4th oct. bali to singapore on 777200 showing its age very small screen to view films etc but no big deal as flight was just over 2 hours. ran out of my choice of meal but crew were great. singapore to lhr on 777300 er instead of a380 but managed to get two seats together at the back of the plane. food quality not great and they again ran out of my meal choice for breakfast. large seat back screen and plane was fitted with new krisworld system so plenty of choice of films tv shows etc. no trolley drinks service after take off just crew with a tray of water juice and beer. arrived from london with my fiance. we bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. our problem isnt that we couldnt sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the singapore airlines staff. one particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. we gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasnt interested when we questioned her. a senior crew noticed this and was professional in trying to make up for it but by then we were fed up at the inadequacy and total lack of customer service. i have been travelling on sia for last 12 years. i find the standard of service dropping every time i take the airline in the recent past. nz to singapore is a long trip. the service was really poor never got what was requested. food was bad did not even bother to eat my final meal on the return trip to nz. some staff rude their standard of service was bias on the type of passenger. july trip was the worst airline experience i have had in my 20 years of airline travel. very substandard service. in future travelling on sia is not a status but a necessity. nrtlax a380 upon boarding cabin crew guided me to the wrong side of cabin and wrong seat. no menu was provided for the entire flight and i did not know which champagne or wine i was drinking nor did i know what to expect for dinner or breakfast. only for the main course entree did the cabin crew provide a quick booklet which after choosing was quickly taken away again. after asking cabin crew for a little help to figure out how to convert my seat into bed i was asked if it was my first time with singapore airlines i am krisflyer gold. cabin crew never asked if i wanted to be awaken for breakfast which i did not. after waking me up and providing me with a cup of coffee i waited 50 minutes for breakfast to be served. again no menu. a rather disappointing service. perth to houston tx on sq 062 my wife and i. flight to moscow aborted at last minute routed to warsaw where singapore airlines had no affiliation. sat on plane for 2 hours after landing in warsaw then escorted to airport. once in the lounge and able to check flights we saw we had been booked on a flight to paris and to houston the next morning. went to gate and told we had no ticket for this flight went back to where we originally left and there was a sa rep. after some time told we could not take this flight. told to gather luggage and go to a hotel. told we were being put on a plane to copenhagen then to chicago and then to houston arriving 36 hours after planned arrival. inquired why we could not take flight to paris as previously scheduled connection time now too close and airline would not book. in summary i have been flying internationally my entire oil field career over 30 years i have experienced delays cancellations reroutes etc. i have never seen such a poor handling of a situation as this. i have always chosen singapore when possible but will think twice in the future. sq 345 zrh to sin 9 dec 2013. the a380 was late due to non communicated reasons  no economy class in upper deck were available thus our long lasting reservations were cancelled and we got rather poor seats in the aft of the airplane. the meal was overcooked thus not edible service was nonexistent we had to get our drinks ourselves in the galley.¨it was the lousiest flight to asia we have experienced. on 151113 flight from brisbane to singapore leaving at 23.45 was the worst flight with this airline. old plane no leg room poor service i was flabbergasted as i have been flying with them for years. coming home the plane was up to their usual standard but i will be very wary of flying or recommending them in the future. 18th december from brisbane to singapore. i have been taking varied airlines such as qantas emirates for this same route over the years. i have to say that i am quite disappointed with the service and that there has indeed been a decline in sias standards in this area. i ordered a special vegetarian oriental meal whilst checking in online. as it was served first our drink orders were not taken. my vegetarian meal came with only a piece of bread and the main meal. it was extremely oily and i had no salad or fruit to go with it. i was also refused a dessert as i was told special meals had their own desserts. i never received anything. i was also never served a drink until i asked the stewardess clearing the trays if i could get one. even then she said she would get back to me and never did. i also tried to do some inflight shopping but the airline had extremely limited stock of the products in the catalogue. most of the products were not in stock at all. i think compared to the competitors for this same leg sia is definitely below average. i would think twice before paying this much when i can get a cheaper flight with better service. flew economy from la to sin in may 2013. the seat is spacious and provides enough legroom. however i was utterly disappointed with the service. i fell asleep when they were handing out the meals. i woke up when all the passengers were just about to dig in and i immediately asked for my meal. but i was told that they had run out of lunch and the rude air stewardess walked away without offering anything else. arent they supposed to have enough meals for everyone even though the air stewardess offered 2 small bags of chips later this still did not make up for it. light snacks for main meal i dont think so. melsin business in december. i was surprisingly disappointed on this trip aboard their 777300er aircraft. granted the newer business class was not yet installed but overall i wasnt all that impressed with the quality of the seat which looked rather tired. the lounge in melbourne is barely comparable to a domestic virgin australia lounge since they have split it into businessfirst and had a very poor food and beverage offering. despite requesting not to be woken for breakfast service during the flight to maximise sleep i was. not a picky traveler and not a regular business traveler either but found myself a little disappointed at the offering considering the hype. a380 lhr to sin ok seats less comfortable than original seating plan. inflight entertainment faulty but viewable. boeing 777200 to christchurch on tired and dated planes. terrible seats and 17 inch. return journey no inflight entertainment for 40 seats from take off. after 9 hours rebooted system as ife had now gone down in business also. poor that it was now clear the problem could have been solved sooner if they were at all bothered. terrible customer service. boeing 777300 new touch screens but the plane noise is so loud almost impossible to hear the movies when sat just behind wing. no snacks offered during 13 hour flight. not recommended. economy class from surabaya to singapore on feb 23. sq operates a330 on this route. seating arrangement is 2x4x2. we were given the middle section 4 seats as we traveled with one child and one infant. the seats were comfortable enough with generous leg room. food was not as tasty as silk air and only one option left at that time when the fa served me. very disappointing all in all still unhappy with the sia inflight services i personally think the services are going downhill. we are long time kris flyers our flights sq 224 and sq 866 7 april 2014 perth  singapore singapore  hong kong there were no problems as was sq 805 22 april 2014. beijing  singapore however sq 223 25 april 2014 singapore  perth what a shambles full flight cabin staff were more interested in special meals etc. eventually after a 1.5 hour delay we were served lunch you read about staff not answering call button this happened to us eventually our call was answered there was definitely a problem. no coffee and tea was brought around eventually my husband took our meal trays down to the back galley only to be met with oh we forgot on leaving the aircraft  there was not one cabin crew member to be seen. singapore airlines in its heydays was the service and efficiency pacesetter amongst international airlines. unfortunately it has lost much of its shine and has reduced itself to relying on price advantage to survive the onslaught by more progressive truly international airlines which are more in tune with todays international travellers. case in point during my last 2 trips from melbourne to singapore and back on first and business class 1 cabin crews lack communication and english language skills most are not able to carry a decent mature conversation. 2 male crews lack discipline and female crews rushing around like preprogrammed robots without genuine warmth. 3 filthy leather seats and the lack of general cleanliness show up an ageing tired airline. 4 second rate food even in first with badly stocked kitchens without essentials such as soy milk for coffee and fresh chilli sauce for food. and the list goes on. wake up singapore the world has moved on. flight sq 308 9th june 2014. the worst business class seat too wide no support hard as a rock. you cant sit comfortably in any position and it is pathetic to lie on. my back actually aching on arrival. never again. food lousy choice too small service without a smile and even then only when you asked. no pyjamas sin to london and one meal served with no cloth at all. used to be great. flying back emirates and saving 1250 per seat on top. icnsinbne. both flights very poor service offered by staff if you could find them icnsin did not see flight attendants for a full hour after take off no offer of any drinks before take off or after. poor selection of lunch offered  braised beef with lentils staff hid behind curtain no offer of refills during a 5 hour flight. sinbne  fas were rude midnight flight there was no offer of any snacks during 8 hour flight and made to feel i was an inconvenience when asking for a drink. breakfast meal received 6 hours into flight was rubbish. have flown economy with singapore and it was fine. i thought flying business class was going to be an amazing experience it was just terrible. rude staff and poor service. will never fly with them again as it was such a waste of a lot of money singapore to auckland sq281 777200. cant believe singapore still use this aircraft it desperately needs an overhaul tiny 6 inch displays no touch even with full brightness i was struggling switched to using my tablet instead. seat rests do go fully up. service was poor this time around food normally in economy is ok to good this wasnt. not a nice way to come back to nz. will consider other options. gold frequent flyer with singapore airlines for last seven years. regularly upgrade to business class. singapores new planes are for the most part very good. there is however an increasing indifference to ff status in economy. the last three economy trips singapore sales staff on allocating seating have assured me that no aisle seats further forward are available. when checking online however there have been several  its just that the aisle seats have been beside other vacant seats. sq975 bkksin a330 j  i was looking forward to my first flight with singapore in what some consider the best business class in the sky. the seats on a330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you dont hold onto it. this can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines business class. the previous passengers socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work. the meal was good but drinks service was infrequent. all in all this experience was comparable to a domestic business class on a us carrier  certainly far short of the singapore airlines i was expecting. flew from osaka to sin. no bottled water provided. requested the japanese breakfast and the meal came without the fish. anyway shared the fish with my daughter who ordered the same meal and it was very salty. requested warm water twice and the crew earnestly promised but never delivered. upon landing while the aircraft was still cruising we could hear the crew arguing loudly among themselves as we occupied the last few row of seats  very unprofessional. i have recently flown hkgsinhkg on b777200 economy. singapore airlines not only did not meet the expectations but were also below the average level of other airlines. the plane was old. the seats were old and the inflight entertainment system was outdated. the selection of movies was very limited. the food served on board was basic. the meals were served long after take off forcing you to be awake for the most part of the flight and fall asleep just when it is time to land. never again. we took four long haul flights with singapore airlines in june and july and were frankly disappointed. on one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when i would have liked to see out. after that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. on two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. on one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. we paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. in contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between manchester and heathrow so it can be done i returned economy class from the uk on a londonsingapore on an airbus a380800 and singaporebrisbane on an airbus a330300. the previous flights out had been great mainly because the planes were only 34 full so everyone could spread out. however the flights back to australia were jampacked and sitting there squashed in my seat like the proverbial sardine i came to the realisation of what the airline had in mind when it purchased the a380 and it wasnt my comfort. further this aircraft seems to be simply a larger version of what was available before so it takes ages to board and disembark as there are so many more people. in the departure lounge those of us in economy were forced to endure cognitive dissonance having to stand in a queue while those in business and first class were given priority boarding. cant these people be whisked into the aircraft out of sight the a330 on the singaporebrisbane leg seemed to be quite aged. further it was freezing. a few things were broken eg the lid on the rubbish bin in the toilet. this seemed a basic thing to be broken also rather unhygienic. the sinks appeared to be stained. there does not seem to be enough toilets for the numbers of people on the plane. economy class seating seems to be encased in metal with no padding to soften the blow. when the metal gets cold due to the freezing temperature this metal is decidedly uncomfortable. the thin polyester blankets supplied are barely adequate. they need to be twice as large and several times the tog rating ameliorate the cold. the things the airline boast about  food entertainment service  are all quite good but in the end i would be happier to spend the entire flight lying down in silence in darkness with a warm blanket and perhaps a good book that i can read by the light of my iphone. rome to perth october 17. older 777. good seats. ife still bad but everything else good on to rome to singapore leg. the singapore to perth leg was not what you would expect from singapore airlines. the crew were really rushing everything. not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. it looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. the cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. the coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. there was no respite this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. i am sure this is an isolated incident i will still fly with them though. ccu to sin in the first week of january 2015. had a seat in row 36 and as part of the boarding process was made to stand in a queue one for different sets of rows for forty minutes. this is a ridiculous ground staff strategy to ensure organised boarding. considering the flight duration is ~4 hours with a pre 5 a.m. landing the cabin lights were on for most of the flight for catering and dutyfree shopping. for a 5star airline the handling of boarding and the management of the cabin left a lot to be desired. flown from sin to bne in business. the aircraft an older a330 seats were not flat the service acceptable but not 5 stars. breakfast was not hot but just lukewarm. for that reason i was not keen in eating it. in my humble opinion that is the product is totally overpriced and it selling it on the name only. after the emerging of the middle eastern carriers you can see the features and benefits other airlines give you. other airlines talk about. please dont get me wrong the airline is acceptable and is better than other airlines but compared to what you pay and what you get i am sorry i would not like to buy this product again. i took 2 flights with sq in business class last week sq173 sgnsin  main dish was inedible  overcooked. sq528 sinmaa  understaffed business class cabin could not prepare the food in time for half of the passengers 90 min wait between the first and second course. less than impressed. rather tired looking 777 to singapore. tv kept changing between colour and black and white. seemed understaffed for the number of passengers on board. return flight on an a380  no sound at my seat. again seemed understaffed for a full plane. trying to change flight date even with changeable ticket was painful. we recently flew from singapore to christchurch new zealand. we are frequent business class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. the cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. dinner took a long time to be served. we were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. i woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether i would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. i agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. the french toast i ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. the flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. the most disappointing thing was when i reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that meals are served two and a half hours before landing. im not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on singapore airlines were good. the flight was on 7th february from singapore. densin april 2014. a330 was nice and clean. comfortable seat and good food. only complaint is staff tossed out the meals as soon as the plane had levelled off and seemed in a rush but didnt follow it up with much service. i expected at least a drink service business class after all and there was nothing you would have had to hit the call button to get service. will know next time to request items from singapore staff and not wait for service. i flew business class from singapore to delhi two days ago and the service was extremely poor and shoddy. we were flying in from brisbane by singapore airlines and took the flight to delhi after a stop over at changi airport. so i was in a position to compare the service on two flights of the same airlines. while on the flight from brisbane the service was good on the flight to delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct  very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. on a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad. money badly spent. cphsindpssincph outbound on 15th of may and return may 21 four segments. must say that i am very disappointed at their service performance. having flown many times on sq i did not expect almost rude service from some of the cabin crew attendants. this is not the 5 star sq that i am use to. cphsin was an old refitted 777200er with an entertainment system from stone age. the food was quite tasty tough. next time i fly to south east asia i will definitely choose other options like qatar airways or thai. much better value for money. travelled on sq211 on 16 may 2015 singapore to sydney in economy seat 32g. flight was full mainly connecting passengers coming in from india. our second light meal was served very late almost at the time when the pilot made the announcement for cabin crew to prepare flight for arrival and some passengers including myself were still waiting to be served it was rather stressful to rush through my meal knowing the plane was arriving soon. apparently the reason why the second meal was served so late was due to the high volume of special meal requests from the indian passengers. i am a kris flyer frequent traveller and travel often on the singapore to sydney leg and have experiencedobserved this problem before where the meals are served later than usual because cabin crew are serving a high volume of special meal requests. perhaps sia need to review the management of special meals on future flights where there are many passengers travelling from india to sydney via singapore. it will be interesting to ask sia how they will manage if 90 of the passengers have special meal requests on one flight so this was quite a let down in service for me. i also have a suspicion that the in flight meals served have become smaller and lighter in portions. another problem was my seat tv did not have entertainment on demand it was most disappointing especially when i was informed while most of the other passengers had entertainment on demand programs mine was one of the few that did not have it surely this type of problem should be noted by cabin crew at the end of its last flight for service maintenance. i think sia needs to pull up its socks to maintain its renowned high standards brisbane to bangkok return. all flights on time. all full. i havent flown sa for 12 months now and i feel the service on board is slipping. only three flight attendants to serve a full flight in the back section. no drinks except tea or coffee offered at meal times. i asked for a soft drink and got given a half a plastic cup. serving a big chunk of chicken on a plane when crowded is virtually impossible to cut. i had to leave it. breakfast hasnt changed in 10 years. still the same old cold bread roll and cake. planes seem old and dirty. my bag didnt make my bangkok flight and was sent on the next one. why this happened i do not know. flew sindxbsin first time in singapore airlines business class. service was poor on the outbound leg. planes are quite old. middle east airlines business class much better emirates etihad qatar airways. wine glasses very small. general impression was not as good as i had expected of sq. first time on singapore airlines. lounge in sydney very basic. apparently a renovation is in progress. seat uncomfortable in comparison to others staff did their job but without enthusiasm . food good. wine selection very average. toilet at front of aircraft fantastic in size. disappointing compared to reputation.  after 1015 years of flying singapore i think ill finally stop now. over the last 23 years the service quality has become dire. plane age and upkeep seems to be getting worse with cabins uncared for. my biggest ire is the decrease in service for economy or overworking the premium seats. both in london singapore and auckland ive seen that they now have 34 check in desks for business with no customers yet only 1 for economy with an hour long queue. the last flight sinath an argument broke out between staff and customers while boarding as the staff tried to push past boarding economy customers to serve juice to the business passengers. i may not pay quadruple price to sit in business but i am still a paying customer. sorry singapore youve tried to compete with the uae for business passengers and alienated the rest in the meantime. i recently flew singapore airlines from milan to singapore. the ground staff provided excellent service however the service on board was not to the level of a 5 star airline. the crew seemed in a hurry to get done and rest. the level of attention went below the average airline. the food served lunch and breakfast was acceptable but below some airlines. the seat is comfortable and equipped with all you need onboard usb charger latest generation entertainment system etc. on this route they provided an excellent wifi service at an affordable price. in all the service onboard did not justify the amount of money spent for the fare. my husband and i flew with singapore airlines from sydney to london via singapore with our 9 month old twins and our older son. we purchased an extra ticket for one of our twins to give us extra space. they initially had us all over the flight. eventually just before boarding they allowed my husband and i to sit together but we lost the extra seat we purchased and they had three babies in a row this meant it was so cramped none of the babies could sleep and they all ended up screaming for the entire flight setting each other off we bought the extra ticket to avoid this scenario. i noted that there were spare bassinets and empty rows elsewhere on the plane so that wasnt the issue. neither we nor the other parents or surrounding passengers were pleased. singapore airlines are trying to do the same thing to us on our upcoming trip on the way home. they are arguing that since one of our infants has a child seat the baby isnt an infant and cant have a bassinet therefore since the other twin has a bassinet we cant be seated together. they wont budge so one parent with have to juggle one baby on their lap somewhere else on the plane whilst the other parent has the other baby in front of a bassinet. thats apparently more logical to them then just seating us together. so it becomes impossible to sleep eat or go to the bathroom. we will never fly with singapore airlines again. worst customer service experience ever. singapore to sydney on a pretty tired and shabby singapore airlines boeing 777. seemed to be few cabin crew and lacking on inflight entertainment options. this felt like it had been flying since the mid 90s. no floor space as there was an ife box that took up most of the legroom in the footwell area. my husband and i have been very strong supporters of singapore airlines over many years. because of the crew and food. we travel regularly with stopovers in singapore for weeks en route to australia. had always found the cabin crew the best that is sadly not the case anymore. san francisco to hong kong via singapore and both crews were unfriendly  they only smiled and chatted when they were together preparing meals. they seemed badly trained  meal time was a debacle  instead of pushing cart they seemed to be taking trays here and there. by the time i received my meal it was cold  they never came and offered extra drinks teacoffee. took ages to clear trays  in fact passengers were returning trays to meal area. when kids cried there were no crew trying to help in any way  they were hidden most of the time. they found it very hard to smile their training seems to have declined  its not just important enough to look after the business section people in economy used to be treated well too. the food is as bad as the us airlines and now the crew is behaving like the crew on us airlines. i find it sad that i will have to try and find another airline. my daughter in law flew from singapore to geneva and zurich to singapore and she struggled with her 11 month old till she complained to the supervisor and then they changed the attitude really is that what we all have to do singapore airlines needs to get back the charm and friendliness it once possessed.  i hope when i return to the us i will find a big improvement in crew. if not sadly i will not be be traveling on sia again. downgraded on honeymoon. paid for premium economy seats as a pleasant surprise for my new wife but forced to take economy seats. singapore airlines say they had to change the aircraft and so the aircraft we were put into had no premium economy seats. it seems to me it was easier to put on us another aircraft and apologise rather than find an aircraft with the appropriate class seats. there were others on our flight who were downgraded like us. given the segment was from singapore to london  it was coming from their hub. i find it hard to imagine that they didnt know in advance they were doing this and at the very least to offer a refund. instead we were pulled aside as we were getting on the plane despite having boarding passes with premium economy allocated seats and offered an upgrade voucher for another flight from economy to premium economy. we could not use the upgrade voucher as we are not in a position to travel long distance in the next year before it would expire. it would also have meant we would have had to fly from melbourne to singapore to use this voucher  and then pay to fly all the way back too i emailed singapore airlines 3 times and did not have a satisfactory response  the offer was that we could use the voucher on any segment i dont think there are many segments longer than singaporelondon so that would be a win for them and 500 in travel vouchers for use in the next year with singapore airlines  again not practical for us. my partner and i last flew business class with singapore airlines from rome to melbourne in 2006 and every aspect of that flight was excellent so we were looking forward to the trip from melbourne to london via singapore. first of all we were very disappointed with the seat. it may well be the broadest business class seat amongst the airlines but it is very hard to sit on. i felt very uncomfortable after 5 minutes. singapore airlines have obviously spent a lot of money installing leather seats but they have seriously overlooked the comfort factor. if youre travelling with a loved one the new pods do not permit easy communication. secondly you have to make the seat into a bed yourself. this approach is just not good enough. for example on air new zealand the crew ask you when youd like to lie down and make your bed up for you. the service was just average. i asked for a 2nd cup of coffee with my breakfast on 2 occasions but this request was ignored. overall i was not impressed with singapore airlines and did not get my moneys worth. flew from london heathrow to singapore changi. with singapore airlines there is always this high standard that most airlines aspire to achieve in terms of service. and because of this i am compelled to write one especially when they fall below their own minimum standards. this is one rare flight where the air stewardess was rude to a passenger never smiling forgiveable and non apologetic when it came to dropping cutleries on her. to top it up she even pouted annoyingly when the passenger was not awake when meal was served. rare indeed and ultimately undid all the good things her colleagues did on this same flight.    my wife and i thought we would treat ourselves to premium economy on a recent holiday to southeast asia on both the main legs london to and from singapore. we usually fly ba premium economy but this was part of a package and we upgraded the flight. we are in our 70s and cannot cope with economy over 13 hours to say we were disappointed would be an understatement. the only good thing is the seat but the service is very poor. firstly if you book the cook  a preordered meal it will be served long before anyone else. the promised champagne and drinks service did not materialise and staff did not curtain off the cabin from economy and were constantly moving through the cabin to serve economy passengers. this is an expensive airline with a lot of online hype about the premium economy service. we were allocated row 31 which has extra legroom but as the seat plan shows it is right next to the galley and we were constantly disturbed throughout the whole flight. under no circumstances would i use this cabin again  not a patch on ba    singapore to munich and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. boarding at changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. checkin staff passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. on boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then i know of. there was a sense of disorganisation. the senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. once in the air meal and drink service was conducted. i use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which i find bit awkward. again the meals can be elabotate for this class but i found portions are small and not filling. service lacked enthusiasm warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. some were good and some were kind of forced to work. sia provides good entertainment system so while watching movies i decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didnt see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. on one of the flight i asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by european standards with the reason given that europeans only drink strong coffee. the crew in back galley were sad and angry. on the positive side sia 777300 has spacious toilets. entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. all in all muc flights are out of singapore airlines pattern. i read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to muc and found to be negative. i have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it i do recommend singapore airlines. i hope sia will rectify the crew issue on this segment and hear the plight in catering segment for premium economy on all segments.    flew roundtrip on singapore airlines new nonstop route between san francisco and singapore in premium economy on the outbound and regular coach class upon returning. the premium seat was decent but i wasnt as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. with the hard partition toward business class in front and the service area  galley located well to the rear past an economy section the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual deadend rarely patrolled by flight attendants. on the sfosin sector received two meals during the 16h20m flight with no other proactive service  no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. you had to press the call button for anything midflight snacks were available but again nothing was offered voluntarily. flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. no landing cards handed out. except for the seat itself the service on the return flight sinsfo in regular economy was actually better with a prelunch drinks run from a tray not a full cart and followup hot beverage service after the meal. as with the outbound flight however the second meal service  a breakfast  took place about six hours before landing what gives the checkin experience at sfo was ok but at sin economy passengers are herded toward self checkin kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. i have only flown sia once before but based on my limited experience with them so far i wouldnt go out of my way to fly them  although i would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point.    first time with singapore airlines. got to sydney airport early. checked in online and dropped bags. friendly ground crew directed me to business class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. no issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. boarding at gate 61 a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full a380. departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in sin. meal ok but cabin crew seemed almost robotic rehearsed and fake. lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. seat 60k in economy. after sometime realized my back was aching. discovered that seat had no lumbar support some did mine didnt and couldnt fully recline either. not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to sin. didnt bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. entertainment system a bit dated probably the original system used with the first a380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. had about 200 movies but i mostly listen to music while flying. choice of music was mediocre so decided to use my ipod instead. no free wifi quota. same continued on sincmb leg except seat had lumbar support this time didnt turn on entertainment system this time. i think sq is highly overrated and not a patch on emirates or even some non 5 star airlines. would consider others before sq next time.    hong kong to surabaya via singapore. i have been flying with singapore airlines in economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that i really like flying with them. however my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. the crews seemed disorganized very mechanic and provided slightly chaotic andor unnecessary stressed meal services. the first beverage service consisted of prefilled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the fa carried through the aisle. kinda strange. why not hand out little wine bottles as lufthansa does and cans of beers instead if no one takes the cups do they pour them out the planes were fairly old featuring ancient inflight systems. i also dislike with singapore airlines that during online set selection one is only being shown very few available seats  and when you sit down the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. i understand that there always are last minute changes but i still notice a repeating pattern with other airlines within star alliance i usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with sia. the food was good. overall if singapore airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. the fare was not cheap yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of krisflyer and mediocre doesnt justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers.    singapore to san francisco. i previously had positive things to say about singapore airlines but in this case i was very frustrated. i paid extra for an upgraded seat with extra legroom. instead the seat was in front of the exit door and had less legroom. in addition the tv was broken and so for the entire 16 hour flight i could not watch any tv. two thumbs down.    hong kong to brisbane via singapore with singapore airline. it is a disappointing travel experience. the flight from hong to singapore sq871 was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. yet my next flight from singapore to brisbane sq255 was going to depart in about 40 minutes. it was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. a better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. as soon as i landed in singapore the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that i had to make a report after landing in brisbane. however no further detail was given and i was not sure where and who to talk to. the flight from singapore to brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between singapore and brisbane offices about my luggage. when i landed in brisbane i was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. i would appreciate if i was given a better instruction in singapore or at least before landing so that i would not need to run around in the airport. i told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. however she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. she told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and i had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since i went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but i did not respond. however i did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. when i asked her whether my luggage was in brisbane or singapore she was not sure. i wouldve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything. i am not upset about my luggage not being able to get on my second flight but im deeply disappointed about the service and how the staff handled it. i will never take singapore airline or recommend to my family and friends.    cape town to singapore. dont bother to hang your jacket. dont bother to help open up your bedding but one has to struggle with it oneself. rude interaction. dont bother to help with opening the table for meals. often forget to offer some passengers cheese and fruit when it is standard for all business class. poor lounge food choice with only indian food available to eat. dont allow couples to travel together.    munich to ho chi minh city via singapore. i will never fly with this airline again. my wife and i booked two seats from madrid to ho chi minh city in vietnam. we had a big drama at the airport in munich because 20 min before departure their ground crew decided to asked us for a return flight from vietnam. we had the approval letter from the vietnamese immigration letter which was shown to them. the only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. this information was cooverrated by the immigration department in vietnam upon our arrival to hcmc. it is also important to note that this wasnt our first time in vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. what really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. it was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot only having 10 minutes or so to do it. we almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. to make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. one of the staff members didnt even bother to use the word please. how can these people work in the traveltourism industry on arrival to vietnam we found out that both of our suitcases were damaged. the airline did replace them however we had to go through the drama of filling out formstaking photos at the airport after a very long flight.    singapore to colombo with singapore airlines. the check in has been fully automated. you have to tag your own baggage and no staff is around to assist. crew is quite rude and didnt care much about the passengers. food is bland and the service is not that good. wouldnt recommend. i think singapore airlines is losing its quality.    jakarta to singapore. the arrival of sq960 was delayed and our flight sq961 was delayed even further. this was on july 7th. the congestion at the airport meant more waiting and the captain allowed passengers to call family and friends to inform them of the severe delay whilst we were on the runaway behind 6 planes. it was not a refitted 777300 but as i did not have any passenger next to me it was fine. there was no wifi on board. this was a routine short haul flight. the flight attendants served dinner they looked stressed and very little smiles but i guess its understandable.    perth to singapore on the 3rd july and the most horrible flight experience i could get from a full service airline. inattentive staff cold food broken inflight entertainment equipment and terrible service.  i was with a friend when i boarded this flight and going back to singapore after a semester of studies in perth. we just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow singaporeans on the sia flight. however we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. first 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. the next 2 forgot our orders. throughout these 5 encounters we were received with rude attitudes which irritated annoyed and angered us. it was a truly frustrating flight. a flight attendant also missed me when serving meals had to be served by another from the other aisle. apart from that inflight entertainment was faulty didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. my remote had 1 button missing. meals were not hot and rice was hard. i had previously tried scoot for the first time from singapore to perth. although the food was terrible they provided a quality of service that could rival a full service airline and definitely beat the one provided by sq on this particular flight.  before this flight i absolutely adored sq. now i am seriously considering boycotting this airline for the treatment i received on flight. i seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for sq had moved on to serve in scoot.  i dont think any customer deserves to be put through the horrible treatment my friend and i received on this flight. i honestly would have liked not having to sit through this torture.    flew singapore airlines from delhi to singapore. the flight from delhi to singapore went well. however the crew on the singapore to adelaide sector were terrible i had to witness a dirty toilet early in the morning before landing. seats were pretty uncomfortable as well.\\r\\r\\n    my wife and i flew to london last week with a singapore stopover choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on qantas premium economy. we expected singapore airlines another favourite carrier to offer a similar product and we had both had good singapore airlines flights before. but this flight was a terrible disappointment and poor value for money. we are not looking forward to the return flight next month. with singapore airlines premium economy you get a wider seat and better leg room. at the airport you check in separately and theres a more generous luggage allowance. but thats all you get. we got the same food as economy poor food compared to previous singapore airlines economy flights. the flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. perhaps they were run off their feet the only smiles were the neonlight style turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. when the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top but it was not offered. we were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. i requested a glass of red and was given it. ive no idea what sort of wine it was. the curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best and far from what singapore airlines has offered in the past. nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine tea of coffee. after each meal it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. my wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. flight attendants were there but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. on the long night flight leg to london a day later it was much the same. we were not even offered eye masks though i was given one when i requested it. ive never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasnt offered. the curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. as we approached london our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. but it hadnt finished yet on arrival at heathrow people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. no flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off not even a cabin announcement. most cabin announcements during were barely audible even in an aircraft as quiet as an a380 so that might not have made much of a difference. to sum up we used to praise singapore airlines to the skies but the scales have fallen from our eyes.this was an appalling way to start our holiday and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.    rome to melbourne via singapore. check in rome was quick efficient and friendly but from there it was all downhill. singapore airlines use a common use airline lounge in rome not affiliated with any specific airline. lounge is very dated and standing room only when full as it was on this day. food offerings were a stale pound cake and a bowl of nuts. the bar area was covered in dirty used glasses.  i left the lounge and bought water from a vending machine. the aircraft was a refitted 777 that looked every bit its 16 years old. the purser was very friendly and the rest of the crew in business class were also alright on the rome to singapore leg. the seat was large but very uncomfortable in seated and bed positions. the meal was not great and quality sub standard. the next flight out of singapore to melbourne while the aircraft was new was the biggest disappointment. the crew rushed both services and literally threw the table clothes and utensils down. bread baskets thrust at passengers without offering bread. all done without uttering a single word to customers. from the noise coming out of the galley they were capable of talking and laughing just not with their customers.  i wouldnt have given more than 2 stars from their product and crew .    singapore to melbourne. our late departure was thankfully made up in the air however i was very disappointed by the lack of water offered or available on board for the flight. dehydration set in and made for an uncomfortable flight. the breakfast of a bread roll and some spread was pretty pathetic too singapore airlines needs to have drinks and snacks available to help yourself to like other 5 star airlines.    our holiday involved four singapore airline flights sydney to frankfurt via singapore and return. i bought and paid for four preferred seats. i have replacement knees and whilst they slightly limit my mobility they do not adversely impact on my upper body strength or general fitness. the preferred seats would have given me more leg freedom. i purchased the preferred seats online and disclosed that i had a mobility problem. the tickets were sold with full disclosure by me. on the flights we were refused the seats. it was then explained to me that it was the decision of the cabin crew on the day whether a person could occupy the preferred seats or not. we were moved further back down both aircraft and other people were seated in the preferred seats at no cost to themselves. it seems that the cabin crew make a decision whether the people in preferred seats are fit enough to assist other passengers in the event of an emergency. a total farce really because they do allow women with babies to utilise these spaces. so much for being fit enough to assist on the last flight the senior cabin crew person indicated she was submitting a report to assist me in having the money returned. i wrote to singapore airlines in late august. my email was acknowledged then no further contact was received. i rang the sydney office today and was told the money would not be refunded because the airlines has a not negotiableno refund policy on preferred seat sales. my point is that those seats should not have been sold to anyone without a clear indication that it was a decision for the cabin crew on the day. it was unpleasant sitting well back watching other people enjoying the seats i paid for. i will never fly singapore airlines again.    singapore to colombo in july 2017. the ground staff were quite rude and to wait at least an hour to check the bags in. the flight crew was also not the best and i found the food quite disappointing. taking this airline because  not many other airlines are having journeys to colombo.    singapore to san francisco via hong kong. worst flight ever. i paid for an extra legroom seat 41c. this seat is supposedly bulkhead but it isnt. this is an isle seat which has the isle for the cabin directly in front of it. this means that the food trolley has to make a 45 degree turn into your cabin thereby making you move or be hit by the trolley every time. in fact they slammed the trolley into the arm of my chair every pass. you can only sleep if you encroach into the middle seat and cross your legs which we all know is a health hazard. the crew just grinned each time i was jarred awake. only once did they say sorry. i complained and the airline said sorry it hasnt been an issue before. most airline these days have a good movie selection not this one. food was awful. glad we had our own water as they hardly bring any around. i know this is a long flight but the crew were terrible.   hong kong to perth via singapore. absolute disgrace. randomly selected seats for my family all over the aircraft. last flew with this airline a couple of years ago and it was brilliant. it seems poor now. entertainment onboard was busted. i travel regularly and would seriously say that even a budget airline is better than singapore airlines. do yourself a favour and give this airline a wide berth.    sydney to singapore. i am disappointed with quality of service and staff attitude on my last flight sq 252 on 10 november. i requested for a non vegetarian hindu meal and was served lamb. for some reason i dont understand my meal was served before other passengers and when i asked for another meal i was rudely told that it can only be served once all passengers are served. i left extremely insulted and did not eat any meal on flight.     sydney to new delhi via singapore. the food ivml served on my flight from sydney to singapore was horrible.  i complained to the cabin crew staff and was not offered a replacement so went without food. the food on singapore to delhi flight was also below average. i previously always had an above average experience with sia but looks like they are cutting costs. i pay a premium to fly with sia and expect services of acceptable standards. will not fly with them in future.   flew singapore airlines from perth to singapore. terrible customer service and substandard conditions. seat was wet departing perth. notified flight attendant and sat on blanket. five hours later on descent senior flight attendant came and said sorry about that. attitude was indifferent and no effort was made to recover the situation. theyre supposed to be known for their excellent customer service it went missing    frankfurt to singapore business class. i got an email early morning on 9 january to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. as i was connecting with air new zealand at singapore onwards to auckland with a short connection time i thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to auckland was going to be impossible. that proved correct. prior to arriving at the airport i rung both sq and air new zealand. both airlines claimed it was each others responsibility. in short sq was to blame for the disruption so it was their responsibility to put things right. when we were due to board at frankfurt the a380 was not at the terminal it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. when we finally arrived at the plane we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through the greeting from the staff was very hohum. the crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. the poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. he asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. the stewardesss response was sorry we are fully booked. this wasnt the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. the meals were very asian with a lot of seafood options in some cases i chose to forego the course as there was just nothing i liked. i would recommend sqs book the cook option. there are far more options available using this than sq offers on the flight. come time to sleep my bed was broken. it lay flat ok its just that when i put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldnt sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. i slept but it wasnt great. i wasnt the only one to complain of this problem. when the flight arrived in singapore there were a team of sq agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. in all fairness sq did handle this very well they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. the journey on to new zealand continued with sq and i can basically say i saw a repeat of the service issues i had on the frankfurtsingapore flight. i cant recommend sq and probably wont chose to fly with them again.    coimbatore to melbourne via singapore. i travelled with my 16 month old baby and sia did not offer me a bassinet seat although i had requested for it before hand. they said that they have children younger than mine who needed it. i understand that but they should have offered me a spare seat or upgraded me to business class. i had to travel from singapore to melbourne with not enough leg room. on top of it the cabin crew didnt bother to provide any food for the baby. they didnt offer me an infant seat belt i had to insist on one. singapore airlines is not cheap and we pay the extra money for a comfortable travel. i have been flying singapore airlines for the past 10 years and this has been the worst travel ever.     tokyo to los angeles. cabin was clean and with decent space for knee room for a 53 female. complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush paste and socks. no slippers or eye mask as other airlines. bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray mouth wash etc. special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic western style of whatever meal selection chosen. i wouldve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. food was decent but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beveragesnack passes due to special needs. this was not at all an issue flying usa to japan. but an issue on this flight. main complaint is how crew couldve done better to handle special requests with passengers. i booked and had a seat arranged by surprise there were no shows in my row. instead of privately making me aware of any request an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that i may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. im partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. instead of privately requesting in writing the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because i am unable to hear. so speaking louder while in flight should be better. there should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute deafness and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak. be like other airlines that have crew member buttons on the seat panels such where passengers can press for assistance or communicate needs.   flew singapore airlines from singapore to auckland. disappointed firstly we were only given one glass of champagne not duplicates as advertised. secondly we chose meals via book the chef and we had finished our meals before we were offered wine and then only a small glass supplied. we were offered no snacks and the curtain was drawn very quickly and passengers were quickly sent to the rear of the aircraft if they entered the curtain wall. this was in complete contrast to the flight from london to singapore which was superb. we were offered champagne top up and crew could not be more helpful. hope it improves on the return    frankfurt to singapore. the flight attendants are some of the nitpickiest ive ever seen. my crime was sleeping during the preflight video. the experience was no better than average. the food wasnt special the premium economy seat was a premium economy seat. it got worse on the way back when we stopped at the star gold lounge to discover what is the worse gold lounge ive ever been to. it felt more like a private waiting area than a lounge it doesnt even have its own bathrooms. singapore is doing the bare minimum to provide the benefits as part of star alliance.  lufthansa gained a star  maybe singapore needs to lose one.    aircraft was very outdated. inflight entertainment audio was out of sync with the screen.  i order a diabetic meal and the meals i was due on this flight never came with a drink until the main service was undertaken. the last meal i was asked if i wanted tea or coffee i replied water and it never arrived. others were at least 40 minutes after i had finished my meal.     sydney to london via singapore. the seats in business class are awkward to use the lie flat seat it is necessary to lie at an angle and because of this it feels cramped. we left sydney at 7.05 in the evening and had the on board meal at approximately 8.00 pm there was a choice and it was perfectly adequate. the flight to singapore takes 7.15 hrs there was a 1 hour change over of planes. after take off we were offered dinner again which having already had an evening meal i passed. the flight to london from singapore takes 14 hrs 35 mins. breakfast is not available until 2 hrs before landing. it was served very late. i think the stewards should be aware of passengers who have been on the flights for 2223 hrs and be prepared to offer breakfast much earlier. we will not be travelling singapore airlines again.    san francisco to bangalore via singapore. i have been flying singapore airlines for the past thirty years. i have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years.  ever since the introduction of the premium economy class the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. the flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically with little or no interaction with passengers. the food is mostly inedible. during my most recent flight i opted for the dim sum breakfast between hong kong and san francisco. the soggy mushy items had no resemblance to dim sum items i have had anywhere. while us airlines such as delta and united have vastly improved service for economy travelers singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive premium economy class. however it is very hard for me to justify spending an additional 1000 just to get two upgraded meals and a slightly larger tv screen.    melbourne to delhi via singapore. flying premium economy was disappointing over rated seating and food was average and similar to economy  apart from slight extra leg room it was not premium at all. service was below average. transit in singapore was also disappointing as agreed requests to ground staff were not actioned on aircraft. after a long time am using my krisflyer points for my wife to travel business class from melbourne to rome via singapore on in august 2018 whilst i am travelling on a business class ticket. my wifes sinrome booking using krisflyer points remains waitlisted on business saver class despite 3 months of booking. instead singapore airlines wishes me to pay approx aud1500 to upgrade my wifes business saver class to the next subclass. this is unacceptable and disappointing.  despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years a fair significant of which is as a pps member until recently the airline is unable to assist. based on poor treatment todate in respect of item 3 above it appears that singapore airlines is misleading with its krisflyer program in that passengers are encouraged to join up but the ability to redeem points is difficulta very long wait.     singapore to xiamen. i am extremely disappointed with singapore airlines i am an united gold customer. before i booked my flight i called singapore airlines to verify whether i can use the airport lounge due to my united gold status. the staff gave me wrong info and as a result i paid 100 more to book singapore airlines. however at the airport i was refused and was told that the staff gave me wrong info. they refused to correct their mistakes and give me refund.  this is ridiculous the service was not any better than united and i dont even get the choice of meal that i want because they didnt prepare enough only 25 of the meal is fish.    doha to paris in august 2017. no amenity kit in economy class. the flight attendants told me that amenities are only given on more than 9 hr duration flights and not on a 7 hr daytime flight. nevertheless in most of the flight the attendants pulled down the window shade.  a pitiful breakfast was served and quality and quantity was miserable. entertainment was average. a very dry snack was given before landing in paris.     boston to trivandrum via doha. the service at the airport and the ground crew and all were excellent. however the flight attendant we got was horrible she didnt really do anything we expect from the airline. food was poorly given our daughter didnt get a toy usually given in the beginning.while this one was useless i was able to get the attention of another attendant who was really nice and helpful. and on our flight back the service was amazing. hopefully next time we will get better service both ways\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    bangkok to atlanta via doha. i had 6 meals on this trip sampled the first picked at the second and third and just looked at the rest to see if there were any positive changes. only one time did the attendant came by to pick up used cups napkins. since i had a window seat i did not feel like squeezing past the aisle seat and walking my garbage down to the galley. they were good about handing out water  just not about collecting it. a340 had the shortest legroom i have experienced my seat back was short and uncomfortable and the bathroom nearest me ran out of water early into the flight. i needed wifi from doh to atl but they did not offer any.     johannesburg to houston via doha. ground crew not friendly. allowed 2 suitcases at 23kg and one carry on. we only had one checked baggage and one carry on each so below by one checked baggage. because my cpap bag was temporary on top of the carry on they wanted me to pay extra. i explained that i can take my medical bag off and an argument by the staff started. eventually a supervisor intervened and commonsense kicked in. the crew onboard were far from friendly except for the jnb to doh that flight was as all flights should be friendly and with good friendly service. entertainment screen was only 8 inches away from my face. most of the time my entertainment system didnt work by the touch screen or by the hand control. main food meal was tasty and good but snack food tasted awful. water was regularly offered throughout all flights.     seats are the most uncomfortable i have experienced although leg room is good it is hard to sleep due to the hardness  design of the modern seating. the service is limited as possible. face wipe issue menu card serve menu and drink in plastic cup then hide away apart from odd round with trays of water pastry snack box before landing. the media is good but not a great deal better than other airlines. food quality was poor and bland. qatar airways ticks all the basic boxes for economy but lacks any wows to support its current status.    comfortable seats delightful staff but in flight service was slow there was one flight attendant to serve the drinks and meals to a large section of the plane each drink is poured by hand. we received no pre meal drink. my first meal was lukewarm and the second cold my mid flight snacks were not warm enough  breakfast before landing was hot. the entertainment system is not a patch on emirates. the staff are the best thing about qatar airways but they need more of them. flew business back and a lovely comfortable cabin but slow service. all flights were extremely punctual with efficient boarding.\\r\\r\\n    paris cdg to doha i was sitting on the first row in the economy class. upon opening the cutlery to start eating i noticed that my fork is dirty. i called the staff and informed him and he changed my cutlery. i am wondering what quality control the caterers in paris enforce.     i started with a good smile and getting my ticket at the business class terminal.  i headed to lounge which was really nice and peaceful and had a good brunch before the flight. boarding which was fast and the amazing qsuite 3k which was really good  a nice seat amazing tv brilliant and innovative. a welcome drink was given but the last drink before take off staff came and asked for my dinner she said in 15 mins we serve you since you ordered online. the cabin crew takes 1 hr 15 mins to make my table afterwords they serve  chickpeas that were cold  i told them i do not need dinner and remove the table cloth. on arriving a lady who is in charge comes to say sorry we could not serve you food i hope you had a wonderful flight.    canberra to doha via sydney. they ran out of champagne two of the three white wines also the red wines within two hours of taking off. i was told by the crew they only load bars in doha.  the steak was dry and overcooked soup and breakfast cold. i had to make my own bed which is a task because the linen has to be fitted needless to say i failed despite crew watching no offer to help was made. i contacted the airline and they dismissed everything i had to say.    we were not given directions while waiting and boarding at melbourne airport. no signs to indicate where each of the allocated zones 14 are located. zone signposting was available at doha checkin however so that was much better. handwash in toilet is very harsh on the hands and mine felt like sandpaper at the end of the trip. signs on the video screen say keep yourself moisturized but there was no moisturizer in the toilets to use. no water was handed out early in the trip and i saw no water handed out at night. no smile from staff when boarding and most staff i saw did not seem very happy or friendly. some were okay. when we arrived in doha they announced that ramadan had just started so drinking and eating in public are prohibited then gave another message that ramadan started the next day. i asked the staff if eating an drinking in the airport during ramadan is prohibited but they said we can eat and drink day time during ramadan. the food was okay  but not great.  london heathrow  yangon via doha return. first three flights were okay  check in staff at lhr a little rude. economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but i didnt see the five star airline reputation particularly. final leg myanmar to doha was overbooked and i was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers resulting in a 13 hour layover in doha. placed on a 2am flight home and doha airport was dreadful  food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. dohlhr i have never been treated so rudely by airline staff told i was in the wrong area when i accidentally went to the wrong toilet. there was a total lack of organisation with this airline. sindps return. sindps section delayed by an hour no explanation or apology given. great seats and ife. no blankets available food was like economy class food on chinaware. no indonesia immigration cards so a further delay at dps airport. dps was a crowded lounge the comfortable section with sofas was for qatar airways crew on the flight. dps sin average in terms of service and catering. not really what i expect from a 5 star airline especially when flying business class. perdohjfk perdohcdg mxpdohper. great new fleet even the older a320s and a330s are new compared to other major airlines. newer 777s are gorgeous though have flaws like stuck tv screens and dirty seats. food is average. when connecting for hours in doha you still find yourself with a breakfast omelette followed by another breakfast omelette on the next flight entertainment system  good when it works. great selection but on 6 flights i had 3 seats without working tv and 4 headphones that did not work. service  pretty poor. staff are generally indifferent friendlybutdazed. timeliness  my experience has not tracked with the ontime stats of the airline. i had one out of six flights depart on time. the rest arrived late by an hour or so. very decent option for the price but not anywhere as good an experience as its 5 star competitors such as singapore or cathay. iaddoh flight 708 on a 777300 er. food was fine the guy at the check in counter changed my seat three times as people checked in to get me an empty bulkhead row so good on him. onboard the service was awful. my flight attendant had a scowl rushed passed me at every opportunity and was really surly with requests. qr905 meldoh qr259 dohwaw qr184 viedoh qr904 dohmel. flights between doha and warsaw and vienna and doha were good completely opposite to the longer haul. midnight flight out of mel thought i would be able to sleep for the first part  wrong. hot meal served about 1.5 hrs into flight sometime before cabin lights turned off. cabin crew dont insist on seats upright at meal times so bit squashed if person in front has seat fully reclined and meals not as good as shorter flights. no foot rests so legs soon started aching 1am flight out of doh on return sleeping when meal came so didnt get any drinksmeal until 2 hrs before landing in mel. toilets only two per section not cleaned often enough one was out of all paper products long queues. doh to lhr 11th april 2014. departure delayed 90 mins due to a passenger becoming sick and being taken off. same thing happened on lhr to doh leg on 3rd april. both times communication poor. doh to lhr leg staff abrupt lunch service didnt start until 4.30pm 2.5 hours into flight and was slow. i was bypassed both at drinks service and lunch and had to ask for drinks and my meal. there was no duty free service. the cabin crew seemed very inexperienced and flustered towards the end of the flight. all in all very poor. flight from manchester to bali 81113 was a pleasant experience with fantastic crew on both legs. we even got a honeymoon cake on the first leg. not a problem with the airline at all just some rude travellers flying with us. mandoh airbus a330200 a bit tired but by no means old dohdps boeing 777200er modern aircraft and comfortable. the return journey however was a shambles 201113. denpasar to doha with a stop in singapore. dohman was a great flight although slightly rough arrived one hour early and the head flight attendant was very very pleasant with me and made me feel comfortable despite my fears. older aircraft and a fair few avod systems not working including my own for the first 30 minutes of the flight. all they could do was reset it. 4 nov houstondoha qr714 and 15 nov dohahouston qr713. business class. check in at houston the desk staff did not know whether coach class seats had power outlets. they do as anyone can find out on the qatar airways website. continuing with the flight attendants. they all seemed to be intraining could not remember to bring coffee or water even though they were very attentive just not very efficient. on both ways my choice of food was not available. i had to ask 2 or 3 times each way for dessert. the 777lr aircraft in a 2x2x2 business class configuration is not very comfortable being trapped for 16 hours between a window and a sleeping passenger. doha airport on both arrivals and departures is undeserving of the beautiful and progressive country of qatar. taking my hand luggage down the stairs up the bus off the bus up to immigration is a chore and nobody from the airline offered any help. overall not a bad airline. london to doha in business on the new airbus. our flight attendants english wasnt very good and they were not as efficient as other airlines. my dinner was overcooked and too salty. staff were very kind and gave me a different meal. i had issues with my tv. it kept cutting out the entire flight. the beds are rights next to one and other. i was lucky as i was traveling with my husband but if i was sleeping that close to a stranger i wouldnt have enjoyed it. with other airlines you can put up a screen which you cant do on this plane. worst inflight tv selection ive seen on a plane. old movies and only a few new western release movies. arrived into doha for a 6 hour stop over and the business lounge is already looking very tired. qatar would not be my first choice next time i fly. up side amazing pyjamas and toiletry bag. have just completed 2 very much anticipated legs with qatar airways paris to doha and doha to melbourne. we were so disappointed which is hardly what i expected to be saying here used air france la premiere lounge in paris although nice had limited food offerings but comfortable. boarding welcome and crew great but meal uninteresting and veal tough. only served with rice. it did do the trick though as required no dessert. cabin was not cleaned prior to landing. our arrival in doha was delayed which meant the long anticipated use of the premium lounge was not met as by the time we were bussed to terminal we were told we had to board in 10 minutes. no seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. back on the bus and our flight to melbourne. greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. for first time qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. when food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. very little cabin presence throughout flight. pyjamas offered and most passenger used them but only saw one bed made up by crew. all in all not quite what we expected and if this particular flight is anything to go on will not fly with them again. sitting in the lounge at doha waiting for the leg of my trip from perth to london. wanted to quickly comment on the first leg. flight very full probably sold out but service slow even despite this. normally trays removed immediately but left sitting in front of us for nearly an hour. no extra drinks offered. request for blanket never materialised. vegetarian hindu meal very average. entertainment very good. note for those looking for an upgrade had a phone call on the day of flight asking me to go first class on following days flight. unfortunately couldnt do it but worth knowing it can be offered. flew zurichdohabangkok in coach. what i experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things i had read about them first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. the inflight system especially on the dreamliner is worth its name. the seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size i am 176cm. the flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. communication is excellent. but service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. on both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. no smiles no communication. secondly the food while the chicken on the way from zurich to doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from doha was simply inedible. layover in doha is something to be avoided. the transfer ride is tiring the terminal is awful and the food court easily the worst. all over a decent experience. we have flown qatar airways economy class 4 times in the past 15 months. as we are now living in doha for work purposes 3 of those 4 flights originated in doha. doha to jfk to florida and back to doha. our first two flights 12 months ago in economy class were very nice. much better than the other airlines we have travelled on for international flights. however in the past 12 months the other two flights have shown a huge decrease in quality of service and a huge increase in cost. the main difference that seems glaring is the level of attentiveness from the flight attendants the quality of food that is now being served and the huge cost increase. we flew back from delhi qr 563 on 6th jan. after an 8hr 21 min delay due to fog we discovered the aircraft was switched from the dreamliner 787 to the a330. the switch in aircraft certainly extended the delay. the communication to update on the flight was terrible. once we reached doha we were told there was no other way back to nyc other than taking the flight on 7th jan qr 701. the transit process on 7th january felt was awful there was lack of communication. once we reached the aircraft we waited and waited until the captain announced we would be delayed  ended up being 1hr 10 mins. while in the air the aircraft was new and we were lucky enough to have an emergency seat. the flight crew appeared tired and unwilling to be pleasant to passengers. most of the food was barely edible. we landed and 1 hr and 32mins late with no apology or update from the pilot on our flight progress. qr219 4th jan. having been a privilege club member for 10 years i have seen the standards of service and quality of catering markedly decline. i flew sofiadoha last week. having identified myself to cabin crew as a club member instead of being given an early choice of menu items i was told when they served dinner that my first choice was finished. however they somehow rustled up my first choice unfortunately it was inedible. wine which used to be served in proper half bottles is now dispensed in plastic cups my request for a second glass was granted rather grudgingly. on 2 legs of a 4 leg trip the airline did not have enough food choices to accommodate business class passengers which is unacceptable. on one leg doha to london several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class  these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. these passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. we would also comment that the boarding arrangements at colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers  a total free for all. finally on one leg london to doha my wifes inflight entertainment had no sound. lhr to doh enroute to perth. this plane seemed very new it had a good touchscreen tv and a little tablet in the seat. good movie options clear screen and sound. seats were comfortable and roomy i also had 2 seats to myself which helped. service was good the food was ok offered plenty and had some lovely bruschetta inbetween meals. boarded a different plane from doh to per this was definitely an older plane. i was in an aisle seat and it was the most uncomfortable plane ive been on. staff never smiled and when you asked for a drink they seemed annoyed. the food wasnt that good. on the return i had an 11 hour per to doh and this only bearable because i luckily had a row to myself so lay down and slept. again staff never smiled and there was only one girl who was friendly. on the next 7 hour flight to lhr i was absolutely freezing so much so i had to ask for a 2nd blanket. qr24 and qr940 1819 feb 2014 and return qr939 and qr21 on 12 march 2014. recently flew manchesterdoha singapore and was dissatisfied with the whole service. flights outward and return were delayed. in doha we were left in a holding area with approximately 100 other passengers with no ventilation air con or access to water in high temperatures with seats for only a dozen people whilst was waited for the nonsense of being bussed to our next flight. this happened on both the outward and return flights. onboard staff were unfriendly and everything seemed too much trouble. food was mediocre at best and repetitive. the entertainment system is outdated. i cannot recommend. lhrdohcok. while the outbound flights were comfortable with clean planes and reasonable service our return flights were terrible. it all seems to depend on how busy business class. from the start checking in at cochi airport took such a long time since the person at the desk seemed to have a difficult time checking in our bags through the london. as always the business lounge in doha was packed. the main problem was on our morning flight from doha to london. when breakfast service finally started we were informed that only 2 of the 5 mains that were listed on the menu were available. they were a choose of pancakes or waffles. basically not much of a choice. when i asked if i could get more fruit or muesli i was told no. the snack that was offered just before landing was also very limited and nothing of interest. overall the inflight service was terrible. their response to my comments about the lack of choice for breakfast was that if i wanted a special meal i should have requested one. i would not recommend flying them in any class given their poor inflight and customer service. ammdohamm in economy both ways on 777 er 300. plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me i am 6 ft 2. inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. the only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. the buses to the plane in doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. the new hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. the price was cheap i would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out emirates or etihad any day. european carriers business class is worse than qr economy. hong kong  madrid via doha. three of the planes were far too hot the food was dire especially the breakfasts each flight was delayed and changing planes in doha airport is horrendous with incredibly long bus journeys to the terminals and then a madly cramped terminal to deal with. the air hostesses were mixed with two flights being fine but one flight having a very angry hostess. im going back to air china etihad and emirates for long haul to europe. qr 240 istdoh and qr 844 dohkul. again qatar changed our seats that we booked 4 months before. they separated 6 of us without any reason. flight was delayed 30 minutes lunch service was very late. doha airport was busy they called for boarding went down to the ground floor the bus had still not come we have to wait 30 minutes in a small room with limited seating and without air conditioning. qr 844 use b7773er this flight was much better. still no hot towel in the morning. auhdohlhr return. 90 minutes delay at doh waiting for late connectionscongestion. things will improve with the new airport opening 27th may 2014. the pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. it is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. the system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory. missed connections at doh for myself and others and the horror of the doha airport transfer desk. only the attendants on the first leg welcomed me onboard as a gold card holder. as a frequent flier who travels on business on average of once a month i was rather disappointed to note the poor quality of the cabin crew on both legs of my recent business class flight onboard qatar airways. the crew were indifferent cold and impersonal. there was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew with the exception of the inflight supervisor unwilling to engage in conversation. i mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the captain had the seatbelt sign on. dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. the plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. food was good but not fantastic. the inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. the seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. happy to note that qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued. overall my disappointment with the cabin service overwhelms what positives i obtained from a good lounge in doha and efficient check in service. boshkg via philadelphia and doha. when we arrived in philadelphia we needed new boarding passes so went to the qatar airways counter for them. the attendant said that there was something wrong with our ticket boarding passes cannot be issued and only us airways can fix the problem. she sent us to the us airways counter without telling us what was the issue. we went over stood in line for 45 minutes waited for someone. of course nothing was wrong. we went back to qatar airways for sure the issue had cleared and we were all set to board. we wasted over 90 minutes for no apparent reason. philadelphia to doha was delayed severely due to a bathroom issue. doha airport itself was small and messy with the new hamad airport opening 27 may it will probably get better. hkgdoh with cathay pacific we were upgraded to premium economy free due to overbooking. the seat was very comfortable. the in flight entertainment system was more responsive compared to qatar airways. dohphl i slept through most of the flight and my husband most of the flight. i dont recommend this airline unless you are flying business or first class where qatar airways actually value you. fcodohbkk and vice versa. finally a new hub but after ive traveled this month with lh af and ba i had a lot of expectations. no meal menu on 3 of 4 flights. on the 6 hours night flight the second meal was served very early more than 2 hours before the landing so no one was able to rest. as a million miler with one of the star alliance carriers this was my first time on qr and i was completely underwhelmed. qr837 bkkdoh overnight. business cabin half full yet call button repeatedly went unanswered. fa screwed up my breakfast so i got none. flat bed seat seemed to curve downward at both ends and had lots of hard metalic edges which required an additional blanket to soften. meals were minuscule. i understand small portions on an overnight flight but if you are hungry you are out of luck. id heard so much about the fabulous first and business class lounge in doh. i must be in the wrong place even though i have been told by two staff that this is the only qr lounge in the airport. what a disappointment. no particularly comfortable seating very little privacy meagre drink and food offerings no organized system for getting a shower  seems to be catchascatch can. i wonder if their famous premier lounge id heard so much about is under renovation or something. i expected much more than this. one way from bomdohdfw in economy. the seats are good but food and drink offerings were meagre. i was actually hungry in the later half of the flight. staff seemed disinterested. i was expecting. not sure if this is a one case scenario but was expecting a bit more from a 5star rated airline. on 2472014 i travelled business class from melbourne to london heathrow via doha. the first leg of the journey on qr905 was relatively ok but on arriving at doha with a 2 hour wait for my next flight i went to the business class lounge where i was abruptly turned away as apparently there was no room left. i was left unable to shower or purchase any refreshment and had no option but to wait at the gate for my flight. the flight was delayed due to waiting for other passengers which resulted in a very unpleasant time sat on the aircraft. the service on board was ok but the toilets were not cleaned. my monitor kept sticking and despite being reset would not function properly. i feel very aggrieved that i paid for a business class flight and received economy treatment  i have yet to receive a response to my email from qatar airways. as a million miler with one of the star alliance carriers this was my first time on qr and i was completely underwhelmed. qr837 bkkdoh overnight. business cabin half full yet call button repeatedly went unanswered. fa screwed up my breakfast so i got none. flat bed seat seemed to curve downward at both ends and had lots of hard metalic edges

about is under renovation or something. i expected much more than this. flew perth to doha to manchester return which i do a few times a year. the planes where all very clean we flew an a330 and b777. the seat quality was one of the best i have had. the biggest let down for me and why i will not be using qatar again was because i am an emerald one world flyer i was greeted by a member of the cabin crew who took my meal order only to find when the meals were served i was asked again as my preference was no longer available. i explained i had made a previous order being an emerald member. this was also the case for the fast track lanes at passport control no fast track passes handed out which it states in the one world privileges. doha airport is so much improved easy connections and very clean and professional. qr401. ammdoh. flight departed earlier than the scheduled time which was good because i had less than 1 hour to catch the next flight. however two young passengers seated next to me made me uncomfortable. they jumped stood on chairs played with their food annoyed the passenger in front of me cried crossed my seat just to peek into the window and my bag under the seat was nearly drenched in coffee. the food was ok chicken potatoes green beans in soy sauce. overall it was a nice flight. qr844 dohkul. i had more than enough time to catch my next flight. it was not a full flight so i got the whole aisle row to myself. for the first time in my life i could lay down completely on a flight. the food was great noodles again in soy sauce. the sandwich offered was ok. one of the fas was nice we had a chat during boarding. 27th july melbourne  doha qr905 boeing 777200lr. 28th july doha  paris cdg qr39 airbus a346. 18th august venice qr130 to doha airbus a320v. 19th august qr904 doha to melbourne boeing 777200lr. recently travelled 4 business flights. the catering was very ordinary. the champagne and beer were both warm the food was not eatable. i ordered a fillet and received a fruit platter. when fillet finally arrived it was tough and chewy and i couldnt eat. i couldnt even cut through. my inflight entertainment on one leg was not working. the movies are very old and very few new shows. the staff although very pleasant do not seem to be that helpful. the seats were very comfortable. i had to ask for pyjamas and noone offered to put my fitted cover over seat. good quality champagne what a waste. overall very disappointing. first leg qr1366 jnbdoh on new boeing 787800. efficient online checkin and friendly staff at baggage drop off. ife system worked properly and crew was welcoming but not very friendly just did their job. special ordered meals were served but drinks were only served twice flight was on time. second leg qr67 dohfra on airbus a330300. staff was welcoming and helpful. ife did not work properly crashed several times. ordered meals were served but tasted horrible. moreover the amount was much to less. again drinks were only served twice during breakfast and lunch. i felt a bit ignored by the crew when i wanted a third drink which in my opinion should be served on a flight of seven hours. flight arrived on time in frankfurt. qr060 mucdohbkk on 6 september. boeing 787. i have flown qatar airways many times already and always have had a good experience. started of rather good but then the cabin came to take my dinner order. i asked to have red wine with my dinner after take off however nothing came until i had finished my dinner. the cabin crew said that they had been busy. i was not very impressed with the service but it was only on this particular flight and this particular cabin crew that did not know how to provide a proper service to a premium customer. but my flight from doha to bangkok everything was excellent. therefore on this occasion i would only give qatar airways 5 stars out of 10 on trip satisfaction. qr401. ammdoh. flight departed earlier than the scheduled time which was good because i had less than 1 hour to catch the next flight. however two young passengers seated next to me made me uncomfortable. they jumped stood on chairs played with their food annoyed the passenger in front of me cried crossed my seat just to peek into the window and my bag under the seat was nearly drenched in coffee. the food was ok chicken potatoes green beans in soy sauce. overall it was a nice flight. qr844 dohkul. i had more than enough time to catch my next flight. it was not a full flight so i got the whole aisle row to myself. for the first time in my life i could lay down completely on a flight. the food was great noodles again in soy sauce. the sandwich offered was ok. one of the fas was nice we had a chat during boarding. just got back from a return trip cph to muscat via doha and must say i am very disappointed this is first time that i have flown with qatar. the seats were not very comfortable the food below average and the service onboard mediocre. all in all not impressed. flew melbourne to london via doha. the flight was pleasant from melbourne to doha. the entertainment system wasnt working or up to date. the cabin crew kept resetting the system but it did not work. i was forced to change seats. from melbourne to doha it was a good flight  no issues. dont know whether i would use qatar again in the near future. flew phldohcmb on nov 30th and dec 1st. first time on qatar. the phldoh flight qr728 in a 777300 with bad inflight entertainment systems. my system along with many around me stopped working after about 4 hours into the 12 hr flight. flight crew promised to reset my system after completing inflight meal service but never did anything or came back to inform me. after about 2 hours i again informed another flight attendant who tried to reset with no success. towards the end of the flight a flight attendant came to me to apologize to say that they have a known technical problem with the system and their engineers will have to look at it in qatar flew melbourne to london via doha. the flight was pleasant from melbourne to doha. the entertainment system wasnt working or up to date. the cabin crew kept resetting the system but it did not work. i was forced to change seats. from melbourne to doha it was a good flight  no issues. dont know whether i would use qatar again in the near future. have used qatar a number of times for manchester to perth via doha and return always in economy. sunday 14th dec 2014. first leg on a full to capacity 777. the cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the ife was very poor and limited in choice of films. also i feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. the aircraft itself looked tired. the leg doha to manchester in an a330 was a contrast. very nice aircraft with good ife food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew. i got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time. no smiles indeed they were quite sullen and spent most of the flight sat on their seats by the galley not even chatting to each other. i doubt very much that i will use qatar again. perth  doha  manchester 1415th december 2014. perth  doha flight  usual b777. full flight but cabin crew maintained a good friendly service. have used qatar over last few years on this run. standard of food has gone down quite noticeably and beverage service not as frequent as in past although a full flight could explain this. ife very poor and aircraft seemed grubby clean but well used. doha  man. airbus 330. seats tight in width but good ife aircraft appeared very new. flight 23rds full but cabin service was very poor. cabin crew sullen only appeared at food serving time and seemed to spend rest of flight sitting on their crew seats looking very unhappy they did not even appear to chat to each other. certainly the worst long haul cabin crew i have experienced the one exception being iberia on a trip to argentina. maybe this was a one off but certainly i will now consider an alternative airline for this run. flew qr on 3 feb to cape town. the dreamliner was most disappointing. noisy cabin. narrow seats no leg room. and if you are above 510 you will struggle to squeeze in. food portions were very small plastic fork and spoons mediocre and slow service. on a 8 hour flight only served drinks once. flights on all sectors were on time. ran out of nonveg food on two sectors. crew seemed amateur and clumsy. except on the joburgdoha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly they were grumpy on all other sectors. in between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. snack with drinks only given on the joburgdoha sector were tasteless small bread sticks with a horrible salsa. nuts would have been a 100 times better. old hindi movies and very limited choice on tv channels. never again on qr. i flew brudohdxb and back. even though the leg dohdxb is rated as first class i subsummarize it as a business class trip because the cabin product is the same. the cabin and the seat are very comfortable nothing to complain. but the service level in general is very low. starting by the performance of the cabin crew in business class very hectic not really attentive. they dont use trolleys in business class they serve every guest individually from the galley. this leads to a very hectic atmosphere in the cabin because the crew has to walk a lot. they miss having any grace whilst serving it seems the invention of a service tray has been totally ignored. they bring your plate with bare hands from the galley when they realised that they forgot a spoon and knife they came back holding the spoon in one hand and the knife in the other instead of putting in on a tray and serving it nicely. on the short trip from doha to dubai this oneafteranother type of service lead to the fact that the last business class row was served only 5 minutes prior to the start of the descent so the poor people could not even finish their meal. but the worst i had to experience was the checkin in dubai there was one counter for first and business class passengers and one counter for status members. both lines totally overcrowded and the checkin procedure went on really slow. after waiting for more than 30 min. some of the first class passengers tried to move to the so called help desk to ask for checkin there. suddenly a qatar airways representative appeared and yelled at them they should go back to their line. i waited more than 50 minutes until i could check in. the firstclass lounge of qatar airways is very small and old and was totally overcrowded. not the way i want to be treated as a first or business class passenger. i think they have to do first a lot of improvement in their service level until they can compete with airlines such as singapore airlines. shjdohnbo march 914th. what was supposed to be a pleasant and enjoyable flight actually has been a nightmare from the beginning to the end. checkin at sharjah was chaotic  a ground staff member belonging to air arabia opened the counter 30 minutes late and were needing 15 to 20 minutes to treat every passenger even in the priority lane. my request for an emergency exit for a wider pitch was ignored. had to ask 3 times for the business class lounge invitation card and the female agent even forgot to give my passport to me after finally printing my tickets. police controls were crowded the time spent at the vip lounge was the only enjoyable moment. qr chef descale was very friendly and helpful. no special welcome for privilege club old a320 aircraft snack served was awful and nothing other than water available. transit time at doha was the worst despite qr sales office promise of hotel accommodation being provided for more than an 8 hour transit i discovered that passengers coming fromgoing to sharjah were excluded of this courtesy. i had to stay overnight in the oryx lounge which was crowded. no earplugs nor eye mask available. at least showers were very clean and comfortable. food offer was ridiculous coffee machine was not working. dohnbo morning flight was miserable old tired a320 no ife for a 5 hours flight seats cramped no special welcome for privilege club and no geovision. the same can be said about the return flight with the same issue at doha regarding transit. my last time with qatar airways. qr845 12 march kuldoha. qr237 dohist. return flight 23 march qr240. istdoh. qr844 dohkul. was given different seats from doha to istanbul although i have booked the seats and got a confirmation email from qatar airways resulting us being separated from each other. tea and coffee were not offered and took quite a long time to get a cup of coffee after requested for one. on the flight back from istanbul to doha lunch took ages to be served. the air hostesses dont seem to move and was at the first 3 rows for almost 1 hour while those serving on the other side has already distributed to all passengers. please improve. lhrdohhkt 1932015. first leg was the ageing a340 which i must add was a superb aircraft very comfortable. second leg was a a330300 not so great seats felt worn out. service wise i have found having travelled with qatar that it would appear they put their best staff on the heathrow route and other routes such as phuket tend to get staff with lower ability. overall having been a loyal customer of qatar over the years i am not sure i will be in the future. i agree with other comments that qatar are riding on past reputations. food is average at best. inflight service is now lip service and crew tend to walk past whilst offering teas and coffees without actually making eye contact. and entering and leaving the aircraft they might as well have no one on the doors. they did however provide bassinets for my kids although on the phuket flight crew never assembled it correctly. whilst not directly related to qatar  the new hamad airport is a joke lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. bkkdohlhr 142015. first leg was the new a380 which i personally feel is average at best. certainly spacious but does not feel as opulent as emirates a380. second leg was an a340 which was fine. service really wasnt great. whilst staff are smiley it does feel very forced now and i can see the change over the last few years. food again was average. whilst not directly related to qatar  the new hamad airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. on the way back qatar had a sand storm the terminal building was filled with sand and people were really suffering. whilst i understand this is an act of nature i would like to think if you operate in a region that has extreme weather conditions then you accommodate accordingly. i will never fly qatar airways again flying manchesterdohajohannesburg and return. outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. worst problem was the 7 hour wait in doha which we were aware of. however on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though i am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. we were given our tickets and thankfully i checked our connection from doha to manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. this resulted in a six hour wait in doha instead of an hour and half. no assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from doha to manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but i had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. we managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. never again recently flew lhrauhlhr with a stopover in doha. it wasnt my first time that i used qa but i sincerely hoped that their service will improve. i was wrong ground staff during the checkin at lhr was not nice. people you need to start smiling airbus a340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. inflight entertainment was ok. cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. i have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didnt get any crew member looked unsatisfied when i interrupted her with a glass of water request. i also had to remind them about the bland meal that ive preordered. return flight from abu dhabi to doha had 1 hour delay. it was a miracle that ive managed to catch a lhr flight which also arrived in london with a 20minute delay. despite their cheap fares im not going to fly with qatar airways anymore. ill better pay more for a flight with a competitor airline. at the end of march and again the beginning of april we travelled from txl to doh in an a330200 business class. the total impression of the interior was not positive but rather rundown. the cabin staff on the other hand â€ were very polite and helpful making the flight really agreeable. the electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. the most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. in the end they succeeded. the meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual  nothing worth mentioning. on the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircrafts are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. on our return flight there were no technical problems worth mentioning except that now the cabin crew members were more interested in chatting with each other than serving meals and drinks. shjdohnbo march 914th. what was supposed to be a pleasant and enjoyable flight actually has been a nightmare from the beginning to the end. checkin at sharjah was chaotic  a ground staff member belonging to air arabia opened the counter 30 minutes late and were needing 15 to 20 minutes to treat every passenger even in the priority lane. my request for an emergency exit for a wider pitch was ignored. had to ask 3 times for the business class lounge invitation card and the female agent even forgot to give my passport to me after finally printing my tickets. police controls were crowded the time spent at the vip lounge was the only enjoyable moment. qr chef descale was very friendly and helpful. no special welcome for privilege club old a320 aircraft snack served was awful and nothing other than water available. transit time at doha was the worst despite qr sales office promise of hotel accommodation being provided for more than an 8 hour transit i discovered that passengers coming fromgoing to sharjah were excluded of this courtesy. i had to stay overnight in the oryx lounge which was crowded. no earplugs nor eye mask available. at least showers were very clean and comfortable. food offer was ridiculous coffee machine was not working. dohnbo morning flight was miserable old tired a320 no ife for a 5 hours flight seats cramped no special welcome for privilege club and no geovision. the same can be said about the return flight with the same issue at doha regarding transit. my last time with qatar airways. dxbdohbcn return. overall a very poor flight in both segments quite old airbus a330200 with noisy engines extremely cramped seats poor ife awful food with small portions and quite inattentive to rude cabin crew both ways. ground staff inattentive transfer at doha is a mess. i will be happy to fly any other airline in the future. i flew cptdohfra on b787a350 16 april 2015 and return lhrdohcpt on a380b787 30 april 2015. all in all a massive disappointment. b787 is without doubt the most uncomfortable aircraft i have flown on and is to be avoided. qatar airways like most others have opted for the high density seating in economy of 3x3x3 instead of 2x4x2 for which the aircraft was designed. this results in horrendously narrow seats with poor pitch and legroom. worst of all a hard metal entertainment box in the foot well of every window and aisle seats. the box takes at least one third of foot well space and forces ones feet close together if you wish to stretch out your legs. the metal box bites into the side of your shin and is painful and uncomfortable. the new airbus a350 with a wider body and 3x3x3 is far better. more spacious more width and a less intrusive entrainment box in the foot well. a350 xwb wins handsdown in passenger comfort over its rival b787. food was average to abysmal on all sectors served lukewarm to cold. drinks service okay and champagne and cognac a plus in economy class. on all flights the crew were friendly but surprisingly disorganised during meal service. running backwards and forwards through the cabin to supply vegetarian meat and chicken dishes not correctly loaded in trolleys. there was a clear lack of effective communication between crew members during service. cultural issues perhaps as the staff are a multinational mishmash from all over the world. better communication and cultural diversity training for staff would help. the awful cramped b787 and shockingly bad food on 2 sectors lukewarm and mass packaged and prepared. avoid any sectors that use the b787 dreamliner its a nightmare. qr 647 may 12 and qr 733 may 13. was travelling from seaktmsea with my 5 year old child and wife. we were given different seats even though we requested the seats together both in ktm airport and doha airport. the agent at the counters said that the seats were together but they were not. on our way to sea from doha i was given the 2 last seats and 1 in front of that. not very nice seats to be given for someone who is travelling with a 5 year old child. had 14 hrs of transit in doha and no hotel was provided. tif doh bkk 10th june  qatar remains my favorite airline and is way above the rest. tifdoh first class. i told the flight attendant what i wanted to eat from the menu where items required a choice assuming that the rest of the menu would follow but all i got was i had selected from that section none of the other items came. the lounge in doha is large and somewhat impersonal but excellent nevertheless. dohbkk business class the crew apart seemed disinterested. some passengers had finished their meal before others had started.  i guess what niggled me not being on the receiving end of top priority as i usually am. all in all ok service and flight. but qatar normally is above ok and exceptional. i put it down to a bad day for both them and me.  meldohbah. the journey back to bahrain from melbourne was an awful experience. flight qr905 june 6th was delayed 45 mins. ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. there was no specific lane for business class passengers to board\\r\\r\\nsomething that was quite obvious on my trip through hamad airport going to melbourne on qa904 on the 21st may. problems start on qa905 once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. it involves the inflight entertainment system. i started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min\\r\\r\\ndelay. a passengers ife was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the ife for a reboot. my screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. this rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we cant fix the problem. this is unacceptable in my book no portable dvd players were available like you have on gulf air singapore airlines and silk air as a back up. the system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. i had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. the next flight 7th june doha  bahrain on qr1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate c28 was just utter chaos. appalling organization by qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. the special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. the next time i travel to melbourne i shall not be using qatar. after near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the uk qr slipped up on the return. having decided which movie to watch after lunch not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787s ife system  even 8 days after the start of the month. i then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. these are distinctly second rate in terms of choice  and not all are classical. ife is one area where qr can definitely improve. prior to take off on the second flight from doha to bkk the fa asked about meal choices reminding me the meal would served on demand as is qrs custom. i made it very clear i wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. we agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. i was then awakened raised my chair threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. the first comment was we are arriving early which was not true. the second was that it was assumed i would need time to freshen up both inexcusable on going to the aft toilet to change the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. then on asking for the complex landing cards required in bangkok i was informed they had not been loaded at doha since they had had no stock for a week. yet with 4 daily flights tofrom bkk surely the worlds best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to doha i was extremely disappointed on this flight qr836 28th july 2015. during boarding there was only one crew member attending to 8 customers it seemed one side of the aircraft was forgotten. i had to ask 3 times for pyjamas before going to the galley to get some. cabin services director didnt bother introducing herself to me when distributing the wifi vouchers. she was very curt and at times i had the perception that she was going through the motions.  manchester to riyadh via doha. the food was good seats were as expected but flights to and from manchester were full of children as well as the short riyadh flights and sleep was impossible. they use an electronic menu for which they interrupted the ife for 30 minutes. toilets were a mess. i am travelling back from a month vacation in phuket with my wife and two children.  when we travelled to phuket in july we found our six year old daughter had no child meals booked. i had booked this online but it failed to register. the staff were apologetic on the plane and said they would sort the issue for when we returned in four weeks. when we arrived in phuket we found one of our cases had not arrived. this delayed us at the airport while we had to sort this issue. on checking in online for the return journey we find our family split with my son 20 rows back from the rest of us on the last sector. the check in staff tried to adjust this but could do nothing better than move him slightly closer.  we found our daughter had no child menu on the plane and appeared to be the only one that failed to get a child gift when they were handed out. we asked later and were told all gifts had been handed out. in doha the airport doesnt have a priority pass lounge. i know things happen in isolation and cannot be helped but good customer services should do their best to make it up to their customers by making them feel wanted and needed.  we had a dreadful experience with qatar airways travelling qr2 on 13th sept 2015. we were delayed 2 hours because a passenger onboard wasnt feeling well as the plane was taxiing out. instead of offloading this passenger the captain decided to wait for a doctor to treat them. the passenger was found to be fit to travel and we departed 2 hours late. this meant we missed our connecting flight at doha for the onward leg to the maldives. what made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at doha when we landed but couldnt be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. on arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at doha at 7.30am. we were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of doha the golden ocean which seemed like a 2 star hotel. we tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site  there was constant drilling and hammering all day long.  not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery as we couldnt change into clean clothes. we were collected at 10pm for the flight to the maldives which departed at 1am. no member of staff apologised at any time  we felt abandoned. we missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered.  we spent the holiday fretting about the return journey as the connection time was a mere 55 minutes and we dreaded missing it. the final insult was being told our flight from doha back to london was departing late because it was waiting for some passengers coming in on a delayed flight.  our seats were changed last minute when boarding from singapore to doha even after we have checked in online and have seats confirmed and printed out our boarding passes as instructed by email. on our way home seats were changed three times and had to be separated. customer service was non existent. when we did a feedback we were told that advance seat reservations can never be guaranteed. heathrow to abu dhabi via doha in economy with qatar airways. we are oneworld ruby card holders so from the time of booking got access to reserving seats which was great. our first flight was on the a380 so we got seats reserved in the small cabin at the back of the upper deck only 7 or 8 rows. when we checked our bags we were able to use business class check in oneworld benefit was honoured however the seats we had chosen months ago were changed when we tried online check in and i could not change them. frustrating that the agent at the desk could not change this back and we were referred to another desk to the flight supervisor who to be fair despite arguing with me about accepting those seats when i checked in online did change them to our original preference. i was grateful for this and thanked her. onboard the seat on the a380 is really good. thin seat but comfortable and plenty of personal space including legroom. the recline is very good but thankfully for me no one in front other wise it would have been in my face. theres a decent sized ife screen and a reasonable choice of movies. despite this cabin only being half full it took about 90 mins before we were offered any service which was lunch. nice enough but the entree portion was small and drinks were offered with the meal almost like an afterthought. throughout the flight the crew were friendly and responsive if you asked for more drinks but not proactive. close to arrival we were served a wrap and muffin which were nice. transferring at hamad international was a breeze you literally walk through a supervised glass door straight back into the departure lounge it is different on your return. really nice modern and relatively quiet airport at 7pm local time. for westerners there is nice french themed bar and restaurant that serves alcohol in the departure lounge. the second leg to abu dhabi was less than an hour in duration. the seat comfort was fine on the boeing 777300 and it had ife if you wanted it. the crew served a savoury pastry and cake with a cuplet of orange juice.  overall the experience felt good value for money albeit i wasnt bowled over given the 5 star experience i was expecting. i just think they could have made a massive impact if theyd provided a more proactive service on the upper deck economy section of the a380 melbourne to madrid via doha. the flights were on time and check in staff very welcoming and efficient. the food was average service was okay my headset was broken on one leg and i didnt get a replacement. my main issue was even though at check in i was in an aisle seat for the longer leg this was changed at the gate and they would not move me again  even though this had happened on my outbound as well within less than a week. i explained my circumstances but the gate person was not interested and was told it was because i was travelling alone. i recently flew qatar airways from london to bangkok via doha returning from ho chi minh city. around 1.5 hours into your journey you get the meal service. this wasnt preceded with a drinks service the drink was served with the meal and service was incredibly slow. after the trays were collected cabin lights are dimmed and turned back on two hours before landing where you are given a snack on the 6 hour leg from lhr to doh this meant no more than two hours between meals. the snack is cleared but there was still 1.5 hours of the flight remaining  this second service could take place a little later into the flight. cabin staff should bring a tray of drinks around occasionally but on my flight having a chat in the galley seemed to take priority. if laptops should be turned off during landing  take off the staff should enforce this rule not just leave it as they do the cabin check. blankets and headsets should be collected before landing in my opinion. i have recommended this airline but it was a border line decision swayed by good prices and on time performance. ho chi minh city to doha on qatar airways. ground services relatively efficient the sgn lounge was full limited selection of food and beverages. nice clean aircraft new seat design recently installed  comfortable and roomy with good ife. catering on board was disappointing chosen entrée and dessert were unavailable  i was offered captains meal instead but declined. service chaotic then all meal choices suddenly available 2 hours into flight. champagne available on tarmac ordered more for post takeoff only to be told later that there was no champagne available for the flight several wines also out of stock. this was the most chaotic food and beverage service seen on a qatar flight staff were largely indifferent. wine list on the route appears to have been downgraded since early 2015 and amenity kit appears to be shrinking. otherwise the flight was noneventful arrived doha to a bus disembarkation for a full a330 which was not enjoyable. singapore to paris via doha and qatar airways has the reputation for being the best five star airline in the world. especially their a350s are outstanding. however some cabin staff were not friendly. my check in baggage was delayed and did not arrive in cdg airport. they expected to delivery the bag to me in one half day but i havent received it yet after one whole day. penang to manchester via doha. we travelled as a family with a toddler and i was disappointed we couldnt book our seats together in advance   they couldnt get us seats together during check in but luckily on both journeys the seat next to my wife been blocked so we were able to seat together. i was told its because they needed to block off for another parent but there is only space for one bassinet  the sitting arrangements were 2x4x2 and we had the 2 seats by the window.  i felt it would have been much more helpful if the airline allowed families to book seats together from the start instead of trying to sort it out onboard or at the gate. food was nice but stewardess doesnt seem so attentive. leg room space seem good the 30kg luggage allowance is generous but our baby pram seem to have got lost on our return journey  we got it back 1 day later. in flight movies seem limited and difficult to browse through and no free complimentary wifi on board. from my experience hamad airport in doha is excellent very clean fantastic toilets lots of charging points and apple imac stations the customer service were rude both in the airport and on the telephone  i tried by email but they took around a week to reply to each email which they had clearly not read. i found the legroom was not enough. the cabin crew dont do any kind of beverage service you kind of have to get their attention to get a drink.  as for the inseat entertainment although there is a good choice of stuff to watch the screens use a touchscreen control which doesnt seem very sensitive meaning you get people tapping the back of your seat with a great deal of force   not great if you want to sleep. the screens are actually a bit too big meaning if the seat in front goes back its so much in your face its not pleasant.    a recent trip from dubai to edinburgh via doha was wrecked. dubai to doha flight delayed due to weather which is fair enough cabin crew and supervisor reassured us that the captain had called and wed land 20 mins before departure so would be whisked to our flight to edinburgh  however no staff were waiting and the connections desk told us the gate was closed. some hours later after being rerouted via london our london flight was delayed for over an hour to await connecting passengers so we were likely to miss the london to edinburgh connection arranged on british airways  no ground staff waiting on arrival for us there despite promises. the british airways flight was delayed due to technical fault so we arrived 12 hours late with no luggage   missed my wifes surprise party and champagne breakfast the next morning as i had to get up early to go and collect luggage from the airport.     a bad experience with a big family on the flight from cape town to doha that basically took over the business section messed up the bathrooms and used the space in front of the toilets for praying  so much so that one felt guilty to get up to use the lavatory. this family also had a child that was screaming for nine hours. the child is not to blame  the parents did not pack single toy or drawing book etc.  original ticket had a layover in doha of more than 8 hours that with complimentary hotel. qatar changed the times which resulted in the cancellation of this hotel booking. i was assured by there are ample sleeping opportunities in the business lounge in doha but do not bet on this. lounge was cold and too noisy for sleeping. quiet zone was occupied  so you are waiting there for your next flight until the next morning. next shorter flight in bad business seat in a320 and i could not sleep properly. will not book again if they have a layover of less than 8 hours. london heathrow to tokyo narita via doha. i heard positive reviews about this airline from friends so i thought id book my flight to japan with qatar airways. days before my flight i got the opportunity to upgrade which i did as i had money to spare and for a long haul i thought this would be perfect. dressed in a tshirt joggers and trainers upon entering the aircraft and presenting my ticket for business class i got a look of disgust  almost as though i didnt and should have been there. how dare someone dressed for eight months worth of travelling be seated in business class right offended to say the least. the seats and food was wonderful. everything you expect from a good airline like qatar airways and for business class. it was my first time flying business so i was definitely enjoying it despite the look i received when i arrived onboard. i decided to ignore this although it gets worse. everybody in the entire cabin got the best of service. not me its almost like they were deliberately not willing to serve me a drink or food etc. i found this service pretty shocking. 11 hours on a plane and served two drinks disgusted. i hate complaining and causing drama but personally this goes to show people judge you. i had the money to spend on my flight and therefore i should have received the same service as everyone else in that cabin. im pretty let down as this was my first time with qatar airways. you should never judge someone by the clothes theyre wearing or lack of make up etc. so i didnt look like a business class flyer but im a nice person who wanted to enjoy me flight and ended up feeling tense thanks to the staff onboard my flight. will make me think twice about upgrading with them or even flying with them. next time ill stick with economy class where aparently i belong. ill be sure to share this experience with friends and family.     doha to singapore and disappointed that the aircraft was changed from the usual a350 to an old a330. the seat was uncomfortable. service was disappointing and crew disappeared after the meal service and i did not notice them doing drink rounds. will fly their a350 in future.    paris to goa via doha on 2nd may. departurearrival is from our local airport and food free baggage allowance. poor service by crew on board and the meal service was below expectations the portion size left me still hungry.  i tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. this in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays the service takes a long time in coming and when it does they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and dont come back to ask if youd like your drink refreshed. surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. for the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. the filling was okay the pastry terrible. the standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. as a result i was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as i did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk himself. the reason we have so far continued to fly with qatar airways is the convenience of flying direct to our end destination without necessitating an overnight hotel stay.     doha to shanghai with qatar airways. boarded just after 2am for a 250am departure. i planned to go right to sleep and asked a fa to make up my bed just after boarding. i was informed that there are no mattresses and quilts on this flight as it is under 8 hours duration. the fa told me it is a flight duration of 7h50m. the qr website and my electronic itinerary sent to me by qr shows the flight as 8h30m. for a flight that leaves doh at nearly 3am one would expect that in a business class that has lieflat seats that qr would have proper bedding same as on all flights tofrom the us australia s. africa etc. the fa working my side of the aircraft in the second cabin of business class was cold and generally unfriendly  unusual for qr where the fas are usually very personable and obliging. she more or less tossed everything at me and had a hard time cracking a smile before marching back to the galley. if you fly in business class with qr to china bring your own bedding\\r\\r\\n    boston to hyderabad via doha on 05052016. when we checked in they allocated seats here and there  how you can have your 6 and 7 years old seat on different seats and not next to the parents. when we boarded we exchanged the seats but their allotment of seats was so poor. the flight got delayed for 5 hours due to technical problem and by the time we reached doha we had missed our connecting flight to hyderabad. they said we will get hotel and will be on next flight to hyderabad. once we reached doha qatar things got changed. they informed me that people who missed hyderabad flight will be accommodated on emirates via dubai and there were only 2 seats available. we are 4 in a family luckily my wife was having visa for qatar. i was forced to leave my wife and kids in qatar and fly to hyderabad. her transfer was handled by the qatar airways and promised all 4 bags will be delivered in hyderabad. emirates delivered 2 bags at my residence but told us to contact qatar airways about the 2 others. now after 12 days i am getting the run around. every day i am following up in hyderabad airport.    when boarding i realized the plane was changed without being notified at checkin. instead of single window seat on an a350 i got a neighbor next to me on an old b777. after takeoff the massage function went on and could not be switched off. the apologetic cabin crew director tried to help rebooted the system several times but could not fix the problem. as there was no other seat available i had to stay in my allocated seat and i ended up sitting upright where the impact of the massage was a bit less then in any other position. instead off sleeping in my bedseat i got a massage for the 6 hour flight. the experience was like a joke although the crew was friendly and apologizing.     i used to regard qatar airways as one of the very best airlines in the world. this was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from warsaw to hanoi via doha. i was impressed by the quality and standards qa presented then. this is why this year after traveling with emirates in 2015 i decided to fly with qatar airways to sri lanka from warsaw. unfortunately this time i was left disappointed. 1 changing an aircraft  choosing qa i was tempted with advertisements of a brand new boeing 787 dreamliner. i chose the connection offering this very plane but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by qa  airbus 340. 2 on board service  in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set earplugs toothbrush etc during my last flight which was overnight no such thing was available. 3 meals  in 2014 there were two meals served main dish and a snack now its only one. 4 no snacks were available during my qr664 flight unlike in 2014 5 drinks  qr boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. no such thing was available neither on my first flight from warsaw to doha this year nor during flight from doha to colombo. these are not very big problems but they have left me thinking it was only two years so many changes and all of them for the worse. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    we have had 2 flights from sao paulo to perth. the first and the longest one which should be the best experience was average seats were not that comfortable. besides oldstyle seats and lack of privacy i realized that there was a hole on the back of the seat when sleeping on my seat 2a. flight attendants could be more responsive when we pressed the button as well as when we got changed into the pyjamas. they could set up our bed more promptly. food was very tasty. poor wine list.\\r\\r\\n    first flight from dubai to doha was extremely hot until about 20 minutes after takeoff it was around 45 degrees in dubai. the a320 was small and did not appear to have been cleaned since the previous flight. doha to kuala lumpur was first delayed by 2 hours then by another 4 hours with no explanation for the first 2 hours. flight was delayed a total of 6 hours due to a technical difficulty with the plane however there was a serious lack of communication. inflight entertainment was outdated. flights on the way back were marginally better and at least they were on time.     flew mumbai to atlanta via doha with qatar airways for the first time and had a great experience. i was a little disappointed with a few aspects. the seat was very comfortable with amazing legroom and backrest  headrest. the welcome amenities were quite good and useful. however the entertainment system technology needs a lot of thought  the right button on one of my copassengers screen didnt work which left her with only 45 movie options and was very annoying. even though they have a great selection the hardware needs an upgrade. the call attendant button or light button did not work on my seat remote control. also i had multiple issues with air hostesses both on mumbaidoha and dohaatlanta leg. even after the call attendant button was pressed none of the airhostesses paid attention and i had to call them while they were passing by in the aisle. i could see 34 other attendant lights switched on but nobody came by for 10 minutes or so.  the meal timings were really bad. after they served us brunch at 1130 am doha time no food was served till almost 6 pm. having reached doha at 5 am just having 1 meal till evening was not what i had in mind. when asked for food the air hostess said we will be serving sandwiches in some time. the overall experience was okay but had these issues not been there it would have been amazing.    brussels to tokyo narita via doha. the checkin was ok smooth but i wasnt offered any special seats despite my ow sapphire status. the security fasttrack which should have been on my ticket barcode didnt work i had to call staff to let me go in. ba lounge access not up to midlonghal standards required for the 6 hour flights to doh. there are no shower facilities and the food choices are limited to a breakfast setup despite the evening departure.  qr boarded their flight one hour ahead of depature time which seems excessive. on top of poor seat width the pitch seemed too tight and im not a giant. there was a ife box stealing 20 of my feet area and no footrest. storage in the seat pocket was poor i couldnt fit my water bottles. ptv remote was covered in smudges. i had ordered a special meal low fat which was pasta. the pasta was dry. the fruit salad showed signs of decay. the salad looked ok but the vinaigrette tasted awful. the bread was not freshly baked. in the bathroom no amenities were offered in economy. the marking on the flushing button in the bathroom was unreadable. the cabin temperature was cold but a good fleece blanket offered. i asked the cabin crew to raise the temperature and was answered that the captain would have to decide on that. ife systems was loaded with advertisement. the flight stopped at a remote stand and we had to be bussed.  after deplaning i was suppposed to have 2 hours between flights to enjoy in the business cass lounge but i only spent 5 minutes in there.    flight from txlcgk via doh return. at berlin unfriendly checkin staff with a lot of queing during checkin process in berlin and they did not tolerate an excess of luggage  make sure that your cabin and checkedin bagage are correct before checkin counter. i requested vgml meal but they forget it and gave me chicken instead. flight dohcgk return was pleasant and nice trip. during flight dohtxl they moved my seat without any notice and reason and they forgot again my requested meal.     doha to kochi. chose it for direct flight and to save time. ordered special meal non lactose and unpleasantly surprised to be served vermicelli drowning in oil. dessert was pineapple chunks coated with sugar syrup. i wish had not ordered any special meal. i recommend qatar airways to be considerate with the choice of meal. the flight was on time and nothing much to say about the seat and comfort. my inflight entertainment on a330 was a joke but it was only 4 hrs flight.    amsterdam to denpasar via doha. the quality of food was terrible or the full choice on the menu was not available for everyone in economy class. i thought that some flight attendants dont speak really good english. inflight entertainment was okay but my touch screen didnt work that well. the flight itself was okay.    buenos aires to singapore via doha. the service at the doha airport during a delay was terrible when our flight suffered a 7 hours delay in doha initially a 2 hours delay and we were given a couple of meal vouchers. to get the vouchers we had to ask several people from the qatar staff the staff at the lounge desk wasnt able to give any information so we had to return the transfer desk. phone support was unavailable  i called the hotline and remained waiting for 20 minutes before i hung up. \\r\\r\\n    geneva to johannesburg return via doha. three months before the departure date qatar airways rescheduled the flight so that it left 4 hours later but didnt inform me. i only learned about it the day before and consequently had to rebook my connecting flights at my destination with a penalty of €150. then as if that wasnt enough the flight left almost 2 hours late and i missed my connecting flight in doha and had to stay 18 hours for the next flight. i arrived at my final destination 24 hours later. i contacted the customer service and explained my case but they not want to reimburse my rebooking fee.     doha to munich. as a solo traveller i hate their 222 configuration in the boeing 777 which they fly from amsterdam. to avoid this i use belgium germany or even skandinavian as starting point for my trip since qatar airways uses the 787 or new a350 to doha. i was unpleasantly surprised to find out that qatar airways uses a leased a350 from latam on their dohamunich route. the config in business class in this plane is 222 and more cramped than the 777. toilets were messy service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger.  this was the second plane change for the worse in 5 months.    paris to kolkata via doha. it is difficult for me to understand how qatar can be considered a 5 star airlines. the choice of food for me was quite limited and on the route from doha to kolkata only indian food was available to me. no dental kit or other amenities. my screen did not work very well on both flights and my wifi did not work on most of the flight.    doha to auckland. the boeing 777200lr they are using is not adequate for the length of the journey neither are the facilities. on our return journey we were kept in the dark from 4pm and were told to close our blinds after the first meal. the lights were then put out and only went up twice during the flight to allow to eat. i will never fly with qatar again we should be treated with respect. and my seat was broken. flight from doha to heathrow was much better but only 6.5 hour flight.     sofia to abu dhabi via doha. my first flight was delayed so i missed my connection and had to stay at the doha airport for 7 hours.  the compensation was a fixed dinner. my flight back home was 5hour flight the a320 was not equipped with individual entertainment. there was some screens playing a movie but my sound was not working. the food provided is very nice. i would avoid flying them again.    economy class flight from heathrow to doha was good. the seats were comfortable and spacious. the service was good the aircraft and in particular the toilets were clean. the cabin crew were pleasant and helpful. however there was a complete contrast to the flight from doha to kuala lumpur. the seats were narrow and crammed. the service was poor and the aircraft looked that it could do with an update. the toilets were dirty and cabin crew unfriendly and did the bare minimum.    zurich to adelaide via doha. the business class cabin of a350 is airy the seats are comfortable to sit on but uncomfortable in bed position. the food choices were very limited although nicely presented. i had four meals two mains were good one was cold and one was overcooked. the entertainment system was disappointing a very small number of new western movies not a lot of choice in classical music and headphones of very poor quality. the cabin crew was mostly friendly sometimes efficient but often unknowledgeable. all in all a disappointing experience.    new york to bangkok via doha. qatar airways aircraft was new and impressive but the seat had problems with reclining. entertainment was as good as other major airlines. the food was surprisingly good. the main issue i had was my flight attendant never smiled. service is everything on my trips and other attendants didnt smile or greet me as i entered or departed the aircraft.     bangkok to dublin via doha with a 16hr layover. at the time of booking we contacted qatar airways customer service to ask if we could avail of their complimentary hotel stay in the airport for our long layover. we were told that we could avail of this service on the day we arrive in doha by a customer service representative on the phone. on arrival in doha today we were told that our fare was promotional and we are not eligible for the hotel meaning we are stuck in the airport for the next 16hrs. the staff were  unapologetic and offered us no alternatives other than paying for hotels with our own money. the flight was disappointing with mediocre food and hard seats. the only staff who were very nice and helpful were at the city tour desks.     kuala lumpur to london via doha. three of us were travelling under two bookings and the online facility was not allowing me to sit with two of my family. luckily at checkin this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. the flight was amended out of kul so we missed the a350 and were changed to qr15 which was 2 hours later into lhr. both planes left on time. toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. food was good  i had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. the sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. wine volume has been reduced  i fly qatar 23 times per year  and i was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. ife screen was only partially responsive headset had a loose connection resulting in sporadic audio connection. seat 18 j was broken so my family was split up. the usb connection did not work so i could not easily charge my phone. the seatbelt sign was on for over 3 hours of leg one so the coffee didnt materialize until i requested it. both sectors seem to consist of 2 services of 2 hours each and from 3 to 5 hours into both flights the crew were in the galley no additional drinks. not the usual standard qatar. connecting at hamad easy.    tokyo to london via doha. not impressed a new aircraft with a cramped cabin. i found the seats not very comfortable and the cabin service was not great. the meal quality was okay and drinks selection limited. boarding the plane in tokyo and doha was fine but getting through transfer in doha was a time consuming and a rugby like exercise.    dallas ft worth to doha. they have changed to airbus plane. flight attendants were overworked. my drink orders were forgotten food was too hot or cold they had ran out of karaoke tea. they changed the pajamas they serve.  i complained to my flight attendant but no supervisor approached me. this plane is different from the boeing 777 and this seems to have affected the experience. toilet was dirty. the tvs are slanted to where they throw a lot of light. even after i told the flight attendant that i will probably move to another airline there was little reaction. she was a little dazed but seemed to have gotten similar reaction in the past. no one at the airport was very responsive either.    hong kong to london via doha. business travellers be warned that you may get aircraft changes prior to the flight. for me this meant ive flown 3 of 4 sectors on their oldest business class set up not what i expected. on board service was hit and miss while the lounge was a big disapointment not much in the way of food.    the standard of qatar airways has dropped. on this trip i enjoyed the older 777 layout and entertainment system over the so called state of the art 7878 which had hard seats that hurt my shoulder with very little privacy. the entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. food on both flights was less than average the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight the arabic mezze which i missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one. i had to miss that and even the ice cream was out i just did not know what i had paid for.    melbourne to doha. the a380 seats are awful and small 3132 ins seat pitch i am a small person and could not even reach for my bag that was located under the seat. the service was poor i had hardly any water offered on 15hour flight. i found the vegetarian food disgusting i actually returned it. the films selection is fairly good but te screen doesnt totally switches off so you end up with bright light in your face.     munich to doha. qatar are using a leased aircraft from latam on this flight. the seat layout is 222 instead of 121. the entertainment system proved slowinconvenient and is not comparable to qatars own aircraft. the service was very slow and partially disorganized. this resulted e.g. in no drinks being served together with the meal. they have cut down on the menu choices compared to previous flights. both the starter as well as the main course were tasteless.  all in all this was a huge disappointment.  were old and uncomfortable.  this is my last flight on this airline.    houston to ho chi minh city via tokyo narita. the mechanics of ana service seat comfort in economy would get highest marks from me. the flight attendants were impeccably polite but english was difficult for many of them. where ana falls short was food even breads were cold despite the galley having warming ovens. the pairings and choices were dismal and i gave up trying to eat for the flight except water and light snacks. the hagen daaz ice cream is a nice treat. their partnersubsidiary air japan that operates from narita to ho chi minh city flies older boeing 767300 aircraft. im a small person but you are really jammed in narrow seats very uncomfortable flight no high marks for these folks for the 6 or so hours i was on board. the ana gold lounge in narita is quite nice even has massager lounge chairs to grab a short nap or relax. many foodbeverage choices no shower facilities in the one by gate 52.    the narita lounge was crowded. predeparture beverage of sparkling wine was in a plastic cup and of very low quality. menus distributed after takeoff orders not taken until nearly an hour into the flight. the western menu was from the conrad new york. perfect presentation unfortunately served cold and was tasteless. a replate of hot food or a second choice of entree would have been proper. service took too long approaching the 3 hour mark when dessert mine was still frozen in the middle was served. poor service had to remind them to start the in cabin mood lighting and had to use the call light to get a wine refill. a least i was able to get some sleep although the white eyeshade only brightened the too bright cabin. maybe it was a bad crew.   booked a trip from austin to malaysia via narita from united  ana and had the worst experience. i was forced to run around narita airport for nearly 2 hours. i was stopped at the transit check point in narita as airport security said the tripod i was carrying was longer than their allowed measurement and was considered security item so i couldnt hand carry it. it wasnt even an issue when i was passing through the us immigration and there wasnt even warning about these dimension restriction when i got my tickets. i dont mind not hand carrying it but ana staff had me check out from the immigration go to the check in counter to check in my tripod then go thru the immigration again. the airport was filled and badly ventilated. i didnt even get to enjoy my lounge experience was drench in sweat and had to run to the gate as the gate was about to close. the staff could have just checked my tripod at my gate which would have saved me all the hassle from running thru the immigration checkpoints. such a nonpractical protocol that they have just irks and zaps all the previous good experience i had towards them. and having done this to a premier 1k and gold alliance customer says a lot about their service.    jakarta to san francisco return via tokyo.  flight was okay despite the pretty bad weather when flying in and out. good inflight entertainment and updated monthly flew in december and january  ground staff and check in process was quick and efficient  seated in a good seat during first leg and bad seat on second leg. delicious and good meal. flight delayed for about 1hr from nrt to sfo. stewardess was not friendly to me. requested for water for a couple of times and i got denied.  i wasnt able to do the web check in. pocket seat poor cleanliness.     tokyo haneda to okinawa. high density on a b777 domestic flight but its quite comfortable plenty of leg room.  no announcements in english from the cockpit and this was a flight to okinawa with a lot of non japanese speakers. cabin staff was amazingly not particularly nice. they delivered children toys at the end of the flight. on a 2 hours flight itd be nice to have any food even a pack of crackers. drinks were only offered once.     seoul gimpo to tokyo haneda. i fly this route once or twice a year. always on time always a quick flight always a good experience except this time. the food is actually good and unique for airline food if you can handle japanese cuisine. they even add extra touches like an extra bag of snacks if you order an extra beer or wine mid flight. planes immaculate. i have never in my life had a problem with any flight attendant. on the return from hnd to gmp i was sitting causally unbuckled with the cabin door open during boarding. an attendant came up to me said welcome aboard and flat out asked me to my face if i wanted a seatbelt extender. nothing about my posture facial expression or attitude remotely indicated i need help. i am 180 cm 120 kg 511 265 lb and fly several times per year around asia and to us and have never needed one. never have i taken up others seat space or anything. nor have i ever really felt shame or lack of confidence being fat. but now i know that feeling. unfortunate that she didnt know better. i emailed ana upon return didnt want to make a scene on board as it really did ruin my flight. i received a generic wordy apology but also didnt expect more as i am nonelite on a premium route. also what else could they really do anyway i will fly ana again but minus points.    london to tokyo return. the service from london to japan was pleasant and air hostess made me feel welcome. however on the return the cabin staff  ignored me when i asked for water or tea. my partner was pestered to move seat forward by staff so that older folks behind us had enough leg space i was so annoyed as i have paid for my seat and checked on to see if seats was moved back. i was approached by staff later asking me to put down the window shutter when the cabin lights were down. i felt that they were more concerned about japanese passengers then non japanese passengers. i didnt complain to air hostess at time as i wanted to just go home. however this experience has totally discouraged me to fly with ana again.o laxhnditm round trip. staff at check in unfriendly and confused. requested special meals not onboard. laxhnd and hndlax the first meal was a sandwich delivered by hand without a tray. selection of beverages was poor seat uncomfortable. the staff friendly but not helpful. flight 950 from mnlnrt. delayed 2 hours. not one apology heard from any crew member or customer service. service was so so. nothing spectacular. older style 767. audio visual didnt work and when i told a crew member she said she would look into it. never came back. pretty bad service especially when other airlines are priced cheaper. flight from narita to jfk june 14 2013. flight attendants were inattentive and this was business class spoke little english. the food arrived cold and without apology. inflight entertainment lacking in variety and limited in choices. all in all an unpleasant experience. for this 90 min shuttle flight from fukuoka to tokyo  haneda ana packs in the seats fitting 405 seats on an old 777200. thats the dreaded 10 seats abreast. thankfully the flight was not full so we could spread out. the service is minimal as is the interior design giving this flight a truly buslike feel. i know these flights are meant to be practical but why do they have to also make them boring on the tokyo narita to fukuoka segment ana uses an ancient a320. the interior was upholstered in a deep green which does not even resemble the current ana blue colour. the plane definitely had a retro feel. moreover it was nearly empty. 20 pax on a 166 seat plane. thankfully its a short commuter flight. they could jazz up the whole experience though and make those 90 minutes a bit more exciting. hkghnd paid full price for economy ticket yet got an awful seat in a separate partitioned area of 2 rows right behind business class. about 5 or 6 babies in the vicinity all crying at various intervals. furthermore seat was incredibly uncomfortable  not the regular seats but the seat cushion is shorter and dips down in the center putting pressure on thighs. when i asked to change seats fa just brushed me off even though there were a couple empty seats elsewhere. the ife tiny low res screen audio was onoff due to ageing headphone input jack. flew from sapporo to haneda on a packed 777300. flight departed on time and arrived on time. boarding was orderly but they allow too many carry on bags onboard the crew had a difficult time closing the overhead bins. as you can imagine 10 across seating is really cramped. flight was about 1 hour 45 mins with no inflight entertainment except headsets for listening to music and scattered video monitors showing a japanese documentary. service wise was bad and minimal. onboard for an hour and 45 min flight you are only offered water oolong tea and apple juice. no other drinks available not even orange juice. asked the fa for ice and she just pointed to her drinks. for the price we paid as it was not cheap its definitely not worth it. for japanese standard of service its appalling. san francisco to tokyo sfonrt march 25 then nrt to sfo april 17 flights 007 and 008. serious decline in service since my last flight in july. this used to be a premium airline. now it is no better than any others serving the same route and its usually 200 more expensive. for many years ana has been the last holdout for oldfashioned japanese hospitality. no longer do you get what you pay for. nh 009 jfknrt. no wheelchair for 80 year old mother. no kids meal loaded its ok  mistakes happen. but when mistakes happen the inflight crew should not be blaming travel agents or ground staff. they even promised to ensure everything would be taken care of for the return. a simple confirmation call to the reservations center made me realize nothing was taken care of. flight attendant even asked if i could speak in japanese since english was obviously not a strength. nrtitm. b767. 232 configuration. good space for legs. fast and efficient checkin. bus boarding with separate bus for priority pax. big screen with front camera views including during takeoff and landing. no individual screen. paid drinks and food. baggage arrived immediately. cabin attendants just vanished. kix to hkg. our flight was delayed for 6.5 hours. the ground staff were unprofessional dealing with the delay and told us there was nothing they could do. before they cancelled the flight they had us wait at the gate for an hour.  the meals were poor plane was old and ife outdated and kept freezing. ana product on the se asian routes is really poor and needs work. on our return flight the plane was super hot when we boarded  like a heated room and again an old 767 with poor ife and untasty meals.     los angeles to bangkok via tokyo narita. i booked my flights through united airlines and was placed in middle seats by ana for both flights despite booking this reservation more than 6 months in advance. i called ana after my outbound flights to change my seats to aisle seats for my return flights later in january 2018 and was told that since i booked a lower class economy fare k class that my ticket had last priority with ana and since i had booked through united airlines their customers had first priority. therefore they were unable to change my seats and i would sit in middle seats. ana chose to prioritize their existing customer base over a new customer. my flight from lax was boarded by bus and delayed by more than one hour making my connection in tokyo very tight i had less than 45 minutes to get on board the connecting flight before it took off.    los angeles to mumbai via dubai. food service on flight from los angeles to dubai and return was one meal in second hour of flight and one pizza slice 2 hours before landing. this is what we were served on a 16 hour flight  they served soft drinksjuice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. alcoholwine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. the dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. there were approx 120 seats near the gate. they are using a380800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. the number of seats were totally inadequate. the staff serves food and drinks  but when you ask for something they dont have like diet cokediet pepsi they say sir i have apple juiceorange juice  they want passenger to believe they do not have diet cokediet pepsi. they are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. moviestv shows were in large quantity but lacked quality. the staff do not clean the toilets on a 16 hour flight. this is not a premium airline  this resembles a budget airline.    barcelona to melbourne via dubai. at the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with who said they receive a very good deal with emirates we had them book our flights. prior to leaving we phoned emirates to arrange seat allocations after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra 200aud for this booking. after complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. this is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. as my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a western vegan meal this was confirmed in a email from them. on the flight to dubai rome what happens my wifes meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fishchickenbeef or pork all come out with curry in it. regardless of complaints no other option available no spare standard meal either. however on the dubai to rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this vegan meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from barcelona. somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers for on our flight from barcelona history repeated itself. once again no spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever i could give her off mine likewise the same issue came up on the flight from dubai to melbourne. just to add insult to injury as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics he was seen ordering doubles  e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. of course what happened next was predictable a full drink spilled all over me so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the aircon. however just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets two of which i am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didnt go cold. needless to say we will never fly emirates again nor recommend them to anyone.    booked ticket to try out emirates on a flight from bangkok to hong kong to try them out. as a solo traveler i tried to check in online to secure a seat next to a window or a aisle. the online check in did not work i showed up at the airport to check in 3 hrs before departure. no other seat than in the middle available. disappointed but its my first time and last to allow emirates to disappoint me. nonreturning customer.    dubai to paris. the service in economy class has gone down. there could be not enough staff but they seem to be in a rush to go at the back and chat together. they dont seem dedicated to their work. breakfast served 3 hours before arrival which for a night flight means no sleep. could be again a question of understaffed if not training in customer service.    dubai to new york jfk. my mother family and friends decided to pick emirates as our choice of airline having hearing great reviews. we were all beyond disappointed at the service we received both going to dubai and coming back to jfk new york. when coming onboard we found our seats filled with about 1015 blankets and 6 headseats and 5 pillows. this was the first image we encountered of emirates. the flight attendant gave us the excuse that other people probably put them there but never apologized aranza. we understand that we did not pay for first class but that does not mean we should be treated any less. how does an airline not pack enough food for a 12 hour and 45 minute flight please help me understand.  it has taken years for a company to build its reputation but seconds to destroy it we were highly disappointed and i will be sure to never fly with emirates ever again and will never recommend your airline they do not project themselves to what they make it seem.    johannesburg to jakarta via dubai. all flights with the customer service seats food entertainment etc was good but the onboard staff service looks inexperienced which is the only negative things. there is no chaos onboard but the crew expected to not help passenger if they need help. then when i press the button then the crew told wait but 10 minutes called another staff but not at all. the good thing about this airline is the service has been improving since the last time ive flown with them few years ago. the shocking is about the staff service onboard which ignores the passengers.     athens to christchurch via dubai. i booked tickets 6 months ago and found that i couldnt select seats on our homeward flights from athens to christchurch. i was separated from my children. emirates staff couldnt care and were very unhelpful. it seems emirates do this to make you pay for seats lousy customer service    dubai to ho chi minh city. my baggage was missing. when i reached the destination i was informed and i was on official tour. the suggestion i received from the incompetent staff was your baggage can only come after 36 hours. you can trying buying clothes from there. they have no understanding of customer needs. leaving baggage is a practice they love. my baggage went missing again in july in another flight. traveling through emirates is just waste of money time and all you get is frustration.     bangkok to manchester via dubai. terrible customer service very unhelpful and feel i was lied to and mislead by customer services i would never use this company again due to there lack of compassion and unhelpful and very poor customer service. tried to contact them they replied asking for details and my contact details still heard nothing back. very poor and would not use this airline again   milan to dubai. i usually like emirates but this time they really disappointed. the cabin crew was careless. the meal was bad and cabin crew didnt come when i called them just to get some water. really disappointing but of course ice the onboard entertainment system was impeccable. flight was ok but emirates standards are higher than that.   new york to mumbai via dubai. comfortable clean and modern aircraft. in flight entertainment excellent. food was decent and warm. customer care is poor. the flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. i have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when i made a request for water. in between meals no beverage provided. even when meal service was being done one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. this airline is not worth your money. please spend a few more bucks and go to qatar airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on etihad as they are worth what you pay. emirates no longer cares about its customers. i regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with emirates. never will i fly them again.    athens to dubai was delayed. no proper communication from the pilot for delay during landing to dubai. the head of the cabin crew absent during the trip. no duty free articles presented during the flight. i called several times for the stewardess with the button to place an order for duty free articles but nobody came. completely careless for the passengers. unpleasant experience from a top rated airline    bangkok to lisbon via dubai. my business class upgrade did not work. no plug for my laptop. the crew were rude on my flight down to bangkok. this has been the worst experience ever. i really dont understand how they can brand them self as a award winning company. oh yes i also tried to buy an upgrade thats was not possible in the airport i had to do that on the flight. on the flight they told me to do it in the airport this happened in 2 flights with 2 airports    singapore to melbourne. checking in early at changi airport was smooth. prior to boarding and we saw it looked like a full flight. the ground crew were disorganised and should have handle it better things got out control when they start to announce for the so call premium loyalty members. i noticed that the cabin crew dont communicate to each other or dont want to be there as a team. food is normal and the ife is excellent. prior to breakfast as it was an overnight flight my wife was woken by one of the cabin crew in a rude manner and i ask the 3 different cabin crews to borrow a pen and was ignored. we arrived at mel safely thats the importance. would i fly with them again not unless they improve their service.    london to ahmedabad via dubai. i was travelling by business class on the a380 from london to dubai. i was impressed by the look of the bar and lounge area. i decided to take a couple of pictures and videos of the same to show the look of the lounge to my family. but an indian flight attendant really rudely asked me to stop clicking pictures and said that if any crew member has been clicked to delete my videos as i can get involved into legal matters. this was embarrassing and humiliating for me as other crew members and passengers could hear this and started staring at us. he would not be wrong in saying this to me but there is a way of requesting for something. i went back to my seat and sat there for a while. i certainly didnt expect this treatment especially from the emirates crew after paying so much for the service of the business class my husband being a gold class member. really disappointed with my trip. food was average. i filled have filled a feedback form on the same date saying this but there is no response or apology. disappointing    paris to dubai. first they cancel my booking by mistake and they dont even notify about it by phone or email. so i had to fly 1 day after i supposed to. disgusting customer service on the phone. ive been on hold for 30 min. why not to call back in the airport such a queue just to drop luggage at emirates counter.  this airline should has 3 stars not 4 total ripoff. all ive heard is we are sorry. never again.   london to islamabad via dubai. this was probably my worst experience ever with any airline i have ever traveled with. on my flight from london to dubai i was asked to move my stuff from my handcarry to my checkin baggage and was charged a lot for the extra weight in my checkedin bag. later i had a layover at dubai airport before my final destination. just before boarding the person at the gate charged me more than 150 for my handcarry again when i told him specifically that i was charged at the london airport to move the weight to my checked in bag. the staff was extremely rude and apparently were even charging people who bought stuff from the dutyfree shop. it seemed like emirates was in desperate need of some extra cash. since the flight was about to depart nobody could really do much. there was a lot of anger and frustration. i was charged twice for almost the amount of a new ticket and it did not make any sense. i am still unable to understand why and how the handcarry at london airport that met the weight need especially after moving the stuff to the checked in bag and paying for it was charged again at the dubai airport in short this really was my last time to choose emirates to fly with. i am extremely disappointed in an airline that used to be one of my favorites. i will never use their services again.    birmingham to nairobi via dubai. first problem was on checking in. i thought i might be one kg over but imagine my surprise when i was told i was 6kg over i had thought that my laptop was separate from my hand luggage allowance. in 2015 when i traveled on the same airline i got 46kg allowance. the clerk said i would have to pay excess baggage. i asked to speak to her supervisor and he said that was right id have to pay. ‘magnanimously he reduced the charge to half 3kilos which was 126. this is a right royal ripoff as i regularly send air parcels to kenya for 4.25 per kilo.  i could not afford to leave any goods behind as i was traveling by myself. i was furious and paid the 126. one would think emirates would want happy customers but after paying 700 for my ticket and 1000 for my wife to follow me next week i was far from happy. need to look next time i fly to an alternative airline. to be honest ive never found birmingham emirates check in very friendly i feel like im being tolerated not valued. well the flight was no better took off late and food took three hours to be served from takeoff im a diabetic and starting to feel quite unwell by the time i got a choice of only one main course which is the usual mushy tray of stewlike substance. dubai airport is nice but its a long trek to the gate followed by a long bus ride to the terminal. food was again usual poor fare and just before landing a passengber sitting close to me vomited all over himself and he just sat there comatose. i assume he had been drinking beforeduring the flight and was blotto. there was no apology from cabin staff and although many passengers were retching from the smell onboard no air fresher was brought by stewardesses the visa and passport control in nairobi was a fiasco and it took about an hour to get through although we still had to wait a long time for our baggage at reclaim. this was not a good trip    lisbon to dubai. emirates is going worse and worse service is not great food is horrible and really small portions. in an  8hour flight we get only a small meal and a mini snack. we pay a lot for a flight that is not by far good the staff is more worried to take care of family flying on same airplane than with other passengers. ife screens sometimes are not working. wifi inside it should last 2h for free i had 5 minutes and couldnt connect any more.    boston to colombo round trip via dubai. first of all my transit at dubai airport 14 hours. when i was booking my ticket i asked if i will get hotel and meals they said yes but at the airport their ground people said we stop giving hotel and meals from november onwards. when i was was flying on january 2017 my transit was 20 hours i didnt get hotel at that time too  the reason they said my ticket cost not reached 1000. i was sitting on the chair for 14 hours. the flight was miserable. meal they were serving is horrible. they gave menu so i decided to ask scrambled eggs they said we dont have lunch i asked fish that was in the menu they said they dont have gave me turkey which i dont eat. i am so disappointed.    budapest to colombo via dubai. if i can name the most child hating airline than emirates must be the one. it was 4 flights but each and everyone was a nightmare. we travelled with our 1 year old son. he was offered food on 1 of the 4 flights only. we werent asked even once if the baby is all right if we need any help but we were harassed several times instead. the seats were uncomfortable and narrow the onflight entertainment hardly worked once the screen was broken once it was frozen and had to be restarted once the console were broken 3 different flights 3 different problems. the utensils were dirty in the sealed pack and the food were terrible but hey its economy so this would be least problem of ours. all in all the staff was probably the rudest it can be we hardly met any kindness or smiles although they cooled down the aircraft to something between 15 and 10 c degrees they arrogantly collected all the blankets way before landing so we almost frozen to death. at least it made us understand why some people are flying in winter jackets near the equator. there is no way we are going to use them again.    cairo to singapore via dubai.  ground staff ran out of fragile tags and was not willing to get it from other counters. during the serving of meals it took an exceptionally long time before we were served and the steward did not provide us with the menu  only offered chicken option to us. when we probe further he mentioned that there is beef and chicken so when we chose beef  the steward mentioned that there is only one beef option left. however i noted that in his tray there were many more beef packets in his trolley and he was serving beef options to others.     sydney to dubai. it was my first time with emirates and  the experience was negatively affected by the fact that 4 toilets of economy class where not functioning and closed. the economy class was full and people had to use the only 2 toilets functioning at the front of the cabin. service was slow and affected by the fact that people needed to go through the attendants to go to the front toilets. at the end of the trip the toilets flooded.    amsterdam to bangkok via dubai in august 2017. during the flight the inflight entertainment did not work so it was a long flight. the crew tried to help and was nice. the cabin supervisor would make a complaint for us because she felt sorry. we never heard anything from emirates. when we filed a complaint we never got a responses when why try to ask for information by facebook of twitter we only got standard answers always file a complaint what we already did. we even went to the bangkok headquarters of emirates. the lady there could not help all she said was send us an email. why would you have a office in a city for help if you dont help people emirates has declined from one of the best to one of the worst airlines in the world.   jakarta to london via dubai. this is the first time i took emirates and definitely my last. boarding began from jakarta and the ground staff was courteous. inflight i dont really expect much because the cabin crew is generally not willing to go out of their way to get you your cup of coffee especially on a busy morning flight. the cabin looks and feel tight though i am neither tall nor fat. the seats it isnt worth commenting. landing in dubai for the transit to london expect the usual uae approach. their ground service is next to zero. the emirates lounge is big but not fantastic its overcrowded if anything. boarding my flight to london was ok but once onboard again do not expect good service. some cabin crew try to smile thats about as good as you can get. once the plane is cruising they go on their switchoff mode chitchat etc more than they are willing to serve. wifi and sleeping are about the only things that can keep you sane inside this flight. needless to say upon arrival to london and once im comfortably checked into my hotel room i dumped the return leg for an sq one. emirates my foot.    dubai to hong kong. we departed with 1 hour delay and landed with 15 hours delay. had 3 trips this year with emirates and each went with delay. service is not what it used to be before meals are poor cabin not very clean. everything is disorganized. compared to other airlines this one went really greedy cabin crew loudly discussed their personal issues.    manchester to bangkok via dubai. we were scheduled to fly out of manchester airport on wednesday 20th december at 20.35. on check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. we were not notified of any changes and the emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. after being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. we were meant to arrive into dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to bangkok at 09.35 so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. as a result we contacted our travel agent at flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at manchester airport. they called emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. we eventually boarded our flight and left manchester almost two hours late and arrived in dubai at 09.12. on the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the emirates plane leaving dubai late. we missed our flight we had no apologies and the only option to get us to bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to mumbai with emirates and then a flight to bangkok with thai airways. this would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. we had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in bangkok and our dinner reservation. however the flight to mumbai landed late which caused us more anxiety then the flight to bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. i am extremely disappointed with the service i received with emirates. the unexplained delays unhelpful and rude staff in some cases as well as missing our night in bangkok was just not good enough. we were travelling for over 36 hours to bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. whilst we appreciate that emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to bangkok we should have already been on the 1145 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in manchester. it was not the perfect start to our honeymoon we spent time hanging around airports or on planes.    newark to dhaka via athens and dubai and back to newark via same routes. dreamed about these long haul flights but got very disappointed  what has happened to emirates no longer the comfortable journeys i had enjoyed previously. service extremely poor and chaotic. no air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. disappointed to find no predinner drinks or appetizers but only a goodlooking menu with a list of fancy items  not so delicious to eat unfortunately. they missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. had to call an exhausted air hostess twice but all in vain. got my dinner after 30 min when all my copassengers finished eating. drinks were very sparse not offered more than once coffees were cold and tasteless and most foods were poor and stale  mostly carbohydrateheavy with almost no green salads. not the best airline for service i have flown with for some time across the oceans. on my return flights an online offer popped up during the online checkin to upgrade to business class but i got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only  not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try it gave me only one chance to upgrade. not impressed with the business class kitbag or other amenities. couldnt sleep in the modernized recliner at all. free business class lounge uses at dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. i am sorry for emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. from dubai to athens to newark the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline. really disappointed wont recommend to any friend or family and will try to avoid in the future unless a genuine offer is made.    dubai to san francisco. i do not think this airline cares about its economy class passengers. this is a very long flight. two hours into flight they did not even provided a cup of water. they gave a food menu. that was a farce. was it due to the flight attendants negligence or airlines policy. food menu had two choices yet when time came they told us only one item is available like it or not. the item were half cooked. they should have told us that no food will be available. that way passengers could have made their own arrangements.   trivandrum to seattle via dubai. recently i had a travel interstate in india in a volvo bus where the ticket was 600 per head and the push back seat gave full comfort of sitting and sleeping overnight during a 8 hours travel. now i also had a recent international trip with emirates in a flight where the ticket rate was 120000 per head and the seating arrangement reminded me of cattle transportation that i have seen in india. kindly consider that people travelling in economy are also human beings and please understand that when we do 1620 hours of journey you can at least provide a proper push back seat which is comfortable.   dubai to colombo. emirates stand as my preferred choice and the reason i pen these lines is to draw attention to a trend that seems to be slowly creeping in and lowering the standard. i travel economy as i have a back problem and feel more comfortable in the small harder seat sitting straight through a flight. my ticket was purchased in economy i subsequently received a mail to state that i had been specially selected for an upgrade on a small payment. i did this only to offer the seat to my son i later realized that most of the passengers had received the same message. this is actually a rip off as if i were to have bought a ccl ticket directly it would have cost me aed 3035 here with the ugs it ended up a little more but minus the ccl benefits. baggage limo and lounge. unlike several years ago when the crew looked stunning and of a better background today they seem to be quite poorly behind the uniform. gone is that poise and flare. on my return journey the crew managed to tick me off with her carelessness and rudeness. if i had never travelled emirates before it may have been my last. food not to my liking crew  stay in your pantry. regular seats limited pitch not suitable for the tall and well built. inflight movies  great kept me busy. tickets  great value for money but paid upgrade  should be avoided    birmingham to dubai. very disappointed what on earth has happened to emirates service extremely poor had service light on requesting some water to take a tablet for over an hour had window seat so couldnt get out  run out of food so was given a childs meal option drinks very sparse and food poor worst airline for service i have flown with for some time i must not forget however we got to dubai and back safe but i am sorry emirates the rest was more like you would expect from a budget airline really disappointed and will avoid in the future.   a disappointing experience. flew with emirates on the a380 from christchurch to sydney. had high expectations from my previous flight. emirates have a fantastic hard product on the a380. great spacious seat and fantastic entertainment systems. the food onboard the flight was great with a great selection of onboard beverages and wellpresented meals. i was very disappointed by the crew and received dull and uninterested service. the staff seemed to have no interest in the guests traveling. the service was efficient but cold. certainly room for improvement for a socalled leading airline. i would not recommend emirates if traveling in business class. there are alternative airlines that with great products and personalized service where you will have a more well rounded experience.   \\r\\r\\nflight 229 dubai to seattle. i last flew emirates business class two years ago and it was good. since then quality has severely declined. the aircraft for this flight was  according to the attendant  15 days old. they attendants didnt know how to use the seats. the seats themselves we not much wider than economy class. though they were lieflat seats the seats were cupped so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. uncomfortable this could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. the flight attendants didnt offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. for business class this is completely unacceptable. i had to ask several times just for water. when i said thank you they did not even say youre welcome. really awful.   this was our first time flying emirates and likely our last. we have taken many other business class flights before and the service provided on every single other carrier even american and chinese carriers far exceeded emirates. the hard product is excellent with the full floor lounge in dubai good seat and bar on the plane. however the biggest issue is that none of the crew seems to want to be there. its all a production line mentality. the service falls below what one would even expect in economy. also the food was very inferior given past reviews we had read about emirates. in short given the price point we would never fly emirates again when there are usually cheaper business class seats on other airlines with better service.    dubai to new york. this was our first time flying emirates and likely our last. we have taken many other business class flights before and the service provided on every single other carrier even american and chinese carriers far exceeded emirates. the hard product is excellent with the full floor lounge in dubai good seat and bar on the plane. however the biggest issue is that none of the crew seems to want to be there. its all a production line mentality. the service falls below what one would even expect in economy. also the food was very inferior given past reviews we had read about emirates. in short given the price point we would never fly emirates again when there are usually cheaper business class seats on other airlines with better service.    chicago to dubai in business class.  20 minutes after take off i pushed the button requesting a flight attendant as i needed a drink before i take my medicine to get some sleep. 15 minutes later no one showed up i assumed and understood that they may be busy helping others. so i decided to go to the galley to get it myself. where i was met by a cabin staff who initially refused to serve me but she started to question me why do i wanted the drink now  what reason cant you wait  i politely kept silent until i got my drink and went back to my seat. few hours later and i had been no longer than 6 minutes in business class lavatory i heard banging on the door. i signaled i heard the knocking. another minute later the banging started again as i was finishing washing my hands. hurried up to open the door only to find the same staffd was knocking asking if all ok and questioning why i spent that much time in the toilet i never responded but politely requested the purser who came to apologize. we all know that their service level is on the decline but never thought it would get that low. i cant say i will never fly emirates again as they serve routes and timing that i have no alternates for but i will avoid them as much as i can.    hamburg to mumbai via dubai. emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. while making online checkin they only provide to reserve seats in the middle check the attached picture. aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of economy. this is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. thats one of the reason why passengers do online checkin for the return flight aircraft was very light but the checkin staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. i was 3 kgs more than limit and when i pointed out the emirates online published baggage policy that luggage not exceeding 32 kgs the staff abruptly replied this policy is only for us bound passengers. but this is not mentioned anywhere. clearly she was dodging the rule. it seemed more like she has been instructed to shell out money. after after security check the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. even after boarding and settling down the manager came onboard to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. this was definitely the height honestly i couldnt believe she made this announcement. on 3 out 4 flights they served absolutely the same food i couldnt see it anymore forget about eating it. the staff was of mixed bag ranging between okay and poor with forced to work and doing a favour attitude. i fly twice a year long haul and based on my experience i dont want to fly emirates again. their publicity and reality are worlds apart get your acts together emirates lots to learn from singapore airlines.    dubai to bangkok the emirates experience has been degrading for years.  whereas flights of over 7 hours used to have two meals they now have just one. not even a snack can be spared on those flights even all the european airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack halfway through the flight. where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality you now get the same halfseasoned and halfbaked meals they even offer on budget airlines. the advertised wifi is nonexistent on many flights yes the you can connect to onair but mostly there is no connection behind it. the quality of their crew has been degrading as well. after years and many flights on emirates its time for me to move back to european airlines who seem to have stepped up their game under competition and who in general offer much better service and customer protection.     manchester to dubai. very disappointed is this down to cost cutting i have flown with emirates a number of times before and have always found the service and food excellent but after 12 months i could not believe the change. the airbus looked tired and poorly cleaned the food was abysmal many passengers complaining that their choice was not available the quality was so bad and the so called beef was like leather. i found some of the staff were very curt and acted as though they were fed up having to attend to passengers. i would use emirates again but only if travelling to dubai but i would certainly choose a different airline if flying elsewhere. what has gone wrong    zurich to auckland via dubai. both parts of the journey from zurich to dubai and from dubai to auckland were in a380 and both aircraft were rather old versions. the flights were smooth and not many turbulences. the food was just fine but definitively not the same standard in quality presentation or service like the one with competitors from asia cathay or europe swiss. emirates had excellent wines from france and australasia on these flights but the handling of those expensive wines by the crew was disappointing mostly the crew filled the wineglasses completely and on one occasion the steward just filled the great bordeaux in the same glas i had enjoyed before a merlot. the crew was very diverse with no minimal standard of service at all overall plainly disappointing and a lot of times unprofessional. the best is the entertainment systems which seems to have no limitation definitively one of the best. during the 24 hours airborne wit emirates in first no crew member ever addressed me ever by name with the exception of the cabin crew directors when making their welcome round in first and read my name from the passengers list.    i flew overnight birmingham to dubai then 1hour 30min stopver before flight to melbourne. upon arriving in dubai i checked the board and saw emirates flight to melbourne leaving from gate x so i headed to gate x. then i checked another board and it said gate z for emirates flight to melbourne. i figured that gate had changed and headed to gate z. when boarding was happening for emirates flight to melbourne at gate z they informed me i had missed my flight which left from gate x. they were very rude and said i had to go to the emirates connections counter. they informed me that there were 2 emirates flights to melbourne  leaving an hour apart and i had gone to the wrong gate. i also discovered that dubai airport had a new policy 6 months of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. i said to the emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to melbourne so i wouldnt miss my flight. another emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. emirates would not change my ticket as well as qantas who sold the original ticket airline partnership situation so i had to buy a new ticket for that leg 440. so in summary emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 emirates melbourne flights leaving dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers. shame on emirates and shame on qantas for this avoidable unfortunate situation.   flew fort lauderdale to casablanca via dubai. for the longest time i had wanted to fly emirates i was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. in fact about 2 years ago i had the chance to travel to dubai and visit emirates training centre where we toured the facilities it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. i could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. i get to the counter to check in and i was expecting luxury beautiful people in emirates fashion just like advertised reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain janes no problem at all just felt cheated. finally boarding time came and i was so anxious to get on board. as i get thru the planes door i suddenly realize is this a joke did i step into the wrong plane where is all the bedazzle all the luxury all the hype emirates told me i should expect as i walk thru first class business class and finally economy i am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft that is outdated and challenged in sophistication style and leg room. delta united or american airlines would have offered the same experience so what makes emirates the best economy airline in the world this was scheduled to be a 14  hour flight from fort lauderdale to dubai cant emirates use the most comfortable newest aircrafts for these longhaul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights emirates certainly does not think so. employees presentation another let down no gorgeous counter or onboard flight attendants which left a lot to be desired not all smiles here far from the gorgeous look i was expecting. cabin service was a let down as well for a 14hour flight i would have expected more than just dinner when dinner was served i had the szechuan chicken it was tasteless. breakfast a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14hour flight we had to get up and ask for water several times. overall my first experience flying with emirates was nothing as expected it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. i will say that emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy unfortunately it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly delta or american internationally again.      cairo to bangkok via dubai. dont get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price as those attractive prices have a dark side in the t&c especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates so they never solve the problem once it happens and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. you will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads and they have those monsters in their back office what even make it worst is that i am a regular customer since 2008 & i am on their skyward mileage reward with a very goodstrong history but still wasnt enough and they unleashed those complaint team on me. i bought a ticket with a stopover in dubai and i wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more so i went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesnt allow me to stay 1 more day max 7 days and if i want to stay then i have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price i paid for the 1st ticket so i asked the guy to check if i buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me so i submitted a complaint and  asked if there is a solution as simply the penalties doesnt make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty and i also mentioned that who has the time to read the t&c unless heshe has nothing to do in the world and i ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution then i would like to cancel my skyward. the complaint department replied with we know that you read the t&c and we should apply those conditions on you and theres no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation they left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back.  anyway i only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me and if you have the time to read the t&c then please do  otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.    cebu to london via dubai. the worst airline ive flown with. from check in to connecting flight in dubai. the staff and cabin crew were rude. they have false reassurance that someone will assist me with my connecting flight which is just 1 hour and 30 minutes apart. i was desperate because even the checkin service staff on my connecting flight did not know where im supposed to go. she was even rude and unapproachable. and on top of it all i am still missing with one luggage. when i got into the luggage desk they were all sarcastic. i have been travelling a lot and i have never been so badly treated like this before. very lousy service. im very disappointed and so devastated because i still am waiting for my luggage. from the stress that i have that ill miss my connecting flight in dubai to heathrow since i checked in in the philippines to the handling of my luggage i am extremely dissatisfied.  i was really expecting good service since the ratings ive seen and read about the airline was good but the opposite its really the worst flight ive ever been to in my entire life far more worst than domestic flights i had.    dubai to manila. old 777 was the equipment used in this sector. ife was not good as it was old. every 10 seconds if you are watching a movie or listening to music it buffers. i decided to stop what i was watching instead. i cannot complain to the crew as i notice the same issue with all other passengers when i looked at their screens. the crew is not good. dont smile at all. grooming check to be done for them as they look so haggard even at the start of the flight. the only good on this flight is non stop.    heathrow to auckland via dubai. we were looking forward to flying with emirates as they are rated very highly on some websites. we were left very disappointed on the first leg of the flight. the crew were miserable and unfriendly. one in particular was sarcastic rude and extremely unhelpful. another couple next to us also mentioned how rude shed been. i complained to emirates and they said it will take 30 days for a response. in my book thats not good enough.  will stay clear of emirates from now in.   emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. probably it has resulted from the costcutting measures they had to take. its competition qatar airways has on the other hand improved quite a lot and even etihad has better service on some parameters. on my last trip i observed the following 1 the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from india according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in dubai. 2 at least 10 passengers when reaching zurich couldnt find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3 they recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. what a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4 i cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5 the toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6 headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me. oman air has disposable earbuds they should learn from that. 7 food was awful. they should learn from etihad or qatar. i cannot even think of comparing lufthansa or any other european airline.   emirates is known for being bad but having to stand in a queue for 1.5 hours to board was a step too far during a feb 18 flight oslo  dubai. it was the same for business class. passengers were going crazy understandable given the situation. i fly emirates once a month and points system is also the worst globally. this is why i avoid emirates wherever possible. i also messaged the country manager of emirates for norway and iceland he was aware of issues but not willing to do anything to make up for the farce.     athens to newark. on a scheduled 11 hour flight from athens not once except with meals were refreshments offered including water and beverages etc. this was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. when a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. this was just the opposite of our experience on singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks sandwiches fruit and candy bars including toblerone candy bars. i was surprised n the difference in service between emirates and singapore airlines. we encountered the same lack of service from newark to athens as we did on the longer return trip.    hyderabad to new york jfk via dubai. business class seating comfort is great. but the service is appalling really disappointed if this is the kind of service we get in business class  what about economy skipped my dinner  mentioned the hostess that i will skip dinner but will have breakfast later and also mentioned what i like to have for breakfast. she noted it down and breakfast time came and went and i kept waiting for mine  at about the end of the breakfast hostess explains that the breakfast what i ordered is not there and i have to pick something else. couple of things here they decide to come and tell me that they are out when the flight is about the descent to the destination and hostess who knew that i skipped dinner does not bother to come and explain the same earlier. regardless i had lost my appetite by then  asked them to not bother but they insisted to get a hindu mealas that was the only thing available but that turned out to be stale. so they were successful in making me fast during the flight. i would think twice before i fly emirates again....    new york jfk to abuja via dubai. i had a terrible experience. when i got to dubai i had to pay 130usd 455 durham because my hand luggage was overweight by just 3kg.  emirates keep advertising duty free stuff on board and when people buy they  insist they pay excess when they have a connecting flight. there is absolutely no value for money with the long trip of over 20 hours from new york to nigeria and the airline exploiting passengers i am never flying emirates again.   ft lauderdale to hyderabad via dubai. emirates is the worst airline i have seen so far. their staff force customers from economy class to pay extra for luggage. i have checked in 2 bags and have a carryon bag and a laptop bag with me. i had a stop in dubai. they checked the weight of carry on in dubai. i made some shopping in dubai duty free. they are checking even duty free weight and charging extra for that. they made me pay 200 for 2 kgs extra which includes duty free weight. i will never ever travel again with emirates.    brussels to chennai via dubai. major concerns regarding emirates flight and ground staff support at dubai. my mother was traveling emirates from brussels to chennai with stopover in dubai. knowing her medical condition i ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. due to her medical condition shes unable to walk. this wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. and again after her flight experience. each time an emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. however on 23rd february 2018 upon arrival in dubai she wasnt given a wheelchair instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldnt accommodate her a wheelchair.  did not expect this from emirates. as a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight.  at this point im besides myself and have no words to express my fury over emirates and its customer service. on her return flight on march 6 we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair apparently emirates has levels of wheelchairs. yes once again she was denied a wheelchair at dubai airport. instead ground staff made her walk. emirates have no customer service skills nor respect for their customers.    bangkok to sydney. the boarding time was incredibly confusing with the boarding process slightly disorganised. we were  greeted onboard with champagne before take off. once airborne the dinner service was incredibly drawn out from taking orders to serving the dishes and drinks. from what i can see most of the cabin crew looked tired and wanted the process to be over with not many smiles going around only person stood out when she introduced herself. i managed to get 34 hours of sleep as the seat was quite comfortable but i can see the hard product is ageing. breakfast was very unsatisfactory basically fruit and bread which is nothing exciting for me to talk about. the ife was amazing with its many options i was entertained the whole flight. overall the experience was very average and not up to scratch and by far its my least favoured experience with emirates in a premium cabin.   on my 8.35 am flight march 3 from dubai to zurich the sound was not working. what a horrible experience. not only mine 44c but also 44 a and b. flight attendant said he would bring another ear piece one hour later he said he forgot. told him its the jack that was not working not the ear piece. one hour later he brought another ear piece then one more. smarter supervisor listened and said that it unfortunately was the jack that was not working. offered to find another place to sit but they forgot. 7 hour boring long flight.   flew amsterdam to dubai. emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. the quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard most of these details are no longer offered. i have flown emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time  and rarely do they make up for lost time. this flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. when you leave later and spend more time on board details start to matter. like for example how long it takes before meals are served. but even as important as when the meal trays are collected. the first they try to stall for obvious reasons they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. the later they serve it the less obvious the difference. the second causes unnecessary annoyance. when youre in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays  and you have to use the toilet  youre going to start having doubts about their service. their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. in the absence of alternatives like qatar airways youre almost forced to fly emirates to most of the middle east which is another annoyance. i am starting to give up hope the emirates of the 20082013 era will ever return. they have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen which i dont even use because i prefer to sleep.   flew johannesburg to beijing via dubai with emirates. very disappointing no coffee was served. i asked 3 times for a cup of coffee but didnt get it. the breakfast consisted of frozen pieces of fruit which had been too cold to eat for someone who has got senstive teeth. the croissant was dry and nothing to swallow it down. only tea was served. i dont drink tea.    melbourne to kuala lumpur via singapore. bought emirates tickets but fly with qantas and jestar. used to fly emirates and the services was pretty good so we went back to emirates. both qantas and jestar was ok too but this whole codeshare thing had really ruin our family trip. ticketing was not transferred properly from one airline to the other airline and we have had to scrumble to find our own way. when customer purchased a ticket from one airline their expectation is solely to that particular airline. otherwise we could have chosen other airlines. nearly missed our flight. treated poorly at counter and was told it was ticketed by another airline so we didnt get to choose seats food or nothing at all. essentially a subclass customers. we did not know nor had chosen qantas and jestar. not once heard of emirates other than paying more and handed to other airline including a budget airline.  we have had to carry our infant on hand despite empty seats are available. it was horrible.  totally unacceptable.   aircraft interior space including food and beverages were more than average. but the service by the ground and cabin crew were terrible and not acceptable. unbelievably they do not respond to the guests. they do not say a word other than commands to guests. they talk only when they have to instruct guests. i did not hear thank you welcome sorry even when they forgot to distribute food and beverages to us. not sure it is their culture or lack of company training but they looked quite rude to me. furthermore older aircrafts we flew with the seats were non reclining with touch screens where cursors pointed at where i did not touch with a hard to select menu. delta or other us airlines are much more friendly and polite.    london heathrow to dubai. overall an excellent flight. the ife was superb and plenty of latest movies to watch. i had a window seat and there did feel like there was a lot of room  i think the a380 does it for me. the food was delicious although my friend and i both wanted the lamb but there was a shortage so were given the chicken with gnocchi  which was very good. the staff on board were very good and helpful.   flew hong kong to dubai. in general the service of emirates has been bad on my recent experience that included checkin and inflight. but what makes its service appalling is not just the no desire to help and no smile its the cabin crews attitude of too proud to serve the customers. honestly i can withstand bad service from an airline but an inappropriate attitude is something that prevents me from choosing emirates again as i dont think any customer deserves that.    manchester to cape town via dubai. we chose to experience emirates based on their reputation despite taking a longer route via dbx. apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen the flight was fine. cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. the second leg from dubai to cape town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. on one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. whilst on the stand i reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. we had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. the area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. i went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. we appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. this affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. when i asked about this i was told that computer says its 25 degrees. in our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. the member of staff was dismissive. it would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed inflight. i decided to seek the supervisor. in regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. on the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. they agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. they said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. they presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. on arrival in cape town i sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. i received a curt rejection pointing me to the online complaints form. emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. on my return via johannesburg i asked to speak to the emirates group side manager to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. after a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the uk customer relations unit and still under investigation. to date still no contact some 37 days later. on the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively without saying a word. another poor pr exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything i can do for you my name is...  my general feeling is that emirates is resting on its historic reputation. having flown qatar airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard. in short not worth the effort of flying emirates   terrible service. crew members were all too proud to be serving customers  no smile no thank you no please. i dont know if this was arrogance or they were simply too proud to be serving customers. there were supposed to be a choice of main course however all i got was ‘grilled chicken without being offered a choice and the meal tray was passed from behind me so i had to turn my back to take the tray. totally unprofessional. i dont know what the hype is about with emirates. i will never travel on emirates again unless i have to without being offered a choice. i also want to mention that the check in staff at dxb was terrible. again no smile no welcome no nothing. basically not interested in serving customers.   emirates have become a low cost carrier. flew christchurch to sydney on a380 in business class ek413. whilst this is a short flight i have paid a premium for business class emirates are now at a race to the bottom for service. the a380 business class is the new economy class. there are so many people to cater for staff can not handle it. no predinner drink offered and had to ask twice for a drink. staff were rude and unfriendly. dinner was inedible and no drink service again had to ask for a glass of wine and by the time it came out it was the end of service. last time i flew emirates i had noticed the deterioration of service. i didnt think it could get any worse.    singapore to paris via dubai. our seats were changed without notice.i would like to clarify that the seat from dubai to paris was already allocated to us in singapore changi airport. our seats was arrange seated together. when we arrived in dubai they replaced us with another boarding pass. as for the luggage they damaged my luggage with one wheel missing and replaced me with a smaller and low quality luggage.    bangkok to istanbul via dubai. ive used emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. i recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in dubai with emirates. the airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. it is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. there are always long queues for security checks. the terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in dubai. in my latest flight from bangkok to istanbul the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. the flight from bangkok to dubai delayed 45 minutes which means that i will definitely miss my flight in dubai to istanbul. despite this fact ground staff in bangkok reassured me that i would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to istanbul. when i arrived at dubai airport 45 minutes delayed the ground personal informed me that my seat to istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. she told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm uae time. with no further assistance she left. i had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. the response i received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. my latter complaints were totally ignored. other issues with this airline their seat layout 343 seat which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. it makes you feel claustrophobic. one annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. yes it is cheaper compared to other airlines and maybe should be listed in budget airline category.    birmingham to cape town via dubai. booked flight online for myself partner and my 16 year old daughter only to be asked at check in for her birth certificate and a lawyers letter to enter south africa. at no point during the flight booking did it flag up the fact these documents were required. the man on check in  kept referring to the need for a visa to enter south africa hence the requirement for paper work. you do not need a visa to enter south africa. surely the need for birth certificates etc should be flagged on entering each passengers dob to prevent this happening. i contacted the south african immigration whilst the man continued to deny my daughter and told that they would have had no problem allowing my 16 year old daughter to enter. still she was refused. the customer service manager did not even take the time to listen to us. he appeared to take great delight in shattering my daughters long awaited visit to south africa. well done emirates.    munich to jakarta via dubai. the quality and service with emirates has gone downhill within years. upon arrival in munich i am informed that one of the seats in the a380 is damaged and been told to change the seat. in addition to that customer ignored the seating requested. the seat is damaged was located in the window seat and only middle seat available because it is a full flight. never experience like this before on other airline. the first food was edible and the second one before landing was awful. the entertainment on my seat was broken asking staff for help but ignored this helped. the wifi is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. last leg on dxbcgk this is at least better than the mucdxb route which everything works fine. the service on the a380 was unacceptable with lack of customer support who decides on changing seat for the customers that flies the a380. in the future i will avoid their a380 because of this issues with ife etc. i have sent complaint to the airline which im still waiting for any replies about this experience.   my flight on the outward journey and inward journey was late and we had to run the length of dubai airport to catch our connecting flight. dubai airport is huge and my husband has trouble walking let alone running. cabin crew on return flight from dubai to manchester were dreadful. we were 3 and a half hours before a drink was offered but we could clearly see the staff in the galley eating and drinking and have a good old laugh. they said nothing when a man walked up the aisle cleaning his teeth with toothpaste and a brush with disgusting bits flying over the other passengers. a horrible experience from start to finish.    i had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchenpantry. and because of this i receive constant noises and laughter from the staff even when the public lights are off waking me up at several times. thats not all i had paid for extra legroom but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over causing me to retract my legs all the time. hence the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact i dont get any throughout the flight. to make things worst there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats so during landing and take off 2 staff will be sitting there. and because they are sitting there i have to retract my  legs again. id paid for extra legroom but in the end it was a terrible experience. never again am i going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane especially from emirates. terrible experience. as for the other experiences most of the crew were ok they will serve and do their job but lack the smile on their face. not that they look rude or unhappy its just not the expression you will receive in flights like singapore air. inflight entertainment was good great contents but the touchscreen was terrible. touchscreen is based on a mouse cursor on screen. if you touch a particular button you need to do it a few times so that the cursor will understand that it should be at your thumb. hence a difficult screen to control.   auckland to london via dubai. first time to fly on emirates and was expecting excellent service for a big airline fleet. i was disappointed. the flight attendants seemed unhappy and unenthusiastic with what they are doing. they seemed robotic and lacked human compassion that ive experienced with other airlines. the seats are cramped with little leg room that i couldnt even get pass seated on the window side without having to wake the sleeping person next to me. i know that economy class isnt really first class service but i had the best time flying with qantas    washington to delhi through dubai. everything looked fine until i reached dubai airport before gate. my luggage was weighed by emirates staff one cabin bag and a laptop bag and i was passed through. at next stage a female staff informed that i couldnt carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and i will need to checkit in. i requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and i couldnt check it in i even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents. while i was talking to her the supervisor came to me grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told i am not allowed to take a laptop bag. i explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carryon item such as laptop is allowed. he said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and i will need to pay the money for that. i told it was already passed from washington airport as well as here dubai also. it looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.  finally i requested him to let me go and i will pay the additional charge. after a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to check in my luggage and didnt allow in the flight.    jakarta to moscow via dubai. emirates ruined my vacation. had a really awful experience with emirates. on our way back from jakarta to dubai our flight was cancelled and emirates never notified us. as a result we showed up on time of our original flight only to find out that emirates moved us to an earlier flight without notifying us. emirates refused to sit us on another flight and we had to buy new tickets back home all the way from jakarta to moscow. even after that incident for 3 months already im struggling to get a confirmation that my flight was cancelled to get a compensation from my travel insurance company. and for 3 months i encounter the heaviest bureaucracy ive seen in years. and zero result. never again i will fly with emirates.    hyderabad to london via dubai. we have experienced firsthand how highhanded emirates has become lately. we are told to checkin our carryon luggage at the gate just before entering the flight in hyderabad en route to lhr via dubai. once we reached lhr one of the checked carryon bag went missing. we got our bag finally after 3 days of minimal communication from emirates only to find out our laptop got stolen along with other food items. emirates did not inform us about missing stuff when the bag got delivered. their customer service  responses were canned and totally put the blame on us for checking in the bag. such a shame     flew dubai to lisbon. if you are looking for a comfortable seat dont fly emirates. the seats were in very bad shape and had almost zero padding. furthermore despite paying quite a substantial amount for the exit row seats to ensure we had extra legroom on the dubai to lisbon leg the space we paid for was constantly filled by passengers queuing up to have their photographs taken with emirates service staff. this practice which appeared to be encouraged by emirates staff resulted in great inconvenience to ourselves and many other passengers. the choice of entertainment was also below par.    amsterdam to melbourne via dubai with emirates in may 2018. it was genuinely a disappointing trip and  confirmed just how overrated emirates is. on the amsdxb sector every cabin crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. people would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or thank you of acknowledgement. they were far from friendly could not crack a smile and appeared like emotionless robots. the seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without reupholstering. thats not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. the entertainment system was a joke. please dont get me started on it. on not one but both sectors there was no recognition in their system that i had requested a vegetarian meal so i was lucky to be graced with untouched leftover vegetarian meals on both sectors but only for one meal on each flight. the cabin crew on the first flight couldnt stop reminding me how lucky i was and that it was my fault and patronised me repeatedly saying mmm yes just next time you must request your meal beforehand. they seemed to have not listened to a word i said. regardless there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu.    this was my first experience with emirates and i was surprised how average it was. maybe expectations were too high but this experience was just not as good as emirates promotes itself best airline really the aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. the cabin was not clean. the staff were not friendly and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. entertainment system was not very handy the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights so i had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. i didnt like the selection of movies either  there were many movies in the database including asian bollywood etc but all of the western movies were more or less of the same genre. same with tv shows. the dinner was very good however only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient only an old sandwich was given before landing. there were no snacks or beverages in between. no amenity kits provided. there was wifi onboard 2 hours free. on a positive note you can checkin 2 bags 32 kg each. overall it was all okay because emirates flight was the cheapest one among all flights available for this route and date. i would be very disapointed otherwise though. the fleets are new comfy. flew naritadubaimunich and romenarita. always wanted to try a380. the fas were awful. on one flight the table was dirty. i took 4 flights in total and every time i experienced something horrible. firstly they didnt give me the bread and i had to ask 2 times for it next i had to wait over 15 mins to receive my main dish. i asked for water that i didnt receive. this is the worst airline service i have experienced so far. travelled on a qantas ticket from perth australia to london gatwick on 19th december. firstly we could not find an overhead locker to out our 1 piece of luggage in. i asked an attendant to assist us and he stated i am not a luggage attendant. next it took 2 hours to be offered any form of refreshment and then it was abysmal. i wanted another drink and buzzed for assistance but nobody came. the inflight entertainment was excellent though but all in all a bad flight  perth to dubai. dubai airport  the emirates lounge was the best i have ever been in and enjoyed the 4 hour lay over. dubai to gatwick  slightly better as the staff were a little more customer focused. food terrible though. will be travelling back in the new year and am not looking forward to it but this time a stop over in dubai may make the experience a little better. never again will i travel on emirates unless i can afford business class. nbosinnbo. first leg was alright but nothing great. food service was slow and fa didnt clear trays for ages. second leg to singapore on a380 was much anticipated but disappointing seat configuration thus narrow seats thus alot of discomfort. sindxb was much better but had to keep asking for waterdrinks. dont know why they just dont offer bottles of water like in business class. flying from singapore to perth on qantas we were given bottles of water to rehydrate  great for a 5 hours flight and essential for a 10 hour flight which emirates should consider. last flight was the worst  lots of turbulence so we didnt get any meals. not emirates fault but the crew were very unprofessional. very thirsty flight again as not enough waterdrinks provided. granted we had to remain seated during the turbulence but one cup of water and 1 juice is not enough for a 5 hour flight. cabin crew on all sectors were not very helpful and not very friendly. same could be said of counter staff at the business class lounge. weve been flying emirates for 10 years and except for the last couple of years due to a change in our country of abode and travel patterns have had to use other airlines so have slipped down to skywards silver status. we were planning to use emirates more for our 2014 flights but will now consider other airlines. the only saving grace is the ice entertainment system which helps you forget the lack of waterdrinks the bland food and that tray in front of you. cmbsin in late december. flight boarded late although had arrived on time from dxb with no explanation and a call 40 mins before anything happened. relatively comfortable seating on a 777  the two of us had one of the only rows with only two seats at the very back. great inflight entertainment but let down by lousy service. they seemed disorganised at best and the meal and drinks took 2.5 hours to arrive. quality of food not good but given plenty of actually drinkable wine with a smile and apologies. great arrival experience in sin  we were out 20 mins after touchdown. ek 201 on 26 november. return on 24 december. a380 jfkdxb. staff were unprofessional. spent a lot of time chatting in the galley while setting up and serving meals took a long time. in between meals a fasten seat belt sign was on for long spells with no apparent turbulent weather and no one allowed to leave seats even to head to a toilet no drinks were offered so people had to make their way to the galley. once a meal is served it takes hours for the trays to be cleared. passengers walked the trays to the galley themselves although the menus are handed out at the start on one leg it was the wrong one most often in economy the choices had completely run out and the only comment from the staff was we have bad news. the a380 is too big too crowded too noisy too uncomfortable too irritating and no way to travel on a long haul. kuala lumpur to london heathrow on 5th january 2014. the prices are reasonable and the service is quite good. 2 years ago i felt the attitude of the cabin crew was poor so i avoided the airline after that. the staff were not responding to calls and was even rude to passengers. this year i thought id use emirates again. i rang my call button twice and both times it took them more than half an hour to respond. they just didnt seemed bothered about serving. the food was served very late. in summary emirates is a good airline but they just need to buck up with the cabin crew service. sydaklmel a380. very disappointing i have flown emirates about 10 times and it is consistently deteriorating now to the point where it is not worth bothering with. the previously generous and hispec economy meals have been replaced with a smaller tray with much lower quality food. the crew on both flights were unprofessional to the point of it being quite sad on the first flight the service was a shambolic mess and on the second they were far more concerned with flirting with each other and chatting rather than serving passengers. call bells were never answered meal service took far too long on both flights and the toilets were utterly revolting despite the newish aircraft. only good part is the ife. sorry to say i wont fly emirates ever again. i flew with my husband on our first emirates flight on ek434 and ek435 business class to brisbane in november we usually fly ba or singapore airlines. i have a few comments to make on the trip first of all the food and drink service was appalling. we had to wait for service were omitted on several occasions and by the time the drink came around the meal was finished. i asked for drinks on a number of occasions and didnt get it even using 2 different malefemale cabin crew. i had to get up myself and go to the bar for water on several occasions to find the staff chatting quite happily in the rear oblivious to the alert light i had pressed for assistance . but the most disappointing part of the trip was on the short stopover in dubai business lounge on the return flight we expected to have a shower and change. the facilities in dubai were pathetic there were queues and the turnover in cleaning the shower cubicles was painfully slow. we gave up and continued on our journey without refreshing the business lounge in dubai leaves much to be desired it is difficult to find food and the way it is designed could definitely be improved. after british airways and singapore airlines and qantas we would put it bottom of the list. zrhdxbmru 81213 business out. business is is ok but not world class. staff are attentive but not all the time  return in economy. emirates economy must be one of the most uncomfortable experiences of any airline. 10 seats abreast on a 777 no footrest on the dxbmru leg on an old aircraft. emirates must be one of the most overrated airlines on this site. recently flown emirates while on holiday with my family to singapore and sydney from new zealand. i have very specific requirements when traveling due to using an electric wheelchair for mobility. despite emailing the airline in advance with these requirements i had a distressing experience using this airline. it was awful from checkin to landing. the customer service was terrible at the checkin desk. the emirates crew at sydney airport were unfriendly and they were more interested in talking amongst themselves. at checkin i explained that id like to drive my wheelchair up to the entrance of the plane. checkin staff made a lot of calls and eventually they assured me they were happy with my request. having reached the gate with my family the bad service continued. the lady at the gate was surprised to see me and asked why i wasnt in a transit chair. she refused to process my boarding early. she ignored my explanation regarding my wheelchair and brought out a transit chair for me to transfer into. when i refused she made more calls and finally she allowed my family and i to continue toward the entrance of the plane. on board usually when a passenger with a disability is onboard a cabin service manager csm comes to say helloand make sure all is ok. i was totally ignored. the food was terrible to say the least. flight attendants did not seem interested in passengers. when we landed i had to wait for other passengers to get off first. once the cabins were cleared i was told that a chair was on its way. 15 minutes later she showed us to a transit chair. my heart sank. i asked where my chair was and i asked that it be brought to the entrance of the plane instead. i pointed out to her that she clearly saw me board the plane with my chair and i was requesting the same procedure to happen in order for me to get off the plane. within a few minutes my chair was brought to the plane. what could have been a very simple problem to resolve turned out to be a nightmare. i am hesitant to travel with emirates again. bangkok to sydney departing 10114 qf 8418. very disappointing after all the hype. check in was a long and tedious process and between my wife and i we were a couple of kilos over the checked baggage allowance and had to argue the toss for them to allow to 2 kilos over between the two of us. boarding at bangkok was confusing. the inflight service was not too bad except we were served breakfast missing the promised croissants and whe we brought this to the cabin crews attention they found two cold ones for us. we had to ask three times for our sydney arrival cards to be given to us. the entertainment system is excellent. following our first experience with emirates would not recommend them as a first choice airline as there are better alternatives. emirates is either expanding too fast or resting on its laurels. fradxb  sindxb  dxbfra. one of the most overrated airlines in my opinion. seats and food okay but not more than average. cabin crew far to young to provide professional service. all service rounds appeared quite disorganized and took ages. crew friendly but more into interaction with themselves than with the passengers. it´ s a pity that qf is codesharing with this airline on the frasyd route. dxbdub  business class out and y class back. gold member. the experience is a mixed bag outward in biz pick up on time. flight on time lounge is to me nothing but an upgrade from the main terminal with free food and drink. staff all look over stretched and it is not in comparison to other leading airlines where you can have a quiet zone to work. its over crowded  busy and too open meaning that all sounds travel. flight fine very full. staff did their job but lacked any interaction skills. return in y again flight over booked their policy of 3x4x3 seating on the 777 is just too tight. ice as ever was good and staff were not attentive pressed the call button numerous time  they walked past me. vanished for over 23 hours mid flight. food on both legs was terrible had ordered a low cholesterol meal with low fat. both times a salad with lettuce and tomato no dressing and fish in biz class was actually burnt so bad to was like plastic. i asked for an alternative and they had biriyani. you get better in y class on saudia for a 1.5 hour flight. in y class on return chicken breast that you could put through a window and white rice inedible. its a pity qatar dont start entering this route as i would gladly fly them in future. emirates are expanding at a fast track rate but seem to be loosing the edge when maintaining standards. in december i flew emirates on 4 different occasions from copenhagen to dubaibangkok and im sorry to say that i was disappointed. the most annoying was the slow and confusing service of the cabin crew it took more than 2 hours for them to serve anything on each of the flights and it seemed like they were all trainees. on the first flight we had great large new screens for the inflight entertainment system but on the other flights the planes were equipped with an earlier version which was not at all as good. the check in and boarding procedures worked fine although there are always a lot of people who dont understand the boarding priorities. the food and beverage were of average quality and you more or less had to go and ask for the drinks by yourself. i will travel with emirates again if i will get a good price but not for the comfort and service level. traveled dxbdardxb on boeing 777300. crew was friendly but responded to call after 2 hours. the entertainment system was ice and had millions of movies and tv shows to last you a year let alone a 5 hour flight. seats were comfy but less legroom. food was excellent no complaints. overall i really enjoyed emirates and would recommend it to anyone. fraper via dxb dec 2013. seating comfort was very poor and comparable to a cheap charter airline. cabin service was as poor as the seating. the crew were uninterested and unfriendly to the passengers. one fa was not able to form a complete sentence when he asked after the passengers wish chicken beef coffee. fa call signs were generally ignored. if you want a bottle of water you had to proceed to the galley. this was our first and last flight with emirates. flew 2 way from jfkdubaimanila last nov jan respectively. the a380 was a nice airplane with decent seats but the inflight service was underwhelming. the serving of the food was very disorganised and meal selections were always not available. the attendants were serving the coffeetea at the same time they were serving the meal and beverage. flight attendants were ignoring flight attendant call signalbuttons. i was disappointed thinking that the flight to manila via dubai would be better as the fare was more expensive and longer. the inflight services on flights via asian routes are much much better no comparison. ek005 7th jan business class with my wife and two boys aged 7 and 4. very disappointing. the preordered childrens meals were not available i was told by the fa that they had been given to other children. why were there not sufficient meals on board i can understand if an adult choice is not available but an airline of this supposed stature should not do this. the adult choices were spicy or containing beef which we do not eat. when i complained the fa giggled and offered me a drink the service was disorganised and awful. i will avoid emirates in the future travelled london to new zealand via dubai and sydney. inflight entertainment was superb but unfortunately thats about the only positive thing i can say about the airline. of the half dozen requests made to the in flight staff all were turned down and were not talking about anything special. examples such as can i have a new set of headphones these dont work can you please fix my screen as it wont turn on. food service was shambolic childrens meals being sent out up to an hour before the rest of the service crew walking around randomly with a couple of trays looking for people repeated offers to give me a childs meal even though i had never asked for one so inefficient. once the main service started the crew constantly ran out of options condiments bread rolls etc. because they were blocking the aisles for so long people who had been served wanted to use the rest rooms and the crew didnt want to let them past and didnt want to clear up the childrens trays which in some cases were there from 2 hours before. having the inflight entertainment interrupted for emirates advertising is pretty irritating too especially when you are trying to settle children down who dont want a seat belt on pre take off. lastly  would it hurt the crew to treat the passengers like customers smile respond to passenger calls and dont stand around the galleys gossiping. wont be flying myself and family again and wouldnt recommend emirates. we flew sydney  dublin return and it was underwhelming to say the least. the service on board was very poor meals were rushed and it took over an hour and two requests to get a glass of water on more than one occasion. the cabin crew were at best not very friendly with some being extremely rude. passengers who needed to use the washroom during the meal service were told by one crew member to wait until after the service or they would not get back to their seat. i have flown with emirates on 8 occasions economy and the flight from dubai to gatwick on december 29th 2013 will be the last i have given the airline the benefit of doubt for too long already. their prices are sky high and the service on board is chaotic. the staff are friendly enough but uncoordinated. the last 3 times they ran out of the meal i would have preferred. flying out to dubai this christmas it was 3.5 hours into the flight before we received a meal at all and it was cold. on yet another flight they forgot to serve regular meals those not prebooked to the whole block of seats from the rearward bulkhead onward. on a new a380 a couple of years ago i flew to dubai from heathrow with part of the ceiling flapping about above my head. on 2 occasions the ice entertainment system was faulty. my main complaint though is with the poor cabin service. i flew with my wife in business class this month from manchester to dubai and then changed for another emirates flight to singapore. we returned some 7 days later 4 flights with emirates 3 on the a380 and one on a 777300. the seats on the a380 are fully flat but so narrow only 18.5 basically an economy class seat that goes flat and not very comfortable. the 777 seats are a bit wider 20.5 but not full flat. the cabin service on all 4 flights was awful they have so many different nationalities that clearly do not work well together and they have no real interest in the passengers. they are not organised never smile and do not seem to know what they are doing. dubai airport itself is a disaster chaotic no helpful ground staff. one of the business class lounges was ok but the other one in the older terminal i think was dirty and run down. we paid over 4500 for the flights i feel really hard done by. traveled dxbdardxb on boeing 777300. crew was friendly but responded to call after 2 hours. the entertainment system was ice and had millions of movies and tv shows to last you a year let alone a 5 hour flight. seats were comfy but less legroom. food was excellent no complaints. overall i really enjoyed emirates and would recommend it to anyone. ek 407 aklmel first class a380800. first class cabin crew seemed very disorganised inattentive uninterested and lacking proper management. preflight drinks champagne only no juice no water were offered to some pax but not others snack baskets missing from some suites several calls to flight attendants ignored no predinner drinks offered. menu and wine list given but no dinner order taken until i eventually attracted someones attention and by then it was almost too late. no duty free order taken complicated seat adjustmententertainment controls not explained despite requests customs forms handed out only after final descent. in order to get anyones attention call button was repeatedly ignored i went back to the galley to find the flight attendants sitting around giggling and gossiping. very sloppy and unprofessional and not what i pay a first class fare for. flew lhrdxb return in january of this year. seat on a380 spacious and comfortable ice system great toilets clean flights largely on time. only problem is the dreadful cabin crew. so disorganised and slow when serving meals. took 2 hours on the lhrdxb flight to be offered a drink. in the end i went up to the galley area where the crew were just chatting and asked for water. meal was served 3 hours into a 6 hour night flight so no one got any sleep. not a single drinks run after that. service truly appalling compared to airlines like singapore airlines. also no comfort kit was provided  socks toothbrush etc which i suppose is a minor thing. return flight was better as there was one drinks run. still not great though. wouldnt choose to fly with them again. ek432 singaporebrisbane 2512014. having flown international business class many times on several airlines this trip can only be rated as the worst experience my wife and i have had in either economy class or business class. staff were unhelpful and obviously unsuited to their job. from checkin to the final getting off the aircraft was one of poor service. the white wine i was served after takeoff was warm the lamb i ordered for my meal was overcooked and almost inedible the entertainment system was awkward to use and no instructions on how to use it were supplied. the flight attendant asked us after take off whether we were familiar with the entertainment system and when we replied no she said she would come back and explain she never came back i will never fly emirates again. 29th jan dubai to perth. took an hour to check in and drop bags. plane delayed an hour without telling passengers. everyone was herded into a tiny departure room so we could wait in discomfort. had booked kids meals they didnt arrive. staff stormed off and came back with kids meals. rest of the food was some of the worst dried out pasta scrambled eggs with the consistency of mashed potato for breakfast. asked for another drink it never came. overnight flight included the cabin screens flashing bright white every 20 mins. 25 jan london to dubai. same carry on with kids meals. very average service and food. had to wait 40 minutes for bags after we had cleared passport control. very disappointed. 12 dec 2013 flight ek004 from lhr. staff on emirates flight from london to dubai are getting worse. they ignored both my children 5 and 8 years old no toys. they did not have the ordered meals for the children. head steward claimed i had not ordered them but i had proof that i had ordered them. these are a380 flight crew  what is the point in getting a new flight when the staff cannot meet the basics needs of passengers. a380 flight from jfk  dubai  kuala lumpur early in december 2013 with my wife and 3year old son. 1st leg jfk dubaikl. on the jfk  dubai route they flew the a380 which was nearly full. it was an 11 pm flight  the crew only began to start serving food 4hrs after takeoff my son did not receive his complimentary inflight toy set they did give the toys out but ran out before reaching us. always had to do a reminder request for water or drinks dubai  kl route they flew us in a very old a330  flight was cramped and the seats smelt the surface of my seat was worn out and torn. the airconditioning and ventilation wasnt working before the flight and performed poorly in the air. return leg kl  dubai the a380 plane blackedout when the plane was boarded and engineers had to come on board to fix the problem. during this time the plane was dark very stuffy no any offer from the crew to provide drinks. lots of apologies from the captain though but the flight was delayed almost an hour. seattledubaisydney. our flights from sydney to dubai to seattle were mediocre. customer service was marginal in terms of fa attentiveness and politeness. our son had a childs meal ordered and it was delivered 45 minutes before we were served our meal. while the a380 had a dedicated restroom attendant from sydney to dubai that was not the case on the 777200er on the dubai to seattle route. two restrooms became inoperative during this flight and the remaining ones were filthy by the time we arrived in seattle. the ice entertainment system was the best feature of the flights. good selection of moviestv shows and news. flew bkksyd on feb 7th. business class lounge closed for refurbishment. very shocked at the low standard of the substitute qantas lounge  extremely average. cheap wine and almost no food. business class cabin was full. dinner service on overnight flight was average. no amenities kit on 9 hour overnight flight. surprisingly second rate ife  no comparison with premium routes. breakfast was continental  it consisted of fruit dry croissant and coffee. overall this was an extremely average experience. the seats are fine so great for sleeping but the service and product beyond that are nonexistent. emirates used to be good 2 years ago. i flew from jfk to bangladesh through milan then dubai 8 hours flight each way. it was a very uncomfortable 29 hours trip because the service was very poor. coming back was 39 hours trip. when i pressed the call button staff no one came for the entire 8 hours flight same for bangladesh to dubai. i had to get up and get the water myself after 90 minutes of waiting. i paid over 2.500 usd and it was not worth the money. the seats were so close together that the passenger next to me had to place his leg on my side just to fit into his seat. the only good thing i can say about my trip was that the food and entertainment system was good. flew a 777 adelaidedubaiistanbul  reasonable service but very slow. the a380 return flight amsterdamdubai  service was shocking. we had finished our entrée and were still waiting for a glass of wine we had finished our main course and were still waiting for a glass of wine. i will never fly emirates again. we went emirates because they fly direct from adelaide and they were a one world affiliate but next time we go overseas europe in june 2015 we will go to sydney or melbourne and fly qantas dxbbkk  business. upgraded with milesek are pulling a fast one with skywards members in that part of the biz class package is chauffeur pick up and drop. you must upgrade at the airport and hope there are seats which will cost you 45000 miles which is huge amount of miles for a simple seat upgrade. staff were good to bkk on the a380 food as usual not good small portions menu offers soup etc its never given main course birani again rice as a main in business class wines are being cut back. overall average there and back entertainment good as ever. return on 772300 older model needs an upgrade its well over 10 years interiors and seat has seen better days with padding poor. staff on this leg insisted that lights stay on full blast until 5 passengers complained that they wished to sleep as a 8 am departure senior refused until 4 hours into the flight. aucklandmelbournedubaiamsterdam. i wasnt really convinced about the quality of the airline. the good things were the inflight entertainment and the food. however service was very poor with flight attendants not really knowing what theyre doing. disorganised team of 2030 year olds. will definitely choose singapore airlines or one of the other asian carriers again next time nairobi to manchester via dxb and back. having loyally used emirates for the last couple of years i am extremely disappointed with ek719 dxbnrb flight back home on 3rd feb. as if the discomfort was not enough the seat pockets were a shambles torn and hanging. an attendant loudly said to a passenger in response as to why he doesnt take flight meals i totally agree with you on this. this while serving the rest of us. such a pity really. business class bkk to syd  i felt like i was inconveniencing the flight attendant. the food was very ordinary but it was the service that was woeful. the flight attendant allocated to our seats was rude whenever we asked for anything. no comfort kit. my tray of food was taken away that quickly and with that little eye contact that it was not possible to ask for another drink. syd to bkk was acceptable but not as good as it was a few years ago. perth to dubai and then dubai to istanbul and return. main problem is no water or drinks served until 4 hours into a 10.5 hr flight. service awful. on board entertainment broken for one entire 10.5 hour leg of flight. really terrible experience. food was inedible apart from a salad on one of the legs. ek419 syddxb 251113. ek005 dxblhr 291113. ek026 gladxb 13114. ek412 dxbsyd 14114. very poor service. glasgow to sydney it was 3 hours before they offered the first drink i was thirsty so asked for a drink before take off after that i was still thirsty so i pressed my button for assistance but no one came. it wasnt until after the meals came around 3 hours into the flight that i got offered a drink. the breakfast options were both egg options so if you dont like egg you are not getting a meal. dubper 23114 qf8424. plane old and dirty  disorganised boarding people in my seat refusing to move as they wanted to sit together requiring cabin crew to intervene. in flight entertainment not working. no food or drinks service until nearly 4 hours in to a 10 hour flight. food served poor quality and cold. when asking for a glass of wine and water cabin crew initially refused saying one drink only only drinks offered during the 2 meal services. seat pocket broken. would not not not recommend unless they upgrade the planes going in to perth. flew from mumbai to jfk via dubai on february 4th this year in coacheconomy. the cabin crew seemed very disinterested. the seat was broken and i had to repair it myself on the mumbai to dubai flt 509 leg of the journey. the overnight portion of the trip dubai to jfk flt 203 was very unpleasant principally due to the over abundance of passengers traveling with young children who screamed the entire flight. it was impossible to read or watch a movie. the flight attendants simply didnt want to be bothered. the first class service on this aucklandmelbourne flight was atrocious and for the money i paid totally unacceptable. food service was chaotic  i had to ask for bread wine and salad dressing was offered with dessert the person sitting next to me almost didnt get any dinner at all because nobody took her order. no tea or coffee was offered after dinner and repeated calls to flight attendants were ignored. they didnt seem to know what they were doing and spent most of the flight hanging around in the galley area chatting. the good news very comfortable seats and great inflight entertainment but they didnt compensate for some of the worst service any class any airline i have ever experienced. im going back to singapore airlines. as we checked in at london gatwick for emirates flight ek0016 we were told the flight was delayed 1 hour advised that there were around 30 of us so there would probably be ground staff waiting for us to escort us to the connecting gate. we asked whilst in the air if we would make the connecting flight and were told we would arrive at 1am and therefore would have plenty of time to make our way to the connecting gate. arrived at the airport disembarked and were met by ground staff at 1.40am who advised us the connecting flight had already left. we were sat in the connecting flight area while our baggage claim tickets were taken from us advised that they needed to rebook our flights. when we were given meal vouchers at 2.20am i asked how long we would be waiting for they couldnt give a time. told we would be on the 9.55am qantas flight to sydney qf002. given a hotel voucher and advised we needed to be back 2 hours before the flight to checkin. 5 hours at the hotel did not seem worth the hassle and we asked if we could instead use the emirates lounge told no to this request. we finally got to the hotel at 4.30am. when we finally arrived back at dubai airport to check in to our rebooked flight we were told that as it was an almost full flight there were no seats next to each other left and that we would be sitting in separate aisles and middle seats. we did not pay extra money to be on a flight that arrived at a convenient time in sydney only to have this ordeal happen to us and to be put on a full flight where we could not even sit next to the person we booked our flight with. our dietary requirements were not carried over to the next flight we were not given an apology for this or an alternative solution. other airline would have provided. sydney  christchurch  sydney. the flight over was acceptable with service pretty poor only one choice left out of two for the meal only one side of the sound in my headphones for ife worked. seats were cramped and uncomfortable. flight back was poor. flight was an hour late departing although they made up a lot of that time. staff are quite rude tending to order you around and not showing much interest in customer comfort. my seat had a great big lump in the back like a spring had come loose or something. it was very uncomfortable. i told the fa who wasnt very interested but said shed see if anything else was available after we took off. i told her id like to sit with my wife and she said its only a couple of hours so put up with it. it was so uncomfortable im not sure what i would have done if it had been a longer haul. food was ok had a choice this time ife ok. travelling back from bangkok on 23rd feb our flight was scheduled to land in dubai airport at 00.30 local time. due to the fog from the previous day in dubai we were told when checking in that our flight from bangkok would be delayed 2 hours making our departure time 22.40 instead of 20.40. when we received our boarding passes they were printed with a departure time of 00.10 meaning a delay of 3.5 hours. after 4  hours of no updated information they called us to the gates. eventually arrive in dubai at around 5.30 am local time 5 hours after our scheduled arrival time. after an hour or so with very little movement in queues peoples patience began to wear thin. after 3 hours we decided to try somewhere else in the airport for answers i eventually got on a flight at 5pm that day and arrived home around 40 hours after leaving my hotel in bangkok. i am fast approaching 60 years have travelled all over the world using many airlines have experienced delays before but never have i encountered such lack of care. ek 313 and ek 312  17th feb and 22nd feb 2014. ive done 2 flights in the last week with emirates 1 in business and 1 in economy and i have to say its been very hit and miss with the service and food served. the economy flight dxb to tokyo and the return was in business. funny thing was the economy journey was better reasonable food and service. the seats were good for economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. the service in business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average. the seats i found very narrow and carried the vibrations of people walking past and the person next to me moving around. we were delayed nearly 5 hours onroute because of fog in dubai which is not the airlines fault of course but a lack of communicating left everyone wondering what was going on. i was very surprised overall by the quality of the business experience. ill be sticking with qantas a380 from laxdxbmaa. lax to dxb was the worst. i had an infant child of 9 months old and didnt get a bassinet. flight attendants said the baby looked too big and the bassinet wouldnt hold him. had to hold my baby for 15 hrs. no water was given either when i had to give baby formula. dxbmaa was much better as they were able to provide a bassinet which unsurprisingly handled the baby just fine. ek 372 on 27th feb 2014. we have flown regularly with emirates for many years and have been very happy. the way the airline dealt with us following the alleged baggage system crash on 27th feb was appalling. despite the fact that aircrew know that most passengers baggage had not been loaded no information was provided during the flight or at the airport. instead we were left forlornly waiting at the carousel. by the time people twigged what was happening the two ground staff at the information desk were besieged. they were totally unprepared and chaos ensued. essentially people were abandoned to their own devices with no attempt to communicate or put contingency arrangements in place. this was a repeat of our experience last year which we attributed to a one off aberration. frankly you can have all the comfort and good food you like but if your customers walk away feeling angry and frustrated you will not get repeat business. things do go wrong occasionally and most people are pretty reasonable if they know what is happening. 22nd feb 2014 arrived in london gatwick at 11am for our 1.30pm flight to dubai to be told that the flight was delayed by 6 hours and would not take off until 7pm. staff at gatwick and on the flight were unable to give us any information about our connecting flights to india. landed in dubai at 6am on 23rd feb and although all passengers on the flight had missed their connections there were no ground staff waiting to direct us. asked to go to the transit desk found more than 500 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. only 2 emirates staff were available. we stood for 4.5 hours with no refreshments. communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. at 10.30 am staff started directing passengers to different gates depending on their destination. we sat until 5.30 pm with no information as to which flight we were likely to catch. although they handed out food vouchers at 2.30pm they ran out so not everyone got vouchers. at 5.30pm we were finally given boarding cards for the 9.45 pm connecting flight to trivandrum. although we waited 16 hours in the airport emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. finally arrived at our destination at 3.45 am on 24th feb. we appreciate that delays due to bad weather are unavoidable. however emirates had 24 hours notice after the fog on saturday morning and did nothing to prepare for the chaos on sunday. communication was extremely poor. we were stranded in dubai for over 24 hours. i mean myself and about 60 other passengers because our connecting flight also an emirates flight left without us. none of us received accommodation no lounge not even a place to take a proper shower or refresh. we didnt receive boarding passes for the next flight for 17 hours or so they kept telling us to come back in 2 hours. this went on all day i couldnt even leave the airport if i wanted to emirates had no sense of organization and zero sympathy for passengers. ek 409 on 16 march. left on a 3.20am flight that i would not really recommend given the time. travelling business i at least thought the staff would promptly go around the cabin and get any services out the way asap. i wanted a nightcap to help me sleep and it took an amazing 1.5 hours before i got it. i have travelled emirates before and they have been good but a little more attention to customers paying for service regardless of time would not go astray. the one saving grace was inflight entertainment. ek002 march 16th lhrdxb. the staff are extremely casual and nonprofessional. they lack the basic courtesy on how to serve premium passengers. as we entered the business class cabin enroute from londondubai two of the flight attendants were chatting away near our seat about social media and twitter etc they didnt seem to notice at all that passengers had already boarded. though the staff were not rude they were extremely casual in service. sydbkkdxb then to lhr. sydbkk leg was late by about an hour. this was ek 419 on 732014. lay flat bed was hard and not actually lie flat. food was less than average and certainly of a lesser quality than economy flight outbound. wine served warm no offer of pudding or cheese after main course. very little soft drinks offered and the cabin crew were less than helpful. bkkdxb breakfast served cold asked for the deli platter but told it was not available. flight service mediocre  no soft drinks offered. seat uncomfortable and not lie flat. new cabin crew no better than on sydbkk leg. dxblhr. as flight was late into dxb was held at arrival gate and then asked to run to next gate  no chance new a380 to lhr and such a difference to the 777 on the other legs. great service good food far better seat good food and great cabin crew. next trip i will go back to cathay business class which is far better even on a 777. mandxbsgn  left man 1 hour late. the etihad flight was due to depart at the same time started boarding much earlier and left early emirates always start boarding too late. poor service onboard with very limited drinks offered fortunately i had bottled water with me. boarded plane at dxb in plenty of time but departed 1 hour late informed by pilot this was because of the delay in getting peoples baggage through the airport and onto the plane as basically the airport could not cope with the amount of passengersflights. arrived in sgn but only one bag did the other never made the flight along with 20 other passengers bags took 2 days to get the other bag. bkk  hong kong on a380 in business class. the bkk ek lounge is being refurbished and i was asked to use qantas lounge. the emirates rep in that lounge was superbly helpful and pleasant. onboard my seat area was clean and everything worked. i did not find the seat too comfortable and used the mattress. after take off the onboard bar opened. the bar person could not speak english well was disorganized and had no idea how to mix drinks. there was a nice selection of tasty sandwiches wraps etc. i asked for the warm food printed on the bar menu and was told we will put it out if we have time. after challenging this they reluctantly heated some for me. i was then told to go back to my seat as lunch will be served. i sat with a table cloth in front of me for a further 20 mins and then a tray of food arrived. the steak in balsamic vinegar and creamy potato was good and tasty. there was a crew member walking up and down serving wines which was positive too. the toilets were not well stocked with tooth brushes etc but were clean. i found the crew awful  with fake smiles patronizing and they ran around like disorganized headless chickens tripping over each other and created a very anxious atmosphere in the cabin. they treated the passengers with contempt and i felt that i was an inconvenience to them. we travelled on the a380 from lhr to dubai. upon entering the plane first impressions was wonderful the inflight entertainment was great. though that is the only good thing about this airline the cabin crew is the worst. the crew are awful they dont care about service at all we waited over 3 hours after we pressed the call button for a stewardess to come. the food is awful nothing but a horrible chicken curry on the menu on both legs of the journey. the final meal served will probably be a biscuit and a cup of tea. i had high hopes for this airline but they are really awful dubai is a wonderful place to visit but dont fly with this airline. my wife and i recently flew jfkdxbbkk and i returned bkkdxbjfk. my wife will return next week. going out we had a pretty good trip to dubai although the plane left late. waited in transit in dubai but were delayed again. onboard told the problem had been fixed and we would depart shortly. when we got to bkk we waited for our luggage 3 pieces only to be told it was still in dubai. we found out 300 passengers from jfk had the same problem. on my way back checkin at bkk was a nightmare due to the fact that over 500 people were checking in. the airbus a380800s are just too big to handle the necessary ground operations to support them. flight was ok to dxb nothing special. in transit at dxb i checked on which gate i was to board at and went to wait. after an interminable wait and seeing nothing i checked the board only to find out that they had changed departure gates but posted no signs or made no announcements about this. i made a mad dash to the new gate and just made it before they closed it. i was in a threeseat row with a window seat and one other passenger in the aisle seat. behind me was a family with 2 little kids. from the minute i sat down until the time i got off the plane the kids yelled and cried. there was no problem resolution from the stewardess although there were a number of options that she could have implemented. ground operations are terrible and their flight crew appear to know nothing about problem resolution. 19 feb 2014 ek405 melsin. 23 feb 2014 ek404 sinmel. fly frequently but this was the first experience with emirates. the plane itself was great with good food and entertainment especially with the big screen. ground crew service at singapore airport was a nightmare. system problem with seat allocation which our prebooked seats were being occupied. staff were being rude to customers at check in counters. customers do not come back with this kind of service level. ek0349 8032014. colombo to dubai. i found the service terrible. it was 2 hours into the flight before we were served anything not even a drink of water was brought. i even rang for someone to come and it was ignored. would not use emirates on this sector again. manchester to perth business class. experience from manchester to dubai was very disappointing. boarding was chaotic and very disorganised the service from the young male attendants very poor. they had run out of my food choice and the business section was almost empty. the food i was given the seafood stew was inedible. the tv did not work a lady did move me but that was just an hour before we landed. all in all a bad experience. considering the cost of the flight i have travelled with emirates in economy and the service was better. flight from dubai to perth was better the attendants were excellent  what a difference that made. we flew from heathrow to dubai on an airbus 380 early in december 2013 on this trip they ran out of food choices and i was told that i could not get the chicken that i had asked for. the flight crew were harassed and totally disorganized. when we few back in march 2014 exactly the same thing happened  sorry we have run out of the choice you asked for on the menu. also my headphones were not working after having had the light on for about two hours i eventually got up and went to the crew to ask for another one. emirates prides itself on good service and this was not the case on the airbus. we flew from dubai to johannesburg and back on a 777 and i cannot fault the service on these planes. april 9 2014. this is my second trip from dubai to toronto both trips had the same problems delay at dubai airport. rude staff. food was bad. it was not worth the money. its a direct flight but too many headaches involved. unfortunately unpleasant experience. we flew from dubai dxb to moscow dme on april 6th economy class while our flight had been scheduled on april 5th. airline changed aircraft airbus380 to boing777 3 hours before departure without any notification. airport checkin machine was returning error during our attempts no information at checkin desks. not all passengers could get their seats because of b777 smaller capacity. however airline provided hotel meal and extra roundtrip ticket. flight was ontime. flight was not very good they ran out of food choices and food quality was awful. overall service become worse. the measure of an airline is how they behave when things are not going right. my experience of this airline is that they tell lies and are a disorganized rabble. they were 2 hours late out of sydney which they blamed on the late arrival of the plane however as the flight was leaving at 6.00 am and there is a curfew in sydney this was not true. we were told on check in that they would make up time in the air which they did not. we were told they would make the connecting flights wait in dubai which they did not. the ground staff at dubai were unprepared and uninformed as to what was planned for us. i will not use this airline again. ive flown emirates on a regular basis for 8 years and up to 2 years ago i had no real problems and planes were never delayed more than 5 or 10 mins. however in the last 2 years i have increasingly experienced delays which coupled with the ludicrous different terminal and concourse situation at dubai has led to problems in transfers at dxb. my last two trips lgwdxbbkk involved 4 sector flights each and in those trips only one flight was on time. last night i flew dxb to lgw on a a380 500 passengers arriving at the boarding gate 45 mins before departure i saw that boarding had started and majority of economy passengers had boarded. i was told there was a delay so better to wait in the business lounge. only one announcement was made. no further announcements or information given. 70 mins later a large indian tour party 40 persons arrived at the gate and immediately a final call for boarding was issued and the flight took off. clearly the flight of 500 persons was delayed to satisfy the tour party. talking to fellow passengers at dxb on the plane and at lgw it seems the reliability is slipping. the service on board is hit and miss and in fact last nights service dxblgw and the lgw ground support was the worst i have experienced. im a regular traveller albeit mainly short haul. when visiting friends i wanted to experience a flight on an airbus 380 in business. big disappointment but waited to form an opinion until after the return flight. in my view there are just too many business class passengers to cabin crew and it is just not possible to get the level of service you expect from a business class flight. significantly inferior to other aircraft configurations. food quality was poor and you are left without being asked if you would like a glass of wine to go with your meal. by the time they arrive the meal is finished. i would recommend you avoid this if you want a high level experience. i usually try to fly via doha with qatar when going in this direction and will return to that route of travel in future. flew from lax to dubai on 32514 and back on 41514. the service level was poor the food was lousy and the bathrooms were dirty and out of stock there were trash on the cabin floor and none of the attendants bothered to pick it up the food trays stayed in front of passengers for at least 40 minutes before they were picked up. the internet connection was very poor and i kept being disconnected every few seconds when passengers myself included used the button to call an attendant no one paid any attention mine was on for 30 minutes before an attendant turned it off while he was passing by and didnt even bother to ask me why i turned it on ek231 april 14 2014. overall experience unsatisfactory rude flight attendants. my first time flying economy class with emirates and i will never use them again. flight attendants were rude when serving meals. my wife was asked what kind of food she would like and she said chicken. in a rude tone the flight attendant said they were out of chicken and only had vegetarian while throwing the meal to my wife. when serving the second meals breakfast the same thing happened. finally she came back with the food of our choice. i flew khidxbjnb and return same route. this time i flew london gatwickdxbisb. the aircrafts were new and tidy. but the toilet had a broken handwash and it was not that clean. i was not provided with headphones and had to ask for them. staff were not attentive and seemed in a rush. secondly i asked for water the cabin crew came after such a very long time. the food was good but the service was not enough good. bhxdxbkul. probably the worst long haul flights i have had. emirates seems to have deteriorated considerably since my last trip in 2010. outbound flight was spoilt by passengers who wandering about the cabin visiting friendsrelatives at all hours of the night and were not controlled by the cabin crew even when seat belt signs were lit. although things were better on the return legs staff seemed generally disinterested and demoralised. food service was very slow over an hour to serve breakfast. drinks were served after the meal rather than before. altogether a very disappointing experience. 24 jan 2014 ek412 dubai  sydney. i am well travelled and have experienced many airlines but this was the worst in terms of staff inexperience and rudeness. the service was appalling with a young rude and inexperienced cabin crew. i had to ask to have my food tray removed on two occasions. i had to ask for coffee and when it arrived without apology it was cold. there was no help with overhead storage. they need to take notice of customer complaints. on a recent flight on 22 april from warsaw to guangzhou via dubai ek180 i was upgraded to business class. finally i get to sample the much advertised emirates business class. the business class was full and so was the entire flight i assume. the welcome was the usual that you get with the welcome drink but none of the staff offered to take my jacket. after take off the bar service started quite late. there was a wait of approximately 40 minutes. the second round of drinks took ages. i had ordered a second whisky which the staff conveniently forgot. i had to remind to which i was given a curt unapologetic its being made that too by the chief purser a lady in her 50s. during the meal which was nice the wine came only once. i had to remind the stewardess to fillup my long empty glass. the staff was not wellinformed about the plane either. i asked one if it was the new 777 to which she replied that she did not know. she never bothered to findout and inform either. i can say one thing about emirates. the hardware is there but the software still needs to be updated. staff training on customer satisfaction has to be intensified. i would not recommend anyone to buy the business class unless its only for the additional comfort. service is definitely lacking. wonder what the first class is like. taking into account my experience in the business class i am certain the pampering is nonexistent. frankly i prefer lufthansa. the service in all classes is very good and that keeps you aching for more. flew from zurich to tokyo via dubai. the flight was efficiently handled. b777 on the way out was fine though the seating was not better than normal. a380 from dxb to zrh had noticeably more seat space and was remarkably quiet. meals were exceptionally good but service was patchy. not everyone got coffee maybe the team needs to bring in some fb to improve there. this airline was not at all child friendly and we had many problems. the transit in dubai involved a bus trip over 30 minutes long standing in a hot stuffy bus. some of our kids were given activity packs on the aircraft and some were not. the allergy meals although not containing the specified allergen contained many other common allergens such as eggs fish and seafood. the meat for these meals was always fish. we did not receive the diabetic meal we ordered on every flight. staff on the a380s are immature and more concerned with enjoying the trip themselves and their own comfort. no drinks were offered between meals on the return a380 flight. the crew spent their time gossiping in the service areas. our flight on the return trip was changed and we werent notified until we tried to check in. these are just some of the highlights but overall the experience was very stressful. london gatwick  dubai ek016 152014. dubai  kuala lumpur ek346 252014. i have been using emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. i have flown primarily between the uk and far east transiting via dubai. fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. i was upgraded to business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldnt rate it as being much better than economy class. i flew with them in janfeb 2014 and again on this current trip may 2014. i would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. boarding the plane was organised and orderly in london gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in dubai. on both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. the stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of qantas and emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. they appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as mas staff and from my observations a certain level of rudenessfrustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. one of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. i quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. asking a stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. the choice of food doesnt seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. travelling in economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. i stopped using malaysia airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. when i started using emirates i began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. i probably will continue to use emirates but would consider other options such as mas qatar etihad and turkish airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. i certainly would have misgivings about recommending emirates to friends at present. emirates had become my airline of choice because of the great seats and entertainment system on their new a380s. until my most recent flights i also found their service and food to be among the best. however on my recent flights from hkg to dxb and dxb to dublin i found both the food and service to be awful. their switch to serving food in j class on open plates is a disaster. the food ends up lukewarm and dry. i much preferred the sealed container. the food was bland and tasteless. the cabin attendants on both sectors were pretty indifferent. on the second sector service was particularly clueless with wrong orders and lack of apology. i might just look for other options next time i fly. one thing also to bear in mind if you can avoid it  the hkgdxb route flies over bay of bengal. turbulence here as on my flight can be fairly rough during monsoon season. also for some reason we had to be bussed to the gate when we reached dxb. the ground journey took 20 minutes. the place where we were dropped off happened to be the confluence between t1 and t3 and as a result a lot of transit passengers headed off in the wrong direction. a frustrating mistake to make at midnight when you are already tired. ek 413 aklsyd 13 april business class. disappointing service and poor hospitality. emirates appear to have lost their former sparkle. problems started at the emirates lounge in akl where numerous qantas passengers were denied entry due to different rules applying to status levels and guests. emirates staff looked particularly anguished dealing with the number of complaints they had on this occasion. the lounge was full to capacity and it was difficult to find a seat with flights going via brisbane sydney and melbourne all around the same time. however the food in the lounge is exceptionally good compared to competitor offerings at the moment. onboard the business class standard on the a380 was poor in hospitality comparison to current competitors. young inexperienced staff surprisingly lacking basic etiquette and manners. staff looked tired and despondent. during the flight i was either served twice or not at all. despite the new a380 i was surrounded with broken and depreciated equipment. meal service very average. the staff just seemed to want to rush and close down the service as quickly as possible. the pricing is definitely competitive and if hospitality isnt important and you just want to nod off this could still be a good way to travel. for me the quality is just not good enough in hospitality for business class. its not just about the ife and the swish seating capsule. the outbound flight with air new zealand may have lacked the latest technology and wizardry in cabin design but made up for it in spades in terms of hospitality professionalism and overall comfort. have used emirates a couple of times over the last few years and couldnt fault them previously. will avoid them for a while. clearly lost something as i didnt feel looked after on this occasion. lhrdxblhr with emirates both ways on a380. aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the a380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. unfortunately as ive always found with emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. sadly this comes with a built in chip on the shoulder which ive seen on every emirates flight more than thirty which ive taken over the past decade or so. slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. on the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. food nice and plenty of it. a request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a french stewardess i have more than 500 passenger today so i get it when i can. i replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. needless to say my wine was forgotten and i helped myself from the galley instead. another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. on the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. not impressive. sad really because the aircraft and the product is very good. just delivered very poorly. my airline of choice is ba. we travelled from heathrowdubaicape town. the aircraft was a 777 all sectors this airline has to be the most uncomfortable and over rated. the seats were crammed in 3x4x3 so narrow and with narrow aisles to. the whole experience was exhausting. the staff were indifferent and you could tell they couldnt wait to get off and avoid the suffering stares from the trussed up passengers. i would suggest think long and hard before booking if the aircraft is a 777. i understand most airlines had 3x3x3 set up which is civilised. food was ok tv ok and all on time. transfer at dubai ok nothing special though. ek751 dubai to casablanca on may 8th 2014. using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent dubai to casablanca flight i was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what i had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like etihad or qatar airways. not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective. and when all this was reported to customer service there was a very passive response to the feedback. this airline was once a star but it is definitely falling from grace. flight ek 421 perth to dubai 6th may 2014. i have flown the glasgow to perth via dubai route several times however this was by far the worst experience economy was full and as anyone that has flown on the emirates 700300 will know due to the 3x4x3 seat configuration how cramped this can be. for long periods of time sometimes up to an hour despite there not being turbulence the seat belt sign was kept on so people couldnt go to the bathroom despite cabin crew walking around freely resulting in long queues when the sign was turned off. it made for an uncomfortable 10.5 hour flight. connecting flight to glasgow was okay. londondubaidhaka and dhakadubailondon  business class. average service apart from the dubai to london leg on our way back this was terrible the cabin crew member who looked after us clearly didnt want to be on the flight she seemed uninterested and tired from the start of the flight. food wasnt business class standard at all. the sandwich was extremely oily which i didnt like and sent back the replacement  biriyani main course was dry followed by sad looking dry sandwiches for afternoon tea and there was no brownie after the sandwiches as the menu stated. hamdxb checkin staff at ham extremely rude. i had a long discuss about the weight of my handbag. ek allows strictly only 7 kg. handbag incl. cameras laptop reading materials umbrella. as per iata rule those carryon personal items can be carried free of charges into the cabin without weighing and counting to the handbag but not by ek. hamdxb on ek 62 b777 late evening flight took off at 21.25 hrs. very cramped seats and very slow service i got my dinner served at 23.30 hrs 2 hours after takeoff. after 5 hours transit at dxb airport for onward flight to bkk with ek 372 a380. after boarding we were informed about the 2 hours delay but we were not allowed to get off the aircraft so had to sit in the full a380 fortunately seats are more comfortable than b777 with no drink or meal service. during the delay crews were hidden and enjoyed talking with themselves in the galleys. after taking off with a 2 hours delay crews still needed another 2.5 hours before starting to serve meals to hungry passengers. quality and quantity of food was poor. only 1 drink was served 1 hour later. after 2 hours trays were collected with the offering of tea or coffee. poor cleanliness during the flight toilets were not cleaned or controlled. i notified the crew that one toilet had run out of tissue but nothing happened. aucklanddubailhr economy connecting flight ek 1 to lhr delayed at dubai for over 1hr but no explanation given by ground staff in fact appeared unprofessional not until on the aircraft did you get an adequate response from the captain who gave a full explanation. by coincidence my leg from heathrow to dubai was also delayed exactly 2 weeks earlier so wonder if they have a scheduling problem. the a380 is a huge aircraft and with its size comes big logistics the cabin crew were not particularly attentive and water for such a long flight was offered very infrequently and the service was not anywhere near the service i had been given by asiana airlines to auckland a year earlier. flight from perth australia to dubai did not meet expectations. despite the airlines supposed reputation the food quality and choice was very poor. the touchscreen was insensitive and caused considerable frustration when trying to select particular films or music. most notable the staff were surly and generally unhelpful. this was one of the worst flights i have ever endured  dubai  male 22nd february 2014 flight ek0652. on the morning of 22nd february we boarded the flight in dubai at the correct time despite their being some fog in which cleared by approximately 10.30am. we were held on the plane for over 7.5 hours and then had our flight cancelled and were disembarked. told that once we left the plane an emirates attendant would be waiting to show us where to go. after we left the plane we went through the airport doors to be offered two options arrivals or transfers and noone had any idea where to go and no help was available. we saw a few emirates staff around and when we went to them asking for assistance they just shrugged their shoulders and said we had to queue up at the desk. we queued for 2 hours and when we finally got to the front we were told that no information was available and that we had to come back in 20 minutes we asked about hotel accommodation and was told that all hotels were booked. the lack of communication was terrible no announcements made no apologies. finally after an exhaustive night and at about 4am sunday we were told that everyone would not be able to fly until monday. this debacle carried on until about 5.30am when we were told that we were going to fly after all at 11am sunday. the journey took approximately 42 hours which should have been a four hour flight. the absolute worst part was having absolutely no information forthcoming  it was an absolute disgrace. bkkdxbham. bkkdxb morning flight ek375  long checkin queue but checkin staff at bangkok were friendly. delayed 30 mins due to waiting for all passengers to finish boarding. a380 full but still roomy in y great aircraft no highlight  same experience as inbound flight in may  very slow service. as the lunch tray arrived to my row it was cold  quality and quantity under 4 stars airline standard. dxbham on ek 61 b777300er flight full no more to say about the feeling of 343 seating. on this flight the crew was very rude inexperienced and the poorest inflightservice i have received on ek  very chaotic no system. crews forgot which seat rows they have already served drinks to and which rows they had not. after meals passengers sitting in seats a to e were served drinks tea or coffee twice while the left hand side passengers f to k did not get any. hours later crews noted this mistake during the collecting of meal trays as the coffee cups were unused and it was too late to serve as we were on landing process and no apology came. flew to los angeles in april. food on the 04.30 am flight from bangalore to dubai was terrible as usual. the flights on the double decker a380 aircraft from dubai to lax and back was very comfortable. the massive queues to board the aircraft long queues at checkin and the scramble for the baggage at lax airport will deter me from choosing this aircraft in future. it took me 2 hours to get my baggage at lax airport and with 500 pax searching for their suitcases it was a total mess food portions on the flight were very small and food was disappointing. for a 16 hour flight the in between meal snacks were just fruits and chocolates which vanished soon and were never refilled. the crew were unfriendly. ask for a drink and it never comes until you remind them thrice. very disappointed. the food on the dubaibangalore sector was excellent. i have had 2 return journeys with emirates to the seychelles via dubai from heathrow within the last 3 months ek002 & 3 and from dubai to seychelles and back and i have to say i was really shocked at how underperforming the cabin crew were. on those separate four journeys i found the cabin crew miserable sarcastic rude and looking like they really would like to be anywhere other than where they were. in a nutshell i have left the planes on each occasion really rather appalled at the lack of customer service and i have no wish to fly again with them anytime soon. on one of the flights food was almost thrown at us and scrambling to find anything to give to us as we were last rows of seats on my most recent flight back from dubai the stewardess just before landing said i will be back she was collecting blankets and headsets and checking seats were upright etc but we never saw her again. air seychelles i have been told dont fair any better but on my next trip i shall be trying them out flying from paris direct to the seychelles which they start from july and see how they do compare because i really dont want to fly emirates again we have traveled 8 international legs with emirates in the past 16 months so we have had a good opportunity to check out this airline. it is our experience that they are so focused on their business and first class customers that they do not care about economy despite the huge number of passengers that they cram into economy seating. food takes so long to be served to economy customer that if you are seated towards the back it is cold once it eventually arrives. it is also our experience that you can expect to have you dinner tray on your tray table for at least on hour after you have finished. service other than for meals is almost non existent and economy is severely understaffed. legs out of dubai to sydney are particularly bad and the check in processes in dubai simply terrible  long queues and slow processing. inflight movies limited. every time we have flown from dubai to sydney there has been a huge hassle with our seating despite having booked our seats months in advance. one time my husband and i were not seated together despite having been allocated seating together  they gave our seats to a sporting group. it is our opinion that this airline does not care about economy class customers. we have flown with many other airlines so have a good idea of the basic standard that one would expect in economy and in our opinion emirates does not meet event the most basic standard. flight from newcastle to brisbane via dubai and singapore. we booked in august with emirates staff promising seats that would be allocated for me being disabled i have severe walking problems that require me to be able to stand up and stretch my legs. what i got were seats in row 37 seats d and e just getting to the seats was extremely hard as i need to use a crutch to walk with the aisles are too narrow to move to the seats while using a crutch. i will never fly with them again. maddxbbkk business class frequent flyer gold card holder traveling approximately bimonthly for over two years. ive noticed a marked deterioration in quality on this service and my last two flights have had problems which need bringing to the attention of a wider audience. i note from comments on this site that others have noted a similar deterioration in service on emirates. on the first flight i was double charged by the airline. when i pointed this out to the service center i was initially told i was incorrect. after a second email and a delay i was informed by another individual i had to prove that i had been overcharged. when i did this i was then told by a third employee to enter certain information via the web to obtain a refund. i tried several times but the information was clearly wrong. after a further delay a fourth employee suggested i was entering the data incorrectly. i tried again same result. i then asked the matter to be escalated. no reply. eventually after further emails a fifth employee agreed that the matter should be escalated. over a month later i received an incomplete refund and a lame excuse for an apology. on my last flight ek385 the service was awful. my breakfast was initially not delivered. after trying to attract the attention of staff my meal some 45 minutes late was slammed down it was as might be expected after being allowed to stew for that amount of time inedible. after asking for the purser a senior eventually arrived who tried various displacement techniques to avoid apologising. i eventually forced an apology and was asked if i wanted something unspecified to replace the disgusting plate. by this time the plane was descending. i asked again to see the purser who eventually turned up and mumbled on about the girl who was responsible. she disappeared to make the safety announcement prior to landing and i never saw her again. i have received no recompense. i would suggest that if you experience problems on emirates dont expect prompt service genuine apologies or any recompense. you will have to deal with an obstructive service center staffed by arrogant and essentially incompetent individuals and an on board crew who regard themselves as a superior class of persons who unless you are prepared to ingratiate yourself find providing a service beneath them. as there is ample choice of airlines on this route i certainly wont fly emirates again and would advise caution if anyone is considering it as the alternatives which i have recently sampled are infinitely superior. we arrived in london gatwick for our 13.35 flight to dubai to be told that the flight was delayed 6 hours and would not take off until 19.00 so we asked to movechange our connecting flight from dubai knowing that we would have missed it for sure but were told multiple times that it could not be done in the uk but it would have been done quickly in dubai airport transfer desk. when we arrived in dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. only 2 emirates staff were available. we stood queuing for about 67 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. at around 1212.30 so after nearly 67 hours standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 further 11 hours wait we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside dubai airport and although we waited so long emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. the food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunchdinner we were told that they were all finish so we had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers. definitely would not recommend also airline refuses to compensate blaming natural causes when they had more than a day to prepare for all the delayed planes to arrive and the fog was only the day before for 23 hours. vastly overrated. the staff may be good at delivering food but have very little idea of what service means. i did 5 sectors in first and met one purser and one person who claimed to be in charge of the first class cabin. on two sectors i was addressed by my name on three i was just another person. staff seem to not want to engage with passengers or communicate with them except to take food orders. on two sectors i had to go and search for cabin staff  none seemed to be around when found they were all talking in the galley and appeared upset that i had interrupted them. as best i can determine there is only one first class lounge and that is in dubai all the others are business class shared with first. on the plus side the suites are great and the beds excellent. flew 2 weeks ago from ho chi minh city sgn  dxb  transit  lhr london and back. my first time flying with emirates. i was served with a hot towel and was able to watch my a film during take off. after flying for 5 hours i needed my bag with me. unfortunately it was in the locker which was too high for me to reach so when i saw a flight attendant pass by i asked her if she could help. she helped me open the locker eventually but her attitude left me disappointed on my way back from dxb to sgn i was lucky to have a lovely flight crew. in general the on board entertainment was very impressive. even though the hot meals were served quickly they didnt taste good the food was incredibly salty and i couldnt finish it. the desserts on the other hand were the best amongst airlines. sydaklsyd and sydaklsyd my work booked these flights. to say the staff are rude is an understatement. onboard staff were only interested in quickly serving the meals and you didnt even have time to finish eating off your tray before they whipped them away. any rubbish left over they werent interested in picking up with their precious little fingers. i buzzed for duty free for an hour and asked 3 people if i could buy some and kept getting told ill tell the girl ill tell the girl or she should be coming through only to find that she couldnt be bothered. ground staff at both airports were rude and i was looked down on it felt for a being a qantas business customer. rude arrogant staff. a recent trip to europe with qantasemirates involved three legs with emirates and one dubai to sydney with qantas. two of the emirates legs were ok but the leg from barcelona to dubai was not up to any realistic standard for economy let alone business class. the food was barely edible my wifes was inedible and the service was appalling. no tea or coffee offered after the meal and resentment shown when my wife asked for some. they basically left us alone except for serving the meal. three previous flights with emirates have been much better. other aspects of the flight on time check in etc were fine and the dubai terminal is excellent. the qantas link with emirates also works well if flying into europe without having to go through london. saves a lot of time. flew from dubai to delhi on 26th june 2014 and back to dubai on 6th july2014. the aircraft was a boeing 777300 in both the cases. the aircraft was neat and clean but was a bit cramped. the staff isnt that courteous though. the ife system seemed very old. overall it was a good experience. ek0025 dxbgla on 251113 ek0048 fradxb on 4214 and ek434 dxbbne on 5214. poor service. food is terrible. ads before watching anything on inflight entertainment are annoying and seem unnecessary. treatment of economy passengers is one of disdain as though you are an inconvenience. i did the long haul from gatwickdubaibangkoksydney in economy for all but one leg when i was in business class. i tried to upgrade the other sections five times over three weeks and was given the run around each time including at the airport three hours before departure. turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. the crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque. seat comfort was what you could expect  but narrow seats made sleeping very hard. luckily my fellow travellers were sanguine about the heat stuffiness and general mayhem. not an experience i want to repeat especially after they lost our bags. return biz class ticket purchased with ek from muscat to beijing. on arrival at dxb airport following the flight from beijing with a 3 hour wait  barred from using the ek business lounges in dubai and told that as it is a code share on the last sector ek ticket i would not be able to use the emirates facilities at dubai airport but must instead use oman air staff on the business lounge desk most unhelpful. following a very long walk through dxb airport to terminal 1 no oman air lounge was found so option was gulf air  who unlike emirates airline ground staff were extremely helpful and friendly note for the future  avoid flying emirates business class if possible ek161 dxb to dub on 16 july and ek384 dxb to bkk on 17 june. we still look forward to a decent experience on emirates that i have read about here on airlinequality.com. interestingly people i have recently spoken to have also shared negative experiences on emirates  i guess we have just been unlucky. inconsistency is clearly a problem. some of our sectors were on qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on qantas and they were also more family friendly than emirates. ultimately we dont have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water. i travel on a variety of airlines for work and the emirates service was similar to that of a very bad us airline. anyway we arrived intact with all luggage accounted for so not all bad. would avoid if possible in the future. the worst economy flight i have had. the seat was good but the legroom wasnt. the ife was very nice lots of german movies. staff were awful. the flight fradxb flight was 35 minutes delayed. after take off flight attendants went off for about 30 minutes on our other flights dxbsgn 3 hours delayed sgndxb 1 hour delay. staff were very slow. they walked 3 times trough the cabin but they didnt see the reclined seat the open seat belt and the fold down table. my bag was on the seat and not in the overhead compartment. the food was good but i will never fly again with emirates. ek6 london to dubai on 2425th july and ek 412 dubai to sydney on 25th july. having experienced other airlines in the past we found emirates to be the worst. the flight attendants were rude i lost count how many times they rush past down the aisle and knocked my elbow while i was trying to sleep there was no apology. food took forever to be served and by the time they got to you there was no choice as it was whatever was left. drinks you would think they were paying for them you had to ask for them and when you did it was like you asked them for gold or something. we had to remain on the plane in dubai for 3 hours before take off to sydney it was very hot and stuffy after 2 hours of waiting the flight attendants finally decided to give us some water or juice as everyone was asking for water even then they begrudgingly gave us drinks. coffee and tea was served half an hour after you had finish your meals and even then it was lukewarm and you only received half a cup. trays were left in front of you for about an hour and people that had special meals were fed first therefore if they were sitting in front of you and they had finished eating they would put their seat back and you had to manage your tray under your chin until they were collected. my experience with emirates is definitely memorable but for the negative reasons and i would definitely not recommend them to anyone. 19th august gladxb dxbmru. poor experience at silver skywards check in glum emirates staff when asked about upgrading paid to business class told speak to someone at the lounge. upstairs at lounge was told there are 4 spare seats but you booked with a company so its difficult to upgrade you. after 10 seconds of silence i put my credit card away. upon boarding i was told no seats in business class despite what lounge said. flight great fas a mix of good and poor food and drink good ife good. dxb the usual chaos refused entry to emirates lounge as its not family oriented. a380 boarding chaotic request to pay to upgrade again met with its too complicated to do fas a mix of rude disinterested and superb flight good food and drink good ife good. flight on time. emirates a strange mix clearly not interested in anything below gold  platinum skywards in terms of service. traveled sindxbbcn and mxpdxbsin on economy. on the flight outbound nothing special besides the connection in dubai the filthy and overcrowded toilets in dxb which is still not up to the standard of changi in singapore or hkia and the wifi that i could never get going and i wasnt the only one. on the flight dxbbcn on the 380 they ran out of cold beers and had to serve warm beers declined the suggestion and opted for red wine which was also warm so i just asked for a glass of water hoping this one would be fresh. there seemed to be friction between the fas as i was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didnt look very professional. on the way back from mxp we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded. managed to get to my gate after a long walk and boarded the flight. nothing special the meal trays seem a lot skinnier than you get on singapore airlines or qatar. fas doing their job and thats it nothing like thai singapore or cathay they are young but not very service oriented. and last but not least they lost my bag. i am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but dont expect a whole new dimension it is just an ok airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated selfattributed reputation with below average delivery. business class doesnt look anything special narrow seats on the 777 and if youre on the middle section you will be seated 3 abreast. bangkokhong kongbangkok. i take this round trip fairly regularly. i love the a380 especially the onboard bar where i spend most of my time i think the emirates lounges on the ground are the best. however the flight on 20th august hong kong to bangkok just did not gel. the business cabin was only a third full and there seemed to be more flight attendants than passengers. a decent time after seat belt sign was switched off we strolled back to the bar and had a pleasant drink and snack. we were then told and not too nicely that if we wanted to eat we would have too return to our seats. fair enough but i wish i had forgone the dinner presented and stayed with the snacks. my prawns with noodles was atrocious. the noodles were a dry tangled coagulated mass and impossible too eat. my companions chicken was similarly inedible. are these business class dinners cooked and prepared in dubai 24 hours before they certainly seemed to be. after dinner back to the bar where with one hour to go before landing we were told by the attendant that the bar would be closing in 10 minutes and it did. and no further service even to the seat with 20 minutes to go before even the captain announced the descent. weather perfect no turbulence. i just had the feeling the entire cabin staff were in a couldnt give a damn frame of mind. this was disgraceful. on no other emirates flight has this happened. i was very disappointed. adl to dxb. slow boarding and no separate lines for first and business. ice system had to be rebooted halfway through the flight. business class about 70 full and still the steak dish was unavailable. only had the choice of the other two spicy dishes. disappointing regarding meal availability for business out of adl. meal table in the business class seat not working correctly. slow drink service on take off business cabin crew seemed new and unsure. business class to geneva a few weeks prior was of a much higher standard. laxdxb on business class. cabin crew were extremely unfriendly. ive been a gold member on emirates for the last 3 years and recently im more and more disappointed with the quality of service and the value for money. flew adldxbbhx return on 777 all the way. seats felt smaller not sure if they are and the service was below average. i had to ask numerous times for a drink on the long let the seat belt signs were on for 8 hours so i could not help myself to water but they did not bring trays of waterjuice around regularly either. everything seemed to be too much trouble. on the return leg from bhxdxb the flight was not full and many women with children moved away from their sleeping husbands to sit next to other customers who were probably hoping to curl up on the extra seat. they allowed their children to claw the hair of passengers in front and change channels of those behind. they were not asked to return to their seats and one even changed a nappy on the seat and at no time was approached by cabin crew. the food was fairly awful and i was forgotten for over an hour when they ran out of my choice though i was happy to have anything. it wasnt cheap 2400 aud return but they are direct from adelaide. dxbjfk on the a380. boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. seats were comfortable but worn out. no footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. the choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. however this was the only exceptional part of the flight. flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. ive never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. ive had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the united states and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. it took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast so basically its a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. only good part was the cool mood lighting. overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but emirates customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly. i recently flew from singapore to melbourne on a boeing 777. on the plus side the fare was extremely cheap  79 for a round trip ticket. the food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable  especially the selection of movies. it was an overnight flight though so i didnt use the system much. the cabin mood lighting during sleep periods was also relaxing. on the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and i could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. admittedly i was travelling in economy class but i have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. unfortunately the emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and i was only able to doze fitfully. the other thing i was disappointed with was the service. emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events such as meals dfs etc. i used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. however they did not do so. the service was also not the friendliest  though that could probably be due partially to the timing of the flight when the flight crew are undoubtedly tired too. flew ek384 bkkhkg today my first emirates flight in 2 years. every time i fly this airline i swear i never will again  things have not improved. the planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. without doubt emirates is the rudest airline i have flown and they are not improving. instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say where are you from i think in the entire flight i heard one please or thank you. i really dont care if they dont enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they werent abrupt surly and clumsy. ive flown economy and business and in all instance staff attitude has been absolutely appalling. for completeness the flight was also an hour late although compared to the staff this was only a minor annoyance. august 1112 flight ek127 and ek335. the crew gets sloppier and sloppier weve flown mnldxbvie and the crew seemed to react more to a pax with two infants rather than one we didnt get anything for my infant and the other seat got something they didnt even ask how old my infant was. all in all i think the service was not as good as always. the crew from dxbvie was very slow and seemed so busy that you didnt want to request anything. flew from bhx to hong kong via dubai and bangkok in august 2014. now after 15 odd long haul flights on emirates over the last 4 years i can safely say they are not as good as they used to be. the tired old 777 from bhx to dxb was awful the entertainment didnt work the crew were grumpy and the food was tasteless. i must say the a380 from dxb to hong kong was a vast improvement apart from the crew. i appreciate some passengers can be tricky to control when they stand up during taxing and landing etc but other passengers should not be able to hear attendants be very rude about them to their colleagues. monday 25th august 2014 ek 776. dur to dxb have been skywards gold for many years always had good to excellent service on emirates. this flight however was one of the worst. food service has always been prompt after takeoff to allow pax to sleep and breakfast left to the last minute. 2 hours after takeoff and food was served many pax asking for main or asking for table cloth etc. to be removed. throughout the night there was constant noise from the galley banging of plates crew talking loudly leaving curtain open i closed it 3 times. breakfast served 2.5 hours before landing so total sleep time was about 3 hours normally i get 5 to 6 on this flight. friend in economy said no breakfast was served and every time he asked for a drink it never came. hope this is not a sign of things to come. i have travelled emirates a lot but the last 2 experiences were not as anticipated. we flew from gatwick to johannesburg via dubai on the 26th june 2014. staff on flight to dubai were good kids fed and good attention. flight to johannesburg was not so staff seemed occupied and unavailable. you had to keep asking for things like kids toys drinks etc which i do not really like doing. return flight to the uk via dubai on the 2nd of september was the worst of them all. staff are different now to when we flew a year ago on the same route. check in was a hassle in jnb and dubai. our 2 year old was not given a childs meal because it was not booked we had to keep asking for almost everything. both kids were not given the complimentary toys. the cabin crew seem to have no people skils at all  only one seemed to be on top of his game. previous staff 20112013 were always happy caring and service was impeccable. standards have changed and i will be trying other airlines after such an experience. emirates have to do something about their staff especially in terms of customer services and people skills. travelling with kids is not easy and emirates has been one of the airlines very good at easing this but this has changed. cabin crew should not look like they are just doing their jobs but happy to be of assistance. emirates have very clean and modern aircraft excellent entertainment and easy transfers to and from flights within dubai. unfortunately the cabin crew are not upholding the emirates values which crew displayed 10 yrs ago. i was shocked at the decline of customer care once showed by crew in economy. i flew from meldxb to italy return crew were rude never smiled avoided pax told pax to wait for the next service upon drink requests and did everything to make for an unpleasant flight. next time i will fly another carrier. crew should treat every pax as they would want their family members treated and remember they have chosen to be there my wife and i live in singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit familyfriends. emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. it is therefore with sadness that i have to complain about the inflight service received on flight ek37 on 10th july which was the beginning of a tour of the uk. we have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. however on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chitchat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an evergrowing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. during meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong ‘end. consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other ‘end. this has somewhat clouded our view of emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again. ek432 dubai to brisbane via singapore continuation after ek2  see separate post. economy b777300er. disembarking from ek2 all transfer pax clear a security check before entering the terminal eliminating the need for it at the gate. clear signage to the next gate. not impressed with t3b terminal. boarding was just turn up and go. no order. once onboard the difference between the a380 and b777 is quiet marked. seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. i had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by i was bumped. the person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. it was most uncomfortable not helped by the av units under the seat taking up space. the food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. a roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. no sausage bacon or baked beans. the last dinner i had was a bit bland a beef casserole. would have benefited from a wine reduction. the av on this craft was the old ice. far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. we had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in india. we were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 bne time. at no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in bne. i had to spend my time in singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. very poor form. this along with the incredibly uncomfortable seats on the 777 make it extremely unlikely i will fly with emirates again if this is the only option available. just flown emirates for the first time manchesterdubaisingaporemelbourne out melkldubaimanchester return. all in economy. 14th august to 14th september. i wont use them again. apart from one leg a more miserable unenthusiastic group of attendants i have yet to see. food on all of the sections was grim. ice entertainment on way back awful. on three sections delays and not one explanation even after the first and business clients complained after us poor souls in economy. i booked thinking i would get qantas service how disappointed was i. next time i fly from manchester i shall use etihad or qatar or even go to lhr again. very disappointed. i have flow with emirates 6 times now and there are some very good good and poor aspects to the overall experience. in particular i refer to our istanbul to dubai flight on 7 aug 2014. there was the normal long delay in checkin due in perceive after working 30 years in aviation large quantity of check in baggage that emirates passengers have  some would see as a plus  combined with minimal experience staff. but the carry on baggage was the big issue both in regard to safety and comfort some people were bringing 35kg on board. bags that just fitted into the lockers and a passenger opposite us had three of them. the onboard staff just helped them put more into the lockers without regard to the effect on others of the 100 passengers i could observe we were the only ones under the 7kg stated limit. when a senior crew from business class started stuffing our soft bags into a smaller space so they could get others large bags away and close the doors i was pointedly told what i could do with my concerns. he did not dispute that others had 35kg of carry on bags in addition we had 2 obese passengers next to us. the crew provided them with extension seat belts but this doesnt stop them squashing those adjacent. again the crew were unhelpful. i spent most of the flight walking around the aircraft. finally the food on this flight was well below the standard i have known on other emirates flights. london to dubai on 69 flight ek 012 and returned 129 flight ek 0009. i flew business class with emirates both on 777 and 380 airbus. the seats were narrow in the extreme even on the 380 and i found it very uncomfortable. the staff were going through the motions and the food was tepid. i have flown with many airlinesfirst time with emirates. if you compare them to qantas they have much to learn. not impressed at all and will avoid in future. ive flown emirates over a period of ten years and i can comprehensively say that every time i fly the service is getting worse. emirates pitch themselves as being a toptop airline and to a degree the service they offer on paper is quite comprehensive. their route network is very good and their fares at times can be competitive however the last four long haul flights ive taken with emirates progressively gets worse. the cabin staff seem disinterested in providing a first class service to the nonchalant ground staff in dubai. they are cutting back massively on quality theyve stopped handing out comfort packs for flights the food is getting worse and the cabin crew dont respond to calls made from your chair. i can give quite a few examples of bad service travelling with emirates over the last few trips however it was compounded by a poor experience travelling with an infant recently. ive always looked forward to flying with emirates and i have quite a few tier miles and skywards miles however i feel ive flown my last flight with emirates. travelled london to dubai. aircraft in excellent condition didnt feel the plane rattle during take off and the landing was perfect. arrived at destination on time picked up luggage and was out of the terminal 15 min later. great selection of onboard entertainment that i ended up watching 3 movies throughout flight. nothing extraordinary with food but as flight was not a long haul it was enough to get by. what i felt was the deal breaker was the rudeness of fas who didnt give a toss about customer service. a request for water didnt come until a quarter of an hour and only after another reminder met by a glare. when it did the fa another one poured too much and spilt some on me but she was in a rush to push her trolley to even say a word of apology. the fas in my cabin section were hardly smiling and didnt make efforts to put their passengers at ease. why were they so grumpy and ill mannered first time business class with ek. viedxbhkg.dxbvie. disappointing service by cabin crew remote stand in dxb on the way out lounge in dxb very different in the terminal areas. a380 nice but bar closing early and was partly not staffed while all cabin crew chatting in the back. service the pure minimum for the travel class small selection and medium quality and inflexible. you did not see staff after main service. woken up for breakfast just to wait half an hour for it and the last hour of the flight there was no service and bar closed. i could have slept longer this happened on both a380 flights. ife is great good selection. expectations where high as was the ticket price and ek did not deliver in my view. i have travelled emirates a lot but the last 2 experiences were not as anticipated. we flew from gatwick to johannesburg via dubai on the 26th june 2014. staff on flight to dubai were good kids fed and good attention. flight to johannesburg was not so staff seemed occupied and unavailable. you had to keep asking for things like kids toys drinks etc which i do not really like doing. return flight to the uk via dubai on the 2nd of september was the worst of them all. staff are different now to when we flew a year ago on the same route. check in was a hassle in jnb and dubai. our 2 year old was not given a childs meal because it was not booked we had to keep asking for almost everything. both kids were not given the complimentary toys. the cabin crew seem to have no people skils at all  only one seemed to be on top of his game. previous staff 20112013 were always happy caring and service was impeccable. standards have changed and i will be trying other airlines after such an experience. emirates have to do something about their staff especially in terms of customer services and people skills. travelling with kids is not easy and emirates has been one of the airlines very good at easing this but this has changed. cabin crew should not look like they are just doing their jobs but happy to be of assistance. emirates have very clean and modern aircraft excellent entertainment and easy transfers to and from flights within dubai. unfortunately the cabin crew are not upholding the emirates values which crew displayed 10 yrs ago. i was shocked at the decline of customer care once showed by crew in economy. i flew from meldxb to italy return crew were rude never smiled avoided pax told pax to wait for the next service upon drink requests and did everything to make for an unpleasant flight. next time i will fly another carrier. crew should treat every pax as they would want their family members treated and remember they have chosen to be there i have flown emirates pretty much all my life. emirates considers itself one of the best airlines  i think this is true only sometimes. for the most part i see the service on certain routes getting worse with time. by service i mean that of the cabin crew. they do not seem to like their jobs at all and dont like dealing with passengers. i agree its not nice dealing with certain passengers who dont cooperate but why treat everyone the same way and why must we hear what the cabin crew have to say about the unruly passengers with some other routes i still do see very friendly cabin crew from time to time but its rare now. entertainment is pretty good on some flights but some routes its terrible almost nonexistent. i do like the food though. the flights would be so much better if the cabin crew seem less  angry impatient and grumpy. you almost feel like a criminal when you request something flew to mauritius via dubai and chose emirates because of good recommendation. not impressed. only good thing to say is that there is plenty of leg room. crew were uninterested in service and in one case downright rude. food largely inedible. the breakfast was particularly horrible. my husband had an aisle seat and every time someone went past he was bumped. would like to know why when we were due to land at 7am we were woken at 4 am. breakfast arrived at 4.45 and then the lights were put out again. obviously for the convenience of the crew and not the passengers who appear to be an annoyance. this is the first time that i have flown with emirates and if i can avoid it i will never fly with them again. the service was terrible  the meal was served and half an hour later they came to ask if we wanted beverages with our dinner. bit late as most people had already finished. the leg room was not adequate for an average person and the staff were very indifferent to the passengers. in dubai it was more important that the girls behind the desk send text messages than attend to customers. we actually had to ask them to help us even though there were two people behind the desk and no one except us waiting. so much for customer service. i cant think of anything positive about the experience. by comparison qantas for the second leg to sydney was a dream with attentive staff beverages offered at the same time as meals. snacks bought around every hour as well as water and other beverages offered every hour. the toilets were clean and tidy and the staff were super friendly. could not fault their service. emirates flight 406 from dubai to melbourne 22 sep. the limousine failed to pick us up at our hotel which had been arranged the previous day. there were no ground staff to show us the way to the loungegate. on board i found the staff less than friendly. i expect to receive prompt attention when i request water to be replaced and food to be delivered during the breakfast service. my past experience has been satisfactory the steward aboard our nice to dubai flight on 20 sep made sure we knew the aircraft features and helped with our carryon bag at the bottom of the stairs on our arrival in dubai. the state of the business washroom on 22 sep was unsatisfactory. i followed a staff member who had just used the washroom and found the litter container full and overflowing toilet paper on the floor and the toilet bowl very dirty. i have been a frequent traveller with emirates but will consider another airline in the future. ek432 dubai to brisbane via singapore continuation after ek2  see separate post. economy b777300er. disembarking from ek2 all transfer pax clear a security check before entering the terminal eliminating the need for it at the gate. clear signage to the next gate. not impressed with t3b terminal. boarding was just turn up and go. no order. once onboard the difference between the a380 and b777 is quiet marked. seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. i had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by i was bumped. the person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. it was most uncomfortable not helped by the av units under the seat taking up space. the food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. a roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. no sausage bacon or baked beans. the last dinner i had was a bit bland a beef casserole. would have benefited from a wine reduction. the av on this craft was the old ice. far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. we had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in india. we were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 bne time. at no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in bne. i had to spend my time in singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. very poor form. this along with the incredibly uncomfortable seats on the 777 make it extremely unlikely i will fly with emirates again if this is the only option available. long time emirates business class passenger  australia to uk and or europe. flights and services are deteriorating and we will look to another airline after recent trips in september. flight from melbourne to dubai was given a gate at cargo terminal in dubai resulting in long delays in off loading passengers and luggage and our luggage plus the other passengers then missed our next flight to zurich. staff not good on flight. dubai to zurich staff were better. returning found no emirates business lounge at amsterdam  desk staff embarrassed and unhelpful. gate slow to open and not enough seating  area of terminal where emirates is located has almost no services. amsterdam to dubai staff were helpful and so were dubai to melbourne staff. luggage came out late. having flown first or business class longhaul from eastcoast australia to north africa the middleeast and spain three times as well as transpacific to north america twice in 11 months i consider i am well qualified to say that both emirates first and business on their a380s simply dont cut it. from the time my wife and i checked in at brisbane there was simply nothing to make us feel special. plane seating is okay but no better than etihad and the onboard shower more a timefilling novelty. a flight is not just the time on board. the lounge in brisbane is dull and sparse and as it is shared with at least 84 traveling business plus whatever ff cardholders are in economy not surprisingly very crowded and noisy. there is nothing to make the 23000 expended on first class deliver any kind of special or exclusive feel. onboard the outbound leg the cabin crew were obviously tired and disinterested. to land in dubai and have to be offloaded via stairs in the desertheat and put on a bus for a 15 minute 5 kilometre lap of the ongoing massive airport expansion project only to have to then walk scurry elevator and shuttlepod back to almost where we started taking over an hour from landing to lounge. lucky were fit and speedy as it is a physical challenge after the 15 hours on board. the cabin crew on to barcelona was a complete contrast to the tired brisbanedubai crew with attentive service. arrival in spain was slick and via an air bridge. departure however was a different story with the crowded lounge and nothing to eat except ham sandwiches crisps and a platter of limp stale pastries. the crew and onboard service were fine and the airbridge arrival in dubai on time. the return dubai to brisbane was the final straw that at this stage has turned me off emirates possibly forever. the chauffeur failed to arrive at our hotel. on arrival at the first checkin nobody could care less about out the chauffeur not showing up. first checkin promptly spat out the boarding passes and told us to get moving as it was a 20 minute walk to the gate. we managed to find a small first lounge just past the gate and had time for a quick refres. at gate 23 there was no separate priority boarding for first or business passengers. all 520 passengers were jostling and pushing to get through one small door. emirates boarding was farcical and sums up what emirates have become. once onboard staff did their jobs providing good attention all the way to brisbane. first offers cabin service pretty much on demand however one thing i have never noticed previously in first was the constant clattering of cutlery and crockery. there are no socks at all and earplugs have to be requested. we also found the cabin hot and noisy and despite repeated requests by us and other passengers in first it remained uncomfortably hot. in conclusion i wont choose emirates again. i neither would fly emirates again nor recommend them. they position themselves as a high end service but are actually low costlow service. we just flew rome to sydney via dubai and bangkok. the dubai to sydney sector was an old 777 with 10 abreast seating 343. the 777 was designed for 9 abreast seating but ek has added an extra seat in the middle. the cabin is like a sardine can. the service was amateur. the entertainment system average. a horrid flight and experience. ek positions itself against singapore cathay qantas and the like. however it really is a third rate airline. never again. emirates service has down downhill over the last few years. recently flew melbourne to dubai and return. a380 both ways. check in staff very disinterested. plane was extremely hot. i rang for some water  no one came. the second time i went to the galley and asked for a drink. staff just gave me a drink and walked off. passengers recline their seats during meal times which makes life very difficult. food was appalling on flight over and back  stale bread rolls even warmed up croissants tasted stale. dubai check in staff even worse than melbourne for return flight. the woman went to put wrong labels on my luggage. when i pointed this out she said well there are two flights to melbourne  i would have thought that was her job to check not mine. very hard to get a drink on flight going home. snacks were handed out in the night but our row missed out. a man sitting behind me asked for some nuts and was told there are no nuts for economy passengers. sought of sums up the whole attitude. 6 aug gatwickdubai ek0010. 11 aug dubai  singapore ek 0352. sep 8 singaporeheathrow ek0005. londondubai service was appalling. dinner was served after midnight although the flight took off at 8.15pm by then i was desperate for water which the crew kept saying they would serve with dinner. they ran out of choices on their menu and could only serve chicken. we were not served any breakfast nor a beverage before landing. however the flight from dubaisingapore was better than the one from heathrow to singapore. i wont take this flight unless it is the only airline thatll take me to the destination. we recently travelled on emirates but were disappointed that the flight home from dubaiadelaide was overbooked and on arrival at the check counter at 11.30pm for a 2.00am departure that we would not be able to board the flight. our luggage was tagged and we were asked to wait until the plane was boarding to see if our seats would be available along with 4 other passengers. with 40 mins to go we were told that we could now board and to hurry through customs immigrations and no stopping to shop so that we would make the flight. we were given eud 100 each to spend on duty free on the flight but the crew told us that they were far too busy to offer any duty free items and this was a 12 hour flight. we still have the vouchers but what good are they to us cgkams via dxb and amscgk via dxb. the staff were rude. act like robots. lack of honesty sincerity and hospitality. great entertainment. dmmdxblax return trip on sept 18 and oct 6 2014. i am a frequent traveller on this route at least 3 times a year and always with emirates. after so many years of loyalty i am now tempted to try other airlines for the following reasons menu does not change on this route and it gets so unexciting and predictable after so many flights. while quantity of food is generous the taste is so below average. i have never seen seafood being offered on this menu it is always the predictable steak indian dish and arabic dish. on board service consistency is very patchy sometimes i am lucky to be served by kind and helpful flight attendant in 50 of the flights i had not. simple things such as smile when attending the customer never miss any customer when laying down mattress on long haul flight will be appreciated. while other aspects such as ontime arrival ife lounge access complimentary limousine pick up at lax are fine the onboard menu needs to be improved to retain customer loyalty. considering that emirates are charging premium and much more expensive that competitors i see no reason why it cannot improve on the menu and consistency of onboard service. loyal customers such as myself are now shopping around for better experience and value than what emirates is offering at the moment on the route. with less generous miles and redeeming a ticket now will cost close to 1000 dollars in additional fees and charges there has been something emirates truly learned from its partner qantas in how to upset its loyal customers by slapping them with 4 digit charges. come on emirates you used to wow me but not anymore. long time emirates business class passenger  australia to uk and or europe. flights and services are deteriorating and we will look to another airline after recent trips in september. flight from melbourne to dubai was given a gate at cargo terminal in dubai resulting in long delays in off loading passengers and luggage and our luggage plus the other passengers then missed our next flight to zurich. staff not good on flight. dubai to zurich staff were better. returning found no emirates business lounge at amsterdam  desk staff embarrassed and unhelpful. gate slow to open and not enough seating  area of terminal where emirates is located has almost no services. amsterdam to dubai staff were helpful and so were dubai to melbourne staff. luggage came out late. i usually fly to europe in economy class with singapore airlines via singapore or thai airways via bangkok but was persuaded to try emirates. i found the 14.5 hours from sydney to dubai to be unbearable. the service from flight staff was both difficult to access and disinterested. staff on the second leg to amsterdam were much more personable. the experience was so bad that i have paid almost 3800 to upgrade to business class for the return journey. it had better be worth it had problems with the airline even before my trip as they changed my flights. if i hadnt called them to check about something i would not have known i flew emirates londonjakarta via dubai. flight from heathrow was delayed by about an hour. dubailondon flight i had the wake me up sticker at the meal time the crew ignored the sticker. food was average and inflight entertainment was excellent. overall i was disappointed with the service i received as i had high expectations of emirates. its not as good as it used to be a few years ago. we recently travelled on emirates but were disappointed that the flight home from dubaiadelaide was overbooked and on arrival at the check counter at 11.30pm for a 2.00am departure that we would not be able to board the flight. our luggage was tagged and we were asked to wait until the plane was boarding to see if our seats would be available along with 4 other passengers. with 40 mins to go we were told that we could now board and to hurry through customs immigrations and no stopping to shop so that we would make the flight. we were given eud 100 each to spend on duty free on the flight but the crew told us that they were far too busy to offer any duty free items and this was a 12 hour flight. we still have the vouchers but what good are they to us leaving on qf 1 on 12 oct and from dubai back to sydney via london on emirates planes. all sectors on a380. the aircraft is the common factor between qantas and emirates. but the experience is so different. the qantas flight attendants are very professional in the way they go about their work. emirates fas are to a man and woman under 30 lack experience and customer skills. on ek 2 from lhr to dubai on saturday 18 october it was particularly bad. a couple of fas would not have been out of place on easyjet. one fixed up her lipstick during a meal service whilst serving. on four sectors flown in the last week on qantas and emirates planes it can be said that qantas came out way on top. this is not some pro australian rant. have been using qantas and emirates combination for a while now and the same result. what can emirates do get some serious training for their cabin crews and some old heads on board to oversee the younger staff. at the moment they all look and act like kids serving in mcdonalds. i will continue to fly emirates as their scheduling from australia is so good and much of my work is in the gulf and europe. shanghai pudongdubaishanghai pudong recently on a380 positive sides  amazing entertainment comfortable seat both flights on time. downside  poor food and beverage quality no waterany food between light meal and breakfast  its a 10hr flight ek is far below sqqr or even kl in terms of service used a bus to board our connecting flight to ham at dubai. we had to carry our baby and stand in the bus during 2030 minutes bus ride. no seats available. we had our hand luggage as well. it was a horrible experience. we paid more money to buy the tickets from emirates  tickets were almost half the price on another airline. it was our first time with emirates and we expected to have good service for the price we paid. i would not recommend emirates. brusselsdubai. emirates scores very low on staff service. they offered a choice between chicken or lamb on both flights but lamb was never available. they ran out of white wine coke ice but the other aspects checkin entertainment get high scores. flew emirates mandxbkul and back. a380 from mandxb and b777300er from dxbkul andmb777300er for all legs back to man from kul. the overall flight experience is below average. the seat was ok and a bit weary and some seats had visible stains. the aisle was too narrow the meal cart always hit the the aisle seats every time the cabin crew served the meal. the meal was below average nothing impressive about it. the crew have to learn to be more friendly and definitely need more training to communicate with the passengers. toilets were fairly dirty after a few hours and crew couldnt be bothered to look after them. the only good thing about the flight experience was the entertainment system. i am totally disappointed as i was expecting emirates to be one of the best airlines in the world. maddxbsyd economy. a380 great seats b777 impossible seats very uncomfortable. cabin crew poor. food is good. at gates in australia the staff were also poor. flew bkk to syd  seat was really uncomfortable. in the upright position it felt like you were slanting forward and i could feel the metal bars in the seat. it was an 8.5hr flight and was expecting the dinner service to take place quite quickly so i could take advantage of the lie flat bed. dinner wasnt served until well after 2hrs into the flight and was a disappointment. the staff were friendly and helpful which was great but apart from that i didnt enjoy what should have been a comfortable flight. check in staff at gatwick were first class and helpful. boarding was late but no idea why. on the flight the seats were comfortable and meal ok. staff were not very forthcoming with service drinks not offered had to ask for them and was left waiting for over 30 mins holding used cups as no one answered my call bell. on return from dubai check in staff not very helpful onboard staff  same problem. slow to answer call bell seats not very comfortable and no drinks offered except with meal. breakfast omelette was cold and so was the tea. this certainly wasnt up to the standard i was expecting from emirates given their reputation of being a first class airline. we flew from lgw to dxb 777300 stopped in dxb for 3 days and flew onwards from dxb to bne a380 as wed heard good reviews of emirates and wanted to see a little of uae. emirates offered the best price and connections tofrom australia and new zealand. really disappointing lgw to dxb service  staff were rude had no personality and seemed rushed. food was average and entertainment not much better. we left the flight in dxb more than willing to give them a second chance to impress on the longer dxbbne sector 14hrs on the a380 but more of the same. staff were rude unfriendly seemed rushed to complete service more concerned with doing their makeup we were sat next to the galley than much else. really poor. were flying back chcsydbkkdxblgw and to say that were looking forward to it would be misleading. compared to other longhaul flights weve flown air nz virgin atlantic singapore ba emirates are by far and away the worst  unless it seems you are lucky to be a gold member when they cant do enough for you. not sure why qantas decided to partner with emirates  terrible deal for qantas customers travelling from dubai to new york on the a380 i bought paid for the wifi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. when i complained to the onboard service director she told me that emirates was not responsible for the service and that i needed to write to inner the service provider. this was absolutely shocking  in my opinion emirates is responsible for every service offered on its flights. also flying from lhr to dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldnt recline so having paid for a first class seat i was unable to get a nights rest the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it. the flight was full so i was unable to be relocated but i would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight  this is what qantas would have done. put simply i believe that emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets i for one will not be flying emirates anymore. just flew perdxbfra. we found the overall experience to be disappointing and dont understand all the hype about emirates being one of the best. the seats were narrow and hard which made them very uncomfortable for long flights. qantas has way better seats. the food was average nothing to note at all. the biggest disappointment was with the unfriendly soulless cabin crew on both flights. barely a smile out of any of them. they looked like they were dead walking just going through the motions of their jobs. one in fact entertained us by digging around for ear wax a few times and then flicking into the aisle. she was gross not at all what we were expecting. maybe our return flights will be better my husband and i travelled on emirates on deldxbncecdgdxbdel between 8th and 16th december and were disappointed with the service that the airline offered. the deldxb and dxbdel flights were the most horrible that i have encountered so far. the staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. on our deldxb flight i requested for water thrice but it never came and on my third request i was rudely told by the staff that she cant give me water as she had other priorities to take care of. it was a clear sign that emirates is not interested in taking care of its flyers. our flight from cdgdxb was also not great as the supply of water and juices was intermittent. however i have high regards for the crew flying on dxbnce flight on the morning of 8th december. they were courteous helpful and very prompt in their service. they made our journey special with a small pastry when they got to know that we were newlyweds. but this was plain luck as the rest three legs of the journey were very disappointing and we have decided not to fly emirates again. the attitude of the staff clearly showed that passengers should not expect after sales service once they have paid for their tickets. i flew from adelaide to paris a couple of days ago. having heard of the really good reputation of emirates i was looking for to it. i was rapidly disappointed with a very basic service more than average food and their ice entertainment system really not user friendly with a lack of movie choices. by experience there are far better airlines on offer for a better price too. travelling back to australia in a couple of weeks hopefully they will prove me wrong. i flew twice with emirates in december  bangkokdubaigatwick returning heathrowdubaibangkok then again bangkokdubaiistanbul and return. their inflight entertainment options are above average although their headsets were broken 50 of the time. other than this i am sad to say on both flights i was disappointed with all aspects of their service. our group were always split in the most odd fashion  even on our business class flight i was separated several rows apart which made no sense. food options ran out on one flight  chicken or lamb my parents cannot eat lamb but they ran out of chicken  no alternative or other option we were no where near the back row so obviously many other passengers only had lamb as an option there are far better options out there for similar prices or cheaper. dont make the mistake i made  dont fly emirates if you have other options. flew hamdxbblr and returned blrdxbham in middecember 2014 with emirates. before taking this flight id heard the hype about emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. how far could the reality be from the hype a long way. where to begin the seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals i wasnt asleep they just didnt ask and were looking away from me so i couldnt get their attention until i had to practically shout at them  which got an angry looking glare. on the return leg from blr to dxb i got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues  i used the call button but nobody came. waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. finally it stopped and i got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. i noticed during the flights to blr and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls  they finally gave up or i saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves  so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy. meals are also average. allinall not a good experience over 4 flights with this airline  i would not recommend flying with them  i sure wont if i can avoid it. whilst i noticed the narrower seating being 777 on my way to london emirates i was lucky then to have a corner seat right in the area which is usually reserved for parents with small children. but yesterday i arrived back in perth from dubai on an 11hour flight on the same boeing 777300er and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. i can only say i am going to carefully consider my next flight maybe even save up for 2nd class. cattle class is just that i am not obese but have wide hips and shoulders and i am above average height. the seats on the boeing 777300er were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight  dubai london legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. sleep is impossible. service was very average crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passageways food options ran out quickly. the entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. of course comfort is supplied to the higherpaying customers. i really do resent this will try and check out the planetype before flying again. fradxbbkkdxbfra. must take ek again for the flight to bangkok due to the best price base on 6 months advance booking. fradxb on a380 nice aircraftflight full but still roomy dxbbkk on b777 did not get the selected seats even those seats are selected 6 months in advance by the time of booking on ek tool ek has changed our seats and we did not sit togetherflight full  no more to say about the 343 seating. worst service of all sectors slow service we requested water but were told to wait for the next service. bkkdxbfra on a380b777 flight full our choice of foods ran out on every sector. ive flown emirates over a period of six years and i can definitively say that every time i fly the service is getting worse. its route networks and frequencies are very good and its fares if booking at least 3 months in advance can be competitive. however ek progressively gets worse. ek is still on cutting back massively on quality example no amenity kits for y class foods quality and quantity is getting worse cutting the skywardsmileage counts too small number of cabin crews in y cabin and they are disinterested in passenger service avoid service to passengers disregards the calling sign. very chaotic and very slow on boardservices choice of foods ran out very early no organization. all those bad on board services ek fare is no more valuable for money. only ife is the best. the flight from hamburg to dubai was two hours delayed and service on board started 25 hours after takeoff. i pushed the service button in order to receive some water for taking medicine the only thing that happened was that after ten minutes a stewardess came by switched of the service sign and went away. i pushed the button a second time and the same happened again. furthermore there was only once service on an 8 hours flight. food unfortunately below standard. the entertainment system was quite ok though. hope that i dont have to fly with emirates again. i flew sindxbbhx after spending new year in singapore. i cannot believe that the standards have gone down so badly. i have been flying ek since 2006. transit in dubai  dubai airport can be a huge one and boast of passenger numbers but the reality is that it is finding hard to cater to the growth. terminal 3 is supposed to be exclusive for ek but why no aerobridges provided. my flight departed sin at 01.20 landed at around 05.00 in dxb. ek parked their b777300er somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. we were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. i entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. finally at around 6.30am i reached my gate b30. after the boarding pass check guess what we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their b777300er again. there was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. inflight service  the inflight service was awful. the standards have down in this area since 2010. their food portions have gone down i always felt hungry after the meal cabin crew dont want to move from their seats at all if you want something it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone. i flew from muscat to geneva via dubai with my 3 children. we were overall very disappointed with the quality of the service and the staff attitude onboard. air hostesses were rude staff made us wait for our hot meals as we refused a menu we had not requested on the way back special meals were not edible t3 in dubai is unpleasant and not set up to host so many people and planes 30 min bus journey from the plane to the terminal. in december i flew from zurich to dubai. i was excited to fly the a380. however my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. their body language and facial expressions were often as if theyd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. the a380 amsdub itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. the onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. the return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. will never fly with them again unless i have no other option. last october i flew from amsterdam to jakarta through dubai. i was excited to fly the a380. however my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. although never really rude the flight stewardesses were pretty much all very short almost bitchy and only busy with themselves. their body language and facial expressions were often as if theyd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. the a380 amsdub itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. the onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. between dubai and jakarta they use a boeing 777. another disappointment the plane on the inside was old seats smelled and looked like they definitely could use new fabrics. the entertainment screen was small and old my 3 year old tablet has a better screen than that onboard the 777 of emirates supposedly touch screen it worked horribly even with the remote control device. different plane and different crew but not a different mentality of the crew. from jakarta to dubai we flew again with the 777. same complaints as on the way to jakarta and on top of that when we arrived 5am in dubai we had to get out of the plane far from the terminal building. we had to use stairs to get out and clearly the stairs werent designed to handle such a large plane since there was quite the difference in height between the stairs and the exit door of the plane. when i asked the crew why we didnt taxi to the terminal the reply was there is no available gate. this is the home base of emirates and there is no place for its own planes from the runway we had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal which took about 20 to 30 minutes. from there it was very confusing where to go once inside the terminal building. for my girlfriend and i this was the first and last time we used emirates. flying perth to manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg. on arrival at dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a no  not every one has a fancy phone with internet service hotel voucher led to a hotel room for a sleep of approx 3hrs not worth the effort. for the cost of the ticket was not impressed with the lack of ground service or apologies for such a long delay one would think they would be more organised as this must happen regularly. flew sinbne in j class on the 77w. this is my second and last flight with ek in business class and i had hoping for a better experience with them the second time around. this did not happen. the crew looked bored and as though they did not want to be there. they missed our welcome drink and i had to ask for ours as they collected everyone elses empty glasses. then during the service the crew kept forgetting which rows they had served. a drink and nuts after take off were offered and then it was almost two hours before we were offered our first course. the fun started trying to get a glass of wine. they do not serve wine automatically with the meal like other airlines and instead walk around with a type of wine rack with a few glasses on it. good luck getting their attention to get a glass. they walked past us three times while we sat looking at them expecting a glass of wine with our entree. i was served red but my partner was ignored. i rang my call bell and they arrived to see what could be wrong with me. a few minutes later the same fa walked past offering bread and no wine. at this point i lost my temper and could not believe what was happening. my partner had finished the entree and not had a drink for over two hours ago by now. eventually the white wine came and the rest of the service was ordinary. they had no idea which wines they were serving or where they came from. it was just red or white and you pointed at which one you wanted. the food was very average quite boring. to me this airline just lacks soul. the ife was good and the ground staff at sin airport and the lounge were delightful. just such a disappointing onboard experience. a380 london heathrow to dubai 777300 dubai to dhaka. a380 leg was comfortable food ok crew efficient. 777300 dubai to dhaka  plane full cabin crew unenthusiastic  had to wait over 90 mins for food and a drink a drink should at least be served earlier if the wait for service is so long. return leg dhaka to dubai 777300er plane again full. cabin crew better and more organised but food was extremely disappointingso called breakfast was a sloppy curry alternative was fish. seats on 777 are cramped and narrow. dubai to london heathrow a380nice new plane seats more comfortable and cabin crew pleasant organised and efficient. cabin crews seem very variable too many need to learn to smile. qf 8043 from dubai to frankfurt on 5 feb 2015. have just flown dubai  frankfurt economy. staff were less than enthusiastic food very unappetising plane rattled in an unnerving way. hoping the return flights to sydney will be better ek 10 on jan 4th onto ek 770. noticed that 25 of passengers received a drink before take off. crew too busy to serve all of us. no drink service for the 2hr 27min. each request met with it will be along shortly. i realize that is why so many regular business travelers dashed to the bar before the seat belt signs were switched off. the meal was still cold when i mentioned this i was told that it had been dealt with in accordance with instructions and we are very busy. it is very obvious that emirates do not carry enough crew on the a380 to serve everyone the same in the business section. make sure that you are not at the back the next leg of the journey on a smaller plane was far better. they just did not bring the luggage. flew manchesterdubaisingapore and returned three weeks later. going out ok but remember much longer journey than with other airlines you also have to change planes. service in past has made this acceptable not any more will i be doing it. earphones were not working so entertainment not good going out on one half of outward journey. return journey was a nightmare. plane full and a seat in front that came so far back i had trouble opening my tray. the guy in front watched movies all the way but was not concerned that i had no room. monitor did not work for three hours so they reset it three times before it worked. seatbelt was falling apart. toilet had no water in sink after putting soap on hands. water dispenser also was not working. second meal before landing not served. i was already unhappy from first leg. second flight was from the other side of the airport a good thirty minutes dash never had such a distance on such a tiring journey. dubai to manchester now another eight hours if you are lucky. problems with a forty ton machine being loaded in cargo hold falls off pallets and jams luggage hold. we sit in our seats for two hours waiting to take off. we eventually do set off. leave aircraft and immediately complain on website. no answer as yet. i have travelled with emirates over the years many times i will not be doing so again service is no longer there. flew from birmingham uk to dubai on 27th january and did not enjoy the experience. cabin crew were terrible. half the plane received a hot towel before takeoff and then the crew could not be bothered with the rest of us and abandoned it. dinner service was dreadful. the rows behind us received their food about an hour before we did but then they had to sit with their food trays for about another 2 hours before being cleared away. it was 3 hours in before we received our first drink. finally the menu said we would get a hot drink and sweet treat before landing  nothing given. the crew were so slow it was unbelievable. flew back from singapore yesterday via dubai and could not believe this was the same airline. yes we all got given hot towels and again before landing. very prompt with food and drinks and was a pleasure to fly with them this time. flew as a package heathrow to dubai dubai to colombo colombo to male male to dubai dubai to heathrow. on all of our paperwork we had numbered seats together. we actually sat in these seats on the first flight and never sat together again. after 3 days in dubai we arrived at the airport after midnight to find that there were no seats on the plane so ours had been sold to someone else. we waited to see if there would be seats as we had a connection waiting for us in colombo. desk was hopelessly undermanned and after a long wait no seats available anywhere on the plane. after 20 minutes or so it was clear there wasnt a hotel to go to either so spent an uncomfortable night in a cold dubai airport with a voucher for probably the cheapest meal in the cafe. got on the next plane in the morning which was delayed by an hour. we did get a voucher to travel from dubai to colombo how this airline has built a reputation for being one of top carriers is beyond us. the only thing that was better than the cheapest airlines was the entertainment system but no way can this make up for the rest of our experience. we did write to express how we thought that our experience should be giving real cause for concern to customer relations. never got a reply. business class on ek 418 bkksyd. the flight itself on a 777 was good and my wife and i managed to get a decent rest on the angled seats. had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. dinner was well presented. we missed breakfast as we were asleep. departure and arrival on time. aircraft equipped with older ice but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. main negatives at checkin and upon arrival. i was very surprised that our reserved seats 9 k and j were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. i am platinum with qf code share on this flight so got a bit upset as the checkin staff at the first class check in in bkk tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. after rejecting this seat change lady suddenly found seats 10 k and j for us. could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 k & j and they had no status with ek or qf. second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at syd. even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with first labels and we checkedin at bkk 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in sydney. as i said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage. an overall great flight but checkin at bkk and luggage return in syd needs to be improved. also not impressed with the ek lounge in bkk. looks new and cozy with good food and drink on offer but the chairs are very uncomfortable. my wife and myself flew from glasgow to sydney return january and february 2015 on economy. the worst flying experience. five emirates flights and all of them delayed on two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served ok if you were business or first but economy forget it on the last flight back from bangkok to dubai the flight was late arriving we were met by emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. we were rushed through dubai airport very large airport and some of us had ailments no transport arranged. when we reached the departure gate the staff there told us its too late for you to get on we did tell arrivals this we were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of dubai airport. we managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. this meant another group around dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. we asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only. by the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline we have traveled on china eastern and found the service much better than emirates provide. flew sinbne in j class on the 77w. this is my second and last flight with ek in business class and i had hoping for a better experience with them the second time around. this did not happen. the crew looked bored and as though they did not want to be there. they missed our welcome drink and i had to ask for ours as they collected everyone elses empty glasses. then during the service the crew kept forgetting which rows they had served. a drink and nuts after take off were offered and then it was almost two hours

lost my temper and could not believe what was happening. my partner had finished the entree and not had a drink for over two hours ago by now. eventually the white wine came and the rest of the service was ordinary. they had no idea which wines they were serving or where they came from. it was just red or white and you pointed at which one you wanted. the food was very average quite boring. to me this airline just lacks soul. the ife was good and the ground staff at sin airport and the lounge were delightful. just such a disappointing onboard experience. flying perth to manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg. on arrival at dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a no  not every one has a fancy phone with internet service hotel voucher led to a hotel room for a sleep of

must happen regularly. a380 london heathrow to dubai 777300 dubai to dhaka. a380 leg was comfortable food ok crew efficient. 777300 dubai to dhaka  plane full cabin crew unenthusiastic  had to wait over 90 mins for food and a drink a drink should at least be served earlier if the wait for service is so long. return leg dhaka to dubai 777300er plane again full. cabin crew better and more organised but food was extremely disappointingso called breakfast was a sloppy curry alternative was fish. seats on 777 are cramped and narrow. dubai to london heathrow a380nice new plane seats more comfortable and cabin crew pleasant organised and efficient. cabin crews seem very variable too many need to learn to smile. from dfw 12262014. from maa 1192015. i have been flying out from dallashouston to couple of cities in india. over the years emirates have squeezed economy or cattle class as much as possible. sometimes the behavior of the crew is surprising. food is good however the overall service is okay only. given that qatar and etihad now flies out of dallas i will avoid emirates in future. dubai to sydney economy class. after reading other postings here for emirates just had to add my comments. i have travelled emirates for many years but i feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. friendly fas are rare these days. the others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. almost knock you over if you are in their way. a couple of people took our seats and wouldnt move but the fas couldnt care less. the once fabulous selection on ice is deteriorating too. plenty to see but a poor selection in english unless you like violent movies. whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight not served on my flight. some passengers rang for the fa but they didnt come. yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. lift your game emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. i firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. i am due another flight next week to europe. hope this is a better experience. flew kuwait  dxb and dxb  doha. food drink and inflight entertainment is only what we can dream about on a short hop in europe. however the crew were absolutely miserable. all of them. the crew also made no effort to enforce safety. during taxi there were people wandering around the cabin without being challenged at all. traveled on 24th march 2015 flight ek435 from auckland to paris stop over brisbane then onto dubai. i would of appreciated more move selection the same with the music. 25 mins before landing our headphones were collected. why flight attendants were slow bringing drinks. flight from brisbane to dubai 13 hrs i recalled them coming around with water 4x. i had to get up to ask an attendant to fill my water bottle because they were too busy talking in the food prep area. meal selection always ran out by the time it got to the back rows. on our final flight the first meal from dubai to paris was served 3hrs into the 7hr flight it was breakfast of what was left over and not everything on the menu. lunch again was what was left over and too salty i requested cheese and crackers and got told shed come back after she served the drinks but i got nothing. one of the toilets brisbane to dubai flight soap dispenser was broken and soap seeped out onto the floor making a huge wet slippery surface. there was never moisturizers or spray in it and there was always one toilet not operational. i paid for a flight that covered all its services why should i be made to feel like my needs are not important. i didnt request extra food or alcohol i just wanted my choices on the menu toilet paper soap spray refreshers and moisturizer in a clean toilet and to be able to listen to good music and get water without having to ask. flew ek406  dubai to melbourne on a380. i fly on a regular basis with emirates. however the quality of service is exponentially going downhill. the food on this flight was terrible. staff service was pretty poor and they werent really interested. my husband and i flew from johannesburg to istanbul via dubai in late march 2015. the flights to dubai and then istanbul were fairly uneventful. i had requested a gluten free meal. the gluten free portion of the meal was unimaginative and very unappetising. arriving at istanbul we waited at least 30 minutes for the luggage to be offloaded. the return trip however was an ordeal from beginning to end. the flight left istanbul more than an hour late. we had to wait in a boarding area that was far too small for the number of passengers. we arrived in dubai with 30 minutes to make our connecting flight and were told that we had been rescheduled on a later flight which meant a wait of 5 hours through the night. our compensation was an inadequate meal voucher. meanwhile our original connection left more than 30 minutes late in any case and we could still have made it. the new connection also left late by about 40 minutes. my special meal request was not transferred to the new flight. the flight was jam packed and the service was patchy. when the coffee eventually came around it was absolutely cold. i will not be flying emirates again. we have flown with emirates more than 20 times. in the last 4 months we flew business class 8 times and first class once. we have experienced 2 great flights with them but 6 awful flights. emirates call centre were disorganised and provided conflicting information when we called to try to make changes. the crew in general are by far the worst we have experienced on any airline including budget airlines. on 4 of the recent flights my wife was pregnant. emirates made very little attempt to make the flight any better for her. we have flown with emirates various times over the last 7 years and have found the experience increasingly worse. the food in business class has been paired back so much that it is almost inedible. they have chosen to use extremely cheap bread and pastry products as filler. the food at singapore business lounge was inedible i say this as a statement of fact not a complaint. i returned to the main terminal and purchased food and drink from there and brought it back into the lounge. the chauffeur service is also highly variable. at singapore we were collected by an 8 year old souped up mini van replete with flashing lights inside and worn out interior instead of the limousine they promise. we fly a combination of business and first class when we use emirates our reason for this is to try to avoid undue stress when travelling to or from a holiday destination. unfortunately we have found that for 75 of the time we come home feeling frustrated. we are going to try ba and virgin for our future trips  i would highly recommend avoiding ever using emirates airlines. ek038 4 mar 15 bhx to dxb. one and a half hours delayed. no drink service offered for another one and a half hours. dinner then served without drink meal eaten before wine was served. on checking the menu i hate curry so informed the stewardess asking her to save me the alternative but she forgot so no main course for me. very stressful flight due to worry about missing connection. next year its ba direct for us. outward from heathrow 24315 ek002 to dubai. dubai to mauritius ek701. homeward mauritius to dubai ek704 on 11315. mauritius to heathrow 12315 ek001. patchy service. if you did get a drink prior to take off it was immediately taken away. the seats were not clean. i actually found dry noodles on my seat on one leg of the journey. i had soup and scrambled egg served cold. you then have to sit and stare at your tray for 20 minutes or more after you have finished one course then wait again for the next. the staff are far too busy not enough of them no team work. have flown emirates business class before and was pleased but not on the huge a380. the only advantage was a fully flat bed but not too much of a bonus when the seats are not clean. dubai business class lounge is like a transport cafe. too big too few comfy seats too few ladies toilets. all in all not value for money. awful. lhrdxb  seats spacious and ice entertainment system excellent with a wide selection to choose from and a very large screen. however most disappointing was the crew onboard as they were very rude and made us passengers seem like an inconvenience. i was expecting a lot more from an airline like emirates in terms of customer service onboard. the food was also quite poor even for economy class. flying to dubai from manchester on 15th march 2015 boeing 777 flight ek022 seat 21e and 21d. we found the service very poor. the female flight attendant never smiled or offered any greeting. we were not offered any drinks but had to ring the call button twice to get a response. on the second occasion for some water again rang twice and from the first call to receiving the drink was just over 11 minutes. this was before and after lunch not at a busy time. at lunch we had to ask for coffee which the male attendant leaned over to pore i had to ask for milk and sugar. the coffee was lukewarm and the attendant was equally out of sorts with himself. we have never had this treatment on previous emirate flights. i wondered if we were on a no frills flight or was it because we can only afford to fly economy. our return on 30th march was just the opposite with friendly crew and excellent service. doha to dubai ek848 and dubai to zurich ek087. both flights were 25 march 2015. emirates was a great airline but lately its service levels are declining. we took a trip from doha to zurich with connection in doha. on first leg we asked for blankets but no attention was given until flight landed and on reminding air hostess were told that no blankets were available on flight. on second leg the food was quite poor and head phones were collected 30 minutes before landing. certainly service levels have declined significantly compared to 2 years ago. flight from icndxbmad. everything was fine except its cabin crew. some were rude and never smiled. dubai airport is awful. it is just a shopping center with zero possibility to see the airport apron. lgwdxbbkk and return. 3 legs with 777300er and 1 leg dxbbkk with a380. overall not impressed. expected a lot more from the emirates name. both journeys no wifi available or telephone onboard as advertised. the screens seems to be a bit unresponsive. staff lacking the extra mile with far too many announcements unrelated to flight safety really disturbing at night time. flying just once with emirates is probably enough. lgwdxbbkkdxblhr. lgwdxb b777. i had forgotten how bad the emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one i used felt in need of a refit. the good selection of movies and tv can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets i gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. all other legs on a380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the ife or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. i sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. as for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get i went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and i was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes. flight ek225. dubai to san francisco. airbus 380. pathetic and rude infight service. basic reply there are 400 plus passengers and 8 crew members only. if crew are short staffed is it a passenger problem terrible service at baggage claim more than 2 hours. reason short staff. flight ek008 from london heathrow to dubai 16 april 2015 business class. the seat i was assigned 10d did not recline and was broken. the system was rebooted 34 times from the shoe holder from the rack alongside the seat from the control area of the aircraft and separately by another to physically try and push it down each one extending for up to 15 minutes and me forced out of the seat for the majority of this period and this went on for about 3.5 hours of the 7 hour flight. until then i was not moved to any other seat with the rebooting i couldnt use the entertainment options for a couple of hours as well. after the chief purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. i was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4k on the flight thereafter. the electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didnt work. there was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. i had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an asian vegetarian meal that got loaded. once again we are now in the 21st century and still emirates business class does not have a single out of four main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means i will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on emirates. seems odd and not befitting an airline such as emirates which has fantastic infrastructure and options available to it as well as world renowned chefs. overall as you can imagine this was disappointing for me as a platinum member flying emirates. on a recent flight ek435 a380 from brisbane to dubai on the 18th of april 2015 the flight had a technical problem shortly after passengers were boarded at 20.30 hrs. resolution took over 3.5 hours during which all passengers were kept on the airplane with no food or drinks. water and some fruit juice was distributed reluctantly by the crew after being repeatedly asked it appeared they did not want to go through the bother of having to open and close the trolleys before the flight took off the captain made a few sporadic announcements in the 1st hour of waiting and then disappeared leaving announcements to the purser. all in all the 14 hour flight took all of 17 hours. the food was as usual substandard the drinks as a few have mentioned only appeared after the food was served i dread the day they are going to launch the new revamped a380 cdgdxbkix nrtdxbcdg. a380  b777300er. first time with emirates with high expectations. in terms of aircrafts themselves not disappointed at all. great seats especially on the a380 with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. what disappointed me was first of all the service. in all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. no smiles at all. when you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. another disappointment was food quality and quantity. continental breakfast from dxb left me hungry for few hours. the rest of meals acceptable but not good as other european airlines af or klm for example. overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as sq or qf. anyway prices keep being competitive so at the end fair value for money. my husband and i flew from johannesburg to istanbul via dubai in late march 2015. the flights to dubai and then istanbul were fairly uneventful. i had requested a gluten free meal. the gluten free portion of the meal was unimaginative and very unappetising. arriving at istanbul we waited at least 30 minutes for the luggage to be offloaded. the return trip however was an ordeal from beginning to end. the flight left istanbul more than an hour late. we had to wait in a boarding area that was far too small for the number of passengers. we arrived in dubai with 30 minutes to make our connecting flight and were told that we had been rescheduled on a later flight which meant a wait of 5 hours through the night. our compensation was an inadequate meal voucher. meanwhile our original connection left more than 30 minutes late in any case and we could still have made it. the new connection also left late by about 40 minutes. my special meal request was not transferred to the new flight. the flight was jam packed and the service was patchy. when the coffee eventually came around it was absolutely cold. i will not be flying emirates again. was on the emirates flight dubai to delhi in february. have done this route several times. they have this weird practice of serving meals before serving drinks which is the norm even on their other flights. it appears like theyd rather not have the passengers order any drinks which are advertised as included in the flight cost. secondly meal choices advertised on their menu cards are almost always not fully available  its always oh sorry weve run out of this option so all we can serve is this great  than why offer a choice in the first place. seats are cramped with lower than average legroom. flight ek207 dubainew york may 14th 2015. we boarded the plane with 400 people and no air conditioning on time with no delays. when we were moving towards the runway the plane stopped and after an hour the captain realized there was a technical issue. we were kept onside the plane for 2.5 hours with no food or water. the flight crew were most inconsiderate. it was a madhouse people were frustrated and angry without any details on what was going on. they finally let us out from the plane into a tiny lounge at least it had ac. forget about food or water at this point. 1.5 hours later they boarded the same plane all over again and with total of 4 hours delay we finally took off. we were in dubai home country to emirates and the company couldnt expedite the problem with providing us with the new pane it was my first and my last time with emirates i have not taken an international flight for many years but before then i travelled overseas all the time often with 2 small children by myself. this trip i flew sydney  dubai  dublin for christmas 2014. then returned manchester  dubai  sydney in jan 2015. i found on all flights that the cabin crew were fighting amongst themselves and were not interested in the passengers at all. i felt that it was an imposition to ask for anything. i went to the galley and asked for something to eat when most were sleeping and was told that food would be coming soon. it came 2 hours later. the cabin crew were sittingdrinkingeating and arguing. the meal thing surprised me as i had never been hungry on an international flight before. we were fed twice in 14 hours. otherwise it was as you expect. bkkdxblhr and lhrdxbbkk. first leg bkkdxb ek 373 was cancelled for 27 hours finally managed to get on the next days flight again the flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. the a380 is a jumbo jet however the emirates seats are very hard. your legs will get very sore after 2 hours flight in. food is so so and the cabin crew are mostly unpleasant or just not willing to help. dxb to bkk sit on the first row right outside toilet a nightmare as you cant sleep at all with a long queue of people waiting for toilet the entire journey. nevertheless i wont fly with emirates again. bkkhkgbkk trip on ek384 and ek385 respectively on april 1st and april 4th. on the outbound leg boarding was at will. arrived at boarding gate about an hour before the departure time and was told to go ahead and grab our seats inside the plane. the cabin crew appeared to have little or no training in their jobs. they wore dirty shabby uniform. no safety checks or seatbelt checks prior to take off as one would expect from any airline. rushed safety announcement which was barely understandable. the meal they served resembled a frozen microwavable quick meal. i picked the chicken offering which smelt and tasted horrible. cabin crew were mostly absent through the entire flight. on our return leg same story with the meal  i didnt even bother to touch it. ife screen was frozen on my wifes seat and despite promises from a crew to reboot it nothing worked. headphones for half the passengers in my section were broken as could be seen from passenger complaints onboard. i fly this route at least once a year and do not look forward to flying ek again unless desperate. the a380 is an amazingly comfortable plane to fly however ek service was a massive letdown. flight ek418 bkk to syd. 2x3x2 configuration. seat adequate with duvet addition making it more comfortable to sleep. food and beverage selection limited and food quality just average. staff very aloof and inattentive. inflight entertainment was good. auckland to sydney ek413 28 may 2015. drink trolley came 15 minutes after the meal trolley. all passengers around me had therefore finished their meal before being provided with a drinks service. dinner menu offered beef or chicken however the option was in fact fish or beef the crew in the mid section of the cabin seemed very disorganised and lacked supervision. i activated the call button and it took 20 minutes to have any attention given and i was not the only passenger in this situation. travelled nz to england 3 flights both ways in may. i think their standards have slipped having flown with them several times now. my main gripe is the miserable cabin crew. hardly anyone smiles or gives eye contact. the food was ok but quite repetitive. we often didnt get to choose the meal we wanted as they had ran out. its a pity you cant give an indication of which meal you would choose prior to the flight so they can get more accurate supplies. meals seemed a bit disorganised and drawn out at times and we couldnt believe that they abandoned the last sweet snacks round after serving half the cabin. we thought the staff were going to get more supplies or we would be served later but no. we got nothing. then it was time to land with a 3 hour wait for the next connection so we had to purchase some drinks and snacks in the airport to keep us going. maybe they left it too late to start the snacks round. but again better organisation is therefore needed. the staff were not seen much in between the food and drinks serving unless somebody called for them. on previous flights they often came round with extra water. but this time hardly at all which left us quite dehydrated as i didnt realise till the end you could self serve from a point on the aircraft. this should have been made known to everyone at the beginning of the flight. we had the airbus for all of the flights which was a great. the entertainment and leg room were much needed on such long journeys. all in all we are keen to try a different airline next time. i was shocked at how bad the service was from emirates. the flight attendants were rude abrupt and everything was so slow. we were delayed on the way there and again on the way back. waiting an hour for baggage in dubai very disappointed with emirates as ive heard people praise them. where do i start touch screens for tvmovies did not work properly i was constantly having to press it. i had two sets of headphones and neither worked properly. attendants seemed constantly harried with poor time management skills although they seemed to find lots of time to have a group gossip in the galley at the back. on the dubailondon leg the young man in the window seat near me as getting wet from an overhead drip originating in the air outlet. when he asked politely if he could move he was told curtly no he could not even though there were spare seats. just before we touched down in london there was announcement could the five gentlemen who should have been travelling to london gatwick make themselves known to cabin crew. how can the emirates staff let people booked on a london gatwick flight get onto a london heathrow flight we had a good laugh about that one.  i have flown emirates 3 times in the last six months but clearly customer loyalty means nothing to them. my mother brother and i are scheduled to fly with them to italy tomorrow for my brothers 21st birthday but we got a call from them today less than 24 hours before our flight to say that our flight has been cancelled and we have been moved to another flight. the problem with this is that we were scheduled to arrive in rome at 07h25 in the morning after a short 3 hour layover in dubai but now they were making us arrive at 20h20 in the evening after a 16 hour layover in dubai i have called emirates countless times today and wasted my entire day trying to get an earlier flight and they say there is nothing they can do. we are only going for 5 days so to lose an entire day have a 16 hour layover and lose out on all the tours we had planned is just unacceptable. very disappointing. this is the last time i will be flying emirates. dxb  istanbul  dxb y class. gold member with ek regular flights mainly long haul in j class this was a business trip. both flights full to the ceiling both flights late by one hour staff obviously over stretched but in no hurry and not one i ever saw smile. entertainment would have been good as usual with ek except the ear phones i had and changed twice were useless due to the engine noise and two men talking behind me so could hear nothing. staff service as mentioned massive difference from j class really is a case of get them in and get them out. no call bell answered ever actually looked at me and walked off  never again y class ek. for 1000 usd for a supposed 4 hour flight  crazy. flew lhr to mel in business class. trip i take 34 times per year on ek both economy and business. over a 12 month period emirates scores very high on the overall product and their planes are new and very comfortable. i write this review because the last flight was plagued by uninterested cabin crew menu that never changes lack of non alcoholic beverages to match winechampagne list unlike etihad and qatar food that was poorly reheated business class bread selection again unchanged but truly awful in taste and texture and lacked freshness and flavour. while i did get my value for money i wouldnt consider flying emirates again. ground service at sydney airport was ok. checkin was quick and smooth. however at the gate staff were generally unfriendly and quick to dismiss people. the person managing the gate seemed tired and angry at customers. the plane was clean and quite spacious. the seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. there was a very large selection of entertainment. however the flight was significantly let down by the crew. when boarding the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. when serving the hot towels the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me. during the meal service the flight attendant gave me the wrong order. instead she gave me my seatmates order and gave my seatmate my order. additionally during the drinks service the flight attendant seem bothered when i asked what tea they were offering. ultimately i thought the crew were inexperienced tired and annoyed. this was my first flight with emirates and it unfortunately has given me a bad impressions of the airline. our flight to dubai was delayed by 2 hours and emirates didnt seem to care. we had one notification that our flight will delayed by 2 hours and not a word since. staff appeared not experienced disinterested and rather tired to serve. the cabin looked outdated and they run out of specific food although we were seated towards front of the aircraft. when our luggage was misplaced at dubai airport nobody had a clue what happened to it or where should we go. waiting with 3 kids at the airport for over 2 hours wasnt fun.  jfkdxb on the a380. hard product is great excellent legroom seats had decent recline and cabin was in good condition. ife is top of the industry and is the best. not only do they have a plethora of tv series but they have entire seasons. my biggest gripe about emirates is the inconsistent service. some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. they had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. for example during the breakfast service a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when i tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart i was met with a shrugged look. catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative not what it used to be. dxb is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid. overall still a decent flight but i would rather fly with another airline. generally good service but my screen console wasnt working. i told the hostess who said she would reboot the screen. twenty minutes later after nothing had happenedi told another hostess who said exactly the same thing. neither returned to check if the screen was working. the third hostess i asked if i could move to another seat with a working entertainment console. this was arranged but should have been done much earlier on when i told them it wasnt working. i dont think the quality of their entertainment consoles are that good something i have noticed on other flights with them. this experience confirmed that. the seat pitch seems particularly narrow. if you drop something on the floor you can forget about trying to pick it up. ill fly the whole way with qantas next time. bangkok to dubai 4 july ek373 a380 was as expected and as usual there was a good offering of inflight entertainment choices. the inflight service was some of the worst i have experienced and my expectations are pretty low nearly 2.5 hours until even a glass of water was offered. i would rather they ditched the hot towels and handed out a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight if they are incapable of providing a glass of water within a hour of take off. crew were largely invisible and on the odd occasion one would scurry down the aisle avoiding all eye contact with passengers. the only visible crew member spent most the flight speaking to friends or family in row 45. all service requests in our section ignored and a number of other frustrated passengers mystified as to what was going on. plane arrived on time but to a stand well away from the terminal. buses delays and a transfer that felt like we were driving from abu dhabi to dubai. very efficient booking and check in. very good value for the money. all flights on time and excellent entertainment choices inflight. meals were ok not great. the only complaint would be that the staff were grumpy most of the time. service level of the female staff was below any acceptable level for any reputable airline. narrow seats with very little legroom. the staff were rude and with an awful attitude. free food obviously. ice was not what i expected. my fingers were almost broken trying to click on screen. the boeing 777300ers some brand new still seemed jaded. as for dxb i will return to european hubs. disappointed my first time. expected so much more. the staff badly need to change their attitude. i was onboard ek345 on 172015 from klia to dubai departing at 9.30 am malaysian time. emirates has generally good service but i must say that the service provided by staff will supercede all other aspects. i believe a customer may forget if the landing was not smooth the food was delayed or not to required taste the departure slightly delayed etc etc. a rude or arrogant staff member however will be remembered and customers may reconsider their travel experience with the said airline. again i will rate emirates to have given my family and i fairly good service. but i was very much upset with one of the cabin crew. i have observed harsh tones in dealing with customers in particular those elderly and who may not be proficient in english.  i pressed for assistance 3 times and only once was i attended to but all 3 requests of a cup of water was forgottennot delivered. food was not served despite placing the sticker wake me up for food. all i got was only a cup noodle. service has declined since my first flight with them and i have been flying with emirates once a year since 2010. really disappointed. brilliant flight as always and emirates is known for its very comfortable flights. however i truly feel that emiratess standards have notched down a bit as the cabin crew are not that responsive to economy class passengers. moreover i had to ask for a glass of water about 5 times which is unacceptable according to emirates standards. i am a frequent traveller of emirates but this was not a good experience in terms of service provided. on the positive side the seats were extremely comfortable and inflight entertainment was superb with movies from all over the world and very fine podcasts this was without question the worst business class flight ive ever undertaken in my life. flight was qf8765 a codeshared flight operated by emirates on 28 june 2015. flying with emirates can be a hit or miss affair based on our experiences with the inflight service either being excellent or completely substandard. in this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service meals availability and inflight entertainment not functioning. our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. it honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. this terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. we were offered only one meal from the menu and there was no desserts coffee or chocolates. the catering was terrible on this flight however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. i had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a childrens meal despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult business class ticket. inflight entertainment was not functioning correctly with mine and several other screens not working. we reported it to our disinterested flight attendant who said they would reset the system however this never occurred. upon leaving the aircraft at sydney i reported the incidents to an emirates ground staff cso who was on the aero bridge. we never heard from him or had any followup from emirates at sydney. we wrote to emirates however with any correspondence to the complaints  complements team at emirates there was no reply. delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after checkin when i noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 initially thought it was a misprint. no active qf communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to dubai for 10 hours. later i found out passengers booked under ek flight numbers were reshuffled to other ek connecting flights passengers under qantas had to see the qf counter in dubai see below. flight service was extremely poor from fra to dubai took 3 hrs to finish service whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes usually they do this instantly. drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after ek service has gone dramatically downhill. on arrival in dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. it took 20 minutes in a barely airconditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and i doubt they made it. trying to find a qf counter at dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. it took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop just missed a shuttle to the express hotel  next one was only 30 minutes later. so from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.53 hrs and i walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. after 6 hrs or so i tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. at the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight although it did not matter as another delay. service on the dubai–sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately i.e. cutlery one pass tablet main meal desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea this whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak english well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. singapore on the same airline is. this was my first time trying fly emirates and i was disappointed. when we first arrived the planes ac was off and everyone was hot not to mention a 1 hour delay for departure. the cabin staff were not cooperating at all. my mother needed help with baggage and the hostess told her to do it herself. we ordered water and tea countless times until they finally responded the inflight entertainment in my opinion is not good. there wasnt enough variety in the choice of food. when we bought the tickets they advertised it as a plane that has wifi which was not the case. the plane was old the seats were tiny and not comfortable at all. the cabin manager was very helpful though and listened to our complaints and was one of the few reliable people in the staff. definitely not going to try it again. we were disappointed with our recent emirates flight. on our return from paris were were informed of a 6 hour delay but without any explanation. during the delay were were provided with a voucher for one drink and one cake when we eventually boarded it took over two hours to get a meal let alone a drink. my partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. when the food does arrive its sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce. yes the aircraft are new and the ife ok but the attitude of the cabin crew doesnt match. they appear surly and unsmiling as if us paying passengers are an inconvenience. we encountered the same issues with the cabin crew on our outward flight. all in all a very disappointing experience. we are an australian family of four that just returned after spending a month in europe. we booked our travel with emirates travelling brisbane barcelona paris london dubai and return. the preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 4649. however on every sector except from london to dubai the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle  four of us i telephoned the booking offices at each location who refused to help then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. it was a long journey which we had to endure. i found almost all of their staff be it cabin crew or counter staff to be very robotic in their attitude. no customer service at all. no friendly disposition no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. the food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. however this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. i did the right thing booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help. wont be flying emirates again i flew karachi to dubai with emirates on 5th august 2015 on a half empty aircraft only 100 passengers and it was not pleasant flight. one of the male emirates pursers was very rude on the entrance of the aircraft not welcoming the passengers. inflight staff had no eye contact and food standards were poor.  i have become a loyal emirates traveller over the past year with short hops in and out of saudi arabia on a regular basis and retained gold status. however this flight reminded me why i do not rate emirates for longer haul. flight was a hour late leaving due to slow loading of cargo and then we missed our take off slot. drink service came 1.5 hours after take off and food started 1 hour later  but took nearly 1.5 hours to get out all courses. by this time we were 23rds of the way into the flight so if we had wanted to sleep forget it and by dubai time my starting point it was gone 4pm. food was a starter of tiny piece of smoked duck mains were something with rice and since there were a lot on nonchinese on the flight i think in business class there should have been another nonrice choice. my main was two tiny bits of skin covered in tasteless red gunge which was supposed to be sweet and sour chicken plus something that once may have have been pak choi but was so waterlogged it clearly had drowned weeks ago. totally inedible. about an hour later they offered us a snack  it was barely an hour since lunch  it all smelled awful and what i saw of it was not worth touching. sorry emirates next time i fly to the far east i will check out qatar and will remain loyal as before to ba for londoneuropestates despite their old planes. the 2nd leg of my wifes and my return flight from the seychelles and a discounted upgrade into business class. apart from relatively comfortable and spacey seating nothing special. friendly staff but the threecourse meal was served and cleared much too quickly forcing us to eat our food much faster than we would have in economy and making the beginning of the flight not relaxing at all. the food itself was ok for business but not much better than in economy. entertainment great as always. after all  only the seating justified the upgrade. overall we found the experience disappointing. the seats were average the wifi was fine 10mb for free the entertainment system had a good variety of programs the food was ordinary and the service was indifferent on our return flight one of the stewardesss was incredibly rude although the ground staff in dubai were fantastic. this is the 5th time we have flown this route and have had far better experiences with other airlines singapore malaysian jal and saudi the cabin on the new airbus is lovely. comfortable bar and lounge area excellent seats with your own personal minibar. on these facilities i have no complaints. my disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof and i am afraid the ultimate criticism  it was no different to being in economy. on each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men despite waiting patiently i always had to ask. on an 8 hour evening flight i was told we dont hand these out on evening flights. the menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. but in reality there is no choice just like in economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. tray table is pulled out on the hour breakfast arrives 20 mins later coffee follows after 10 mins and the refill never came. within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. i could see post take off drinks being served but i was never offered one. it becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. i have often mocked the likes of virgin for their automated approach to customer service  but at least you all receive the same service it is not the luck of the draw. they are inefficient unorganised rude and left me in no doubt that i will never travel emirates business class again. after the long awaited flight to paris from sydney we settled in to our flight which included our two girls 5 and 8. the first flight was an early morning flight out of sydney and it soon became apparent i was going to be let down. the new a380 is not so new anymore the seats didnt work properly the plane as a whole looked tied. the food well for us it was just ok apart from the frozen salad but the kids food awful. absolutely terrible. now im not suggesting for a moment my kids arent picky when it comes to food but this was terrible. pasta that was cooked days ago and reheated. well they tried to reheat. it was either was frozen or cold. the bread was also terrible. the cabin crew on the first leg were great and up to paris also great but on the flight home from dubai to sydney. they werent interested. they basically bitched how tied they were for the entire trip. im back in london in october flying etihad lets hope for a better experience. would avoid flying with emirates if possible in future. too many members of staff that were rude. customer service staff poor in kuala lumper one senior member of staff even answered his mobile whilst talking to us without apologising. service inflight was slow and disorganised not enough childrens meals despite reserving beforehand. the only thing that impressed me was the limited wifi connection we had but wont be long before other flight operators offer this service. i really want to like emirates so much but the variable nature of their service just makes the love difficult to give. its the whole experience from check in at sydney the agent was very grumpy about my baggage being 4kgs over and did not like being told that as a qantas ff i was well within my allowance to onboard where the crew were nice but just lacked polish. its a case of emirates having expanded so swiftly that their staffing standards are haphazard. small things such as bags with linen from the crew rest area being dumped at the back of the main deck  just not a good look. emirates fly from sydney to where i need to get to globally but just make it difficult to love them. we left heathrow at 10.15pm due to arrive in dubai around 8am so this is an overnight flight as i see it. so i didnt understand the logic of serving us a full dinner an hour into the flight and then breakfast 2 hours before landing. the cabin lights only went off for about an hour between these times so overall it was almost impossible to sleep. when we checked in online we couple with toddler son were not given 3 seats together but the staff on the ground at lhr managed to talk someone into moving so we ended up together. service on board was okay but not up to the standards i have experienced in the past. overall though i cannot recommend this airline and flight for this route  if you are staying in dubai you have had no chance to sleep and therefore you are going to have to manage 2 days awake in a row and probably not have a chance to enjoy your day in dubai. boarding was fine but we were standing around with no info given as to why we werent moving. left 20 odd minutes late but flight time to melbourne was an hour short so that was good. emirates is a really good airline for flying with children. but overall i was underwhelmed with the service  indeed it seems to be getting worse each time i fly this airline. food delivery is a bit erratic in terms of timing and the steward serving hot drinks passed us by twice. going to auckland it was announced we were descending. we hadnt received nz arrival cards which are rather long to fill out so i asked a passing steward. he seemed surprised by the request and i pointed out that everyone else would need one too. so a few minutes later he came round with some  but nowhere near enough for everyone so he had to go back and get some more. then they got grumpy with us for having a tray table down to fill it out while we were in descent. this was really poor  surely handing out landing cards is a pretty basic function  they were handed out straight away going to melbourne. we had breakfast twice  just before landing in melbourne and again after taking off and it was pretty much the same both times. bad luck if you dont like mushrooms or baked beans. overall disappointing and if going to europe again i will look for other options. london heathrow to dxb in business class on the a380. if business class was purely about the comfort of seating and the layout i would give emirates 1010. however i witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. having flown qatar airways throughout the years even on a bahrain to dubai flight via doha i was accustomed to high standards of service. the service from the crew was a letdown. i asked for a fruit platter and i was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. i mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice. frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available which i think he assumed i forgot. each and every time i requested something i had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy.  i even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same. the food itself was not up to the exquisite taste we come to associate with this travel. obviously i would not know better because i was not able to try another statement dish. i have had better personal and quicker service in a380 economy where a crew is bound to serve more then 300400 passengers. i do think i would appreciate a more personal response and attention then a standard we are sorry to hear of your inconvenience and regret the same.  i am not going to risk that next trip unless i actually see an effort on part of the airline to make amends for its lackluster performance. this review is about leg 1 boston to dubai 16th august of my travel from boston to kochi india via dubai. i traveled with my 2 year old son who is in autusim spectrum. i had a car seat with me so that i can seat with some comfort. none of the crew members in the economy class knew how to fit the car seat in the airline seat. they kept saying that car seat fitting is responsibility of the passenger.  what kind of training they got not knowing how to do a simple task. their attitude was rude.   on our way to dubai they had the hardest time to get our boarding passes issued. after about an hour they figured out how to issue boarding passes. they still failed to issue boarding passes for both legs. we had to pick up dubaidhaka boarding passes at dubai. inflight service was not up to the mark flight attendants were not friendly and didnt seem to care much about customer satisfaction.  the hotel they provided in dubai was a bad one.  poor service with miserable staff. very poor individual monitor reception films kept sticking. very stingy with the drinks trolley soft drinks too. no snacks were given out. the towels handed out for cleaning your hands were bone dry. in all a poor experience and the staff did not seem to care and were simply going through the motions with a bad attitude. i first traveled with emirates in march 2015 with my 10 year old son to dubai. the business class service was appalling. the crew strutted around barely taking orders and being completely inept. they served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. they ended up losing my luggage on arrival such that i was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours. i decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us including my 10 year old and 5 year old flew from nyc to dubai and on to bombay in mid august returning 3 days ago. once again the service on board was completely disorganized. on boarding my 5 year old sons seatbelt had dried food all over it. i asked the steward to clean it and he handed me a warm towel and told me to do it myself. when i asked for my dessert to be given to my 5 year old instead of listening to me the stewardess said you only get oreo cookies as dessert with a childs economy meal. first off i had paid 4000 per ticket for our business class tickets so the concept of childs economy meal didnt arise. i will never fly them again. disgusting service with emirates. i am a rewards member and my flights were terrible. being bumped from our reserved seats on both our return trips even though my seats were confirmed. i complained on my first two flights and they assured me that my return flights were safe. well they werent. they bumped us again. i am disgusted at the emirates attitude. i wont fly with them again. choose a different carrier you will save yourself some grief. i flew emirates on ek11 from dubai to london gatwick on a full boeing 777300. the flight departed on time and after take off drinks and a small snack was served before lights were turned off. the seat back tv had lots of films and tv shows to watch. about 2.5 hours prior to landing a hot full breakfast was served. the 10 across seating makes the aisles very narrow a few airlines using this plane still have 9 seats across. cabin staff did their job but lacked smiles and any form of friendliness. overhead bins are meant for hand luggage so why do ek allow passengers to board with excessive cabin baggage i saw one passenger with a small wheelie suitcase two bags of duty free a backpack and large handbag and she used up two overhead bins. i saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers. the passenger seated next to me was one of the last to board and had nowhere to put his hand luggage. the cabin crew told him to put it under the seat in front of him so he had no leg room for the entire 7 hour flight. i changed my emirates flight to a late flight departing athens at 22.20 and arriving into dubai at 03.50 because there was first class offered on this extra service and according to my reservation the aircraft was a boeing 777lr with closed suites. the morning of my departure i was disappointed to find that the aircraft had been changed to an a330 with only sleeper seats. i have never traveled on an emirates a330 so i had no idea what the seats would be like. on boarding the aircraft i was horrified to find that the seats were not even angle lie flat seats in fact the seats could hardly recline more than a business class seat on a domestic route. whilst i understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route how emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what i expect when paying a first class fare. on top of that whilst there was many empty gates on arrival at dxb we were places on a stand far away from the terminal. again another sign that emirates have no consideration for the comfort of their passengers. london heathrow to guangzhou via dubai return on emirates. london to dubai on an a380 plane quite full food was reasonable but trays are now smaller so portions smaller. cabin crew went through the motions efficient but strange that drinks followed meal and not served before or with any haste. dubai to guangzhou on a boeing 777  plane virtually full seat comfort not as good seats narrow and 3x4x3 layout. cabin crew efficient but hardly a smile. flight on time  but beware of guangzhou airport its very slow to get through large queues. inbound from guangzhou to dubai 5 days later on boeing 777 an older aircraft again very full. similar hard narrow seat cabin crew seemed more interested in preening hair and chatting to each other than dealing with passengers. food quite good a better menu. dubai to london on the a380  on time cabin crew served a continental breakfast that was very small and unappetising. lunch followed later  on the menu it looked good but it was quite poor. bangkok to birmingham via dubai with emirates. i have been using emirates for the past 10 years and the service has gone downhill. the positives are a great entertainment system good prices if the flight is booked at the right time but thats about it. nowadays the meals have been scaled down and they must be using a cheap supplier as they have gone downhill on the culinary front   none of the meals that i have had over the past couple of years have been very nice especially when you compare the economy cabin food of singapore and malaysia airlines both of whom were excellent. i also find that it depends on the crew if you get attention on your flight  on this flight both legs the crews were not at all interested in the passengers no water runs were made you had to ring continuously for drinks and then you were served by a surly crew. i was excited to be flying emirates a380 business class for the first time. chauffeur service top notch. seats welldesigned but the film choice was poor. the onboard service was appalling. the problem being that there are so many people in business class in the upper deck of the 380 that the logistics of meal and drinks service go up the creek. added to which the stewardsstewardesses act like automatons with no common sense and often poor or no english. one example of cockeyed service is that my wife and i were sitting next to each other but service came from different aisles so she might be waiting patiently for her soup while i am waiting less patiently for my pudding. and her wine steward wasnt permitted to fill up my glass and my aisle wine dispenser appeared 40 minutes later. seemingly the only way to beat the system is to go to the bar at the back of the section but that would have requires all sorts of seat contortions. on a 7 hour evening flight you expect to get some decent sleep but there isnt enough sleep time when the airlines gambit is to stretch out drinks and dinner unendingly. not a success for the airline which is sad. will not go emirates again certainly not on the evening flight. flight from adelaide to dubai on 16 august would have to be one of the worst flights i have taken. the cabin crew were disinterested and disorganised. seats are very uncomfortable and leg room is almost non existent. the food was the worst food i have encountered on an airline. they did asked if you would like a drink but you would have to ask exactly what was on offer as no more information was forthcoming. the worst part was the lack of water being offered on board. they came around twice to offer a cup of water and i found that i became very dehydrated. even though there is a water cooler near the toilets which i didnt know about at the time it was almost impossible to get out of my seat as i was in the middle and my companion was asleep. one good thing was the ice entertainment system. lots of movies etc which helped get through this flight. my wife and i heard a lot about emirates new planes incredible service and even chauffer ride. we decided to try it on our vacation as there was a nonstop flight jfk to milan. the van was on time and the fact that the driver farted did not break our high spirits. it was not too hot and an opened widow saved us. at jfk they did not have a separate line for business class or global access and it took us more time than anticipated to get through. the lounge was calm clean fresh air great selection of food and premium drinks. on board we were greeted with veuve clicquot and a selection of juices. my wife asked for different juice and it was produced in seconds. the plane looked new with a lot of gadgets. stewards were very nice and friendly and were only interested in servicing us even better. we were offered a great selection of premium drinks and very good wines. the dinner meals selection was also good served hot and delicious like at very good manhattan restaurant. after dinner the beds were made with mattresses and we had a good rest. in the morning we had a great breakfast. on exit the chauffer was already waiting and the ride to milan was very nice. all our expectation were exceeded. on the way back there was a separate line for business class and it took us minuets to get to the lounge where again there was a great selection of tasty food and premium drinks waiting for us. a nice touch the gate was inside the lounge and it took us few steps to get to our seats. i told my wife that i would rather fly emirates with a layover in dubai than a direct to europe with another airline. on the plane we were greeted with a great selection of orange juice only and when i asked for cranberry had a beaming smile as an answer and stewardess left. next time we saw her taking drink orders. i asked what scotch they had but she did not know what i meant. i asked for whiskey and she offered john daniels without alternatives. i decided to try something new and was rewarded with johnny walker i think by taste. contrary to our first experience to see a stewardess we had to call and wait for awhile and she always came giving the impression that we drew her away from something important. for dinner we had a selection of two wines red and white and she did not know what a wine card was. but she promised that her colleague will come to help me which never happened. i cant say speak to food quality because she brought somebody elses order and i did not have a chance to get mine. no beds. for breakfast i ordered hot beef sandwich which was served deadly cold. when i asked to warm it  beaming smile and it disappeared forever. we had the imprudence to check my suit in shortly before the final descent my wife and i asked for it five times but tough luck i got it when all people were clearing the plane and had to change in the airport bathroom. we were out a bit early and did not find our chauffer at the exit area. we waited for about 30 minutes until i found the emirates desk where we were told that my ride is waiting for me outside terminal and around the corner. on the way back we left the highway and stopped as chauffer needed to use the bathroom which to be honest was better than farting. we can take any airline anywhere but we dont pay a premium for the flight we pay it for a service. at home my wife asked emirates again and we laughed. i love the emirates a380.  i have been flying emirates since 2010 2 flights per year and i have to say that this is probably one of the most stressful ones as of yet. i was transiting via dubai with emirates and we left doha quite late and had to literally run to our gate. we had to be escorted by ground staff just for us to make our next flight. i got to the gate and i was probably one of the last few to get on which was a relief. i go on really short 5day holidays and my schedule is pretty lean. not making it to a flight will probably ruin my itinerary a whole lot. anyway when i got to the plane it was quite hectic. dxbhkg is always mad ive been flying this route regularly for the past couple of years and its pretty busy. the staff was not as courteous as before. seats are standard but mine would not recline. not sure if the seat was faulty or the passenger behind me just had really long legs. i have to comment on how the cabin crew looked really exhausted and worn out and we had not even left yet uniforms all wrinkled and presence was just sending out vibes of tiredness. we expected a lot from emirates but were unfortunately a little disappointed on our flight from bangkok to venice via dubai. the crew on the plane was quite unorganised. the meals were mixed up. we ordered two childrens menus and two special meals and we were lucky enough our meals were not mixed but our neighbors did not get the special meals they ordered. the staff apologised however this is not what you would expect from emirates. other children on the flight got the toys but they forgot our children both 5 years old and they were very disappointed. afterwards we had to ask stewardess to please give them something  so later they received the entertainment set. we were quite disappointed with crew services. the entertainment system was excellent the variety of movies music you could choose. wifi was payable. customer service is really lacking on emirates. the food in the main cabin was awful dry and tasteless. the stewards are not very courteous either leaving another bad taste in your mouth. on the flight to bangkok i tried to purchase two duty free items but was denied when i produced my drivers license and credit card. according to the steward he could not sell the item to me unless i signed my card. i told him that for safety reasons i do not sign the card and this is a very antiquated rule since the cards now carry a chip. the 3 stewards made quite a scene because i refused to sign my card. after a while i simply asked them to leave me alone and reminded them that this is not a necessity. they all left mumbling to each other. on my return flight from bkk i showed up at the airport with 2 pieces of checked baggage. the staff at the counter told me i was only entitled to one bag and i would have to pay for the other. of course i said no problem expecting a reasonable price. to my surprise the representative quoted me over 22000 bht for the bag. i told her i was only checking an extra bag and not an extra person. she explained that according to my ticket i have to pay by the kilo per bag. still in shock i asked to talk to the manager who was not in any way helpful. when i first travelled emirates over 5 years ago i could not sing their praises enough. however i have just returned from munich having one of the worst experiences ever. after moving seats because my entertainment screen did not work i was seated in one of the two remaining empty seats. i was seated in 48j between two obese travellers and a young woman. as the obese lady needed 1.25 seats it was 12 hours of hell. the food trays were left for an hour which made it impossible to go to the bathroom or move around. window shades were left open when it was sleep time when i asked an attendant to request it to be closed i was informed sorry the man is asleep. if a plane is going to be 100 full may i suggest they put on the amount of staff required to service the customers. on the first leg of my journey it was 45 mins before i got a glass of water i rang the bell but no one replied. i was next to the window and man next to me had all his computer gear large laptop because his entertainment system did not work. at the last leg of my journey waiting to use the bathroom for a good ten minutes it was opened by an attendant who removed the garbage bags so i could use it. waste was overflowing in the restrooms. the worst was being locked into my seat by food trays left for what seemed forever. the last experience i had like this was with a quantas flight to hong kong at least they apologised and explained that they were on staff member down. when are airlines going to realise that economy flyers are their bread and butter and we have a voice. i would rather pay another 15 and be treated as a guest and not an inconvenience. emirates cancelled our flight without warning. we found out as we approached the counter at the airport to check in. the staff was rude and dismissive and the airport staff had zero direction as if they have never experienced a cancelled flight. they refused to refund our prepaid hotel and travel costs in italy suggesting we inquire with the credit card co. we booked with. the service was aggressive and bizarre. do they abuse their staffers into compliance a bad experience lesson learned cheap flights on a bad airline just not worth it. will definitely not be flying them again anytime soon. i flew emirates from dubai to karachi. when i had online checkedin emirates had changed the aircraft without informing passengers on their cell no and emails and our seats was different rather then original one allocated. also the cabin crew was robotic and not smiling. please when you change aircraft kindly inform passengers. frankfurt to sydney via dubai. from the disinterested cabin crew faulty entertainment system lack of refreshments to the flight delays we do not have a good word to say about emirates. transiting through dubai is a nightmare. overpriced food desperately needed as so litte food is served on board and undrinkable coffee and half hour long queues for the filthy toilets. toilets onboard the aircraft were not cleaned and as the flight progressed more of them became out of order. in over 20 hours of flying tea and coffee was served twice. when i asked for a cup of tea i was advised they didnt have any cups. all in all a nightmare trip. we were looking forward our emirates experience a lot since i heard so many things about that company. we flew 4 sectors within 3 weeks with them and  the checkin on all airports used was smooth and didnt take us long even though we were economy passengers. aircraft were average typical boeing 777 but i could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors so seating was ok. i was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines the performance was just average. the inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. on all 4 sectors only one meal was served not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. emirates competitor on flights to dubai does a lot more with less crew. duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again. so why does emirate put so much crew in the cabin if they dont have to work during the flight.  i have to say that the tickets were quite cheap but others who paid more probably had the same experience. i did 4 flights with emirates over a 3 week period and on each trip there was issues. seats and entertainment was fine with no issues. service and food horrendous. cabin crew were rude and only thing they where interested in was how quickly they could dish the meals out. have put a complaint in with emirates due to a member of staff pushing my fiancé out the way when letting another passanger sit down. on the way home even though sitting next to the cabin crew station they wouldnt answer the cabin crew service button so i could buy duty free. also having to listen to the lead cabin crew staff member tell off her staff was a joke. avoid if you can. ground staff at lisbon were polite and good natured but they couldnt for some reason check me for the 2nd leg of my flight from dubai to sydney despite trying for sometime and in the end i told them id sort it in dubai  in hindsight a mistake. the flight was pleasant enough although as this is emirates youll have to endure arabic subtitles over your movies. im not sure why as an international airline they dont offer non subtitled option. arrived at dubai and no information about my next flight anywhere. lined up at emirates customer service only to be told by a very rude and disinterested customer rep to go to customer service next door and then waved away. everyone has a bad day so let it go thanked her and went next door. next customer service rep was the same told me to catch the train and waved me away. walked away feeling a little a bit annoyed at emirates for not being just a little more polite.  i then had to cross security twice in queues to finally get to a qantas desk. got there to be greeted by a fairly happy and polite rep who handed me my boarding pass with an upgrade to business.  excellent or so i thought  i spent the next 6 hours waiting for the flight even made arrangements to take my kids first thing in the morning when i land due to being fresh at the other end. got to the boarding gate in the lounge made to wait 15 minutes as the rep was late to be bumped back down to premium economy by a rude emirates rep didnt properly click what was going on until i got to the door of the aircraft where i approached the qantas cabin crew. the first girl was disinterested nonempathetic and in the end i had to walk away from her. in the end i got to talk to a cabin supervisor and after being questioned by one of his peers insinuating that maybe id made up the story might not have been the intention but perception is reality especially after only a couple of hours sleep. i was told that 3 people were mistakenly upgraded and that the lisbon emirates ground staff shouldnt have upgraded me. i briefly explained that they had nothing to do with it. so i was stuck where i was  i guess you get what you pay for. i was a platinum ff for 56 years now im just a gold its amazing how differently you get treated.  geneva to singapore via dubai and emirates was a cheaper option for this flight and seemed more convinient in terms of stop over time and departurearrival times. not only the price was cheap meals served onboard were poor quality. the outbound flight from dubai to singapore was a nightmare the plane was completely full and seating very bad very little room. tried to forget about the inconvenience by watching ridiculously censored films but arrived exhausted from sitting in a cramped position for many hours. staff seemed more interested in chatting to each other than attending to passengers although they were not directly unfriendly. the first leg of my flight amsterdam to dubai was excellent. i cant say the same about the dubai to sydney flight. nearly for two hours after departure that was late  at 1245 there was nothing served but the forms that was needed only at the sydney airport. no water no refreshment nothing at all. most of the passengers were transferring being after another flight tired hungry and thirsty. many children were on the flight too. everybody just wanted to have some meal something to drink as soon as possible and then sleep. but we had to wait for a long time for it to happen. even when eventually the crew started serving it was very slow and unprofessional. they accidentally splashed drinks over passengers pushed them without even apologising.  i will not recommend emirates.  dallas to dubai return in october 2015 with emirates were the worst flights i have been on. seats were cramped poor service filthy bathrooms and crying children during the entire flight. had great hopes that this airline would be exceptional and it was exceptionally bad. emirates from singapore to gatwick via dubai. very full flights on all legs. both legs delayed. found seats had little lumber support and narrow which after spending 17 hours in them both my husband and i were  in pain. food was poor ordered vegetarian and got given vegan on the way out so had to call emirates to change this for this leg. husband had chicken which was ok but why serve gravy on a full flight with no elbow room equally spaghetti with tomato sauce constant passenger announcements disturbed inflight entertainment which was very irritating and very loud in the earphones. overall disappointed with comfort promptness of schedule and noise levels on plane. emirates service was not up to standard. the cabin crew was like newly trained and not professional. i was travelling with wife and one 10 month old son. could not use the inflight entertainment system due to bassinet seat installed in front of me for my son. why do they provide menu cards when they dont have all the food available all the time. my seat was 56jk. and air hostess always skip these seats which is next to kitchen and they would start from the seat right behind ours. they provided food and did not bother to pick up trays for at least 45 minutes  many people end up going themselves to kitchen and put the trays back. during the flight they never offered tea or coffee to us. emirates used to be 1010 airline but as they secure more routes the service is getting worse. they are often late these days and i now leave at least a 4 hour gap to make sure i make the next flight in dubai. for the latest flight from manila to dubai they forgot that there is heavy traffic on a friday night and the crew arrived over 2 hours late  if all the passengers can get to the airport on time then why cant the crew what is so bad is that the ground staff lied about the situation when they told the economy passengers the aircraft needed more cleaning but told the business class passengers the truth. there is no doubt that emirates is undergoing a decline in service. i was able to choose my seats for all four sectors on the round trip. im not a big man so economy seating rarely presents me with a problem and for me the available legroom was fine regardless of aircraft type. the a380 was a cut above the others in terms of comfort and quietness though but the service was a little wooden and certainly slow but the food was not bad at all. service was slightly better on the dxbsgn return legs food reasonable but nothing to write home about. one thing i wish emirates would move away from is the overcrowded serving tray or at least change the shape of it a square tray balanced on a rectangular seat table is not a great fit. entertainment was good except for the boeing 777 leg limited choices and poor picture quality so slept read listened to music on that one. certainly not the greatest service onboard but adequate nothing that would stop me flying with them again certainly for the value for money i get and the convenience from my perspective at least of the flight times. dubai t3 is another story altogether though ive flown this route a few times now and it remains the worst part of the journey for me. its not the two to three hour stopover i quite welcome the chance to get out stretch wash and change clothes but the building itself  i find it poorly signposted and just so busy and bustling i struggle to relax there. would certainly use them again. we were planning a trip to perth to see our daughter tragically my wife fell ill diagnosed terminal within a few days. just a few weeks later on the day the flight was leaving after an emirates flight reminder she died in just 7 short weeks. during her illness i tried to cancel the flight and use the money to fly my daughter back. although i thought i had purchased one return ticket with one set of conditions that allowed cancellation the return flight unknown to me had its own set of conditions that precluded any refund. after many emails and phone calls i was not able to cancel the flight and get a refund. after family help with no help from emirates we got enough money together get my daughter home tragically too late. during that time emirates thanked me for my understanding and refused to help quoting terms and conditions of the return ticket and refused to consider changing a ticket to allow my daughter to fly back. they would retain my money and provide no help. during my wifes illness macmillan cancer support contacted emirates on several occasions and attempted to help get my daughter home using the tickets or a refund on the purchased tickets. the same reply was given to macmillan cancer support as was given to me despite them talking to senior staff. emirates final email thanked me for my understanding in these difficult times saying they could do nothing to help. macmillan cancer support wrote to emirates to express their concerns over the lack of compassion and support todate there has been no reply. if you fly with emirates pray you will not need their help because they will thank you for your understanding and take your money and leave you alone to sort it out. newcastle to dubai return.the food on board was virtually inedible and we were offered one drink on a 7.5 hour flight. the staff were unhelpful and if a question was asked or a request made the look you received was painful.  the flight to dubai was exactly the same. this this was my first time in this region. i felt the people in the uae were so friendly and helpful and dubai is spotlessly clean our only real disappointment was emirates. the captain announced that there were eleven cabin staff on the plane  what were they doing one girl was kind and had a smile. she even admitted to us that she didnt and wouldnt eat the meals on board.  i had an elderly parent in business class and he fared little better apparently. we had approximately forty minutes waiting on luggage whilst there was no other plane landed at newcastle competing for resources. this may be an issue with the airport but worth mentioning as indicative of the poor service we received.  a380 excellent aircraft. awful emirates service. i had high expectations of flying on this aircraft back to london from dubai. the flight was 3 hours delayed with the only explanation being that there was technical difficulties. unless you travel by business class or first class you are treated like cattle and hearded on to the plane as such. once onboard it doesnt get any better in cattle class. requests for anything like an extra blanket because it was so cold are dismissed and you are left wondering if they misunderstood you or just chose to dismiss your request. i chose to fly emirates only because of the a380 but if i knew the staff were going to be so rude i wouldnt have bothered. next time ill read the airline reviews before deciding how to travel. one good point about the aircraft is the internet access i can write this review while im on the flight. jfk to karachi via dubai. emirates was the best airline to travel once upon a time. missed my flight connection due to delay by the airline. close to 300 passengers with similar issues greeted by 2 people on the counter. after complaining the staff called security who threatened the passengers for taking away their passport as if they have any legal right to do so. they also told passengers not to make any noise. in addition the last time i have checked in to emirates at jfk i have been asked to place my hand carry so they can weigh it no word of getting late how are you welcome nothing. end result  5 hours later 6 more hours lay over 15 meal voucher. this is unacceptable. london to kuala lumpur via dubai with emirates. inflight entertainment was wonderful with many selections to choose from. food was rather okay too considering i ordered a gluten free meal. the seat was hard to sleep in and the cabin was sometimes too cold. i needed to use a couple of blankets on these flights as it was just too cold. service was below average. asked for orange juice and water twice from two different cabin crew but it never showed up. i had to go to the galley myself to take the drinks because no one attended to my call. very poor service on our emirates flight dubai to gatwick ek009 as was flight out to dubai on 3rd november ek012. having flown with emirates once or twice a year for a number of years i am seriously considering using another carrier. drinks that are supposed to be part of the flight cost were not forthcoming the meal service was poor blankets collected even though plane was cold. worth pointing out that the flight on the 17th november was barely half full in economy. singapore to chicago via dubai with emirates. the crew were impatient and demanded to take away all the blankets 45mins prior to landing. passengers were rudely awaken from their sleep during this freezing red eye flight and had blankets taken away. the crew then proceeded to collect all headsets in a very rude manner. i assume all these is to help turn around the aircraft quicker but this results in a very horrible flying experience. not to mention the food is also cold and of poor quality. i have had experience with many other airlines around the world and this is certainly the worst service and worst food ever. i will never take emirates again. for similar value i would choose qatar airways. delhi to melbourne via dubai. check in good and fast and the delhi lounge not bad. flight out of delhi was delayed and cancelled due to technical reasons. delhi airport staff do not know how to handle a crisis. passengers were left high and dry. hotels andor comfort was not provided to passengers in a reasonable manner. replacement flight ek8515 left delhi 20 hrs later. crew on the replacement flight pretty bad. food on board emirates flights is very poor now. ek406 to mel. flight departed and arrived on time. ife not bad. wifi advertised was slow and bad. bottom line is that emirates is suffering from over expansion. the airline has lost common grip and basics of customer care. being a gold member with ek i am looking elsewhere now. this is my 6th business class trip this year with emirates. checking was done in melbourne by qantas all went smoothly. the ek lounge in sydney is a nice and cosy. great food and service. boarding the flight was a nightmare there was no priority lane in place it was a dogs breakfast. i have never encountered that before on any airlines. after take off we were given mattresses straight away  how about asking priority passengers what they would like to drink after take off and what their meal requests would be that was a first. the crew always give the mattresses after dining. just very strange and not logical. i was seating in 7k which was located at the very front section of the business class. after a long 1h30 we were given our departure drink and cold nuts then asked to chose our dinner. no wine request was offered with the meal we had to ask for it. ive asked for my cheese platter to be served after i finish my main meal. i got my starter the chicken roulade and salad  i had to send back my meal the whole food that i just got was far too chilled. there were pieces of ice on the salad and the chicken i just couldnt believe what was served on my plate.  no coffee or tea were offered to my section no refill of our drinks or bread and i never got my cheese platter. by that stage ive had enough. 2 hours before landing ive ordered a lite bites waited only 5 minutes which i thought was pretty amazing considering during the flight ive had to press the call button 34 times to get some water then asked for a big bottle therefore i was sure to have the water when i needed it and without disrupting the crew well my snack was cold so i had to send it back again the crew who were designated to look after my section really failed on that flight they were non existent during the flight didnt care one bit about their passengers. im starting to get very annoyed with emirates every time its a win or a miss but over my 6 business trips this year it has been a miss. \\r\\r\\n melbourne to rome via kuala lumpur & dubai. my husband and i booked a trip to italy with our two young children. the flight is around 21 hrs not including transfers & upon recommendations from several friends we decided to travel with emirates. i do not have one good thing to say about them we experienced every familys worst fears about international plane travel with everything from poor slow service judgemental staff pathetic kids meals the kids were served spaghetti bolognaise on 56 flights rude staff refusing to give the kids their complimentary toy which we had to beg for and to top it all off we had all been separated on one flight despite booking our seats online. my four year old son and seven year old daughter were sitting 10 and 15 rows away from myself with my husband sitting another 7 rows behind me all up we were spread right through the economy cabin and noone wanted to help us each blaming the next point of transfer as the responsible party. originally i made an online complaint to emirates while on holiday hoping at the bare minimum theyd be able to offer some palatable food to our children inflight. the response i got as well as being ridiculously late and outside the timeframe given was pathetic suggesting i should just bring my own food in future with no useful advice or empathy shown emirates has been my worst flight experience ever i am a rather experienced traveller having flown with at least 15 different airlines and never have i been so dismally disappointed. i will never fly with emirates again. manchester to bangkok via dubai and was really disappointed with emirates. the onboard service was slow and appeared disorganised. we were 2 hours into the flight before we were offered a drink and even then the stewardess seemed uninterested. the food was bland and repetitive. there were two options with one always being chicken. there was never enough of the second meal choice option. the seating was comfortable with good legroom. entertainment was okay but the same on each connecting flight. some screens also failed on the plane causing complaints. on a whole an average experience for the price.  i travelled on emirates with my wife and 2 month old baby from london to lahore via dubai return. our bassinet seats were changed on all flights apart from heathrow to dubai despite having reserved and requested bassinet seats. the staff attitude was terrible as our seats were changed at dubai and they just would not give me a reason despite asking on a number of occasions to why they have changed our seats upon checking my reserved seats once boarded only to discover another couple with a child sitting in our reserved seats. on return flight from dubai to london we were told a number of times we had got my bassinet seats as reserved even up until the point we was boarding. when we boarded the plane we had recieved seats 1 behind the bassinet seats   so i complained and nothing was done about it. however  a nice passenger in one of the bassinet seats gave his up so my wife could sit there with the baby he and many others around could not understand why we had been changed and people not needing bassinet seats given them. i have flown with emirates for many years but this was by far the worst trip ever in terms of staff attitude and making this journey more difficult than needed be especially whilst traveling with a 2 month old baby. i wont travel with emirates again after this journey.  we choose emirates from cdg to pvg via dxb because of the cheap price and it had been recommended to us. however i did not really enjoy this experience. the food is some of the best in economy class. but the ife screen needs improvements as it is not as clear as some other airlines. the cabin crew service from dubai to shanghai was rude and impatient. furthermore the seat was not that comfortable the space was acceptable but the quality of the seat was poor  the headrest was made of the same material as the lazyback instead of artificial leather so if you put you head on it for a long time you hair would stick to the headrest. overall a soso flight.  the flight from brisbane to singapore was very good. friendly and helpful staff. we had an annoying 75 minute stop in singapore with a change of crew before the flight to dubai. the whole demeanour of things changed. the new crew members on the whole seemed rude and abrupt. a young woman travelling on her own was not allowed a bassinet for her young child whereas she had experienced no problems brisbane to singapore. i took up the advocates role but to no avail. i asked to speak with the purser but was brushed off. i do not intend flying emirates again once this holiday is over. heathrow to mauritius via dubai with emirates. very good seat space for 2 travellers together tv screen large with plenty of choices. very indifferent service all four flights. some crew really did not want to be working. im an easy premium passenger  if its night time and after about 10pm then i want to board and get ready to sleep which should be easy on a 7 hour flight from london. mumbai to new york jfk via dubai. every time i fly with emirates their service seems to be on a decline. dubai to new york their meal service was horrible. they provided a menu which they usually do with 3 options. however the vegetarian option in the menu both breakfast and lunch was available only for those who had pre selected meal preferences. not sure how it makes sense to include something in the menu when it is not really available for selection. secondly their flights are freezing cold and flight attendants always seem to be in a hurry to collect blankets. on one leg of the journey they collected blankets one hour prior to landing in a freezing flight. not a pleasant flying experience overall and not worth the cost of tickets. manchester to sydney via dubai. first time using emirates and very disappointed with the lack of communication requests were ignored and very cold aircraft. service was poor haphazard when serving food and drinks trays left on tables. children allowed to run up and down the aisles even when the seat belt signs switched on and the crew didnt seem to care. ran out of toilet paper in the lavatories reported but nothing done. ek407 aklmel. check in busy due to 3x ek a380 leaving within an hour to syd mel and bne. however was processed fast. lounge very busy due to the number of pax. boarded on time. flight departed on time. again i say this. ek crew quality has come down a lot. most of them just seem to be there for glamour and stand around like robots. ife good. food very bad. arrived on time. bags out on time. good value for money based on price paid. would i go out of the way to fly even though i am a gold member. no i will think twice. flew emirates dxbman 0712 afternoon flight on the a380. on boarding the aircraft we were greeted by miserable cabin crew so got the feeling it wasnt going to be a great flight and we were correct. the flight took off on time and it was a full flight so knew the service would be slow but waiting 90 minutes after take off for any refreshment is poor by emirates standards. no pre dinner drink just the food and then another wait for drinks. crew were surly and clearly didnt want to be at work that day. asked for another drink to be grunted at by the stewardess who moaned she would have to write my drink down as a few people were asking. if they had been pro active and commenced a drinks service before the food maybe people wouldnt be asking for another drink so soon after the meal. cabin crew then disappeared and not offered anything else until 2 hours before landing when they came round with afternoon tea. a very small sandwich and a tiny scone. the aircraft was immaculate as it was only 3 months old. flight landed 40 minutes early. i would fly emirates again but would avoid the a380 where possible. i have been traveling emirates since 2005 and have found that the inflight service has been going downhill over the past 2 years. on 9th december i flew from mumbai to dar es salaam via dubai. i was extremely disappointed with the staff attitude. i found that the table was dirty and had food and teacoffee stains on it. i brought this to the attention of the staff and they were completely indifferent towards it. they gave me a wet tissue and asked me to clean it myself. on my next flight from dubai to dar es salaam my vegetarian meal was given away to another passenger. dubai to orlando seat 37k paid aed8045 for my ticket. emirates 16 hour flight  inadequate feeding arrangements i plan to pack a snack pack on the return flight from orlando. meal served soon after take off was satisfactory. then pizza soon after which i declined because i wasnt hungry. 4 hours before landing i requested a piece of fruit or a dry cracker the menu suggested that these snacks are available between meals. i was told that there was nothing left everything has been demolished i was told by a steward. whilst i understand the limitations of food on board i would expect something small to snack on for a flight of this length. eventually after saying how astounded i was one of the stewards said they knew where a stash could be found why was it not readily available anyway he gave me two small packets. worse still every cup of coffee i had was lukewarm so i asked for tea that was worse it looked like dish water the colour was not tea the icing on the cake i asked for a drink of fruit juice an hour and a half before landing and the steward said there was none available because it was all packed away i am astounded and disgusted. bangkok to sydney with emirates. the service was robotic at best. the seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip and legroom was barely enough. the food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland. for a company that prides themselves on quality of food and service they should share that experience with the entire plane not just business class.  the free wifi was a bonus but at 10mb was hardly enough in the age of smartphones. auckland to newcastle via dubai and i was very disappointed with the service. they had run out of food options so we only had one choice the staff were unhelpful. my coffee fell off my tray onto my seat i told the stewardess and she handed me five napkins and walked away. i asked her for another blanket and she never returned so i asked another stewardess and she walked away. i thought she was coming back so i was reluctant to fall asleep i sat on my soaked blanket to soak up the coffee on the chair. half an hour later she didnt return so i had to ask a third member of the crew. the crew were rude about getting the trolleys past us and when they hit a mans foot they didnt apologise. they looked stressed and annoyed during the flight safety announcement. when they brought round the warm towels the stewardess handed one to the person next to me then noticed she had none left to give me. she said oh and walked away. when another steward came to collect our towels i said i never received one and he frowned looked around and walked away. i wasnt spoken to again. halfway through the flight an alarm went off and a yellow light flashed the stewardesses asked each other what does that mean. i pointed to the screen by the toilets where it said smoke detected. they swore and ran off and came back later to announce it was just someones deodorant.  finally we were delayed for an hour when leaving dubai and were not informed why or spoken to we just watched the flight safety video and an hour later we suddenly took off.  the londondubai leg was great because we got an emirates a380 and it was generally a comfortable experience with minimal bumps. the service was also exceptional with the attendants appearing warm and friendly while the food was decent. the leg from dubai to kuala lumpur was a whole different story. the plane felt old and gaudy. for 4 hours of a 6 hour journey we were subjected to so much turbulence that it made it terribly difficult to do anything. nobody could go to the bathroom too and so i spent 4 hours having to hold my bladder in. the passengers lose all sense of comfort and peace of mind when we have to experience a heavily bumpy journey for a protracted period of time. i was assigned seat 21h due to its accessibility to the bathroom. if anyone chooses this seat i promise you that you would be subjected to peoples butts brushing against your arm for the entire flight. ive had the flight attendants rush past me hitting my arm repeatedly without ever apologizing.  they would grab your food trays without asking too. the attendants on the a380 were much more polite and pleasant.  their airline ranking must have gone to their heads.  nightmare emirates flight from dubai to london. we were on our 2nd leg of our journey from sri lanka to uk on 5th january. first the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 5.00. then 45 mins into the flight we were informed by the captain that there was a problem with the undercarriage and we would be turning back to dubai. after dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in dubai we landed back in dubai at 9.00pm. then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a hotel. it was taking for ever. after collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. it was utter chaos children were crying there were a lot of very tired passengers. finally after a very long time and the management woke up to the crisis they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers which we took up. i am totally shocked at the emirates response to this incident. no regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. they had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the hotels and transport for the passengers. yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude. will certainly be thinking twice before booking emirates again rome to jakarta via dubai with emirates and terrible inflight service. was calling for a flight attendant to help pull the screen from the side of my seat and had to wait for at least 30 minutes before one showed up and that was for the inflight meal service. then she just stared at me and did not move a muscle until i requested her to help pull out the tv screen. without waiting for any of us to pull out our tray table the flight attendant just distributed the lunch trays and they were on our laps. terrible despite asking for an aisle seat for both legs of my journey i got a middle seat for the second leg of my journey. the ground crew behind the counter failed to tell me that i will get a middle seat as perhaps no other aisle seats were available. food was soso compared to a few other airlines i have taken over the years. overall i was quite disappointed with my experience which happens to be my first time with emirates. i have now flown return from perth to london heathrow via dubai with emirates on two separate occasions and each trip has been poor. my expectations had been high which is perhaps why each trip has been a disappointment. i have encountered long delays in flight departures waiting on the tarmac on at least half of the legs flown as flights seem to seldom leave on time. the cabin staff are unfriendly and the entertainment selection is the worst i have encountered. you are hard pushed to find a film title you even recognize in the list of new releases. on two occasions my meal choice has been unavailable despite being seating fairly close to the start of service and obtaining a drink water not alcohol outside of the allocated service times is as if you have asked for the moon on a stick. meal quality is however pretty good. seats are generally comfortable and provide ample space for a long haul flight. i have only flown emirates as qantas does not operate its own flights out of perth and i wish to maximize my qff benefits by flying on a code share flight. london to brisbane return via dubai with emirates and our journey was the worst i have had. the crew were not service oriented and were rude  we waited 2.5 hours before we were offered water or a drink. i had stewardesses telling me no and i am too busy so many times. the crew gave the impression that they would rather be anywhere other than serving on that aircraft. do not bother complaining  they seem to have no customer service team but an email that will give you a generated standard reply. when i did more digging and calling they admitted that they do not have a phone number or a team that i could speak to. mauritius to dusseldorf via dubai. the advantage of emirates are quite modern aircraft with spacious seats and attractive pricing for business class. the disadvantage is that youll have an extra stopover at dubai. it looks like that emirates puts more emphasis on languages spoken onboard by its crew than the quality of their job performance. on two out of four flights on this vacation i found that the crew assigned to my section were very professional. the other two flights the crew were sloppy or inadequately trained. on one flight i had to move to another seat because the headrest was broken. i am quite tall person and therefore a headrest that is so loose that it immediately drops to the lowest position is not acceptable for me. when moving to an empty seat a stewardess told me that she had received several reports of seat problems on that flight. because of the quality of the customer service of emirates my overall rating is low. it took one week to get a standard answer to one of the two issues i reported. this standard answer was obvious not applicable to my situation. i then asked for a relevant answer on both issue but after an month i havent received any answer at all. especially for business and first class passengers i would have expected a functioning customer service department. toronto to dubai and i always fly on emirates and everything is great except the attitude of cabin crew. i have a 4 year old and we book his meal in advance  on this very last flight my food was served and his was nowhere to be found. i talked to three different cabin staff until one finally brought the tray for him the crew looks at you and says yes but then they disappear so you have to ask another crew member  and if you are lucky the third or the fourth one will finally get you what you want its such a shame that inflight service is mirroring so bad on the airline. yes the flights are long and you get tired but you know this when you apply for this job. i enjoy the ife food is ok seats are fine planes are safe but my only complain is the cabin staff attitude and the way they treat the passengers i hope someone from emirates looks into this issue paris cdg to dubai with emirates. the chauffer transfer worked well the lounge was good and i enjoyed the ife. that is where the positives end. check in was slow and did not feel i was warmly greeted. greeting on the plane was neither warm or genuine compared with singapore airlines. the cabin crew did not engage and would not make eye contact when walking past. had to make up my own bed. food was average and not the best wine selection. overall this was not a premium experience. bangkok to sydney with emirates. the check in was good. lounge was okay if very full and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airlinededicated lounge. the food and drink adequateabove average for a small lounge. boarding was prompt but only because i ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. i was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the business passengers in the long missed priority boarding which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through business. onboard the business cabin felt cramped. the 232 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. there is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. the overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so i had to use another. virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my average sized shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. ife selection was adequate. screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle so in a d seat such as mine i could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you  but has started it earlier. complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. i found the seat uncomfortable. poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. very limited position options. the seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down i could not stretch out fully  and i am 175cm5ft 9 inches tall. for me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone i would not normally fly emirates. the power port is recessed so that it cannot take an ipad or macbook charger as there is insufficient room. service was slow an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. it was ok but no more than that. the table is a good size and presentation was good. service generally was not great. i asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. similarly i asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. the complimentary bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles  but no earplugs there were only two toilets for 42 passengers. definitely insufficient it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. the flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. flight arrived on time. summary. the product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. the main issue is the seat and configuration. well below a cathay qantas singapore jal or even ba. i understand that the a380 fitout may be better but ill continue to avoid emirates. emirates have gone backwards. accra to dubai leg was in a boeing 777300er one flight attendant had a rude attitude whilst the other was great. unfortunately the rude one was in our cabin. the 777 business class seats are outdated and other airlines have much better seating. food and service was below average. dubai to sydney in an a380 crew were friendly but could not seem to get it together. i was travelling with a partner and food only came to one of us and not together every single time my food orders were incorrect. meals are getting smaller and are the same on other routes. meals were served and wines were poured after meals ended. comfort wise i was able to get some sleep in the a380 seats. overall a below average experience with emirates. melbourne to auckland with emirates. 3045 minutes late in takeoff they said it was due to cleaners anyway eventually we were allowed to board. the plane was nice the seats looked comfortable enough and it was certainly clean. the fas however were conspicuous in their absence. once boarded we didnt see them again till we were served a meal. about an hour or so before we landed i asked one fa about landing cards to fill in. she said they had run out of them as they never give us enough and we would probably have to fill in once we landed however to her credit she called around and found a pile more. not sure why this wasnt done when they had run out earlier anyway that was sorted. they also asked for coin donations to a childrens fund so we had our coins ready but no one came for them. just odd. the pe was quite good though but as for service id say below par compared to most airlines i have flown. lusaka to amsterdam via dubai the emirates a340300 was full and seats pretty cramped. ife the old type and with the seat of the passenger reclined almost all the way it was not possible to get a good view of the screen. there was no wifi on this flight. the cabin crew seemed disinterested and more busy with themselves than with their passengers. two crew doing the meal serving were gossiping about a colleague apparently oblivious to the fact that at least 20 pax around them where hearing this. furthermore an extra order of something that was not on a drinks trolley was acknowledged but never arrived. emirates was a great airline with fantastic service but they now need to realize that on the stretch lun  hre to europe there are alternatives. in december last year i flew business class with emirates from brisbane to london with my daughter her husband and three children  a three year old and twelve month old twins. i knew this was not going to be easy but in my worst imaginings i hadnt dreamt it would be such a nightmare. let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. the babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents but were too big to be able to use them. i was a few rows back with the 3 year old but shared baby duties through the night. right from before takeoff i could see we were not welcome. as the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration one of our babies whimpered a little. she rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. even with the comfort of liedown seats it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. so we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. on two occasions when i was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. towards the end of the long flight to dubai we were all exhausted but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. the seventytwo year old granny must have looked a fright as i walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep believe it or not the next leg of the journey was worse as the seats i was in with the three year old would not recline. on two occasions i sought help. the attendant said she would reset the equipment. this meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes much to the distress of my little autistic grandson i didnt see this attendant again. his seat did recline after this but mine still did not i tried again  different attendant  same story i was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. having outlaid almost 10000 for business class i was not happy i would probably have been more comfortable in economy i would have thought that an airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. they would have known our party was coming on board. one would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead london heathrow to sydney via dubai and bangkok with emirates. we were not offered enough water and when we asked staff for water it was a constant battle to get any yet they were more than happy to give the drunk man constant alcoholic drinks and encourage him. the seat wouldnt recline and tv wouldnt work.  we asked staff for support and were told they would come back yet they didnt we paid extra and specifically chose to fly with emirates a decision we can never take back. a once in a lifetime holiday started off awfully. one of our meal choices was chicken or beef and after asking for two beef were told only one left  en they went to the two rows behind us and offered beef or chicken. a complaint submitted and would hear within 30 days  29 days later we got a reply what a joke for an award winning service. munich to perth via dubai with emirates. slow and bad business class service. the first drink on mucdxb and dxbper took ages. dont ask for a refill  you wont get if because the cabin crew is not able andor not willing to cope with extra requests. particularly bad was the meal service on the dxbper leg. food came without any drinks  not even water. when i used the call button a flight attendant showed up after a while and took my order. however the order never arrived. she came back after  believe it or not  about 30 minutes and explained that thy have not been able to serve my order because they were busy with serving the food. this is ridiculous given the fact that they have a large number of flight attendants in business class. emirates might have a young fleet of aircraft but their inflight processes are a disaster and they have no service attitude. they are entirely inefficient. i can only recommend to use the asian carriers or maybe qatar airways when you fly between europe and australia. we flew emirates from madrid to dubai and we were shocked that the 777300 was configured 343 on this aircraft and not the standard 333 as usually found on other airlines who operate the type this along with extrememly tight seat pitch made for a very uncomfortable flight. ground service was good no delays no baggage problems and the ife is excellent. cabin crew seemed scattered and uncoordinated the men do the donkey work whilst most of the girls seem to have been chosen for their looks rather than their ability to do the job. dinner was served over two hours into the flight ie almost midnight reasonable grilled chicken and bean salad starter followed by a choice of roast chicken or ragout of lamb. by the time they got to us theyd run out of the lamb hardly surprising so we got chicken for our main course too dry as a bone served with some sloppy veg. breakfast wasnt offered not even juice just a choice of coffee or tea. one drinks service before dinner. a huge disappointment after all the hype wed heard about emirates. well see how next weeks return flight goes. mumbai to dubai and emirates staff was very considerate. i was travelling with a active toddler. dubai to san francisco and the air hostess are least bothered. not a sight of smile while welcoming. young kids needs milk is it not obvious or let parents carry them. irony is they ran out of milk when asked for second time. in a 15 hour flight is it not reasonable for a parent to ask another serving of milk for toddler. i guess cabin crew staff needs to be trained to handle young kids and learn some patience instead of making faces. this is annoying for passengers. from the moment i checked in emirates managed to make a mess of things. i asked the agent at the check in counter if i could use the lounge with my one world emerald status platinum with qatar airways given that qf and ek code share the flight i was checking in for. she took my card then mistakenly entered the membership number with qf instead of qr. i didnt notice her error until i arrived at the qf lounge and was promptly denied entry. ek also switched my seat without informing me. when i asked about it at the gate i was told that there was a note in the record that my seat had been changed in order to allow a family to sit together. that is fine but ek could have at least had the courtesy to inform me at check in. onboard fas did the minimum. i asked for a bandage for a small cut on my finger which the fa completely forgot about. the best was when i asked for ketchup to accompany my breakfast of hash browns and a frittata  exactly the sort of dishes one would eat with ketchup. i was informed that ketchup is only available in business and first class. what is ketchup the new dom perignon give me a break. requests with the call button went ignored. last time i flew with ek was in business class from nbokwi via dxb. i didnt find it to be a very good experience. the final kicker is they broke a wheel of my dependable and well constructed roll on bag.  flight no issues inflight entertainment was not as expected or advertised. food was not good at all. on my flight back to sa the only good option i had was vegetable and was told that the other options were not available as it was finished. most of the time cabin crew had to be asked twice as they had forgotten. just some info for passengers if you are asleep while serving food you will be left to sleep. it was my third trip to indonesia and i had always chosen emirates for that. me and my mate were flying from jakarta to malpensa via dubai. the first flight was ok while the dubai to malpensa flight was horrible. a passenger had a health problem when we had just taken our seats and we had to wait about two hours. then the passenger and his wife left the plane. but the wrong luggage was taken from the plane and another bag not belonging to anyone was shown by a steward to us all. none of the staff apologised for the delay or inconvenience. i arrived at malpensa two hours late and very tired having started my trip the day before in yogyakarta. the a380 has no place for standing up just to change position and relax the body in a many hours trip. it is filled with seats and nothing else. i will not choose emirates for my next flights. flew with emirates for the first time. jfk to bangkok with layover in dubai. i chose this flight due to short layover. all would be great if the flight was not delayed. we left jfk later than projected and ended up missing our flight from dubai to bangkok resulting is a 8 hour layover. emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4 which they were not happy to fix either. the flight was ok. a380 is an impressive plane. seat are relatively comfortable in economy section entertainment selection was very good. food and drink service was ok. the crew was very international and not super friendly. our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened letting bright light in they were also extremely loud chit chatting laughing. when i asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away returning in a few minutes with ear plugs which i never requested. eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane as flight was only half full and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. return flight from bangkok to dubai was also delayed. at some point there was airport security on board going through all carryons.  however afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful with same okay fooddrink service and not overly friendly the international crew. overall i was not very impressed with emirates their flight attendants could be more friendly and on ground crew could me more helpful.  dubai to warsaw with emirates. my seats selected 3 month before the flight were changed without any notice. when we boarded a plane they told me that they cannot do anything about that because aircraft was full. seat belt was not working and the seat was broken. when we complain about it three times they said that they will check what can be done and will let us know. no one came to explain anything. we were really disappointed. flew emirates business class from birmingham to bangkok via dubai on 1 march comfortable flight with no problems. however return journey on 9th was a completely different story. total lack of customer care. i appreciate problems were caused by the storm in uae but this does not excuse emirates of customer care. no information was supplied in bangkok as to rescheduled flight and connections and therefore had 12 hour wait. once on board flight the crew were indifferent and unhelpful. arrived in dubai and no help with connection flight. went to business lounge and was told we had been downgraded to economy and we had 27 minutes to make the flight or would have to wait for 2 days for another flight. was told luggage would be transferred on flight so we decided to run to catch the flight. seated next to toilet and disturbed by smell and passengers all flight. arrived at birmingham to be told luggage was still in dubai. have yet to be contacted about compensation for downgrade or delayed baggage despite making complaint at bhx. i think emirates is on the slippery slope of becoming arrogant and then awful. i flew business class with emirates from brisbane to london with my daughter her husband and three children  a three year old and twelve month old twins. i knew this was not going to be easy but in my worst imaginings i hadnt dreamt it would be such a nightmare.  the babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents but were too big to be able to use them. i was a few rows back with the 3 year old but shared baby duties through the night. right from before takeoff i could see we were not welcome.  even with the comfort of liedown seats it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. so we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. on two occasions when i was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. towards the end of the long flight to dubai we were all exhausted but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves.  believe it or not the next leg of the journey was worse as the seats i was in with the three year old would not recline. on two occasions i sought help. the attendant said she would reset the equipment. this meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. i didnt see this attendant again. his seat did recline after this but mine still did not i tried again different attendant but same story i was forced to sit upright all the way. having outlaid almost 10000 for business class i was not happy emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead.    london heathrow to dhaka via dubai returning to newcastle via dubai. london heathrow to dubai started off well as i only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to emirates easy and intuitive mobile checkin. it all went downhill from here though. on boarding was clear my ice seat back screen was not working or responding. worse it wouldnt switch off and kept flickering. i informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasnt a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. i asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didnt really help me sleep on a night flight. i understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. once over dubai landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. we were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and i was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. however it seemed they were only helping certain people and when i asked i got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. i was left to fend for myself when i only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to dhaka which was showing as final call. infuriated and out of breath i arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. i was then shoved on bus in the dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past takeoff time. we were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. the saving grace of the dxbdac sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm and unusually the catering was rather nice. returning dacdxb even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines biman handling team is slow and innefficient. the hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. the flight itself dacdxb was uneventful but the food was atrocious even by emirates standards  almost inedible. thas was repeated on the dxbncl sector as well. all in all very much going downhill even the hard product is showing some weariness and theres complacency in improvements on these  the 10 abreast seating on boeing 777s is horrific. staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt especially when things go wrong. all in all there doesnt seem to be any benefit of flyng emirates anymore  other carriers do this better now.\\r\\r\\n    i chose emirates for 3 reasons ability to fly out of boston pricing and desire to experience the a380 for the first time. i had flown ek once previously a hkgbkk one way several years ago. i was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that i felt that accurate. i am not sure that i would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. first the good. despite a miserable snowstorm in boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. the flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. i would have thought that the high ratio of fas to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. not so. there was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff needing to take some medicine i was finally able to flag down the purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. one appeared annoyed when i asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. though the bell sounded and the light went on the fa told me it wasnt working when i walked back to the galley. the food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. the chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. the bread in cellophane was cold. the flight itself was very smooth. changing to the a380 in dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. once aboard i found that the seat i had selected from a seating chart was not where i expected it to be. aisle seat next to the middle galley. i was banged into by fas the entire flight rarely with an apology. the service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. the food was better than the trip out. so good in fact that the fas were continually eating. i have never seen so many fas consuming food in plain view of pax. again smooth flights but service wise i would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. no comparison to the level of service on qatar which thankfully had just begun service out of boston. am hoping the flight back home in two weeks are better.    adelaide to delhi via dubai with emirates. i had selected my seats for travel on 26th december 2015 but the seats were released and i could not check in on my mobile.  i tried many times to check in and choose my seat but the system locked me out. when i made a phone call to emirates they told me of their inability to do a thing about it. this resulted in being allocated a horrible seat in the middle for the 13 hours long flight with the aisle person making it almost impossible for me to even go to the toilet. topping it up the emirates staff was unresponsive on the plane. when the staff was called they did not come even after pressing the tab 5 times. the entertainment system had so many glitches that i could hardly watch it. the worse thing was the bus from the plane to the terminal herding us like cattle.  the experience was not to end there since when i got my luggage back from the conveyor belt the lock was broken. when i sent the complaint to emirates they said sorry for the things but passing on the blame to the respective authorities.    we expected to arrive in dubai by 0015 and board our onward flight to kuwait by 0145. our flight was expected to leave at 1415 from london heathrow on 31st march but departed at 1520. we expressed concerns to the staff in london and were assured that we would not miss our connecting flight. onboard the flight the crew said they could not be certain if we will make the flight as it depends which gate etc the flight would be on. this left us confused and apprehensive for the rest of our flight. as we arrived in dubai at 0100 we were met by a emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. they gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. the staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. there was no empathy and i do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays.  we chose this flight due to the short connection. if we wanted a longer layover we would have booked it but timing was important to us. we truly experienced a journey in a class of its own.    never ever fly emirates if it is outside the gulf region they are good only for short distance local sectors in the gulf especially to asian cities like hong kong bangkok or singapore. my trip to bangkok and hong kong last week was a trauma or a nightmare i cant get over with them misplacing my luggage  on both flights  back to back and then in bangkok it wasnt delivered until i had to leave the country when i got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. in hong kong they misplaced it erroneously according to the response of the customer service staff only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. also their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them. id never recommend hong kong at all since emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them it is outsourced to an agency jardine services who dont speak english properly. their a380 planes not having a proper recliner seat for many passengers even despite being an 8.5 hour flight.    brisbane to stockholm via dubai. i have been flying with emirates for the last 15 years. i did stop for a couple of years when they went really bad in almost every aspect but lately they have picked up on service and everything. on my recent flight though there were many things not right again. the service with emirates is hit and miss. you can get lucky with extremely polite and efficient staff or very unlucky with poor staff. on this trip i experienced both. when a flight attendant replies to guest complaint about the ice cold ie. not heated food with the answer she could not know i wanted it hot then there is something severely wrong. within asia you will have good staff within europe you wont. the new a380 is a pleasure to fly it is more spacious and new. the second leg of my journey was on an older model a boeing 777300 and that was awful. it is impossible to move eat sit or do anything. my worst concern was the disgusting food.  also my folding table was dirty so they might want to look into cleanliness. the entertaining system is marvelous but in the older planes many gadgets do not work properly.    toronto to trivandrum via dubai with emirates  during checkin the emirates representative was rude and tried to mislead me by saying that i cannot carry my laptop bag 1 laptop and my carry on 7kg. i was told i needed to check in my carry on along with my 2 checked bags. my 2 checkin bags were only 10kg each. he scared me saying i will be charged 150 fee for my carry on bag since i have a laptop bag also. he reiterated only 1 piece of baggage can be carried on board on a a380. very poor form and service. i didnt expect this from emirates. i declined his offer and proceeded with my carry on and laptop bag. nobody stopped me at the gate. hundreds of other passengers had bigger and heavier bags. perhaps he took me for a first time traveler but i know the rules and facts. awful customer service.    flew from dubai to shanghai. i have been traveling with emirates since 2002 and a skywards gold card holder since 2006. over the last 34 years their inflight service can be best described as indifferent this is especially true of the younger set of flight stewards. at dubai airport the emirates ground staff service is abysmal it has been that way for a long time even the food in the business lounge can be best described as average. the inflight service has been going downhill. service it seems mainly depends mainly on individual personalities rather than as mantra. i used to complain before but no longer. i dont care i guess and i use other airlines when i can.    birmingham to adelaide via dubai with emirates. the birmingham to dubai leg was in an a380 and ok but seat was narrow for business class. we switched to a boeing 777300 in dubai. cant help thinking anyone in economy who was able to lie across 3 seats would have had a better trip. the boeing 777 seats are at a 15 degree angle so your legs can not be flat. this flight seemed understaffed. too few bathrooms which were tiny and not always clean. the focus seemed to be on serving those who wanted alcohol throughout the flight rather than basic quality care to everyone. definitely not value for money  at best i would describe it as poor premium class. what happened to emirates this airline misconnected our baggage on the way back from bangkok and as a result our one night and day in istanbul were totally ruined. to make matters worse they have the most disgraceful staff representing them at ist airport. a third party agency whose staff ask what our problem is after waiting 2 hours and only being given 50 dollars to cloth ourselves no explanation where our baggage is or when it will arrive. on top of this complete disaster the inflight service was terrible with inexperienced crew having absolutely no idea how to do their job. will never fly emirates again.    bangkok  hong kong. greeted with indignance at bangkok lounge which was my very first impression of emirates having flown singapore and qatar many times. comfortable lounge. on board brand new a380800 was comfortable with all the latest gadgets. food ok and wine list a credit to the selectors except for champagne. why would you choose such a large house as moet which seems totally out of balance with the rest of the wine selections friendly service although not as professional as singapore and qatar. hkgbkk on an older a380 was a real experience. seats feel more cramped than the new version although i have read they are the same width. nowhere to put your arms when reclining and it feels like a very cramped space. food was downright awful and service was staff who in their attempt to be over friendly and hip just got it wrong. i would much pefer to pay the extra money for singapore and qatar where i am almost guaranteed of a better experience. upon disembarkation the staff were very rude. they forgot to give me my arrival papers on board.  expecting a great deal based on other reviews we decided to pay more to fly with emirates from dubai to london heathrow. unhelpful emirates staff at heathrow  could barely muster a smile. completely oversold their family friendly service. it was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. although the kids meals were given as they had been preordered i dont think they were particularly great quality. in terms of the cabin crew  rude unfriendly and i could go on. we were issued the wrong menu  no apology. i asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if id asked for gold. the serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed  no system no organisation. i wasnt offered food twice as they bypassed me. my partner was missed out on a few occasions too. no apology. they didnt bother with the kids i went to change the baby and when i was returning to my seat i had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way. they are clearly more important than you. the toilets were not maintained. i have always flown with virgin in the past and will continue to do so in the future.    have flown amsterdam to dubai roundtrips with emirates a380s since they started the route. seat ife and overall cabin comfort remain top in class. catering has recently improved quality of the fas is still erratic but emirates find it increasingly difficult to depart on time both in ams and dxb. when departure is delayed by more than 45min it is not possible to catchup during the flight as the sector is not long enough. turnaround time in amsterdam is very short and thus departure time suffers quickly when the inbound flight is delayed. not sure why leaving dubai on time is so difficult but according to announcements made by cabin staff it is often due to passengers arriving late at the gate. barcelona to sydney via dubai with emirates. the a380 in economy is roomy enough but service was again found wanting after meal service. dubai wont allow liquids of more than 100ml past the boarding gate area so you rely on being provided enough water inflight. this i found near impossible and with my annoying dry cough i needed the liquid. i tried repeatedly to hail a passing staff member only to be ignored. never before have i pressed the assistance button but when a staff member finally responded it was with an impatient look but she eventually brought a mouthful of water in a plastic cup. hardly enough to keep well hydrated. when disembarking i spotted a water fountain with cups down the front end of economy i could have used had i been able to get past the two large men sound asleep beside me  the perils of the window seat. i will try another airline for my next trip.  manchester to dubai with emirates. it was disappointing  paid to upgrade to business class and maybe expected too much. after queuing for check in we were immediately welcomed by the staff saying you are on a saver business ticket so you cant use the lounge. yes we knew that but thankyou for making us feel so welcome. onboard we settled into row 18 in the lovely a380 seats. the cabin supervisor was coming through welcoming people onboard  she clearly missed us out and carried on. no smile or hello. we hadnt paid enough obviously. next my husbands seat did not recline or indeed move. the centre partition was jammed half way down. the cabin supervisor came over and shrugged. we will reset the seat and see what happens  it got stuck half way to lie flat. we changed seats off our own back but the only seats available together were in row 26 infront of the rowdy mens pub area inflight bar. if you want a peaceful flight dont sit in the rear section. its like lying down at a party. the food service started  they took our orders early on but oh dear our choices werent available. no apology even though they would have known that already at time of taking the order. the food we got was lovely but really  back row problem in any class obviously. after being at the party a while listening to some loud stories and eating something we didnt really want we found yet 2 more individual seats further down the cabin to try and sleep. it was shoddy the whole trip. downstairs it was half full and people no doubt had 3 seats each anyway. we upgraded not for the food but to lie down and be more comfortable. i guess we got that bit eventually but at a price we personally wouldnt pay for in the future.    flew emirates bangkok to malta via tunis. a tale of two contrasting legs first leg bangkok to dubai fine on 777 or a380 depending on time of departure. new planes and the expected emirates serviceexperience. 2nd leg from dubai to tunis left a lot to be desired  on a very tired old workhorse 777. narrow width seats. old generation ice no working power supply at the time. 2hrs in tunis  you are not allowed to disembark the aircraft and for the first hour are vigorously encouraged to remain in your seat while headcounts security formalities are completed. having just endured a 6hr flight and probably a couple of hours in dubai before the flight  and in need of a stretch drink and to freshen up  it was frustrating not to receive better onground transit care. delayed outbound from dxb  tun meant the flight took close to 20hrs all in all. flew emirates from singapore to brisbane. check in was great. airport did a great job. while boarding the flight attendants were friendly and approachable. however during mid flight they seemed rather tired and unmotivated. i was quite disappointed with the service as i expected more from them. during both meal services the flight attendants pulled long faces as if the passengers were a burden. entertainment system was old screen was small selection of movies were poor. seats were hard and cramped.    emirates just won my worst airline experience. i was supposed to fly the simple maniladubaiwashington route. but instead i got manilaclark airport transfer via bus to get us on a plane there. we then were asked to wait without a clear departure time. eventually we left at 2am after a 8 hour delay. then they put me on a dubailondon flight. when asked why this is the case they tell me that i will fly to london and then wait for another transfer to get on washington dc flight. already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours i told them i just want to wait for the next direct flight to washington. they tell me i need to talk to the guys in dubai for they cant do anything. but then upon checking i find that i have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. at this time i have no idea when i will arrive in london or washington. i am now sitting at the dubai airport to find out that i will have to wait another 4 hours in london. and they are announcing the flight to london need to be boarded. since my luggage is already tagged through these stops i am waiting at the gate. but i have to say this is horrible. more so since no emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made. those that ticketed me in clark airport in the philippines was not even an emirates staff.     dubai to manchester. specifically chose this flight so that we could travel on the a380. very disappointed. boarding was ok and we were in seats 12ef. seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side the floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. cabin service was very poor and disjointed. starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. we were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served i gave up in the end. times must be hard on emirates only one chocolate between us the bar area at the rear of business cabin is the place to go if you want a drink at least you get one there eventually. the pilot managed to make up the lost time and arrived in manchester bang on time. much prefer the a340 or boeing 777 to this plane. we have the same trip booked later this year and i am wondering if i can change to another flight to avoid the a380.    rome to taipei via dubai food are surprisingly cold fa even forgot to give drink when serving the meals. chinesespeaking fa treat the customer poorly ignored customer needs. could only tell customer need to english speaking fa. i think the emirates product is really good big screen seat pitch is ok but the software is really poor  very inattentive fa no runs between meals cold food.    manchester to dubai with emirates. having just got off the flight from hell i feel a few words are in order. there were real problems and long lines boarding the a380 in manchester and this was not well handled. the food when we got it was cold and a 7 hour flight only provided one meal the paying passengers seemed to be a inconvenience to the cabin staff  very slow and poor service and they never smiled or interacted. you press the call bell and wait and wait and wait. then get out of your seat and go and find them. this is not the sort of service i expected and if this had of been my first flight with them i would never have used them again. i have been flying with them and other airlines for 20 years. i shall be using them in the future as i have never had a problem like this before but would not again fly in a a380 from manchester. stockholm to manila with emirates. not baby friendly. flew with emirates twice this year. one return flight to singapore in jan and next was return flight to manila in jun. on both flights service not too good. although we reserved a bassinet in advance we still had to request it inflight. irritating policy on serving food. travelling alone so i requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous. other airlines like sq are more flexible on such requests. no food served for babies even if you ask. lastly difficult to get help when asking assistance with my babys milk. i had to carry my baby and go all the way to the pantry to get someone to assist me.   mumbai to amsterdam via dubai with emirates. aircraft very clean but the service was poor. the flight attendants were extremely lethargic and did not seem interested in serving the passengers. i would say its a complete avoid airline. even the food is not upto the mark. most it was cold hot meal wasnt hot.    perth to dubai. i booked my ticket through qantas for a route serviced by emirates. at the check in emirates staff was not able to locate me in their system. instead of clearing the issue with qantas themselves i had to go and talk to qantas and forward qantas message to emirates because according to emirates expressed in pretty arrogant way i booked the ticket with qantas and thus it is up to me to clear it. for me as a customer it does not make sense as i would expect the airline to clear the issues they have with their internal systems themselves and not make the customer to try and resolve it at the airport a couple of hours before the departure. once the issue was resolved the seat i originally booked was also changed from aisle to the window. of course it is a small thing but in the circumstances it was annoying as i particularly booked a seat at the aisle feeling unwell before the trip.    dubai to tokyo narita. during the flight i wanted to buy some duty free products. i asked three times and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly but never did. after the third attempt i gave up. what annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence i had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the atlantic and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion different airline. so i had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. in the end i arrived in tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache seats seemed to be made of cardboard. the only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment which included wifi and live tv. that however is not enough to convince me to fly on emirates with my own money again particularly as i paid a 25 premium to fly on emirates this time. very disappointed. dublin to manila via dubai. as a frequent flyer on this route but typically with etihad i was booked with emirates by a colleague who heard good things about the airline. unfortunately this proved to not be my experience. when you fly long haul as often as i do the one thing that really matters is the seat  thats what im paying for. i dont believe i have experienced a more uncomfortable seat ever. not flatbed but angled  no comfort in any position left me arriving with back pain and exhausted by lack of sleep. unfortunately i get to enjoy it all again on the return trip in 10 days. the food was pretty awful also. firmly back to etihad for me and my team in future.    perth to nice via dubai. i used to love flying emirates. what has happened  very expensive flights to nice and service is terrible. i pressed the bell 6 times and the second time 4 times on another connecting flight but no one showed up. the service from europe was no better. i waited over 15 minutes to use a toilet in business and then one of the hostesses came out with her makeup bag there was a line for both toilets. service so slow and they act like they are doing you a favour. i asked for a red wine and got a cup of tea when i mentioned this i still did not get the red. two sauvignon blancs is not smart for a choice of white wines. on board ice entertainment system clumsy. chaffeur did not confirm and we had to chase them to see if we were being picked up for two legs of the trip website section said booked but empty. business lounge outdated and they have the childrens play room down in the smoking section. what has happened to my favourite airline    melbourne to kuala lumpur. i was disappointed the staff were not friendlier during checkin. one of the best business class lounges food alcohol and facilities are great. staff are the same as every other lounge. service in flight the first time in my experience of flying business class that i was not greeted with a welcome drink while other people in the cabin received it. i had a feeling of unwelcomeness from the staff  an overall indifference.  the only thing premium is the menu and not necessarily the service. i think the diversity of their crew is the biggest problem. there is no cohesive identity and embedded culture of service and welcoming.  even having to press the call button twice on a few occasions to receive service. food quality varied  some were delicious the others not. seating was very uncomfortable.  i was reconsidering my decision to upgrade. i couldnt sleep properly as i am a side sleeper. emirates makes a big deal about lieflat beds but does not deliver in all of their business class cabins.   \\r\\r\\nthe car arrived at our singapore lodgings in fine time and we were soon on our way to changi where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the firstbusiness lounge. we were welcomed aboard our 777 with the usual courtesy but my infotainment screen wouldnt work. attempts to reboot failed. fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so i moved. all went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into dubai. i switched to the flight details on the screen of my new seat. without warning the destination changed from dubai to sharjah. ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to sharjah and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at sharjah. our 777 parked alongside several others in a secluded corner of the airport. hours passed. we werent allowed to leave the plane. information was hard to come by from the crew but someone with contacts in dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at dubai which closed the airport. without warning buses arrived and we were asked to board them. it looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. we found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. it did have air con but i made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. we set out we knew not for where in a convoy with police escort. after many stops and starts we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the employees entrance of dubai airport. a man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our convoy. with much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. he drove an ordinary saloon car with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him airside. eventually driving by parked planes and other airside traffic we came to an arrival gate we were only too pleased to leave the ovenhot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at dubai. imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for glasgow had not yet left. it was now about 19.30hrs. the departures screen announced gate open so we made our way there and checked in. the emirates staff in attendance couldnt tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart but they did advise that we should stand by. eventually the flight was boarded and took off at about 21.30hrs. six and a half hours late. the flight was incident free although again i couldnt make the infotainment system work and we landed at glasgow at 01.45hrs on thursday 4th august 2016 just under six hours behind schedule. our bags of course were still in the middle east so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. the final indignity. they had given our car to someone in greater need we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. so ever so jet lagged a taxi nearly as grotty as the sharjah mini bus but not so hot delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than i feared when we first diverted to sharjah. we were reunited with our luggage during the evening of friday 5th august when a driver brought them to our home. a journey memorable for all the wrong reasons.    dubai to new york jfk in business class. i am a big fan of this airline and being a platinum member i expect them to be the best. this trip the crew disappointed me as they were talking about some new rule of not serving me a drink from the bar till they take off which is unheard of. also past few trips on emirates they always have shortfall of water bottles even after 3 hours of take off and their food choices have gone so commercial and reminds me of cheap united airlines food  specially the light bite and they should stop serving this uncooked doughy pizza. the flight manager never showed up in the cabin usually they always come and greet their gold and platinum members.    flew amsterdam  dubai  dar es salaam with emirates. in amsterdam our flight was already delayed 3.5 hrs which left us 30 minutes to make our transfer in dubai. upon arrival in dubai we could not disembark for another 1520 minutes. after running through dubai airport we arrived at our gate to be the last passengers boarding to dar es salaam. hungry and thirsty we entered the plane. the personnel aboard seemed very reluctant and after calling the stewardess to ask for some water they just did not come. having travelled for 22 hours all emirates served us were 2 meals and a couple of drinks but the worst was yet to come. upon arrival to dar es salaam the luggage was lost. its 4 days later and still we have not heard anything from them.   birmingham to colombo via dubai with emirates. poor throughout specially onboard food and service which is what i thought emirates was renowned for and worth paying extra for. birmingham to dubai we had the a380 which was very comfortable with seats that i could sit crosslegged on. the entertaintment system was also amazing. this is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. the organisation for transfers was poor to nonexistent with a massive queue for security at dubai with minimal time for the connection. for the rest of our flights dubai to sri lanka sri lanka to dubai with a stop at male and dubai to birmingham we had the smaller and older aircraft b777300. this was noticably older dated and uncomfortably cramped. the entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. the worst of all was the inflight service. pressed my buzzer for help with a nonfunctioning screen and an hour later nobody had come to ask what i needed. in the end i had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. i had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. it only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. the food and beverage service also poor. they had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23 they had completely run out of chicken. i offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. i was told categorically there was none left and then later i saw them handing chicken to some passengers. on the 8hour flight from dubai to birmingham after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast no drinks runs to even offer people water. on walking around i saw all the service staff at the back of the plane with tea and biscuits having a good old jolly. overall a very disappointing experience completely unexpected from an airline with the reputation of emirates.    emirates has lost its edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. if traveling to first world destinations emirates provide their latest aircraft with state of the art features and polished services. however take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isnt much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. flying to london heathrow on their a380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress.  had previously enjoyed emirates design and layout of the a380 but having flown recently it seems theyve tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions.  emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored thats where it ends. an economy return ticket from dubai to london was priced at a whopping 1200 gbp when other airlines were much cheaper. the only advantage i saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and i didnt have any lengthy layovers.  one would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. however it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular check in queues and i dont really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters. overall i am quite disappointed with emirates and next time i fly this sector i might seriously consider other airlines.    bangkok to birmingham via dubai. having been a frequent flyer with emirates for many years i have to say that the service has dramatically declined over the years. gone are the days when on the evening flights you got a small amenity pack even in economy. they have a great tv system but more often than not the crew are surly seem not to want to work and if you want a drink you do have to keep buzzing for it. whilst the newer a380 planes are great and a lot more comfort the older b777 planes can be ok dependant on the crews    upgraded to first private suites on brussels to dubai using 777300er. a very agreable flight of course but with a long series of problems that should not occur. after takeoff the seat could only operated through the large tv touch screen not through the remotes which is a bit painful as the creen is about 1m from the seat. this was fixed after 15 min. then the tv screen started going black for 30sec every 10min while the soundtrack of the movie still played. the system was reset and then worked fine. although only 3 people travelling in the first class cabin crew brought a wrong entree and insisted it was the right one even it was obviously not the case. after 10 min they apologized and offered to cook the right one but this took another 30 min. halfway through the flight the seat completely jammed but i could easily pick another one as the cabin was less than half full. i must say emirates first class seat is in fact worse than their lie flat business class seats on the a380s. upon arrival in dubai i used emirates chauffeur service was assigned one of their cars but the driver told me he didnt know the meydan hotel and asked whether i could guide him. which i could not so i asked for another car and driver and left the car. but the organizers of the service on the pavement insisted i wait until they explained the route to follow to the driver. i did not want to wait at midnight with 36c temperature outside and only after insisting really hard did they call another driver.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    manchester to tokyo narita via dubai. first leg from manchester to dubai was very good in a380 with good legroom and excellent inflight cabin service. however wifi did not work. boeing 777300 from dubai to narita was very cramped. emirates have taken off 1 inch from each seat to squeeze additional one seat in a 343 configuration. this makes the seating very uncomfortable. ice system did not work very well. return journey from osaka to dubai was also bad. boeing 777300 cabin had a dated look. seating very uncomfortable. my seat did not recline. passenger sitting next to me had to move as that seat would not recline either. toilets were dirty and had no water in the basin to wash hands. cabin crew very slow in serving any foodsdrinks. it took over three hours before any drinks or food was served after departure. headphones did not work properly. had to try 3 different headphones before i found one that worked. airbus a380 from dubai to manchester was fine. i will avoid flying on emirates boeing 777300 to japan in future.    manila to barcelona return via dubai. food was very bad  breakfast to dubai was not even substantial neither egg nor any piece of meat was served just two types of bread cheese and fruit cocktail. service from manila to barcelona and barcelona to dubai was bad. no attendants doing the rounds to offer water or juice when meal service was long over. this was only done for the flight from dubai to manila. meal was served very late  going 2 hours into the flight. fancy packaging for some biscuits with cheese and salsa and tiny toasted bread but actually everything in that nice packaging does not taste good unless you are too hungry. cod fish served over noodles was not fresh.  the salads served were awful and im not picky with food. this is the first time that i ever asked for noodles during any flight just because i ate so little on my tray. very disappointed indeed.    london gatwick to bangalore via dubai. having knee surgery 8 weeks ago we requested wheel chair assistance at ramp at gatwick. this never arrived. we requested to speak to local management. we were told a manager would meet us in the lounge. this never happened. during flight we were given difference choice of food even though we had requested jain vegetarian meal. when we had complained previously to emirates customer service they even suggested we should bring our own food if we were not happy with food provided    geneva to taipei via dubai. i dont recommend emirates and i will avoid to fly with emirates moving forward. the flight i took from dubai to taipei was delayed for more than 6 hours. i arrived dubai around 1am and departed at 10am. during this period of longwaiting time emirates didnt make up anything for us. there was no meal voucher no nothing. i wont rate its service as good as its reputation. it is pretty poor actually. secondly during my whole itinerary i had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. it was either from flight to terminal or from terminal to flight. its definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and i had to wait in a jammed hot bus and the transit time was long. i travel average 810 times a year and fly various airlines worldwide. i have never experienced anything similar before with other airlines.    mauritius to dubai. our problems began with the meal service. we waited nearly half an hour from first to main course but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. the menu promised braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables. what was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. judge for yourself from the photo. when i drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back so i pressed the call button which was completely ignored this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention. i finally collared the purser as he was passing got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. when i declined explained that my partner and i were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didnt like curry the other alternative he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt  the purser brought the fish and curry meals id already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. he then very reluctantly said hed see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. i decided to pass and go the the sweet course 15 minutes waiting for that while my partner decided not to eat at all. for the remainder of the flight the cabin crew did their best to ignore us or when they had to interact their manner was off hand to say the least. customer focus was lacking completely. the purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. about 30 minutes from landing my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. again the call button was ignored completely. this was the worst flight i have had. by contrast the connecting flight from dubai to manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. however this is not the first time ive found a lack of consistency with emirates but it will be the last time. i will never fly with them again and i would recommend others to choose another airline.    on 15th september i travelled to singapore from colombo with my parents and 5 months old baby. this was the first time i travelled with my baby. i specifically chose emirates as i believed theyll offer an exceptional service. but it was so disappointing. the worst cabin crew i have seen. no one even bothered to ask whether we need anything for the baby  when i asked a crew member i need to make formula for the baby she asked me to wait till the service over that is for another half an hour. can a baby wait like an adult. i wanted to wash her milk bottle and she asked me to go to the washroom. no helping hand at all. luckily i had my parents with me to help. even though they advertise they give a baby kit no one came to us when the baby started crying. i must say if you plan to travel with an infant dont select this airline.    london gatwick to dubai with emirates. excellent seating  good space. excellent food entertainment system very smooth flight. my cons would be not enough drinks staff are not very cheerful only one lady on my return was lovely the rest appear grumpy. on my way out there was no brandy available which was surprising. i would definitely fly with emirates again.    i flew with emirates from brisbane to london return via dubai. the staff were sour acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle and the food was disgusting. but the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. after not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at dubai airport ever heard of email emirates i arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk where i was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. the customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when i was in the air  someone would meet me at the gate i scoffed at that one. trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games after an hour i gave up and caught a cab. after spending 14 hours in the hotel i thought i would be winging my way home. after finally arriving in dubai there was no one there to meet me at the gate so i proceeded to the transfer desk where i was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. so after waiting for 3 hours i found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight then i shouldnt bother waiting in the queue as they werent giving out hotel or meal vouchers.  i checked online and found that i had indeed been put on a flight  scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. i settled in to spend 28 hours total in dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates.  on my return to australia emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now considered the matter closed refusing to respond to any further emails. so if youre looking to fly emirates  beware they may show you great service which is a bit hit and miss anyway but when things go wrong they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause. having travelled emirates first class in the past and loving the experience i really looked forward to my business class flight with them from singapore to melbourne. the seatbed is spacious stylish and comfortable. the selection of beverages and food average and the service on this flight appalling. the staff made flying business feel like the new economy. they do not make eye contact answer the call bell return with requests even if you ask four times at twenty minute intervals or serve you breakfast if you ask not to be woken for it regardless of your slumber status. they do congregate in the guest onboard barlounge talking loudly in a manner that could lead you to believe they were having their own cocktail party.    i have been flying with emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown economy class where i have found the service to be of excellent standards. recently i was offered the option to upgrade to business class and i decided to pay the additional premium. the service i received during my flight was disappointing and quite substandard. dubai to manchester the journey began really well. after 15 minutes into the flight my tv and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant i couldnt not watch tv close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. i made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the tv and this would resolve the issue. one hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. on my way to the toilets i raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. i sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. i then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which i could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. this was done twice without any positive result. the service i received in business class became anything but relaxing. almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey i was offered the chance to move to another seat which i found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. i emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25000 air miles which amount to nothing. i cannot even get an upgrade really disappointed with emirates and the way they have dealt with this. i do not recommend flying emirates business class really not worth the extra money you pay. if you have an issue on the flight dont count on dealing with their complaints team after as they wont offer you anything try and get what you want while your on the flight.    i had a disappointing flight in business class from washington to dubai flight service was 1 out of 10. from beginning of flight the attendants ignored me they even havent gave me complimentary welcome package before take off and just passed me like they dont see me  i complained to them and they said they have no more left at dubai airport after waiting 30 min for my luggage i became to know that they left my luggage in washington dulles airport. so i send them email asking for refunds and after a month on 22092016 they sent me an email says they will not refund but they will topup my mile account with 20000 miles as a gesture of goodwill. my flight was on 18 august and now we are on 21st october that i havent even received that 20000 miles that they said as gesture of goodwill.     bangkok to hong kong and very disappointing. i have been flying qatar for many years and this is the first time to fly emirates. the planes are badly designed with drab colors and no atmosphere. the food was bad and staff just okay. the whole experience was worse than air asia but the price was very good  20 less than air asia. so we will be using emirates again but will take our own food.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    flight from dubai to warsaw on 17th october in economy class. cabin crew service was bad and no smiles. i felt like im sorry that i ask for something. meal on board was poor. cleanliness could be better. the seats are rather uncomfortable in the economy class.    in short unprofessional and rude cabin service awful meals dirty cabin and most annoying is that the cabin crew just dont seem to care about anything. im a frequent traveler usually every other week on cx or my i only choose emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an a380 from bangkok to hong kong. we had seats 52hjk next to the galley to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. firstly the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you they dont use a curtain. even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise lots of noise if its not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors its the cabin crew talking. meals were low grade and poor quality. meal service took forever and was completely unorganized my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later i was offered a regular meal. condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats  the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets. ice system is good but the headphones are a perfect example of form over function  who has square ears ek385 was met at bkk airport with stairs on the tarmac about 20 minutes after landing and free bus ride to the terminal. even lccs like airasia afford their passengers an air bridge to walk into the terminal.\\r\\r\\n    i flew from paris cdg to dubai dxb on saturday 1 october 2016 15.35 – 00.20 with emirates ek 074. the flight was good but the service is far from expected. i asked for a hot chocolate during the meal time it took ages and i had to ask another flight attendant. when it arrived it was cold and had been filled with cold milk. i made a complaint to the purser she apologised and they served another one. during the dessert they served ice cream but for myself and my wife there was no spoon. we ended up with the tea stirrer. furthermore i saw a flight attendant queuing for the toilets in front of me and refusing to assist passengers. usually they use the toilet at the far end in the back. i really regret picking emirates. a nightmare journey from dubai to cape town with emirates. poor seating very cramped air crew unfriendly. captain spent 5 mins telling us that the crew were award winning. i was last off the flight as i was pretty loaded up no help from the staff as they stood watching me. would never fly this airline again. houston to trivandrum via dubai with emirates. i had a 2 hour lay over in dubai and had plans to shop for a couple of things from the duty free. however due to the delayed take off i was sprinting through dubai airport in order to not miss my flight to houston reaching it just 3 mins before the gate closed. such a delay is not my first experience with emirates. staff onboard were just okay except one  the rest of them all seemed stressed out. the economy class seats are extremely uncomfortable for a 16 hours long flight. nonspacious and no leg space. inflight entetainment is nice but that is the least of my concerns i do not wish to fly with emirates again.    cape town to dubai. the timing of the meals on this 9hour overnight flight was senseless. firstly it took them 3 hours to serve supper by which time id lost interest and gone to sleep. then they woke me up 3.5 hours before landing for breakfast which i also declined because of poor timing. so there was only a twohour window when the cabin didnt smell like a restaurant. glasgow to bangkok return via dubai. check in good in all airports. im skywards silver so boarding is good. all flights pretty much on time but arrival in dxb and having to bus from a remote stand to the terminal is nonsense. as usual variable standards from the cabin crew  infrequent drinks runs and disorganised meal service resulting in myself and another passenger not even being offered a meal  its not exactly very complicated and the flight was only half full. emirates are well priced and reliable and i make use of the lounge in dubai but the service in the cabin is average at best and too often pretty poor. emirates were better a few years ago but standards have not increased as fast as their route network.    manchester to dubai return on the new 2 class a380. the plane is basically a flying cattle market and it is obvious that emirates are moving towards to a pile em high sell em cheap service except that its not so cheap. the service from cabin crew was virtually nonexistent apart from serving the meal and collecting headsetsblankets at the end of the flights. call bells were left unanswered throughout both flights with passengers resorting to self service to get a drink. no drinks runs other than with the meal. seat pitch and width has also been reduced downstairs compared to the 3 class a380 no doubt to cram more seats in. emirates service has noticeably deteriorated over the last 12 months. i used to sing the praises of ek but not any more. will be flying with qatar airways next time.    london gatwick to dubai return. the emirates a380 is huge quiet and with a brilliant inflight entertainment system only let down by the headphones. so my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. but thats where it ends. on both the outbound and return legs the inflight service was terrible. slow to the point of lazy a choice of menu thats undeliverable by the time theyve reached the middle of the flight staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked whats possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. i had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after i asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley and then it was the same meal i had declined. i asked to speak to the cabin manager twice who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. on the return flight the experience was much the same. no choice of menu for over half the passengers two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes  after my wifes vegetarian choice was offered to her. this was labelled vegan which isnt what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was left. when i was finally presented with the remaining meal choice chicken with olive sauce i had to ask for a drink and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way  it was half the length of the plane away somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals but we at the back were treated as an after thought. the passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. a note of advice for emirates. olives are a divisive ingredient people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives more people will avoid it than choose it leaving you short of choice the overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight  constantly bumping my head as they reached up. on one occasion the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. so my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. its all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on whats on tv and food and drink service is a secondary concern i for one wont fly with them again.    kuala lumpur to frankfurt via dubai with emirates. this perhaps is my worst flight experience ever. my flight and seat was booked and confirmed 3 months in advance. when arriving back at dubai airport for my dubai  frankfurt flight ek045 they informed me that the flight was over booked and refused me checkin despite arriving more than 2 hours before departure because i did not do online checkin. apparently my seat has been allocated to another passenger. they offered me the next available flight and free ticket but i refused as i was traveling with my colleagues and had to be in frankfurt for a meeting. the customer service said that i have to wait until check in is closed to see whether is there any available seat. after waiting until almost boarding time they finally allocated me a seat and ask me to rush to the gate. onboard i checked in my coat and went to the allocated the seat 65c which is right next to the lavatory. throughout the entire 6.5 hour journey it was just horrible. im entirely fine with me with people going in and out of the toilet. but every half and hour or so someone and somehow loss their sense direction and came knocking into me. just before landing i press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. nobody answered. upon landing i immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said i had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. i mean this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed. obviously i was the last to board the plane and the last to leave the plane in this flight. to me this is unacceptable for a world class airline they claimed to be. even a budget airlines has better service than the emirates. mauritius to frankfurt via dubai with emirates. the night flight from mauritius to dubai departed 11 pm. business as usual very positive reception on the aircraft hand luggage was stored away crosscheck and takeoff. then emirates showed their way of customer care once again. first beverage service 90 minutes after takeoff together with dinner  actually not a meal but disgusting. after lights were turned off part of the crew was gathering in the servicestation directly behind row 51 to loudly exchange their experiences on mauritius while slamming some compartment doors. passenger complaints did not bother them at all. any cabin sevice was discontinued. even on request. i never ever was confronted with such a rude cabin crew behaviour  fly emirates does not mean enjoy emirates.    gatwick to maldives via dubai. emirates was highly recommended to us but all i can say is it was a big disappointment and we are dreading our return flight with them. positives  polite staff seats comfortable. negatives  service and amenities. husband not able to use ife controls as it had jammed. we ordered two courses as suggested on the menu booklet for a light eater. waited one and half hours after first course for cheese we ordered with our starter as we did not want the main course  told that it had all gone as they had served everyone else in the cabin even those behind us. after showing our displeasure they did make up for this by getting us some cheese and offering good wine from first class. why not offer this in first place rather than telling us the cheese had gone on a long flight that arrives at night 2am we wanted to sleep  not an amenity bag in sight. i asked for one and was told they only supply on night flights. well im sorry but when i board and arrive somewhere early in the morning then i expect an amenity bag. that is night time and that is when you require those bits and pieces that add a little paid for luxury to the start of a hard earned holiday. having paid thousands for business i do not expect an airline to be so stingy  they should supply amenity bags regardless of time of flying. people do need to wash and clean teeth and freshen up during any long haul flight. this is appalling cost cutting meanness and sorry i thought my thousands in air fare bought me a small bag of comfort. i have flown business with other airlines and received much better service. i was so excited to fly with emirates as i heard good reports but they will not be my first choice again really not good value for money. felt there was no balance between profit and service what they needed to do was so little but the impact would have been so positive. very sad.    new york to chennai via dubai. went in with great expectations but it was an average experience. flight from jfk to dubai was okay but the flight from dubai to chennai was worse. ife was not so responsive and did not have extensive collection. food was just okay opted for asian vegetarian. i am a pure vegetarian and i pre ordered it while booking tickets. but crew told vegetarian meal was not available when coming to me and then i have to argue with them to get my vegetarian meal. overall average experience for a world class airline  i had been in qatar airways before and it was way better.    i flew from london gatwick to brisbane via dubai returning via singapore and dubai. my flight from gatwick to dxb was extremely pleasant entertainment was great the a380 was excellent. food was great as well i cleared all the meals. the disappointing part of the journey were the cabin crew they just didnt seem available and welcoming. they just seemed to be very tired and were too much involved and busy in chatting among themselves. overall this leg was great apart from the cabin crew. dxb to bne was even worse in that field the flight was already very long which was stressful enough. i had a massive headache and when i consulted one member of the cabin crew she was a supervisor she just told me to go back to my seat and watch movies as they offered lots of choice. and that annoyed me i thought cabin crew were supposed to be of support during a flight. the return flights from bne to sin sin to dxb were excellent and even the crew were excellent and seemed professional and friendly. no comment on the dxb to lgw flight as it was well packed so the cabin crew were busy  other than that i slept the whole flight so cant say much.    i buy ticket and confirm to travel from dubai to bangkok. my fly departure is 1145am and i reach the counter 1010am where the staff inform me the flight is full and i need to get next flight  how is it full when i have ticket confirmed. i talk with supervisor who says sorry you cant to get this fly you can go on next flight and will give you free ticket for 1 year or refund money. i infom him i came to the counter before it closes and again he says sorry we cant help you. you buy ticket and is confirmed but they delay you to next flight  no more trust with emirates.    london heathrow to dubai. had heard great things about the airline and my wife and i were looking forward to the flightholiday. what a disappointment. the headphone jack was not working the recline button on my seat was not working. the seat itself was not completely fixed. it kept slipping.  when the food arrived my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasnt even hot. some passengers could not have their first choice meal. when we landed in dubai we had to be bussed to the terminal. the return flight was worse. seating in the middle of the middle row seats ef is definitely a mistake. the cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. they kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. we only wanted a cup of tea. they even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. there was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. we found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional.  all in all a pretty disappointing experience.  the a380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but i feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry. will only use this airline if i really have too. we had a wonderful holiday in dubai but the return flight left a bad taste in the mouth.\\r\\r\\n    i booked the flights from manchester to melbourne via dubai through carlton leisure and was surprised that qantas airways were working in partnership with emirates. the flight i am reviewing is flight manchester to dubai on 6th november. the seats were comfortable and there was plenty of room to move around during the flight. however it was very obvious that the crew were struggling to provide a service. the flight lasted for 8 hours and within that time we only recived 2 cups of water which had to be asked for. once the meals were brought round i was told that there were no more of what i wanted and had to settle for a the second choice. a few minutes later i saw one of the cabin crew serving my original choice and asked if i could change my meal. the reply from the cabin crew was that it was the last one. on opening the meal it looked as if it had been put through a blender and only ate half of the meal due to the fact that i was so hungry with only two cup of water previously.  my partner and i will not be flying with emirates again.   new york jfk to guangzhou via dubai with emirates. where is the service heading does their management know the avml food on this route specially from jfk is horrible. staff are becoming lazy and so talkative amongst themselves rather than focussing on the service. water bottles are so small you have to keep asking for water and then an attitude is shown to you by the staff. i know this is a growing airline but if the growth is not controlled it will be a downfall for them soon.    dubai to bangkok via hong kong. never again emirates business class we flew from dubai to hong kong and a few days later to bangkok. on all flights the staff service was really bad. cabin crew busy inviting guys from economy to the bar and taking photos with them. during this time i was not able to order a drink at the bar  the bar seems to be more a playground for the crew than a place for first and business class passengers. all aircrafts were in a bad shape and dirty. dinner service was not able to let me dine with my partner together on both flights. qatar airways is much better   boston to hyderabad via dubai. emirates used to be good but standards have fallen. 13 hour flight from boston to dubai and the entertainment system did not work all the way and a few other passengers had the same issue. preordered vegetarian food was not served and they came up with an excuse that they are running short. quantity and quality of the food has decreased. need to do lot of work to regain the old standards.    newcastle to bangkok via dubai. we always fly with emirates when going to thailand as usually the service is excellent. we boarded the flight at newcastle and found our seats were not the ones i had booked back in march i told a member of the cabin crew and she said she would get her supervisor that didnt happen so when we arrived in krabi minus our luggage because that was left in bangkok due to the late arrival our our dubai flight i emailed emirates only to be told it could have been operational reasons we were bumped but i feel really strongly that we are being fobbed off by them. why bother giving you the option to book seats then move you anyway. what makes another passenger better than me and why should they get the seat id booked all those months in advance. i have since replied to them and asked the question again. i think the cabin crew are not as attentive as they used to be either. i know to some people the seat saga is petty but its a big thing to me. all i hope is we get the seats we booked on our return flights. i will not say i wont fly with them again but it has made me think there maybe better airlines out there to try.    san francisco to kolkata via dubai. dubai happens to be a great midpoint between san francisco and india and is also a nice city. i have flown many times with emirates business class from sfo to india via dubai. however my last flight with them in september was the worst and that is what this review is about.  really bad food on the flights  so much so that for much of the flight i stayed hungry. i am not particularly finicky about food. this is not an issue with dubai to india shorter flight but a real issue for sfo to dxb. on this occasion i swapped my business class seat with my wifes economy class. extremely rude staff started an argument whether i can visit my wife in business class. this was lodged as a complaint with emirates but i did not hear anything in the last 3 months. so rude staff and ineffective management that does nothing even on feedback. wife was pregnant and unwell threw up on the flight in the business class seat and requested that i be called from the economy section for a few minutes. the confused staff bumbled around for a few minutes and did nothing.      seattle to thiruvananthapuram via dubai.  i was travelling with my kids which includes an infant. the staff on the flight from seattle to dubai were rude and noncooperative. i requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infants meal. at the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggages were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people.  i had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. the tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. with a one year old how many hours can i handle the tray on requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. all of them responded in a very arrogant manner. the passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. i had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. the screen infront of my seat was not working. i just wanted it to be switched off. the crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. apparently he came after 5 hrs. the airlines says that they take care of people who are travelling with kids which is not true. the other passengers elder people were so kind that they offered to hold the baby for a few minutes so that i can use the restroom. on our return flight i had requested for glutenfree meal which was provided in the flight from trv to dubai but was denied on the flight from dubai to seattle stating that i had not made the choice even though i had opted for it in all the flights to and fro. i do want to thank the crew on the flight from dubai to thiruvananthapuram who were helpful and accommodating. they helped me out without even requesting. they took care of the baby so that i could use the restroom and also made sure that the passengers travelling with kids had a comfortable pleasant flight.    islamabad to bologna via dubai before booking flight i checked the ratings of all airlines because i wanted my mother to have a comfortable flight. i wont be using this airline again.  flight was delayed for more than an hour due to bad weather which one can ignore. however flight from islamabad to dubai was ok even though the airplane was not very clean. staff was cooperative. but as soon as we landed in dubai we were like stranded. there was no counter or any staff to help us or guide us. the fellow passengers were helpful enough to guide us. we had 18 hrs connecting flight to bologna. it took us more than a hour to find the emirates counter regarding hotel room. my mother cannot walk a lot. finally when we found the counter and asked for hotel room emirates staff was rude and denied us room. finally seeing condition of my mother i offered to pay for the room. even then the woman sitting on counter said her shift was over and she wont help us out we should wait till after 5 our flight landed in duabi at 300pm. after waiting for almost an hour the emirates took around 1100 dirhams from us for one night stay visa fee included. but all this process took around 4 hrs as we reached hotel at 730 pm  extremely exhausted. when we thought all that was bad was behind us the flight to bologna turned out to be even a worse experience. the air hostesses were not cooperative at all. the rating i give for cabin staff service is only because of staff in flight from islamabad to dubai.    bangkok to hong kong. purchased the ticket last minute due to sudden change of plan approached check in desk 60 minutes before a supposedly 1345 departure and was told off about being late. once airside boarding was not announced until 1345 and flight departed at 1500. there were many emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. clearly bangkoks gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of a380 passengers and it was jam packed. no effort was made by the emirates ground staff to separate passengers. boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. once on board cabin crew was cold. the lady responsible for the area i sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent english when distributing the meal tasteless and cold curry chicken rice and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley diet coke for example the request would fall on deaf ear. despite such rudeness service was slow and inefficient. they only served the meal one hour after take off and barely managed to collect the trays at top of descent. inflight entertainment was good and a saving grace so that you do not have to speak with the crew.    paris to kuala lumpur via dubai.i am disappointed with emirates. the entertainment is excellent the food is good the seat is comfortable the aircraft is clean the staff are okay. my flight from paris to dubai was delayed 3 hours because of bad weather. the ground staff at paris reassured us that we will be taken care of if we missed our connecting flight. we landed at dubai at about 10.20 pm instead of the scheduled 9.40 pm. we need about 510 minutes to get off the plane and proceed to the transit area. there were 2 staff holding boards for the bangkok flight passengers and other destination. we checked the departure screen and read that our connecting flight was boarding. all of the kuala lumpur flight passengers ran to the gate just to know that the flight had departed at 10.30 pm. we were very shocked. if it had waited 10 more minutes all of the passangers would not be stranded at the dubai airport on new years eve. we were forced to queue at the ground office for hours to find our flight home. my family got lucky. we got our flight home after standing for 2 and a half hours. we were rerouted flying from dubai to kuala lumpur via dhaka using bangladesh airlines. we paid for emirates got biman and extra trouble of tracing our baggage. amazing way to start the year. i would be much grateful if the ground staff and the cabin staff had communicated better and at least some direction or guidance from the emirates for the lost passengers. i would be happy to never fly with emirates again.    birmingham to male return via dubai. unfortunately emirates has declined over the last few years and now i try my best to avoid using them. i had problems both legs of the return journey. firstly our flight got cancelled from maldives which caused a lot of stress and losses time and money. they gave some skywards miles as goodwill gesture which were worthless. i have been going back and forth with their customer affairs team but getting nowhere. on the second leg home the service was diabolical never have i experienced such bad customer service. emirates really need to sort out their customer service.    a family trip from jakarta to jeddah via dubai. seat was okay while inflight entertainment was various. the screen from jakarta to dubai was more interactive as it was a newer type of screen depends on which aircraft onell fly with. food had a middleeastern style taste and it was unexpectedly good. wifi was available but didnt check it out. on the other hand staffs were curt. the use of please from staffs can be increased. on the bright side everyone still did their job. in a nutshell hospitality can be enhanced.   cape town to sydney via dubai. emirates has to be the worst airline i have ever travelled with. they state on your ticket that you are allowed 30kg of checked in baggage. however when you check in this changes to two 23kg bags. now because most passengers are over 23kg and are not in a position to buy a new bag at the airport they let you get out of the dilemma by paying 75 usa. most passengers i met on board stated they had to pay this amount. when myself and the other passengers inquired about this amount to ground staff we were all rudely told you need to read the fine print and that it a new emirates policy. i was also shouted at by the senior manager in cape town because i asked him to explain why this policy was in place. after we argued for almost 30 mins he turned to the other ground staff and started laughing. they also ran out of food and i had to miss dinner despite paying for this service. staff on board also dont seem to like their job as they dont respond to the assistance light and frequently forget what they told you. as a frequent traveller to all parts of the world this is the worst airline i have ever flown. emirates has become an arrogant airline which now seems to accept bad service and rude staff. i will never travel with them ever again.    \\r\\r\\nflew emirates from dubai to mumbai. frequent flyer with emirates. modern aircrafts with the best inflight entertainment and good meals. dedicated terminal in dubai with excellent facilities. overall comfortable. snobbish staff. worst thing about this airline  stingy on drinks on dubaimumbai route. almost all flights on dubaimumbai routes are always delayed by 30 mins. offers very expensive tickets on long routes compared to other airlines taking advantage of being able to offer those routes nonstop.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    pure nightmare. i travelled with a 4yrs old who has special needs. i was allocated a seat in the upper deck which is close to business class. my seat was changed a few minutes before boarding with this unbelievable reason your child has autism so he cant seat near the business area we were then moved to the lower deck to the end of the plane from 27 to 87 where we could enjoy the toilet flushing sound throughout the 7hrs flight from dubai to birmingham. not only that i was relying on my sons pushchair as he gets tired walking long distance. they lost the first pushchair on the way to dubai texted me the next day and asked me to collect it had to take taxi from sharjah to dubai waited in the lost luggage office for hours to be told the text message was wrong and they havent yet found the pushchair. ok organized another pushchair and this was again lost on the way back to birmingham. i have been calling their call center for the last 10 days every time talked to a new person but same reply we will email birmingham airport they will get back to you  so far nothing has happened and i had to buy a new pushchair for my son.     dubai to manila. i am a first time emirates passenger. boarding process was disorganized. flight attendants seemed tired and never smiled. even if i said thank you not even a single response just nothing.  there was no amenity kit given to economy passengers. food was soso. onboard announcements before take off and landing was rushed. i am not happy with my first time with them but i have a return flight to dubai with emirates and i hope it will be a better experience from the first one.    flew emirates from dubai to london heathrow. four hour delay before takeoff due to a technical problem only apparent after we had taxied to the runway for takeoff. food service offered but never materialised. child meals later provided were unhealthy and inedible. during both legs of the flight there was a mad panic from the aircrew attempting to ready the cabin for landing as if this had been delayed until the last possible moment. the flight deck reminding them that we were at 10000 feet and they really ought to be sitting down. at the end of the flight there was an announcement that i hope the delay hasnt caused too much inconvenience really arriving home at 1am instead of 9pm with young children missing the last tube glib nonsense.\\r\\r\\n    christchurch to sydney. after our qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the emirates desk being checked in for ek413 to sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience. we have flown emirates before and had reservations which had led us to avoid them for this trip to new zealand. unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. the plane was brilliant newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. the main problem is with the service and staff. business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. when i informed the attendant that i did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. her solution was to give me an economy main course and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. the staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of english. my wife and i asked two simple questions of the attendants one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. i did not have a dedicated attendant for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. no hot drinks were served after the meal. if you are paying a business class fare you expect value for money. i know we were transferred at short notice but by taking us we were still entitled to expect certain standards.    paris to melbourne via dubai. economy class is never going to be that comfortable but the a380 from paris to dubai was okay and felt quite spacious. changed onto a boeing 777 in dubai for the 13.5 hour flight to melbourne  ouch this aircraft was so cramped width of seat excruciating and has put me off every choosing emirates again. the fare was cheap and now i know why entertainment onboard was good but couldnt distract from the pain and discomfort. to anyone thinking of emirates on this melbourne route think again and choose another airline.    dubai to beijing in business class and what a mistake. i could have routed through doha or abu dhabi but emirates was a little cheaper for business class and now i know why. the boeing 777 had seats in this cabin arranged 2x3x2 and being in the middle block i couldnt believe how cramped uncomfortable and positively horrible this is. one expects this from premium economy but not business. the ife was okay but i had expected something much more and realised they bulk up the quantity by many multi national offerings and a plethora of old not proper classic movies that other airlines wouldnt bother with. the cabin staff performed their duties not with any friendliness or courtesy and im glad my return route flights are arranged with china southern who at least offer proper flat bed seats and comfort in business class. never again via dubai with emirates.    london heathrow to dubai. the service we received today was appalling. this is the second time we have flown with this airline and the service has been consistently poor. first of all the staff took over an hour for the trays to be cleared leaving us highly uncomfortable in our seats. the hostess snapped at me when i asked for the trays to be cleared reporting that she has 400 passengers to cater for. another staff snapped and told us we should wait when we requested for juice to eat our meal which was served an hour after everyone had eaten as our preferred choice had . . they even got my name wrong.    dubai to manchester. boarded the plane at the last minute owing to delayed previous flight. the cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. i did eventually get a drink but only after i specifically asked for one. a380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting at times outnumbering the passengers there. the main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. again the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. in flight entertainment was good. this was the sixth flight on business class with emirates within four months and each time i have been very disappointed with the product. service on the a380 seems to be very poor.    phuket to dubai. aircraft boarding was haphazard but everyone was boarded 10 minutes before departure time. there was then a delay of over 1 hour as a mother informed cabin crew that her son was unwell. eventually they were all offloaded and the flight departed 75 minutes late. during the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal both first and second choices were unavailable. eventually i ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. cabin crew service was hit and miss. seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the a380. no amenity packs were offered. arriving at dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection. discounting the delay i was not overly impressed with emirates and thought that the flight was poor value for money.    manchester to phuket via dubai. manchester check in and lounge very good. boarded a380 seats 11ef not as originally booked as aircraft changed to an a380 from boeing 777. personally i find the a380 very claustrophobic and the seat most uncomfortable there is limited room for elbows especially with the ice tablet and seat divider screen getting in the way. no matter how much i tried i could not get comfortable in the seat. cabin crew were friendly on boarding but during the flight they seemed very elusive. a walk to the bar area on several occasions found that passengers in the bar outnumbered by cabin crew. meals on this leg of the journey were less than memorable and service was poor i am still waiting for the cheeseboard to be served even though i reminded cabin crew three times that i had not received it. and where is the chocolate that is mentioned on the menus but is noticeable by its absence and there was no amenity kit provided is this a cost cutting measure on the dubai to phuket leg the seats were much more comfortable for me than on the a380. the boeing 777 was reasonably smart but was beginning to show signs of wear and tear cabin crew on this flight were ok but service was still below what it should be. meals again were not too good although we did get chocolates this time but only because we asked specifically for them. an amenity kit was provided on this flight. in view of the cost of the tickets i was disappointed at the level of service and the standard of food provided although the emirates lounge at manchester had exceptionally good food on offer.    hong kong to dubai. they blocked seats so when i tried to check in online 48hr before i was stuck in the seat they assigned me. we were a family of four travelling together. we were separated in the huge a380. i cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. i called the customer service and also raised my concern with their social media team the feedback i got was that all passengers had already checked in by then  which was ridiculous. and they refused to help. their staff told me in a quite rude way that i shouldve paid a lot more for a better cabin. second on the flight from dubai to hong kong they ran out of food food not food selection when the trolly reached me. i asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengersseats on board and the flight attendant at first said that this should be expected by passengers and asked if i wanted to have cup noodle instead. until later she said that was a mistake. she then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staffs meal but i can take it any staff will have no meal during the flight i refused. later on when they started to collect leftovers miraculously the flight attendant found one meal and wanted to offer to me. this is disgusting. this is simply the worst experience ever.    new york to male via dubai. i am sitting in the maldives a day later than i was supposed to arrive waiting for a sea plane for two hours because emirates overbooked my flight from dubai to the maldives. they kicked my husband and i off the flight with absolutely no other option. so we had to get up at 1am and take 430am flight to get into the maldives a day late. their rude clerks informed me this was my only option. since we had to reschedule our sea plane to our island i am stuck at another airport waiting for hours since all flights for today were already booked. oh did i mention this is supposed to be my honeymoon. emirates cost me a day and a half at my beach resort on my honeymoon. their consolation round trip tickets are all well and good except i dont have any time off of work to travel again and we really cant afford another vacation.  their airline is supposed to be elite but my experience has been inconvenient rude frustrating demeaning and enraging. this is unacceptable.    emirates a380 from manchester to dubai was modern and comfortable and staff although friendly and polite were kept very busy by a fullish flight. ife probably the best in the sky and on a decent sized screen too. from dubai to jakarta was a much older plane with smaller screens but attendants just as nice. what let this airline down was the food. first flight they had only chicken left when they got to me so even though i was hungry i declined but imagine my surprise when later i saw the cabin crew tucking into the left over beef meals including the stewardess who had served me. on the second flight i was served what is probably the worst beef meal i have ever witnessed on a plane so again nothing to eat. my moto now is bring your own sandwiches whether the airline is budget or supposed premium class.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    warsaw to bangkok via dubai. the planes were dirty. cabin crew was inattentive and mixed orders several times and i found the business class food to be mediocre  seemed like an economy meal but on normal plates. the business class lounge in dubai is overcrowded with long queues to the bathrooms. the food in the lounge is fine.     singapore to melbourne. before boarding i was paged to see the ground staff which i did and was asked by a rude staff if i could change my exit row seat for another passenger wishing to seat as a couple. i said no. then during the messy boarding process i was refused boarding and directed to go back to the counter to see another ground staff i was made to wait and treated as if i had done something wrong. the staff later took my boarding pass with an annoyed look clicked on her computer and handed back to me without a word. no explanation no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. on boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief steward. she was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. why should i be inconvenienced at the expense of others  am i not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect the service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. some were though to be fair so forgivable. but after the main course served the crew disappeared until time for a small second meal prior to landing which was a cold muffin and cold roll for breakfast  really bad no orange juice the crew just said dont have and that was it. no water runs between meals. before landing crew collected the blankets and started to drag them around passengers and dumped into the toilets overall an average mediocre flight crew service not very professional. i was so tired and exhausted from this flight. emirates is dropping in standards.    karachi to london via dubai. truly disappointed with emirates and the overall quality of service thats provided. my flight from karachi to dubai was really comfortable. however in dubai the business class lounge was like you had arrived at the bus depot  big and impersonal. the staff was stoic and looked as if they would rather be anywhere but where they were. this is the second time while travelling business class the crew has informed me that they are running short on the main entree and i could not have the food at s later time as they were warming all the food together. the food which came looked unappealing and dry. i will try my best not to travel emirates again. its become impersonal and now have an i dont care attitude.    zurich to cebu return vua dubai.  on the outbound there had been no weighing of carry ons. on the return i used eboarding passes.  when went to board the second flight at dxb they weighed my carry ons at the gate and asked me to pay 241. this would have made the return 40 more expensive than the full ticket price. after some screaming they let me on without paying. the other sheep all paid and there were a lot of them. if you want to weigh something weigh people and carry ons together. that would be fair.    cape town to london via dubai. flew emirates on family recommendations and to be honest they were okay but not worth the hype. the 777 with the 343 configuration is uncomfortable and cramped. asking 20 per leg to select seats is robbery when you are only transiting from one aircraft to another. that would have added 160 to the price of 2 return tickets. the crew were indifferent and did not really communicate with you they were distant i asked for a drink with my meal which never arrived and part of my meal tray was missing but by then i had given up. they seemed disorganised at service times. on 4 flights only had one comfort bag with socks eye mask and toothbrush in.  the a380 was a much nicer aircraft and reasonably comfortable and we did have a spare seat next to us. food was again okay. overall pay a bit more and go qatar airways.     dubai to bangkok. used to be a very frequent flier on emirates but standards have deteriorated more and more. this flight was probably my last one for me with that airline. very nice plane but extremely mediocre service. staff mostly seemed more interested in enjoying themselves in the back of the plane than to look after passengers. food was also rather uninteresting staff forgot to offer any drinks with the meal very impersonal service. not that flight was full.    dusseldorf to shanghai return via dubai. j all in all not an excellent experience with emirates being the leg from shanghai to dubai the worst. boeing 777 aircraft in 232 configuration in business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. the seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. also remarkable for me that emirates provided only on the night flight from dubai to shanghai an amenity kit. the content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. seen much better kits eg. turkish airlines or even at tap portugal. in general the a380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in a380. seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. as noticed from others fellows in this forum seems to be a hit or miss. though always announced from the cockpit as award winning cabin crew i was unfortunate and got too often the miss. only exception was the crew on the b777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. food always better in the lounges than on board. highlight for me the emirates lounge in düsseldorf. for me the best food offer and comfort level i had in a lounge. will recommend emirates but image is better than reality.   bangkok to new york via dubai. very unfortunate experience on my latest emirates flight. im a skywards member that flew in late february 2017 and had a poor experience. later i made a complaint via email including the details. they took more than 5 weeks to reply and then just told me it never happened. from what i understand this is par for the course with their customer service. im horrified by the customer service for this toprated airline. i wont be flying them again.    dubai to lisbon ek191 on 17th april. was this the same airline as we flew out on the check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination faro but not us this created a bit of a problem for the tap staff at lisbon. on boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was noone to welcome us to our normal 47k seat in the rear cabin. there was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. continental breakfast was served but the coffeetea forgotten  our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told okay but it will be cold. after this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed  coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course which to add to our dismay was tough grisly beef. the whole service seemed to lack leadership which comes from the cabin supervisor  so if anyone from emirates reads this i would hope they investigate. on the good side the flight was on time seat comfortable and flight crew informative.    dubai to warsaw on may 4th 2017. we were boarded on bus which supposed to take us to the plane and waited inside closed bus for 40 minutes with no information. bus driver didnt spoke english. doors were closed all that time due to safety reasons.  after 40 min we entered plane which was apparently not prepared. cabin temperature was very hot.  after 10 minutes everything shuts down on the plane.  captain said that we have another technical issue which should be solved shortly and we take off. another 20 min passed. engines start to work again. no changes in temperature. no one offered water. i asked two times flight attendants for water they went away never came back. third time i asked senior flight attendant he gave me little bottle. finally air started to chill a little 3 minutes before departure. total delay 1 hour 50 minutes. why we were board to bus and brought to the plane if it was not ready and no staff provided clear comments what was going on. simply to serve water for everyone would be very kind thing to do and just to clarify what is going on.     mauritius to london via dubai. very disappointed in emirates  i believed them to be a premium airline however we upgraded twice to business and both times were denied lounge access. the service onboard was also not great. emailed customer services but no response as yet. would not bother flying with them again.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    johannesburg to newcastle via dubai. this is the second return flight with emirates to south africa. emirates may have competitive fares but this is not an award winning airline from my experience. the service on the last flights were poor especially the johannesburg to dubai leg cabin staff nowhere to be seen no water or juice offered inflight and the snack advertised a sandwich but this was also not offered and had to be asked for. the worst thing was that i had purchased the flex fare which costs more than the saver but allows advance booking of seats. emirates changed the aircraft a month before the flight but did not notify and the seat configuration was different meaning i was seated in a location i had not selected. customer service was not interested and i received a poor response. i will be looking to use another airline in future.    chennai to adelaide via dubai. emirates let me down. i had a lot of expectations as i frequently fly with qatar and etihad and based on what i heard expected emirates to be outstanding. chennaidubai flight was outstanding refurbished aircraft a6ecl the food was amazing excellent legroom and crew were top class. but then came dubai to adelaide. i ended up flying on a old boeing 777 a6egw which had old unresponsive ife not touch screen the crew were pretty much nonexistent the whole flight. i had no legroom for that 12hr flight im 62. the crew did not wake me up to eat even though i had the wake me up to eat sign up they didnt give me my australian immigration card. sure you might say they didnt want to wake me up but they didnt even take the courtesy to put the immigration card in my seat pocket because of that i had to go to adelaide and get one at the airport security there to fill when others just went past me. alas i was not the only one they left out another 45 people without immigration cards too. the only thing good about emirates is their infight meals. what im most surprised about is how come a short haul flight is excellent and long haul flight a disaster emirates really need to get their heads together.    right from ticketing counter to boarding the flight from bangalore to san francisco via dubai on emirates was the worst. boarding at blr airport by emirates ground staff was an absolute mess. no announcements of gate changes or boarding by seat rows. at dubai airport we found out our prebooked seats were changed and given really bad seats. when complained and talked to the supervisor at the emirates customer service was complete disregard to customers. on board the flight we have preordered special meals was not even acknowledged by the crew. when informed about the preordered the meals the crew rudely said they have to check their paperwork. is that a customer issue or fault seats are extremely hard and uncomfortable. this is our first and last travel on emirates.    sometimes i think emirates forget they have passengers. beautiful aeroplanes but thats where it stops. got an upgrade to business flying from birmingham to dubai but wow did we know we were not a premium flyer. no lounge no fast track menu was mediocre and after a 7 hour overnight flight no breakfast. probably the worst thing though is that feedback can only happen via their forms which they dont answer. the customer service emails dont work. overall there are more caring airlines at cathay singapore or qatar airways. think twice.    dubai to singapore. emirates was disappointing compared to singapore airline or other major carriers like qatar airways. would not recommend flying with them as they damaged my bag admitted it but didnt want to resolve it.  i would recommend that you watch out with this airline of damaging your things severely and then absolutely not caring as theres nothing you can do to protect yourself. very unresponsive staff across the organization which is not ideal. everything seems like its done in a backdoor manner.    london to melbourne via dubai. i am a skywards gold member for over a decade. the quality of service is a bit hit and miss. i have noted that they dont strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy and business over more loyal passengers. i will be considering taking my business elsewhere as they dont reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore. to add insult to injury it is now impossible to use miles to upgrade on flights out of london now    bahrain to nairobi via dubai. the emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the dxb to nbo sector is arbitary. i have flown emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in dxb. each economy passenger was directed as per airline policy to weigh all cabin bags including those containing duty free items. the response from emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. i understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. however i have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. returning on the nbo to dxb sector no similar policy applied same for the dxb to bah leg. emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag bought in dxb duty free loaded into the hold one option used by some airlines. overall if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as we are the best in our view what you are left with is an economy service that includes food ife and cabin crew. my conclusion is very much buyer beware.   i was flying from perth to colombo with qantas but the flight from singapore to colombo is operated by emirates. as soon as i got in the flight the crew was very friendly and even helped me with my hand luggage since i had a shoulder injury. once the flight took of it was very hard to speak anyone in the crew. i even had to wait for more than 20 minutes for staff to answer the call bell. this was not the first time experienced this type of behaviour as my previous flight to colombo from perth via dubai everyone in the crew had a huge attitude.    ahmedabad to los angeles return via dubai. an additional amount was paid after few days for pre selection of seats. the seat selection was changed thereafter. a web checkin for my return journey from los angeles was done on 12th june. after initial food selection of vegetarian hindu meal while purchasing the tickets on all 3 subsequent occasions the seat preselection change in seat and web check in the meal selection of vegetarian hindu meal was repeatedly confirmed. after boarding the flight the food offered to me was either chickenlamb. on specifically asking for pre selected vegetarian meal i was told by the staff that my name was not on the vegetarian list at all and was asked to wait till meal was serving was over. i was never approached again for food vegetarian fruits bread or even cookies. the only food i was offered was a small pizza & then a breakfast which was eggsham.    we flew from dubai at 2.45am to sydney and were served breakfast about 4.30am. this was a decent meal but we were not offered anything more until 9 hrs later when the next meal was supplied not even water. after 7 hrs i went back to the curtained area and requested some water. there were about four flight attendants chatting and laughing behind the curtains. when we flew singapore airlines they could not do enough for you. were were constantly asked if we needed water and they supplied fruit snacks and ice creams. very disappointed in emirates.    good bye emirates. in january i booked flights with emirates for my wife and me bangkok to rome via dubai returning munich to bangkok via dubai. due to endless amendments by emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. one month before departure i was informed that flight time from bangkok to dubai has been changed. usually not a big deal but i would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. on the flight munich – dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water referring that drinks like fanta or coke have to be purchased at the bar. what bar as we were flying economy. waiting for flight dubai to bangkok at the boarding area about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new etd will be 1345. right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. we found the new gate deserted leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights meals or drinks. after having breakfast on the munich to dubai flight at around 4am i expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2½ hours. about 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. at this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. finally boarding stated at 1405 instead of 1145 arriving at bangkok at 2345 instead of 2125. leaving us for uninformed hungry and thirsty stranded at dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with emirates claim to be the best airline in the world. under european legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in bangkok. with the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs unless you are willing to pay extra  for a saver ticket and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25usd per person emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers while asking for premium rates. as a result of their new policy and the unacceptable mistreatment during our recent trip we will avoid flying emirates in the future.    singapore to melbourne. the flight didnt start well as the departure was delayed for over an hour an no announcements were made. once boarded we found the cabin configuration rather cramped. lie flat beds were satisfactory but fairly hard and narrow. there is no convenient place to store small items while sleeping. overhead lockers were good. the mainly female flight attendants were distant and in some cases unfriendly. service was poor. cabin supervisor was good but he couldnt be everywhere. overall it was a very disappointing flight.    tokyo to zagreb via dubai. i will never again fly with this airline because of the luggage allowance and inflight service.  normally airlines allow one piece of checked in luggage and one carry on when you fly intercontinental and then they charge you per extra piece of luggage. but no emirates allow only 30 kg checked in and 8 kg 1 piece only carry on everything extra is charged 100 usd per kg. since i also had my backpack i would only carry on that and had to check in my two suitcases and one carry on.  the flight attendants kept talking out loud in the back of the plane i was seated in the back so could hear them the entire time. apart from serving meals they rarely passed through the plane to see if passengers needed anything.     bangkok to london via dubai for the 2nd time in the last 18 months. i feel that on several levels the emirates product has declined in quality. being 2m tall i normally never have issues with being allocated an exit row seat so that i can sit without my legs being restricted by the seat in front of me. 2 weeks prior to flying i had called the emirates call center and spoke to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that exit seats are only allocated on arrival at the airport. fair enough i got to bkk early and was allocated an exit row seat on the flight to dubai. i was told that i would then need to be allocated an exit row seat in dubai. upon arrival at dubai which was 3 hours before the flight departed i was told that all seats had been allocated. nothing could be done. thats it. surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating other issues. toilets were filthy and were not cleaned during the flight. the cabin crew were rarely seen and seemed quiet content to serve a passenger excess alcohol who was later abusive to passengers. again cabin crew were not concerned to sort or prevent this issue. if you want to treated like a herd of cattle then emirates are a good option. if you are looking for some basic comforts then there are many better options.    cairo to dubai and i requested for a wheel chair for my mother which was ok in cairo but once i reached dubai they bring her a wheel chair but after two minutes they said sorry your mother name isnt listed in wheelchair request. i said it is already requested from egypt. one very aggressive guy replied you have to wait at least 30 min. i requested to meet any supervisor or manager from emirates but they said no body available and it is your mistake you have to check that wheelchair service include in case emirates missed it. i called customer service supervisor for 45 min to complain and at the end he said please send your complaint via email nothing we can do for you right now.  even though after finish my trip i sent my complaint without any feed back. totally unprofessional careless about people it is just brand name but in fact nothing.    singapore to london return via dubai. its my 3rd time flying with emirates. this time i flew from singapore to london transited in dubai for 12 hours. their seats and entertainment are good and comfortable. but we are not impressed by the service of the staff. when i asked for hot tea the staff would say you can ask my colleague later which you have to wait till you see a staff passing by. the next staff would say the same thing to me too. we had problem checking in the return flight. but there was an error saying that check in is not possible for this flight. we immediately called emirates but the staff said online check in is not allowed at heathrow airport and said we have to check in when we reach the airport the next day.  when we reached the airport we were told that our return flight was canceled. we were not informed in advance. the staff ushered us to join a long queue which we stood queueing for almost two hours when we asked what happen can we get another flight back to singapore the staff said you will get to choose an earlier or later flight or put up at a hotel. please talk to the next staff. the staff didnt even apologise. when we reached the counter staff asked for our passport focused on the computer and passed us our boarding pass for tomorrow noon. we didnt even get to choose so we asked if there is any other option as the one she gave us need to stay another night in the hotel and the transit at dubai airport is 10 hours. our flight in london was delayed 14 hours and to make matters worse the transit in dubai is 10 hours. and we were separated. we asked to get an earlier flight but again the staff said please talk to our staff when you reach dubai. she also asked us to reach the airport 4 hours before boarding tomorrow. we tried to enjoy our flight to dubai and when we reached we asked the staff to help us get an earlier to singapore. the price i bought for the ticket is for only 12 hours transit. 10 hours is too much. the staff said all the flights were full she could put us at a hotel in dubai. we rejected not wanting to stay another day in the hotel. the staff was then willing to help us and she managed to put us on an earlier flight and we were very thankful. the flight back to singapore was much better the staff  greeted us amicably. totally different from the previous crew.     london to bangkok via dubai. i hadnt used emirates for 3 years and was surprised at seeing many cuts. business class ticket was admittedly quite cheap versus other airlines but even at lower price i felt value for money was poor. seat comfort is not good and doesnt match many others i have flown in 20162017. food okay but nothing to mark this out as a premium cabin. ife is good although in reality it is not much different to the likes of singapore qatar etc just that they have loads of different languages and many very old films. dubai airport is now horrific i guess reflecting how downmarket dubai has become and lounge was no better than sitting at a coffee shop in the main terminal. this was a 1way ticket and quite pleased i opted for a very different return route  airline.    emirates customer service has certainly dropped their game since i last flew with them a few years ago. an overnight flight from barcelona to dubai  simple enough request for a toothbrush kit at end of flight to be advised they no longer do this. this is despite being given a kit only 2 weeks prior on a flight from sydney to dubai to which they answered they do as its long haul. also the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it could not eat it. if youre not an emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one. ill stick to qatar airways in future when flying from australia abroad far superior service.    san francisco to chenna via dubai. i had bad experience with the airhost. i was given a meal that i dont eat. upon requested to change the meal to the one i selected at the time of booking veggie the answer provided was that i did not select the meal. fact is that i did select the meal as soon as i booked my ticket. in fact later i called up the airline because i was unable to select infant meal for all the flights and confirmed that my meal is selected.  i spoke to the airhost and he replied with a question if i selected the meal. he said hell check the file and get back. he did not. when questioned he said he does not have any vegetarian meal. i asked for a fruit. that was my meal for lunch. for breakfast the airhost asked what would you like to have was given 2 choices. i said  the one i selected. he replied that he does not have. i thought they dont have the kind of breakfast i was seeking. i walked up to another hostess without the knowledge of this person and she gave me the veggie breakfast.  i was terribly upset tired with baby on my lap the whole time and hungry. i confronted with him on the flight questioning his conscience of how indifferent he could be. i asked who i should contact for this. his reply was that emirates does not handle the food and it is a 3rd party company.    johannesburg to mumbai via dubai. traveling in economy class i cannot complain about the space etc. i have an issue with the staff attitude to passengers. having travelled extensively on different airlines to europe usa far east i think im adequately qualified to to complain about the lack of courtesy meted out by emirates staff. they appeared to be a disgruntled lot who found it difficult to even crack a smile. a male attendant was particularly impatient with passengers asking for any service. even though my husband is a platinum skywards member i dont think i will be booking on this airline anytime soon. every passenger economy to first class deserves the same respect.    ahmedabad to dubai. i have a very bitter experience while flying today from emirates flight. i have been flying with emirates since past five years but this is happened first time with me. i have already booked online my seat no 22k however while taking boarding pass they changed my seat to 24k. free breakfast also not provided to me and they did not even have courtesy to ask for meal. while all other passenger got their meal and i feel that i am discriminated from others. even if you are providing complimentary services either you should have taken proper care for hospitality or better not to provide complimentary and not to advertise it on your itinerary.    i was traveling with my wife from tokyo to dubai on the 3rd of november ek319 we prebooked extra leg room seats which was an emergency exit for 95 per seat because its a 12 hours flight 80h this was my seat. first the crew were very noisy all the flight especially that we were beside the kitchen they were bumping us our legs heads even our screens every time all over the flight putting the food & wine boxes in front of us like a storage area which also hit our legs and putting the wine boxes on the emergency exit door which is not complying with the safety regulations. we complained and the crew told us that they always tell the company about these seats that it has a problem and they dont believe them so please complain when you reach dubai nothing we can do its a full flight no place to change. we stayed for 12 hours we couldnt even sleep for 1 hour from the noise of the crew it was the worst flight ever. when we went back to dubai we went to the service center to complain about the flight experience they told us we dont have complain system you only can complain online by email. we sent our complain and wrote all the details and even the safety issues that was not applied during the flight & unfortunately they came back to us after two weeks with nothing. the flight was the worst flight experience and the customer service was disaster in case of handling our complains we paid extra money for noisy seats with untrained crew that no nothing about service treating our seats as if its a storage area and know nothing about safety guidelines.   the one area that consistently disappoints with emirates is their service. i have consistently experienced poor service flying business class with them. ive often found their economy class staff service to be much better surprisingly. i just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in business class. approached the business class checkin person in dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. no smiles no conversation nothing did her work handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. not a word was spoken. i was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with a380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. at the gate there was no separate boarding for business  first class waited in the long line with everyone. once we got into the flight we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. i was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to toronto had even started. a quick word of apology was muttered and i was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. i returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. i asked for one more towel and never got it. later during the flight i asked for a headphone for my child and the response i got was one was placed on every seat. thats it. i had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. every time the same lady came to clear my table  seat of any clutter or finished meal i was motioned to place them on her tray. it was like she couldnt be bothered to reach out and pick them up. so i spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. the whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children my 3 year olds presence was not once acknowledged the only gesture was a childs goodie bag being handed out. we also experienced similarly disappointing service at the emirates checkin counter at toronto airport on our way back to dubai. no smile no word. i asked if the flight was full to which i got the reply wait i am trying to read something here. never ended up getting an answer. the service on the flight economy class this time was however excellent. i commended them on their efforts. makes me wonder though why the such a difference in service between the two classes if at all one should experience better service for business class yea i have encountered similar experiences in previous flights with them as well  generally rude and snobbish flight attendants in business class while the opposite is true for economy class.   the positives for emirates is to do with the aircraft as the a380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. the list of negatives is quite big  crew members didnt bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. even worse when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. long literally long queues at lavatories. crew didnt assist at all. i do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. they could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didnt serve because you were sleeping. having two options for dinner when you promote yourself as top carrier is quite limited. saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers particular flight was almost fully booked is laughable. some people do not eat chicken sounds strange but i do not eat it i can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef actually i do not understand it but anyway but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse actually they did not refuse just didnt bother to reply and moved on to take it back. cabin wifi is great as an idea. if only someone could say how to activate it on economy class.    this was our first flight using emirates from glasgow to sydney via dubai and it will be our last. we were looking forward to flying emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. the reality was quite the opposite. the flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. the staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. we met with dour stony faces  no smile genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. we felt more like an inconvenience. once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. the meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. the return leg was no better in fact worse. we experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle and woe betide anyone in their way. if we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. meal service was again slow and very sloppy. the attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. she did get some cloths but the stains havent come out. the other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband  are they not taught how to serve customers we were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. the final thank you for flying emirates sounded matter of fact and so insincere. on the return we missed our connection from brisbane to dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. we were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. when we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers comfort. this is by far the worst airline i have ever flown with even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. next time we fly to australia we will use singapore airlines again  far superior.   we are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance emirates flights. in our recent experience there was only one meal served during our flight from manchester to dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. a tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. there were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. on the dubai to kolkata flight duration of 4 hours the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks which were tiny packets of savoury mix to fill in. not to mention the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. desserts were horrendous. we dread boarding our already booked return flight back to manchester.    london to perth via dubai. it is 10 years since we last used emirates on this route and they have really gone down the budget airline path since then. plane to perth looked worn and quite dirty in the cabin staff service bordered on downright rude and those serving our seating area clearly had some issues about having to work. dubai airport has assumed the role of a large characterless giant warehouse and the airport staff for emirates seem to delight in shouting at passengers and showing contempt to all. i admit the tickets were really cheap and now i realise that emirates is going down the budget airline path with what they provide. can only assume they have financial problems to have cut back so much on what they once provided.    dubai to cairo. emirates has become mass transit in their economy class. people are herded like cattle the plane is crammed with little room and the staff is overworked as usually 100 of seats are occupied. probably great for their bottom line but its not anymore a special airline. it gets you from a to b safely and theres nice entertainment. thats it.    perth to manchester via dubai returning from paris. we have traveled with emirates business class many times in the past and although not perfect we have never had cause for complaint until now. we traveled to manchester from perth on 4th september 2017. our flight to manchester was uneventful. however the walk including train to our connecting flight ek19 was horrendous. it took at least 30 minutes to get from terminal 3 to terminal 1. considering there is no significant layover time between flights if the incoming flight from perth had been delayed we would have missed the manchester flight. another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. many uk expats live in perth and would have been connecting to the manchester flight why was this flight from terminal 1 and not terminal 3 the experience on our return flight flights was even worse. the service and food on the flight from paris to dubai from 30th september 2017 ek76 was unacceptable. food was cold soup and a steak that i ordered was uneatable. i asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after i had finished my meal. seats were also very uncomfortable. once again a walk and train for our flight to perth ek424. when the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. i have had a better embarkation experience with airasia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of emirates reputation. the flight arrived in perth over an hour late obviously due to the embarkation process. with the exception of the return flight from dubai to perth ek424 food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. the business class lounge in dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. the highlight of the flight was the food and service in the emirates paris business lounge. it is a shame that emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. we travel business class to europe at least once every year and more often than not with emirates. given the above experience it will be hard to choose emirates as our carrier in the future.    barcelona to melbourne via dubai.  we were looking forward to flying with emirates  we hadnt flown with them before and had heard good things. but unfortunately the customer service or lack thereof from the flight attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. i have written over a month ago to the emirates feedback form on their website but have not had any response  perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints for a start none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. i didnt really think anything of it at first until i realised how uncomfortable i felt with the sour faces around me. about an hour into the flight i thought i would use the restroom. i was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat row 56. i had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so i walked forward too where i could see the toilet sign. a male flight attendant asked me where i was going i said to the toilet. im going to the restroom. he shouted back get back. go back and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. i was shocked at his attitude and aggression that i returned to my seat. he came over to me and said you can use the toilet at the back of the plane. i explained that i had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that i felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. he said i could use the toilet towards the front if i wanted. i have no idea how many international and domestic flights i have been on in my 48 years but i have never been spoken to like that  with so little provocation  the other flight attendants were equally rude no communication or attempt at being polite or friendly. an hour and a half before we landed in dubai they literally pulled blankets off people and demanded headsets and were more concerned with shoving all the blankets into the toilet cubicles than with the passengers waiting to use the restrooms. many of the passengers in dubai were talking about how rude the flight attendants had been and why they had to take blankets and headsets from people so early unfortunately they were not much better from dubai to melbourne. again no smiles no warmth  they would say drink with raised eyebrows no smile and when i would say an orange juice please they would place it onto a tray and just shove the tray into my face without a word. literally into my face. i am writing because i had heard good things about emirates  but the flight attendants have really let the company down.  on a long haul flight the last thing customers need we who are paying their wages is such surly faces around us. we are not doing you a favour by being on the plane    dubai to mumbai. food served extremely late just before 1 hour landing time though the flight duration was about 3 hours. no drinks before except water. we were in seatsr 84j84k in zone c. til our food was being served non veg food over. they served veg food. i asked for mango juice. no juice. juice also over. instead they served orange juice. til i complete my dinner it was almost landing time. no time to eat properly or appreciate the food.    dubai to perth. i initially travelled from cairo to dubai on ek 924 for which i gave an excellent review but the flight to perth was terrible. staff were not even friendly nor were they interested in their passengers. i asked for a seatbelt extension and this flight attendant stood two seats away asking me to repeat what id said before she very unhappily went to fetch one. i did not have breakfast however lunch arrived with the hostess telling us chicken on the menu would be 15 min late well that never arrived nor did an apology from staff. they were standing behind the curtain and eating snacks no concern for their passengers or if they attended we felt like a nuisance so dare not ask. i tried to write a review online but that wasnt working either. all in all they were the most miserable flight attendants ive ever travelled with we only heard from the captain and that was it the flight itself was uneventful    new york to delhi return via dubai. the staff  did not seem properly trained. the communication is difficult because some staff cant speak english very well.  at delhi airport i was three hours early ready to get on board but some  employee told me to stand in line to get checked in. they didnt properly guide us or let us board the flight. the line was extremely long and it took me 1.5 hours to get checked in. i discussed my issues with one of the employees and told him i am not happy with the service. his response was very poor and he seemed to not understand the issue. on the flight to delhi we requested an asian meal but they denied to gave us an asian meal on the flight which i found very strange. after reaching dubai the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. i asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was ssss which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously. the flight from dubai to jfk was better but again they failed to serve us any asian vegetarian food. i will not be flying with this airline in the future.    birmingham to johannesburg via dubai. we paid extra so my wife and i could sit together. on the way home they allocated us to different seats. wed booked window seats and they put us on each flight in the centre of the plane. i am just getting fed up with trying to get a refund for the money we paid 80. just phoned them again and the customer service rep was just rude. i will never fly with this airline again. i thought emirates were going to be superior but they are simply nothing special at in any department. two months trying to get your money back due to their effective management of seating is dreadful. so be warned if you are thinking of booking seats and paying 20 each person per seat per flight.   i have been flying with emirates for 6 years as they offered good customer service and did not sell exit row seats. no longer it seems. i recently booked a flight from london to denpasar via dubai only to find after paying for the flight that emirates now charge for exit row seats in this case an additional 150. i immediately called emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. the representative said my options were to pay for the seats pay a 100 cancellation fee or email customer services. i emailed customer services highlighting that it is poor customer service and even worse business process to not show the potential full price of the flight until after the customer has booked and requested a fair and reasonable solution. the representative said my options were to pay for the seats or pay a 100 cancellation fee. shame emirates. emirates did not show the full price and are using a misleading process that sells a ticket without showing the potential full price. even easyjet and ryanair show users the full price of their tickets before purchase emirates used to be a company that put customers at the heart of the business. i guess now it is just money.   not close to what we expected. we now understand why emirates is not number 1 anymore. we are frequent travellers going to various locations always economy. the flights with emirates from frankfurt to male via dubai and same way back were pretty interesting. on all flights we were pretty confused that the blankets we used to keep us warm were taken away before landing same counts for the earphones. we had our own but even them they wanted to take away crazy. the cabin crew was not pretty helpful and especially soft drinks were not offered often enough even on request we were simply ignored maybe because of being economy guests. highlight was that the cabin crew lady poured me with mango juice and did not even say a word. the food experience was average other airlines offer much better food from a quality perspective and also from the options you have. entertainment was pretty good.    lyon to bangkok via dubai. a horror expensive for a shabby delivery. in the devices 4 in total we had only trouble error of seats headphones that do not work screen that does not work lack on the meal trays we even had a power cut on our row of seats and damaged luggage on arrival and the staff is completely dabbing no matter what your request its always no we can not well see never seen people who had so much nothing to do even for luggage une horreur cher pour une prestation minable. dans les appareils 4 au total nous navons eu que des ennuis erreur de sièges écouteurs qui ne fonctionnent pas écran qui ne fonctionnent pas manque sur les plateaux repas nous avons même eu une coupure délectricité sur notre rangée de sièges et bien sûr bagages endommagés à larrivée surréaliste  et le personnel sen tamponne complétement peu importe votre demande cest toujours non on peut pas on va voir jamais vu des gens qui en avaient autant rien à faire même pour les bagages     frankfurt to bangkok via dubai. i understood from the crew that emirates has a new policy to overbook the economy class and upgrade all remaining passengers to business class. that is what happened on the both mentioned flights more than 50 passengers got free upgrades to business. so c class was totally full on the huge a380 results in poor service because the fas were totally overloaded with this high amount of people. on the flight from frankfurt to dubai i had to wait more than 3 hours until they served the dinner. further i think this is also very unfair for the passengers who paid the business class fare. it seems that the airline is good for economy passengers but sorry emirates this is not what business people paying a very high fare do expect.    zürich to phuket via dubai. i had high expectations since i  heard that emirates should be very good but i was very disappointed. the customer service was terrible. i am not sure they even know what it means. the stewardesses had a very arrogant superior attitude which i found just low and disgusting. as they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves. one time a stewardess was serving drinks and as she presented the tablet with the drinks my boyfriend wanted to take the tray to make it easier to take our drinks. then she said in not such a friendly tone just take the drinks please. not politeness no smile. i dont know if they are able to smile because we didnt see much of it. they may think that the red lipstick makes them look nice but a smile is way more beautiful. another time a stewardess was serving food and drinks and as she came to our row i looked up. then she said in an arrogant tone hold on please then walked away and came back a little later. i hadnt said anything to her. at the end of a flight a man came to collect all the headphones. i gave mine to my boyfriend so he could give it because he sat by the aisle. he gave it to the man and a little later the man asked for the headphones not in a nice way and with no smile. my boyfriend then told him he had already given it. he just looked and then went on. no apology which one would actually expect. when you work in the service business you cannot act all arrogant and superior because then you lose customers which you are dependent on to receive salary. they obviously didnt learn what i learned as i was working in the service business. that the customer is the boss. another thing was that as we boarded the plane it reeked of perfume which was just very nauseating to be honest. very disappointing was also on the flight from dubai to phuket as my boyfriend and i didnt get to sit together even though we had booked as a couple. we were told that if there were some available seats in the back that we could maybe sit together. the stewardess never came. my boyfriend then saw that there were some available seats in the back and we asked a stewardess if we could sit there. then she said that no these seats are for the cabin crew to sit down for breaks. uhm what i have never experienced that the cabin crew is sitting with the rest of the passengers. so this was very odd. the food was ok the entertainment was not to be complained about but the rude unfriendly arrogant cabin crew just ruined everything for me. i have this to say to those arrogant stewardesses get over yourselves and get down from your high horse you are not better than anyone. so i will not be travelling with emirates again and i will certainly not recommend it to anyone i know quite the contrary actually.    larnaca to singapore via dubai. our flight from cyprus got delayed more than an hour so we missed our connecting flight from dubai to singapore. as all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from cyprus to dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. we needed to reach singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. however coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. they would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. after a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. it was simply horrible. never experienced worse service in my life not even with a budget airline. after arranging to stay in dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful manager. this is the second time this happened to my husband with this airline and we want to tell the travelers out there not to waste their valuable time and money well earned to throw it to them. any other airline is much better    dubai to boston. very disappointed. seat narrow doesnt like flat not very comfortable although supplied mattress helps a lot. inflight entertainment system was unreliable and difficult to operate despite multiple screens. food was terrible and surprisingly scarce. was hungry getting off a 12 hour flight which is a rare experience in business on most airlines. cabin service was lackluster at best  this was the biggest surprise. i had a hard time getting a drink then was offered bourbon when i had ordered scotch. i didnt drink it and after many hours they took it away. much later in flight male flight attendant argued with me that the drink had been scotch not bourbon. im pretty positive i can tell the difference if there was a snack offered late in the flight that was on the menu i did not see or hear about it. overall i will not choose emirates again unless there are compelling circumstances.    melbourne to venice via dubai. i have been flying emirates for many years and always praised and recommend it. not this time. and i am very angry and disappointed. i was wheelchair bound and when i arrived at the check in at melbourne all seemed fine... until i have been taken 3 hours before my flight to the gate gate 11 empty alone and abandoned there. no water no one to ask for help no chance to go to a toilet as i needed assistance. when finally an attendant arrived to open the gate i asked her if i could have a glass of water and needed a toilet she said there was none around and i had to go to another area. i was boarded and kindly a flight attendant on the plane helped me to the toilet and gave me a glass of water. she felt terrible for what i experienced but could not do much about it. she tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. when arrived in dubai they told me i had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. the guy in dubai who took me on my wheelchair instead left me for a while parked while he was happily chatting with other friends until i waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. finally at service desk i explained the situation and what i had endured in melbourne. they said they would take me to the lounge to wait. the guy brought me to another plane where i was left and almost missed my flight to venice when i received an alert from emirates to go straight to the gate i tried to get attention again  arrived at the gate they changed  my seat. previously i had a seat with empty ones right and left to allow me to raise my leg and stretch it on other and i thought the change was similar. instead they moved me to seats whose armrest was fixed and could not be lifted making it impossible for my leg to rest flat on the other seats.     venice to melbourne via dubai. i am now on my way back to australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from emirates. just before my departure i had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from dubai to melbourne for au 1157 . as my leg had not yet healed  did my way into europe on a wheelchair and although feeling much better i thought i could do this effort and upgrade so that i could be more comfortable. before my departure i tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully as every time i filled everything and clicked upgrade a message came out that the system was down note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue  tried again before i had to catch my first flight but then i had to board and had to let go. arrived in dubai i went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes i had another person before me and i knew i would never had time to wait so i went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. the lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure i could not upgrade with that offer anymore as i had already started the first leg. when i explained that i did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down so it was not my fault they just said they could not do anything and if i wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same on the plane i asked again. they had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer i had in my email asked around 3.500 us dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane while my offer was 1157 australian dollars for the same which equals to us 864 i am so angry and disappointed but if you want to see this from a marketing point of view emirates has lost both in image and in money. in fact those seats have remained empty and emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years. emirates has gone so downhill lately which is unbelievable.    london to adelaide via dubai  brisbane. i am very surprised that huge airlines like emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. do they not want to know about problems or have feedback obviously not. i heard it was rated best airline but by whom i have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. well i review them as bad. it is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint you should have the opportunity during the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. i paid 180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. that was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. the flights were 1500. they told me i could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left  thats if. the airport terminal in dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. they need longer on the ground before next flight. myself and my son the people to my side that i could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. the green sausages looked like plasticine. the white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. it states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. they do not. if i wanted my child to have child meals i had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. it is not available to do this online but meals like kosher and vegetarian are ridiculous. and when we boarded after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water  it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either. i will not choose to fly emirates again over priced and over rated. ive been with malaysian airlines and qantas before and will go back to them next time as i never encountered one problem with either airline.    i had a bad experience with emirates customer service before in the past and it didnt change. i thought this was a good airline and happily purchased an unaccompanied minor ticket for my son which was expensive already at over 1700. i gave all required information for pick up etc. to the airline and they assured me that they have all info. unfortunately on my sons flying date they needed more info which they never informed me about and tried to call me but never reached me and just didnt board my son. the next day i complained about this treatment and was forced to pay another 500 to no fault of mine. they said i could get the money back through customer service. i did complain and stated my case but i only received an unfriendly rejection. therefore this ticket cost me 2300 which is higher than any other airline. in addition my sons next day flight got delayed so that he missed the connection in dubai due to emirates fault. he had to spend the night at the airport to finally arrive another day later this unprofessional treatment with poor customer service and delays is unacceptable. last year i used lufthansa with my son and no surprises unfair increase of rates no delays no problems what a difference    dubai to manchester. disgusting flight. my wife and i were split up on checkin. surrounded by noisy families. cabin crew more interested in chatting to each other than actually serving. flight delay of 1 hour  on ground but no water given until protest. lousy food lousy service. no better than ryanair. will not use this airline again.    rome to dubai. i think emirates is losing the plot. service average at best. and for the second time in two weeks an a380 with around 450 passengers parked remotely. so around 1012 busses sent on a 25 minute drive around the airport to reach the terminal. very ordinary experience. qatar airways seems to win the war of the middle eastern carriers. and rightfully so.    i cant describe how upset i am by being stuck on fl dubai plane for 5 hours with no food drink inflight entertainment or internet. i did book moscow to hanoi via dubai  specifically to fly with emirates that cost me 650usd one way compared to aeroflot 650usdround trip which is direct modern and safe anyway. i paid twice as much just to have an experience with emirates. instead of emirates plane i found myself in an outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft. i never been send to a lowcost instead of a full service. how is that even possible a company like emirates coshares with a lower cost. by cosharing i mean they stuck me on a lower cost send one meal 1 cup of free water and let me carry 30kg of luggage. there was no choice of food and the suggested free dinner only one option was not suitable for me no free snacks available no nothing. i had to buy water and peanuts. i booked a ticket with emirates for my husband londondubaihanoi round trip and he had an amazing flight despite his flight was longer and the price was cheaper. i dont book planes which sell water and sandwiches and i would never in a conscious mind choose fly dubai for a 5 hours flight seats were uncomfortable even for my 5 feet. it was freezing cold the entire time and no blankets available i couldnt even hear the announcement it was just cracking noise. the whole experience felt like a charter flight in 90s i never saw flight attendants just sleeping on the back row on a 5 hours flight before our departure was also delayed because of late arrival. i couldnt even charge my phone up to 60 in 5 hours the equipment was that old i have noticed that my flight is operated by flydubai on behalf of emirates on my ticket but i have no idea what flydubai is and didnt expect such a con being pulled off by emirates. flydubai is not the same level as emirates if i wanted to fly with flydubai in my case emirates is a middleman profiting by using the brand to sell cheap flights at high price.  i complained to the customer service afterwards but they just blamed me on not researching what flydubai is. so i guess they are aware of what they are doing but hope that people will be just tricked and book a ticket because of emirates brand on it. second flight dubaihanoi was also pretty awful just got a sandwich croissant and an omelette in 7 hours flight was pretty uneatable the plane was very shabby as well. and at the checkin emirates even tried to put me on standby because the plane was overbooked even though i paid for my tickets 2 months in advance. guess emirates dont care about their customers as much as they did.    auckland to birmingham via brisbane  dubai. the b777 on the brisbane to dubai leg was cramped and dirty. the a380 on the dubaibirmingham leg had more leg room. it was a380s on the return journey to melbourne. having heard people rate emirates i was so disappointed. each flight was late by about an hour each time departing. the cabin service was poor. we were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. the food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons i couldnt eat anything that the airports offered. if the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. the cabin crew refused to help. so no i never want to use this airline again. and i dont recommend them.    maldives to boston via dubai. all i can say this was the first time i had traveled on emirates. as much as i have heard of this airline this was the worst decision. with 12hrs flight haul it is understandable that the trip will be not very comfortable. but with the crew on board that cannot get you water until to press the button on you seat 10 times and finally they get annoyed by the pings and decide to come ask you how they can help. as one attendant told me we are out of ice. just seconds later asked a different crew member they got me some ice. seats are tight you have to lift your shoulders and still touch the person next to you when eating your meal. i have took qatar airways before for a similar ling flight and had a very conformable journey.   flew birmingham to dubai. all emirates flights have been full these days but good for them for maximising profit. they handle a full flight quite well but expect to be sat in a centre seat if you are not very organised. but today they announced the flight was boarding a full 45 minutes before it started boarding. this seems a bit dishonest to be expected i guess but still lying.    taipei to hong kong they only provide one cake and one juice for this flight which left me  disappointed. i will choose other airlines to hong kong or macau for my flight. my wife and i have travelled on most of the long haul carriers when we fly to the far east. we booked premium economy i have got to say we were very disappointed with the little things that we have grown accustomed to when flying long haul. passengers were not given a hotcold towel when settling down there was no menu and the choice had to be made when the trolley arrived. there was not an offer of a drink throughout the flight except with the meal and that was only wine. we will be looking at another airline next year. last month i flew amsbkkams on eva. on my way to bkk the cabin crew appeared to be very tired. they were not friendly and even rude to a fellow passenger. i bought eliteclass tickets but in my experience i did not get eliteclass service. my flight bkkams was better. the cabin staff were not as tired but not friendly either. they dont make real contact with the passengers on board and just ask the most essential questions like pork or chicken. dont know if this is a lack of not speaking wellenough english or they are just not interested. for me evaair is not a 4 star airline. seats were more comfortable than other pricier airlines for economy. food was okay but again better than others. staff kept passing by our row when they came with the drink cart & it was difficult to get them to come back but may have been a language barrier. had to help ourselves to slippers & blankets on the flight back since staff did not pass them out but not a big deal. inflight entertainment not as good as other airlines  wasnt much selection. they lost one of our luggage in toronto before we even got on the flight & it took them more than 3 weeks to find it & send it to our destination by this time we had come back. they cant send it back to us & offered us 80. not impressed at all with their customer service in this regard. lhrbkkk  we recently travelled with eva air and decided to pay the additional usd 595 per person x 4 one way to upgrade to premium economy. the additional cost was certainly not worth the money  very little extra legroom and poor inflight cabin service. our journey home was in economy and the cabin staff were extremely helpful and friendly and having the last row of seats we had more than sufficient leg room. our advise would be dont pay the extra for little or no extra comfort. return flight from lhr to bkk. travelled in economy class and boy did we feel that we were in economy. they were on an economy drive with drinks when you asked for one you were offered water and then it was only max 100ml 5 hours into the flight and we had been offered only 2 small drinks. the food was just indescribably bad for a 12 hour flight the seat comfort has not been taken into consideration although the leg room is adequate. like other reviewers we found the staff to be rude and the announcements to be inaudible. all in all a very uncomfortable and unpleasant 12.5 hours. i have flown eva air before and found their premium economy pretty good. however my most recent experience with them was poor and i found the customer service upon my return very bad. i was on a bkklhr flight. about 2 hours into the flight my screen and those of people around me went blank without explanation. after restarting my movie it happened 2 more times until it stopped working altogether. i asked a member of cabin crew who shrugged her shoulders and said there was nothing she could do. so for the remainder of my 12 hour flight i sat and twiddled my thumbs. the food was awful consisting of an omelette for one meal and noodles for another. neither looked very appetising. i see from the other comments on here that many customers have commented on the poor food quality. one alcoholic drink was offered throughout the flight. the cabin announcements were inaudible which must be a health and safety issue finding a way to complain is difficult. i wont fly with them again if i can help it. flew economy londonbangkok. on the positive side flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. the seats are decent for economy and the ife has a reasonable choice. the disappointing thing was the poor service attitude of the crew who were mostly cold and standoffish. the meal quality was fairly average for economy airline food but it would be nice to see a menu or be told how the food is prepared instead of just being asked do you want chicken or pork. also they are very mean with drinks i was given half a small plastic glass of wine with dinner. there was no cold drinks offered between the 2 meals the crew seemed to just disappear for long periods. flew lhrbkklhr in premium economy with 1 suitcase and 1 set of golf clubs on a golfing holiday. left lhr and everything was fine. on my return they decided that with my golf clubs i was 10kgs over my baggage allowance and wanted to charge me 450 excess baggage. my ticket cost almost 1000 for an upgraded economy seat so i wasnt prepared to pay anymore. my clubs are still in bangkok eva airline both in bkk and at the offices in london are like robots. i would rather walk to bangkok carrying golf clubs on my back than fly with eva again. recently traveled bkklhrbkk in premium economy. the reason we chose the airline was price and being a new member on star alliance. overall the flights were okay nothing too bad but also nothing to be very excited about. bkk lhr we sat in 20ac  first row of premium economy. the seats are comfortable and recline very generous. in the bulkhead rows monitors are in the armrests of the seats making them a little less wide than the normal premium seats. legroom was also slightly restricted due to the dividing wall with business class. i could not stretch my legs completely. food was is best described as okay. i have to agree with other reviewers and say that drinks services were very poor on this 12 hour flight. 2 rounds of drinks during the meal followed by two water runs until the snack before landing was served. in premium economy passengers get a half litre bottle of water after take off which in theory can be refilled by crew. i walked to the galley in economy mid flight and was told that they had run out of water. i did get a refill from the business class galley. on the way back to bkk we sat in 22a and c which was much more comfortable than the bulkhead seats. food and drink services on this flight were much better. cabin crew was also genuinely more friendly than on the outbound flight. overall we were okay with the product particularly given the good rates we had for our trip. we will use them again if rates are favourable. i wasnt sure about this airline when booking they far exceeded my expectations in just about every category. the have flown premium economy for the last 15 years and it has gradually gone downhill. the old airplanes were much more comfortable in premium economy but the prices difference has continued to rise. very simply all i want on a long flight is a leisurely meal and lots of wine and then i go to sleep. although the crew have 11 hours dinner is literally thrown at you no pre dinner drink this is served with the food  a miserable little glass of wine and refills were non existent food pretty poor in general. other airlines do it so much better recently flew thai economy and it was great. flight from london to bangkok was ok just but the flight back was an awful experience. we were in the middle of 4 seats and both middle seats have a metal box on the seat in front just where one leg needs to go so you end up with one leg at an angle all the time and one foot twisted. not at all comfortable on a long flight. seats were hard. on the way out they gave us a menu which listed cocktails liqueurs etc but we were not offered anything other than wine and only 1 glass at that. food was not very good. flight back to london from bangkok was terrible. we had the same middle seats so same problem with where to put your feet. the staff were extremely unfriendly  not one smile from any of them until the point at which we all left the plane. when we asked for a gin and tonic we were treated to glares and when we plus a number of other passengers asked for a second glass of wine with the meal it was almost thrown at us. inflight entertainment was not very good  very limited choice of films. i would not travel with eva air again. flew between bkklhr economy. ive flown with them many times over the last 2 years but this may be my last time due to the below constant problem. its the same for every flight good modern comfortable plane always on time or close to food is not great. inflight is average. space is not too bad better than most. my big complaint is that more often than not eva flights are very cold on this return flight to heathrow on tuesday many passengers were again shivering and wrapping up in jumpers and jackets the stewardesses really did nothing about it even when passengers complained you are going to lose many european customers. my expectation of this airline was high however i was disappointed with the poor service on 3 of my 4 flights. cabin crews were lacking warmth and manners. a few of them were ok but the rest didnt seem to be happy. food was disappointing the only positive thing was the comfort of the seat . i am 6 ft 4 legroom space was important and i got that in the elite class. i flew sintpesin sector. this airline has the potential to make a top airline a real pity really. seattle tacoma international airport to taipei in economy. boarding is a mess the staff were terrible on when to call your zone. most of the time youre flight will be delayed just because boarding took too long. the seat is fair for economy when you recline the bottom part of the seat it slides forward so you somewhat lay down. however there isnt a footrest. the width and recline is reasonable. i sat in the upper deck and i like that there is a compartment on the side therefore you have more legroom. you also get a very tiny pillow and surprisingly a nice blanket. the inflight meal is what you would expect for economy. you will have two choices. flight attendants were the worst i have encountered. the inflight entertainment is awful the screen is smaller than an ipad mini and you have very limited choices of movies. overall i wouldnt fly with eva again. lhrbkk premium economy  i have flown this journey a number of times. i found the experience very hit and miss some of the premium economy cabin staff are okay most are just rude. food is bearable although if you want to know what is in the meal good luck most staff have only basic english. when travelling premium with eva you need to remember the 10 hours between meals are stewardesses personal time. you may get half a glass of warm water or warm apple juice. the ife is generally acceptable. flight announcements are annoyingly loud when it comes through on your earphones. manilataipeiseattle. all flights were delayed. we had a 9 hrs lay over in taipei but they took us for a half a day city tour. got back to the airport and still had to wait because the flight was delayed again. they didnt even offer us something to drink or a snack. we were all tired and hungry. the crews were not nice and i didnt understand them. food was not the greatest. we had a connecting flight in seattle and we just barely made it. we made it to boise but our luggage didnt. so we had to spend the night in a hotel to pick up our luggage the next day. i will not fly on eva air again or recommend them to anyone. flew on br067 lhrbkk on 7th october. full flight. service very ordinary nothing special. also inflight catering quite disappointing  quite bland and tasteless. we flew economy from ams to bkk. the airconditioning blew very cold air on both flights we had with eva. we fly very often and know how the temperature should feel like. although we asked the flight attendants to change the temperature and made them aware of all the other passengers that needed jackets and shawls they didnt really care about our problem. i also think like many others here that eva tries to lower the costs by putting on a cold airco. so take a hat a winter jacket and thick socks with you if you decide with eva air. another problem is that under many seats there a steal boxes i think they are the entertainment boxes for the screens so that you dont have enough space for your seats. very uncomfortable. we could further not check in online and when we arrives esrly at the check in we were both times told that we couldnt sit together although we had booked months in advance. very bad service the crew looks like the chinese army with their dark green uniform and their hair cuts and they lack a kind of warmth and interest in their guests. i hope that these problems will also be read by eva air so that these things will change. the food was okay but the drinks were served in half full plastic glasses. lhr to bkk and return on br6867. economy. not impressed with the service food palatable  just. asked for a beer 40 mins into return flight to be told no beer no smiles either. cabin crew efficient and toilets kept spotless. lack of refreshment in between meals needs addressing. also whats with all the window blinds having to be kept closed on daylight flight. first and last time will pay a little more next time. ive been a loyal eva customer for about 5 years travelling approx three times a year to thailand from london in both economy and premium. prices are good and the flight times are perfect on each leg. id still recommend eva but feel the quality of service has dropped. the planes on this route are starting to look a little tired inside. films and music could be better. the food is never great on eva and you are made to feel like you are begging for alcoholic beverages. the main issue tho is the quality of some passengers maybe down to recent competitive prices. noisy and rude talking all night and opening blinds during sleep hours. the stewardesses for some reason will never ask these disruptive passengers to be quiet or close the blinds so we all suffer light in the cabinlack of sleep. so im back on thai airways on the monday nightflight for the first time in 5 years lets see how they compare. los angeles to manila via taipei. the plane was very clean and cabin staff was efficient at getting meals served. i took a total of four flights with eva air in february and i felt some stewards attitude was very gruff. they need training on how to ask passengers to do things such as opening and closing the window shade raising the seat from a recline position. when i am travelling especially on vacation i expect courteous service. i was very frustrated with the demeanor. it may be a cultural difference.    i recently travelled on eva air flight br0106 hello kitty jet between taipei and fukuoka. i have been looking forward to travelling on the hello kitty jet for around four years and finally got the chance to board on 14th april 2016 at 0810am along with my partner.  upon arrival at the airport we were handed our boarding passes and my excitement began. walking to the gate we thought it was strange that the standard green eva air plane was waiting to be boarded and not the hello kitty love apples jet as advertised. i made a query with two eva air staff members who informed me that the interior of the plane was hello kitty but the exterior was not as they told me the airline choose to switch the jets sometimes. as you can imagine we were left disappointed and cheated as we had paid a lot of money to get the full hello kitty experience. there are many other airlines that travel this route that are much cheaper at much more convenient times. however we had booked the hello kitty jet specifically. boarding the plane we also noticed that the hello kitty interior was very limited and not what is advertised online that we had booked and expected to find. we merely experienced a pillow seat cover cutlery and a pack of playing cards. on the hello kitty jet website there is much more hello kitty branded interior advertised. if we had known the jet wouldnt be the same as advertised online then we wouldnt have booked it due to the high price.    flew eva air from london to bangkok on elite class. this is not my first time using eva as they are my preferred choice when flying to bkk or taipei. the online booking is pretty straight forward but i wish they allow passengers to edit their profile and input passport information prior to check in. i checked in online 24 hours before departure and dropped my luggage at heathrow. there is never a queue for elite class passengers which is a plus. boarding was on time. the plane was 8 years old and has just been refurbished  new seats for elite class as well as new entertainment system. personally i think the entertainment system is decent  the screen is large with good resolution but the programme is limited and the flight map is not interactive.  i prefer the old seat as it felt more comfortable. however the advantage of the new seat is that the chunky entertainment box has now been removed. they have upgraded the amenity pack but it was just the packing that is changed. service on this flight was the biggest disappointment. the crew serving my area did not smile once  not a typical eva standard. food and wine were ok although i sensed some cost cutting this time. the flight was pretty smooth and we landed on time.     manila to taipei. website and booking easy enough to navigate including seat selection. prices were good and competitive for the route. i was pretty excited to fly eva air for the first time as i was hearing and reading about sparkling reviews for the airline but maybe the excellence is applied only to their long haul product.  seat width and pitch were acceptable but no personal tv screens and had to rely on drop down screens for this short 2 hour flight. flight crew were robotic with no warmth. food was passable on the outbound but i did not eat anything on the return flight. as long as the price is right ill consider eva air.    singapore to taipei. eva airs hard business class product is great. i love the reverse herringbone seat layout of 121 which means that my window seat was angled toward the windows so i could look out with getting a neck ache. the seat is fully flat highly adjustable and really enormously comfortable although the footwell area for fully flat is a tad confined and the seat itself is quite narrow. there is quite a lot of storage space but none of it very useful since one is not permitted to stow anything in it for take off and landing and there is no floor level storage for the carryon unlike the singapore airlines business class product which allows me to put my quite big carry on in an alcove near my feet. the color scheme is very nice and the whole finish is excellent. as for the soft product not so much. the fas were attentive but their english and japanese language skills were really limited. they were not proactive when it came to service. i had ordered the main course online and since the appetizer looked great and tasted even better was looking forward to it in as much as one can look forward to airline food. when the fa brought my main it was ghastly. i left my fork standing up in the mess and you know the fa came by to refill my wine several times and never once inquired about the main course which sat there the whole time. i could have asked her to take it away and bring something else but i thought id see how long it went on. nothing happened. after a while she came and took it away and replaced it with a dessert selection which was as good as the appetizer. in my experience on singapore airlines and ana in business the fa would notice the mess sitting there uneaten and do something about it without being asked.  im flying with them again in a few days so we shall see if  the food is better and if the fas see service problems without being told and deal with them.   chicago ord to taipei. my flight to on eva air started off well. the staff at checkin were welcoming and helpful. after i went through tsa i realized i had left my cell phone at the counter and i frantically ran back to the checkin counter and the checkin staff held it for me. i believe ord to tpe is a new route and the eva gate staff still has a few things to work out boarding was a bit chaotic even though they called by zones several people pushed past those of us lined up by zone. on the plane it was a mostly good 15 hour trip. i believe eva has improved its catering because both my meal choices were terrific — the chicken with rice dinner was delicious and the morning breakfast scrambled eggs and bacon was amazing — it seems to be tough for any airline to do eggs well but eva got it right. a plus is that we were served with silverware and that elevated the experience. unfortunately throughout the 15 hours the cabin was just too warm. i asked the passenger seated at the aisle near me if he felt warm and he agreed it was hot and he was wearing shorts. i asked the fa if she was able to lower the temperature a bit and 20 minutes later it was not as warm but the temperature in the cabin never approached comfortable and i could not sleep during the flight. the odd part is i walked back through the economy section a few times during the flight to stretch my legs and those cabins were so much cooler and almost everyone was asleep. the fa for my section seemed a bit distracted and forgot to bring my drink order even after the person next to me was served drink orders twice. overall i feel like this flight experience with the chaotic boarding and the inconsistent service onboard fell just short of evas usual high standards.   this airline hardly feeds their customers. after the first meal about an hour into a 13 hour flight nothing else was offered. i was starving until 10 hours later. flight attendants was nowhere to be found. im looking at alternatives airlines for my next flight that are not stingy with the food service.    flown with eva air on this route london heathrow to bangkok before and it was ok. but this latest sector was i believe a new aircraft with newly designed flimsy seats. im average height and build and i just pity any taller travellers or those carrying a few extra pounds. i have never been so uncomfortable on a flight in my life. the seat base was so hard my legs were literally numb 3 or 4 hours into the flight. we had to ask for extra blankets to provide at least a bearable level of padding and so did other passengers around us. once the seat in front was reclined you could forget getting anything from the bag under your seat. in preparation for our return flight we have bought inflatable cushions. inflight entertainment is below average old films and very little else. cabin service is also average food was ok and attendants friendly but a tiny cup full of wine was offered with dinner with a top up if you could catch the offer as it flew past on the trolley. that we could live with but i dont recall any soft drinks being offered through the night although there was a tray of drinks in the galley if you could manage to prise yourself out of your tiny seat which wasnt ever going to be more than once or twice due to the unavoidable disturbance caused to passengers around you. having said all this it was the best price at the time of booking but i will not use this airline again.     hong kong to singapore. unfortunately took this cathay pacific flight in jan 2018 from hkg to sin during midnight very sad news was the last minute aircraft changes due to no reason. from a350 1x2x1 seat configurations to b777 2x3x2 seat configurations the cabin was so narrow very similar to economy class seats. i missed out my meal service i understand passengers may sleep during the midnight flight but there was no one asking about if i am okay to wake up during the meal service after i woke up there was no on asking if i want have some meal before the flight landed.  will not take cathay pacific flight again.   this is my second time to take cathay pacific flying from manila to san diego via hong kong. the food served was really bad with an after taste not to mention the fact that the flight was 2.5 hrs delayed. we were held inside the aircraft for 2hrs and the other 30mins was due to late boarding. i wont take cathay pacific anymore. the only positive thing is their legroom which is more spacious than other airlines.    flew cathay pacific from melbourne to hong kong. improve your current services before you introduce anything new. biting off more you can chew by the looks of the current cut in staff andthus the shocking customer service. delayed flight today then cancelled sent to immigration then flight was uncancelled walk back to gate with no guidance from cathay staff. 300 people aimlessly walking around the airport. got to the gate waited half an hour to find out the flight was cancelled again. minimal to no remorse for the inconvenience which shows their lack of regard for customer satisfaction.    i really cant understand why this airline is an awarded airline. the service is rushed and unfriendly and as a premium economy flyer the only difference between economy seems to be priority boarding and a slightly bigger seat. it is by far the worst premium economy offering i have experienced with my comparison being virgin australia virgin atlantic and qantas. my flight wasnt bad just very average. dont waste your money on premium economy with cathay pacific.    london to hong kong. it seems from this trip that cathay pacific have followed british airways in cutting standards of what they give during the flight. seat comfort is fairly standard cramped economy class of today but i was shocked at condition of the cabin. many seats with damaged torn covers armrests dented and scratched and stains on the carpets. worst of all is the poor food served and i would have rather a lowcost option where i could buy something decent to eat onboard. the cabin staff seemed disillusioned and unhappy in their service and maybe they are fed up with cutbacks sad to see a once great airline drop to such low levels.    gatwick to hong kong the a350 was a beautiful aircraft to fly on and made the long 12 hour journey much easier a very nice plane to travel on. cathay pacific did not have a good style of boarding rather than boarding economy from back to front to avoid congestion all of economy was called at once and boarding took way too long and there was too much isle congestion. the cabin crew were not friendly or helpful at all on most airlines ive flown the cabin crew greet you and direct you to your seat on cathay you get on nothing happens and you find your own way the crew just stood there talking. the seats were comfortable although the seat pockets on the seats were directly connected with fabric and no internal plastic meaning whenever you or somebody else went into the seat pocket the person in front felt it quite a lot and it was frustrating while trying to sleep. the meal options werent great considering it was a flight from england to asia youd expect there to be british style options as well as asian not on this flight. on dinner service the crew were rude what do you want i understand their first language is not english but being a flight from an english speaking country youd expect there to be a little better knowledge. i noticed most people had bread rolls i didnt get one so i asked for one the attendant thought i was trying to get two and explained it was only one per passenger i told her that i hadnt been given one and she didnt believe me. all in all the flight was average but cathay was disappointing and i wouldnt fly with them in future unless it was considerably cheaper than other options.   paid considerably extra for premium economy ticket. seating comfort and inflight entertainment system is fine but still compromised when seat in front is reclined. thats it. that is all you get extra for the big price difference between economy and so called premium economy. extra inflight services and attention from cabin crew non existent. not offered a single service of any kind throughout the trip apart from the regular meals. on one occasion tray was removed without offer of tea or coffee. ran out of dishes on the menu offered economy meal instead which was terrible. have seen better inflight service on a package holiday flight. lesson learned  do not fly premium economy it is not worth it. would not recommend this airline to anyone.    los angeles to chennai via hong kong. the flight was on time. the inflight service was average. i had a wheelchair request when the tickets were booked at the airline website and still i did not get it for my connection flight at hong kong. it was a pathetic situation as there was more than 10 passengers waiting and finally one service person comes with a single wheelchair collects our hand luggage and walks us to the gate of the connecting flight.  after walking my knee was swollen and i could not walk upon landing at my destination. i had faced the same problem when i came from chennai to los angeles and wanted to be better this time. no change. even worse is the assistance you get at hong kong dont even speak english. i am not sure how and why i am also not sure if this is some kind of stepmotherly treatment. long time ago this airline used to be good. i would not recommend this airline. typical attitude. very unfortunate.    bali to gatwick via hong kong. this airline has to be the worst airline i have ever been on. the cabin crew spoilt the journey for me and my partner. they were rude miserable and uninterested. you did not see any crew apart from when it was meal time which was so disorganised. if you wanted another drink apart from your meal one you had to get up and walk to the back where all of them were standing around chatting and laughing to ask them for one but only a small amount of water was offered. i tried to be helpful with our dinner trays and was told not to do it again as it was not helpful when i was putting my hand luggage up in the locker a stewardess barged past me making me fall into the seats. the list goes on and on. i think it says something about the airlines attitude to their passengers that only first class and premier fliers are welcomed onto the plane in your pa announcements. i would guess that economy passengers make far more income for the airline as a whole and maybe you should consider treating them with a little more respect.    vancouver to kolkata via hong kong. i was also carrying a lot of chocolates that everyone was planning to use at my sisters wedding. i chose cathay pacific because of a 24hour flight to ccu. only 2 stops but it happened to be my worst flight experience ever flight from vancouver was delayed and connecting flight was missed. cathay informed us that the quickest connection was to be a delay of 24hours and that via singapore with one more stop. thus a 24 hour flight was now 48hour flight. i missed my sisters wedding due to the sheer mismanagement of cathay. even after informing them about my urgency they did not offer me a different route when i checked online i found a connection to kolkata available which allowed me to reach earlier on mentioning that to the ground staff they informed us it is not from a partner flight hence they cannot offer that flight ground staff did not know how to apply for a hong kong permit. hence we did not get a visa and had to stay in the airport lounge for one whole night. the lounge did not have a place to sleep. inflight the flight attendants could not provide me the meal i asked for. they offered me a vegetarian meal when i specifically asked for a nonvegetarian chicken meal. thus during this experience with cathay i did get the flights i booked the tickets for did not get the food i asked for nor did i get a place to sleep at night. the staff and customer service was also not cooperative at all. the customer support was very negligent and did not reply favorably to my request. i am a student and strive hard to make to ends meet. i do not have any extra money to waste on an irresponsible airline who does not try to attend to their customers. i would discourage anyone to travel through cathay pacific due to their poor services.     manchester to sydney via hong kong. i can only echo other reviews. service very poor. towards the end of the flight i felt ill and pressed my button for service 3 times. once was acknowledged and promised but no soda water and twice i was ignored. it was only when i reported it strongly that the service manager gave me assistance. insisting i used the economy toilet which was disgusting this did not help. we were served economy meals which were uneatable apart from the piece of chocolate. i would not recommend this premium service premium it isnt.   are standards slipping had a very inconsistent flight flying from london heathrow to hong kong. check in was professional but had to ask at reception if someone was available to take our orders for breakfast at the fantastic restaurant in first class lounge. food was just ok. boarding was professional. then everything went downhill. indifferent crew and dreadful food. one option of starter with a salad but no dressing was served with it. rice with main was very hard. crew did not offer to top up drinks or offered more bread. i asked for a mid flight snack and the noodle was still hard so asked for rhe burger which was actually very good. breakfast option was also excellent but i was not offered coffee or hot drinks and for some reason i was ignored by cabin member who served people around me. the cabin service director who after i complained about the robotic unprofessional and indifferent service came to see if all was ok was horrified i was ignored. seat is spacious but very very hard so best to ask for another duvet as use a a mattress. it does wonders. i love cathay but was seriously let down on this trip.    singapore to hong kong on cx710. i thought cathay pacific was a good airline but this trip proved it wrong. the fare was expensive it was one of my worst flight experiences. my seat did not recline which was a big let down. the food choice was limited. on my flight the meal that they were serving were omelette and seafood porridge. i wanted the omelette but by the time meal delivery got to my seat they they had run out of omelette.  the flight attendant said that she would try to see what she has and give us more food to compensate but we didnt hear from her again. the meal service took a long time. the inflight entertainment had so little choices. the screen was not very responsive.  i pressed the crew call button and it took a long time for  crew to respond.   flew osaka to london via hong kong. i heard good things about cathay pacific but this proved to be an unpleasant experience. i ordered vegetarian meals which were not supplied because the airline changed my seat at the last minute so someone else got my meal  instead i was given a pot noodle. then on the hk london flight the plane was filthy and shabby. again no vegetarian meals  for breakfast the stewards heated up a chick pea curry which was obviously leftover from another flight and pretty rank at 4am. one of the toilets was out of order so people had to queue for ages. the pillows and blankets were disgusting. horrible    vancouver to bangkok via hong kong. i decided to pay a premium to fly with cathay pacific because of their reputation as aa airline providing extra amenitiesservice enabling a more pleasant overseas flight experience. our first issue encountered was our flight leaving vancouver was late which at the time we continued to feel confident in catching our transit flight as the connecting carrier was also with cathay pacific. upon arriving in hong kong cathay pacific employees reassured us we would be on our booked flight. to our dismay cathay pacific failed to expedite our airport transit time and our connecting flight left without us. there was no attempt made to help us with catching the connection and no apology given. we also had an arranged pickup in bangkok for our scheduled arrival time which was no longer available to us. our original flight from vancouver to hong kong was a scheduled 14 hour flight time and was the longest most drawn out disappointing flight in our lives. our 2nd issue encountered was with the audio and video amenities expected with our cathay pacific flight which were not working the entire time. i paid a premium to fly with cathay pacific totaling 1918.00 expecting to be provided with a comfortable travel experience. this was non existent for the 14 hours we had to sit there in bewilderment. cathay pacific failed to provide a bare minimum service in relation to their standards.   zurich to melbourne via hong kong. cathay pacific  turns out there is a sting in the tail. i am heading out on a work trip  and purchased a business class ticket because i knew that i might need to change flights due to meeting changes. 9th january 2018  i called to change my flight on the 17th january. i thought that this was a reasonable amount of time to change a business class ticket. i would have been disappointed but completely accepted if there were no tickets. what i was told was that there were not any seats available in my booking class. not something that i had ever heard of before  nor as you can imagine something that they promote when enticing you to buy their flexible ticket. complete scam. they very kindly offered to 1. allow me to pay the difference to the different booking class  what a scam 2. go on a wait list for this booking class lots of other business class seats available on the flight but no chance that this is what they will do. i asked if i could speak with someone who could help me  i had paid a lot of money after all so thought that this was unreasonable. i was told i could but that the answer would be the same. when i said that i would still like to i was then told that i actually couldnt because no one was there but i could wait on hold for up to 6 hours. i asked to go on the wait list and before i had pretty much finished saying the words i was hung up on. not wanting to see if there was anything else i was needing already have my money and no need to try any harder. all i can say is that you got my money this time but never again. lots of other airlines out there who actually care about their customers.    chennai to san francisco via hong kong. the handling of the boarding process is chaotic  one long line no directions or instructions. cabin service is acceptable but not as good as it used to be. attendants seem stressed and lack pleasant disposition. faucet in washroom was broken. meals are at odd times  both meals within the first six hrs of a 12 hr flight. no wifi. definitely an airline which is not as focused on superior experience which is a big deal on long flights.    san francisco to hong kong on premium economy with cathay pacific. i am gold member with cathay pacific. i could feel of late service levels going down dramatically. in this particular flight cabin service was really poor. the flight attendants look disinterested tired and customer unfriendly. we ordered special meal. it was delivered and when drinks were served we were given a go. in the cutlery set there was 2 spoons 2 forks but no knife. when requested it took long time to deliver. i felt bad having booked full fare premier economy for the entire family for our holiday for this service. asian veg food quality was pathetic.    this was the most unpleasant flight i have ever taken. a midnight flight from singapore to hong kong so shorthaul. the flight crew with sulking faces lack of friendliness and pretty much rude. seats are old and dirty. food is worst that 7eleven breads they dont even serve you any drinks apart from lemon tea. no food menu no drink menu no food selection. i was woken up abruptly by the flight crew because they need me to straighten up the chair. inflight entertainment was very minimal with old movies and limited choice of shows and music. i will avoid this airlines if i can. if they want to remain in toptier airlines please game up the hygiene and services.    london heathrow to perth via hong kong. you learn a lot about a business when things go wrong. ive learned today that cp struggle greatly to deal with difficulties. my premium economy flight was originally scheduled for 1715 to perth via hong kong but was subject to repeated delays until my connection was under threat. the people in the lengthy queue at the desk informed me the flight was unlikely to leave and that staff were rebooking people to other flights even other airlines. i waited for more than two hours in the queue eventually to be told that there were two options available . i could take the first leg in the 5 hour delayed original flight with no onward connection available until 24 hours after the original resulting in a full day delay. my other option was to fly another airline to sydney via singapore with a lengthy wait there until a connection to perth the latter leg in economy and around 14 hours delay. no upgrades were offered despite those delays and the inconvenience. i asked about being upgraded and was very reluctantly offered business class on the first leg only on the first option. that apparently is the very best they could do for me. during the conversation i was invited to explore other routes and options myself online if i thought i could do better told that i should appreciate that they hadnt deliberately planned this disruption and informed that they were dealing with lots of people in the same situation  as though i was somehow not appreciating fully their problems and being rather selfish in the circumstances. i wont be flying with them again after this trip and ill be spreading the word around our australiabased business  not because they had a problem with my flight but because their response to it was haphazard and unsatisfactory.    vancouver to hong kong. the passenger in front of me reclined their seat. they seemed to be having trouble with doing so they called their stewardess. after much banging of his seat he managed to recline his seat much further back than the passengers next to him who had also reclined their seats. his seat did not stay in position so he braced his leg against the seat in front to maintain his seat in recline. i am 155cms in height and his seat was pressing into my knees. i spoke to the stewardess who called for her supervisor who told me that she could see nothing wrong and that if i removed my book from the pocket and stored it in the overhead locker i would have more room. as i intended to read my book i didnt wish to do this. the passenger in front overheard our conversation and started to make a fuss so the stewardess apologised to him whilst i was feeling both unheard and dismissed.  she then suggested that i move seat which i was more than happy to do. i asked if she could please help me move my things and she made a comment that i was not showing respect. she seemed to think that helping me move my things was beneath her. she then called upon the other stewardess to help me move. when i moved seat the passenger in front of my reclined i kept my book in the pocket and still had much more room than i originally had which suggests to me that the seat in front was in fact broken to be able to recline that much.  i felt dismissed and was made to feel like a nuisance. on the approx 120 flights i have taken i have never complained about the leg room nor how the cabin crew have dealt with me.   good points  seats checkin experience. bad points  food only 2 meals provided during 14 hour long journey very few vegetarian options. for my first leg flying from delhi to hong kong the departure time was 1am and the first refreshments came 2 hours post take off. i reached delhi airport at around 10 pm so i had to stay hungry the whole night. furthermore no socks toothbrush or eye cover for sleep were provided. lastly this airlines cabin crew are the rudest crew i have ever come across keeping in mind i have travelled to over 15 countries. they focus mostly on business class passengers. i think cathay pacific is a hyped up airline.    ho chi minh city to chicago via hong kongthe interior of the cabin appears a bit used. seats are narrower than singapore airlines although i like the ability to flatten the seat without assistance. video monitor is clear only from one very specific angle and height. food is fair for business class. the worst part of the experience is the surly unfriendly attitude from the flight attendant crew. this is the second time i have flown cathay pacific and both times have received unfriendly service. when i went to the bathroom while the seat belt sign was on i was told to go sit down like a child being scolded even though there is no turbulence and at least 4 other customers had gone to the bathroom immediately before me with no hassle. i had to insist that i had to use the toilet before the flight attendant would let me pass. the service by contrast on my flight in the other direction via singapore airlines was perfection the reason why they are consistently at the top of the list. the flight attendants were friendly graceful helpful and attentive to all customers equally.   flew hong kong to london heathrow. i cherished flying with cathay but this trip left me wondering whether i would ever travel with them again. their lounges and seats are the best but the food and wine on board is abysmal. my experience was seriously clouded also by having to secure my dinner table with a tape and been told my agents before boarding that the table could not come out which was not true who then asked me if a wanted to move but completely ignored the fact that i was travelling with my partner who was not offered alternative seat in a not very busy cabin. one selects a particular seat for a reason and it is rather odd they ignored my partner as we were seated behind each other. the cabin crew hardly smiled and food from a supermarket would be better than what was served. a starter of dinner before landing was a plate of cut fruit. this in incredibly mean. the main confit of duck was as cold as ice. cathay is going through a hard time but by serving supermarket type food they are telling loyal customer like me to look elsewhere. one flies with them because their fantastic lounges and spacious but no comfortable seats i put a duvet on the seat to make it comfy otherwise it is as hard as rock but not for their food and wine. the new entertainment system is confusing to use. it is not user friendly.    hong kong to new york jfk. i usually dont write reviews but this time i need to post it. im their frequent flyer and i can see cathay service has lost it touch not much selection in meals. they asked if i prefer beef or fish then come back and said we only have fish gave it to me walk away anddid not offer me any drink at all i was totally shocked no smile screw members are to busy chit chat instead of serving its customers. they charge me cancellation fees for tickets purchased andcancel within 24hrs called customer service took them 1hr plus to answer my call there are other airlines on my business route that treat customer much much better than cathay i did prefer them as #1 choice because of shortening flight time but now on cathay is off my list    overnight flight from delhi to hong kong. a cabin crew was recklessly moving the meal trolley by hitting my seat arm rest and spilled a glass of coke on myself. she didnt attempt to do any damage control except some tissue paper on me. wanted to speak to a manger but she brought in another colleague who offered no real help. ultimately lodged a complaint via cx web site but their complaint handling process wasnt up to scratch either.    london to ho chi min city via hong kong. terrible experience. the flight from london was delayed due to unexplained reason. they refused us on the second flight from hong kong to ho chi min city even we had more than an hour for the connection. the next available flight was in 8 hours we did not receive enough not even to buy a decent meal and a bottle of water in hong kong airport. members of staff incredibly rude. we spent 3 days of our precious holiday in a terrible state because of the jet lag and the lack of sleep. they did not offer access to the lounge. never again with cathay pacific.    i have been travelling with cathay pacific for more than 10 years. on the flight hong kong to new york i only asked for cup noodles once. but the flight attendants insisted that i asked for cup noodles multiple times. i wanted to get a water bottle but none of the flight attendants bothered to respond to me. what kind of service is this for a flight that is 17 hours two meals is not enough. i feel hungry travelling for a long period of time.   flew hong kong to perth. cathay pacific separated myself and my partner even though we arrived at the airport more than 4 hours before our flight. we requested to be seated together and they told us they would arrange it for us. this was a lie. by the time we got to the gate to check we were told they would not be able to arrange the seating so we could sit together because they would not request to swap another solo flyer to consider swapping with one of us. as an anxious flyer this airline definitely is worth avoiding. uncompromising. dispassionate and rude. after being lied to several times by the airline with what would be a reasonable request i highly recommend taking another airline. in terms of feedback and dispute resolution. this is a take your money and run airline. not the world class airline it reputedly used to be. i have had significantly better flights on china southern airlines which runs comparable routes from australia.   flew cathay pacific from hong kong to auckland. not exactly what i expected from a 5 star airline. there was enough space from the seat in front but the seat was very narrow meals were acceptable considering the class flown. flight attendants were almost nonexistant during the flight very poor service in premium economy they appeared to be more concerned with keeping the economy passengers happy    booked last minute as this is the cheapest flight i could find out of nyc to my home country philippines. i chose crk as i would not want to trouble myself getting out of mnl airport. last time i flew cx was in 2009 to ruh. the service and food then was great so i trusted that it would be the same or better. flight date is 08 june. check in was brief pleasant. felt at home as there were a lot filipino staff in ewr. airplane is new legroom was good. in flight entertainment was great this is a 15 hour flight and we had 2 meals and snacks in between. i had dinner around 8 pm. we flew out 155 am. most of the restaurants near the gates were closed and besides food the airport was expensive. after supper which was very good. i had beef fried rice and veggies i was still hungry. the menu said that they offer cup noodles upon request. the fa gave me another entree as really am not able to sleep during flights i walk around. i went to the galley at the back of the plane and they have snacks. few hours passed i went to the back and asked for toothbrush. i noticed that they do not provided amenity kits unless you asked. i asked for socks at the beginning of the flight. i think i asked both of these from the team lead fa. she is not smiling very serious and does not even respond back after saying thank you. i had a feeling that she does not like serving filipinos because she was from hong kong. there was an indian flight attendant serving my area and i thought it was nice for cx to have diversity in their crew. but i was really disappointed the way this team lead fa treated me. i have read a few reviews and it feels very tight. i guess i have gotten used to western airlines that offer small chats. so snack time came and they were serving cup noodles. i am hungry so i requested for one. the fa was apologetic and told me i can only have one and i did have mine already. but other people are not even having a snack. they served breakfast late.30 mins before landing they are still serving breakfast. overall i did not enjoy this leg of the flight. transferred to satellite terminal in hk. it was packed flight. flight was delayed. baggage was delayed. and snack was served on a paper bag. crackers candy and water. not even coffee. cx went below my expectations. i guess airline services across the board is getting worse.    perth to london via hong kong. decided to treat myself and booked premium economy waste of money. perth to hong kong was good wide comfortable seats good service. hong kong to heathrow was terrible plane was old and didnt seem any better than economy i walked to back of plane and checked. on both flights there and back one toilet was marked out of order i saw female attendance using them  had to walk to back of plane and queue to use economy toilets. premium economy was so similar to economy not worth twice the price.    manila to hong kong. cathay pacific is highly reliable and efficient. the sense of efficiency comes across from all the interaction i have had with their staff in particular the cabin crew who always seem to be dashing off to accomplish some urgent tasks. the seats of the plane i was on seem dated but otherwise quite comfortable. the inflight entertainment was good with lots available to distract me for the duration of the flight. the food for this 2 hours 10 mins flight was unfortunately quite small and come in a paper bag. i have been on flights that are much shorter but had more generous food options.   flew hong kong to london heathrow. although i generally like cathay i do believe they are going downhill. the cabin could do with some updating the food was only ok with 2 meals served on a 13 hour flight and the flight attendants largely unavailable. the ife was only so so. i am a one world emerald member but this is rarely if ever acknowledged on cathay. flown 7 cathay flights in 2 weeks. cant say i love them. the new shell seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever food very average especially as i ordered vegetarian meals. bland and carb filled. terrible service at the airport in hk. flew colombosingaporehkg with a 7 hour stopover before mel. on their website it says those with a transit time of over 4 hours can access their lounges. upon arriving at one of them we were abruptly told no this is for business class and first class or members only. wont fly them again. they were on time though. hong kong to singapore on cx711 on 8 august 2013. the seats were narrow with no room space to straighten legs. worse when the passenger in front row reclines their seat. food is terrible tasteless and meatless. service is slow. requested warm water and they took ages to serve it. inflight entertainment is also a disappointment and during my return flight my inflight entertainment is faulty and there was no entertainment for me throughout my entire journey. i am sorry to say that in general budget flights have better service quality and seats. i have just got back to melbourne from rome via hong kong flying and i was very disappointed. the food was terrible myself my husband and our son could hardly eat any of the meals and when asked if they had any crackers they said the only snack they can offer is peanuts or noodles. flight cx929 from rome to hong kong after pressing my button for assistance and waiting over 45 mins i noticed people walking to the back of the plane and coming back with drinks a fellow passenger informed me there was only one stewardess on duty and we had to get the drinks ourselves. as to the snacks offered you can imagine my surprise when my husband came to me and offered chocolate bars. he said the stewardess offered them to him. i must however say that our flight from hk to melbourne was nothing like this there were lots of staff on duty except food was just as terrible and snacks offered were peanuts and noodles. i booked a flight from moscow to hong kong  it was horrible. the plane was malfunctioning and instead of getting us off the plane they left us sitting there for 7 hours. they finally let us off the plane and sent us to the transit area  without information or water for 3 hours. then they let us wait another 12 hours at least in the business lounge. after the 12 hours they announced that we would have to wait for another 18 hours to get our flight  thats when we snapped and they rebooked us with emirates via dubai. cathay lost our luggage that arrived three days later. checked in for my flight at rome international airport to auckland new zealand via hong kong. queued to board when a cathay pacific hostess said there was a delay to go have lunch then return at 1pm. i returned at 1pm. my flight was still not boarding and no staff present. waited a further 2 hours before any staff were present to answer questions. told the flight had been delayed until 9am the next morning to go to the hilton hotel and those with connecting flights will receive information once there. no explanation for the delay. in the morning we were told that connecting flights would be arranged once we landed at hong kong. no boarding gate was given security would not let us through as our boarding passes were for the day before cathay pacific staff failed to inform them we were coming. once at the gate we were told of a further delay until 4pm. told there were no seats on that days flight to hong kong. i was informed my connecting flight from hong kong to auckland would be rescheduled and would be available when i landed. this did not happen. staff at hong kong put me on a later flight. i am extremely annoyed at how the situation was handled. i will never fly cathay pacific again. flew from sydney to hong kong  very disappointed. the seat is comfortable but the service was quite poor. some cabin crews were rude with no smile. the catering was disappointing and the portion was quite small. wont fly this airline again. i just flew for the first time with cathay pacific premium economy and was very disappointed. plastic glasses slanted tv screens in first row thin blankets extremely mediocre food even for the hong kong chef special only one wine choice for either white or red and red wine was freezing cold. the service was very inattentive  no refills on wine for example. poor wine quality. uncomfortable seats and very weak selection of movies. also lots of confusion at boarding whether premium economy can board with business or just economy. compare this to qantas premium economy nice food on a white tablecloth with real plates and real glasses. good selection of wines. thick blanket. attentive serviceyou feel almost like business class. comfortable and attractive seats. how does cathay get a good reputation cx872 aug 18. i just got back from a trip from hong kong to san francisco in economy plus. there is no priority boarding like they advertise. you will board with the regular economy class. my tv monitor did not work. aklhkg and return. a340 both ways. have not flown this route or airline for many years but had very good memories of past flights sadly this appeared to be a different airline altogether. boarding was rather disorganised seemed to be totally at random. crew seemed very eager to serve lunch after 1.30pm takeoff rapidly cleared trays ordered window shutters closed then disappeared for rest of flight. only way to get a drink was to go to end of the aircraft and ask for one. no mid flight water or service was offered. inflight movie selection was very dated and certainly not current. old style corded remote. could put up with all of the above but could not tolerate the seats the worst seat i have ever used in my entire life tolerable for 12 hours then agony fortunately seat back did not recline into your face but strange cushion arrangement which allows the seat cushion to move forward leaving no lower back support and a terrible slouching position. totally useless had to ram pillows and blankets behind my back for some meagre support. if i had known how bad this would be i would certainly not have flown this airline. fortunately i had an aisle seat and could easily get up and walk a little. meals were usual economy fare just barely edible but nothing to rave about. return flight from hkg started with a circus hk locals with seats all over the economy section boarded early and just grabbed seats in pairs regardless of seat numbers on their tickets. i had booked an aisle seat in row 32 6 months ago and boarded almost last on the plane my seat was long taken by someone whose seat was way back this rippled all the way through the front of economy and ended with 6 pax stranded at the front of economy with their seats taken cabin crew refused to move anyone and told us to just get seats that were left. ended up in a window seat which i had tried so hard to avoid. cabin crew couldnt seem to care less. not a great experience all round and then 11 hours with that seat again never again. i travelled from mumbai to hong kong then hong kong to sydney. the ticketingseating on the leg from hong kong to sydney was horrendous so many people were affected by the poor organisation of the airline. there was a huge bank of people at the desk trying to get seats changed because they could not sit with people they had booked with. then on the plane itself people were swapping all over the place. im only complaining about seating which when you are unable to sit with your friend or relative on a long trip who cares about the rest cx565 from osaka to hong kong 20th sep 13. this flight stop over is in taipei. staff on this flight not very courteous and not very helpful. when we reached taipei the crew just hid they acted as if they had nothing to do with the passenger cleaners hopped on anto d clean up. a female crew came over to ask whether my child wanted a childrens meal. i said there was no need to prepare a childrens meal. i also have a baby i asked if my baby could have the childrens meal. after a while a staff member came over to tell me that because the baby travels for free they are not supposed to have a meal. i just didnt realise the service from business to economy could can be so different. hkgyyz a few months ago. first of all got thoroughly duped on their website with their infamously tricky pricing process. when they say total price they still have not added their 1520 additional carrier fees which they disguise as taxes. after arriving at the airport i am informed the flight is delayed 30 minutes. once arriving at the gate i am then informed they have changed the gate and that the flight is now 45 minutes delayed. when i arrive at the new gate they have extended the delay by 15 minutes and then a few minutes later they covertly increase it by 15 minutes. so were an hour and 15 minutes late out of the gate and the captain comes on and blames the typhoon which was only a t1 and no other flights were delayed that i could see. the aircraft is tired and the cabin crew look about the same. after 15 hours of a very uncharming and shameless money grabbing experience advertisements everywhere  before every video you watch about 3 of them and about 5 reminders of the duty free items being offered we arrive at yyz with the pilots not having made up any time at all likely to save fuel. the airline is obviously in financial distress see the latest report and its been consistently poorly managed for the last few years. another legacy carrier to add to the 34 star category methinks. my husband and i recently flew from melbourne to rome and returned london to melbourne arriving yesterday. we were in economy and the experience was the worst i have had on an international flight. two flights were delayed by 3 hours the first resulted in landing in milan instead of rome and then on alitalia to rome arriving several hours late. the seats were horribly uncomfortable my bottom was numb after a few hours  supposedly their fantastic new shell seats the fourth flight was on a very old plane no new seats however the backs did not recline at all. service was appalling cold unfriendly and unhelpful flight attendants. the toilet floors were sticky and wet after a short time and not cleaned all flights had 57 hours between meals with no offer of drinks at all. our one request for a drink of wine outside of meal times was met with a grudging response and a 15 minute wait. the food was average the inflight entertainment basic. the only positive was that the check in staff in melbourne milan london and hong kong were friendly and welcoming. never again. recent trip from lhr to hk in pe. footrest jammed in the up position all the way. unable to get out of seat without a lot of difficulty. couldnt even put it down for landing so no chance of brace position if necessary. an all round awful experience. never again. have flown 6 usa to hong kong round trips over the past 18 months. first time on cathay pacific. the economy premium is a great product. i was lured to it by the seat and by the reputation for great service. they only deliver on the seat. the seat is much nicer than the premium economy seat in any usabased carrier. by a lot. more legroom more recline slightly bigger screen. but the service is marginal. the attendants are super friendly. but they are never around. they huddle in the far back galley and you need to dodge your way to the back of the plane if you want anything. they make 3 runs through the cabin on a 15 hour flight. i have since read that this is by design. that cp believes that they are offering privacy by not coming through the cabin. they seem to want you to ring the call button and that they will handle your requests with friendly urgency. this approach might be appropriate for domestic chinese flights. but it just doesnt work with flights tofrom america where we have been conditioned by surly flight attendants to keep our hands off the button except in cases of extreme emergency. i found myself wondering if i preferred the grouchy but available service of usa based carriers or instead preferred the friendly but absent service of cathay pacific attendants. in the end the seat wins. my observation is that cp really wants to be a great airline and i think they are sincere in trying. they just need to better understand the markets they serve. food was ok not great. entertainment options were ok not great. beverage selection was very poor. limited choices. inadequate supply. flew hkgdpshkg. first time in cathay economy usually a star alliance customer. shocked at the lack of cleanliness on the plane. my seat was stained and had crumbs there was gum stuck to the seat frame in front of me as well as had jagged metal sticking out which kept grazing my skin and the blanket distributed had long hairs not mine all over it. crumbs were all over the floor. was disappointed with the poor food served the lack of water and the atrocious ife. had to repeatedly ask for the right headphones not standard old fashioned as i was given the wrong ones for the outlet. cathay is gradually deteriorating in standards. after many flights and years of experience i find that flights out of hong kong and bangkok are always delayed awaiting finnair or other partners by periods of over an hour. this adds 2 to 3 extra hours to a flight a panic transfer at hong kong to australia. the apologies are insincere and automated. the crew are always too busy accommodating infants and business class to respond to requests. seats have become less comfortable head sets are cheap and ill fitting flights full and cramped drink selection more restricted. this might make the airline meet its budget but the overall experience for travellers is very taxing. i will search for alternatives. flew kul to hkg a330 in nov 2013 in business class. this aircraft fitted with the regional interior. despite this being the old seat design it was reasonably comfortable for a flight of flying for the second time this year with cathay pacific economy and its not as good as it used to be before. i was not able to reserve a seat online for my flight from mnl to ams. i called the hq in manila and they advised me to come to the airport on time so i could reserve my seat i wanted to upgrade to premium or business. arriving at manila international i found out that i was not able to upgrade in any way. from manila to hong kong the flight was ok we had a new airplane and the seats were comfortable. though we only got a cheap snack even though our flight was at 8pm and people were hungry. from hong kong to amsterdam the flight was delayed and we had to move from gate 69 to gate 31. finally we got to board our flight to amsterdam only to find out that we were using an old airplane again. for some reason they use old airplanes to amsterdam all the time lately. same with routes from hong kong to rome i was told by a stewardess. but flights from hong kong to milan do have new airplanes. all in all super uncomfortable chairs and again i got back pain during the flight. really the worst i have experienced with intercontinental flights. on another note big difference in treatment between business and economy. i mean yes business class and first class do have the right to be treated a bit different since they paid for it. but i havent experienced a nice service from the crew unlike i am used to when flying other airlines. it would be nice if cathay can have a look at this. for now i will choose another airline next time going to my home country. jfkhkgsyd in premium economy a very long flight with every seat filled jfkhkg. the aircraft cabin was in excellent condition. the cabin crew were smiling and immaculately groomed which is more than i can say for qantas with whom i usually travel. i preordered a lacto veg meal. i was offered a glass of champagne prior to takeoff but when i requested one with the meal service i was told there was none and i could have red or white wine no mention of what it was and it was served in a disposable plastic tumbler. the veg main course was good. the dessert on the tray was fresh pineapple which i cannot eat because of medication i take. when the standard meal ice creams were offered i requested one but was told i couldnt have one as it may not be vegetarian. a second meal was served a few hours later but to my surprise the main course on my tray was exactly the same as the previous one. cups of noodles were offered once during the long night flight other snacks listed on the menu were not offered but had to be obtained from trays in the galley. if you are seated on the left side of the 777 to get to the lavatory which is on the right side at the front of the premium economy cabin you need to go back through the ec cabin cross over through the centre galley and then back up to the front and vice versa to get back to your seat. on the hkgsyd sector i moved seats to enable the person next to me more room as he had to go straight to work on arrival. when breakfast was offered i told the cabin attendant i had moved and that i had ordered a veg meal. i did not want to leave them short a breakfast tray. i was told they that would get my meal. when it arrived what i think was an economy tray was put in front of me on which was a bowl with 5 cubes of melon half a plastic tumbler of apple juice a dry bread roll and a main course which did not appeal. there was no butter no jam no croissant no yoghourt all listed on the premium economy menu. in my opinion cathay pacific has a long way to catch up with their premium economy service. cgkhkg cx 776 hkgsfo cx 872. requests were treated as a big nuisance for the flight attendants. when water was politely requested the fa said later ill come back to you but never did. overall cx failed to represent its status as a fivestar airline. hkgsin. to be honest i expected more from this airline. aircraft was a very old and tired a330. ife with small screens and very limited selection. food and beverage average but not more. cabin crew indifferent. i have travelled cathay pacific in the past and enjoyed the experience but have to say my last two flights from perth to hong kong then hong kong to tokyo haneda were very average. the plane was looking old in economy noted that first class and business looked like they had been renovated. my entertainment system did not work on the first flight. rarely have i found an airline meal so bad i would not eat it but the hake was disgusting and the scrambled eggs the next morning also awful. on the first flight the cabin crew were abrupt i realise it was a full flight but i still expect pleasantness. the service was minimal and seemed rushed and a bit sloppy. i thought it might have been just me but when i caught up with my husband and son who had flown the same route two days earlier we laughed because they too had exactly the same experience. im hoping to enjoy my return trip in a weeks time more. myself and my wife visit melbourne australia to see our children almost every 2 years. we by choice travel singapore airlines. this time for a change we travelled cathay pacifc from kolkata india via hong kong. we boarded flight cx 105 scheduled on 19th dec 2013 which actually took off from hong kong in the early hours of 20th dec 2013. when dinner was served my wife asked for an extra bun. she was told that there was no extra bun available. i asked for red wine when i was waiting for a second serving by the time the hostess came to me after serving others seated ahead of me she poured into my glass whatever little left in bottle and said sorry food was very good but left for hours without being offered any drinks or snacks. usually fly with singapore airlines who are far superior. expected a similar service. no hot towels provided no toothbrush and paste or flight socks. one meal and drink soon after take off then nothing for 10 hours. hong kong to london heathrow 27th feb cx257. a 12 hr fight two rows apart because single people are allowed to take the window and aisle seats leaving only single centre seats. not everyone can book online  we cant. young children screaming and crying  cant all young children be sat in one area the tv didnt work for the whole journey  i told the hostess but she never came back about it. worst flight and it had to be the long one. ive flown for 10 years from paris to hkg every month at least twice a month. ive seen the service quality whether in economy or business class drastically going down from 2009. the food has become much poorer quantity and qualitywise. the temperature in cabin was very cold and most of the time no more blankets left even for my 9 year old daughter. the online booking does not show you complete routes when booking a ticket. example hk to singapore they dont mention there is a stop in bangkok. so you just get the surprise at checkin. if you want to upgrade from your miles you need to buy a more expansive ticket and even then you are not sure you can be upgraded. even as a frequent flyer of this company it became almost impossible to book a front row seat over the years. before as a marco polo gold member i could easily get any seat i required. will never will fly with them again. ruined the end of our holiday. we returned premium economy from new zealand  shared flight with anz incidentally anz were superb  what a waste of money  service worse than in ordinary economy. ran out of meal choice then offered from the cheaper economy menu entertainment console  light and call system all broken on way out offered medical assistance when call went out  given bottle of water as thanks sgnnrt and osasn. economy class. having previously flew cx i was quite confident in the quality of the carrier. nevertheless these last experiences came as a disappointment. for shortmedium haul flights it seems that cx has definitely opted for the low cost low quality approach of the business. between sgn to hkg the service was indifferent at best. pax did not even receive a tray with the so called meal but simply a sort of hard paper food box. drinks choice on offer were limited but large choice on request. i was not proposed any coffee or tea. to sumup disappointing experience despite the fact that we always flew on time on this trip. my flight from sinhkg was terrible. there was no food and no inflight entertainment system. flight was delayed by 24 hours. my wife and i travelled 4 sectors in cathay business class recently cx110cx261cx260cx139. we have a benchmark from travelling frequently with qantas in business. several major aspects warrant comment. my wife is diabetic which was nominated at the time of booking. on one long overnight sector she asked for a light snack as she had to take medication. the staff member disregarded the request and offered no snack. however on the return long overnight sector a staff member when asked offered that a special snack had been loaded and was most obliging. what an inconsistency in the attitude of cabin staff. there appears to be no small snacks available at any time as is the case with competitors. seat allocation. was arranged at the time of booking which was some six months prior to departure. boarding passes were issued at sydney for the two sectors. upon presentation at hong kong we were informed of a problem i.e the seat was broken and would not recline thus was unusable. we were asked to go to one side whereon we asked for a supervisor. apparently our adjoining seats were not possible as one seat was broken by coincidence the frequent flyer award seat. as the flight was almost fully booked we were allocated seats apart five and six rows behind. as it was nearly midnight we had little alternative. upon boarding we overheard a passenger seating next to my wife who wished to be repositioned nearer his friend. we were able to sort this out and then inform cabin staff. sometime later there was an hour and a half delay before takeoff due to weather conditions we noticed the original seat was occupied and was fully reclined. this seat was the frequent flyer seat. i was very disappointed with our flight from rome to hong kong flight cx292 on 7 may 2014. my son was travel sick and the flight crew were very unhelpful. also service of water and snacks during the night was very poor. i had to ask for water and when i asked for assistance with my son none was given. flew from hong kong to brisbane via cairns in may. we were offloaded from virgin atlantic to cathay and paid to travel premium economy. we did get a wider seat but the cold hard muffin yoghurt and orange juice breakfast had to be a basic as they could get. i dont know what they got in economy but it couldnt have been any less. hardly saw the staff they just werent there or interested. we had to walk a long way through the economy class to get to the toilets so didnt gain anything for having paid extra. unless you need the slightly larger seat dont waste your money paying extra fro premium economy as you dont gain anything. cairns  hong kong return. my seat tray table and screen had dirt on it and a repulsive odour. flight attendant didnt care but did give me a towelette. food was poor. return night flight had dreadful service no hot beverages at all. limited choices of others. the fa walked through a couple of times only with a couple of drinks on a tray and did his best to ignore everyone. the inflight announcements in english were incomprehensible. these planes did not have any personal airjets and were uncomfortably warm. flew from cgkhkg. very disappointed with the service and the product cx actually offers as a 5 star airline flew with cx798 on the way to hkg. upon boarding i had very high hopes for cx. very surprised with the fas on this flight  they rarely interacted with passengers and some were chatting with colleagues in the cabin upon boarding. the food was not reasonable for a 4.5 hour flight received a cold and not very nice sandwich in a box. my back ached due to the poor quality seats in economy. we hardly saw the crew in the cabin. the entertainment service was the only decent part of my journey movies were very up to date and kept us occupied for 4.5 hour flight. overall will never fly with cx again. flew cx 0690 sinhkg and cx 0103 hkgcns. both in business cabin both the recent new herringbone 121 config. the seat is good but everything else was mediocre at best. lounge at changi airport dreadful no proper business class queue at gate. no priority passport lines either at changi or hongkong airports. walking distance from lounge to departure gate at hkg is insane. inflight service on both flights was all done in a hurry by noticeably overworked crew. food was very mediocre. have had much better meals on many coach flights. seat folds out to flat bed but on the a330 service hkgcns the small cubby hole where your feet go the feet feel claustrophobic and it was boiling hot in there. the only kudos for cathay is the wing 1st class lounge at hkg airport with its great cabanas and menurestaurant dinner. sydney  hkg  milan and return premium economy. sadly disappointed. having flown premium economy or business on a number of airlines in recent years this definitely felt economy. service food and beverages were very average. seat and entertainment acceptable. i note that the cost was equivalent to singapore airlines economy class via singapore. next time well opt for sa. neither the food or the beverages offered were business class equivalent. did i misunderstand what we were paying for the crew were rarely seen but happy to step across passengers in the front row. no excuse mes were offered. the only flight where service was up to standard was hksydney when the aircraft was not full. if this was premium well opt for economy on another airline overall a good airline but seats could be more comfortable. my biggest complaint is that after meal service the crew disappear and it is almost impossible to drag them out of the galley for service. this is not the first time i have experienced this on cathay pacific. food is good but portions are very small. 22 july we flew dragonair to connect with cathay 0135 from hong kong to melbourne. we missed our connection and began a 48 hour ordeal exacerbated by poor customer service a lost bag airline transfers that left us sandwiched between babies and high school kids on thai airways into sydney with a seven hour wait before we boarded a flight into adelaide. all together this was a horrible trip. cathay has promised to be in touch but were home four days and nothing. lets face it  an airline is about what happens both in the air and on the ground. disappointing. pvgsyd. dragonair business to hkg cathay premium economy cx101 hkgsyd. after many years of flying the shanghai sydney route decided to try cathay pe. while it was acceptable it is certainly nothing to get excited about. as with many other comments i agree it is slightly better than standard economy and far inferior to business. while not being so interested in the food or entertainment both of which were fine i am much more interested in the comfort factor. cathay pe does not meet my requirements. both meal services dinner on departure and breakfast before arrival the empty food trays sat for far too long obviously the staff serve pe first then do the economy cabin service so it can be a long time before they return to collect the food tray. cabin lights remained fully lit well into the 2355 flight departure. they advertised an amenity kit that provides eye shades but i was never offered one. a pillow over my face eliminated some of the light. bathroom is shared with economy this is not good. the economy flight crew work the pe cabin while we all sat there with empty food trays in front of us business class crew and the purser made a number of trips through the cabin and completely ignored the fact that the cabin needed service. my result is either take a daytime economy flight or upgrade to business. pe is not value for money a separate bathroom and a couple of dedicated cabin staff would make the experience better. cathay need to learn something from turkish airlines their comfort class works very well. cx659 20 july 2014. flying from taipei to singapore transit in hk. when boarding the flight from taipei the plane was so hot. only box of snacks served. the flight from hkg to sin the seat was uncomfortable as it cant be reclined back only the inner part is reclineable which is uncomfortable. box of snacks is served around 1 hour later around 2.30am when people are starting to sleep instead of before arriving as a breakfast. the plane was cold to start with but then was very hot and with no air circulation. melhkghndhkgbkkhkgnrthkgmel. flown cx all around asia in the past 3.5 weeks and experienced all their fleet from the shell seat to the new seats found the new seats to be nice and wide but also hard under the legs. shell seat well what were they thinking all flights were delayed upwards of 30 minutes thats right all crew well they make the airline and most of them couldnt be found after service was complete. the 747 i flew on needed some seat repairs as there were parts missing or taped over and the cleanliness was not exactly great. i didnt appreciate the fact that my table on a few flights was filthy. i do however like the fact that they fly to hnd and that makes them a much better option than qf. meal portions very small but overall ok. ill give them a second go. flew from melbourne to hk then on to london. back to hk from london. we have a 3 year old and found that only one of our flights was good for her. the staff didnt bother to give her the childrens pack or smaller headphones although we were aware that they were available. when we asked for a snack for her they offered peanuts or mentoes hard sweetsboth unsuitable for her. on the hk to london flight our attendant was great but all other flights we felt that we were being a nuisance if we asked for anything and even when they said theyd bring us something they didnt get around to it this was simple requests like an orange juice or an extra bread roll. our attendant from london to hk was very young and maybe just inexperienced. she was quite unfriendly. personally i wish we had booked singapore airlines but the difference in price was significant. two of our flights were delayed one by 90 minutes. not ideal for connecting flights. they did allow our car seat on for free and it was bagged and handled carefully. we have recently done an evergreen tour which was fantastic but we had to pay for our flights in october and pay for them. come to the actual tour we could not book seats until 48 hrs before hand. so i stayed up until 11.55pm 48hrs before we flew and there were no seats left  how can that be on the way home i checked in 48hrs and actual was able to get seats from san francisco to hong kong and hong kong to perth go to get our boarding pass and find out my husband and i arent even together and yet when looking around behind us the middle four seats people had used them to sleep on because they werent taken same goes for the two seats the air hostess didnt seem to even care or help us. after experiencing this because of the length of the flights i doubt very much that we will fly with cathay again. those hostesses couldnt get us fed quick enough. they left out on a bench nuts and a drink if we needed it. i am a lifetime gold qantas member and just this week flew sydney  hong kong premium economy with no issues flight food and service was great. then boarded cx0364 to shanghai flight was 30 minutes late boarding however then we waited in the plane for 3.5 hours before taking off i watched 2 movies the reason that there was 4 other flights ahead of us using the same route to shanghai unbelievable. then on the return flight to hong kong cx0369 arrived at the pudong airport at 2.30pm for a 5.30pm flight to find all of the check in counters closed there was no real explanation for this but was told to check in at the standby counter. i did this and received a pass b16 it seems because i have gold status i was allocated to b the guy i was flying with being a silver was allocated c6 and the local guy a d as he has no status. in talking to other passengers we learnt that the 1.30 flight still had not left so it seems that the pass was a chance to get on an earlier flight. now i could go on and on about this but the facts are that some of the cathay staff were very rude and unprofessional in their handling of this matter we received no real info on what was going on except to ask us to come back at 4pm and then 6pm to check what was going on after returning at 5 mins to 6pm i heard my number b16 called so i was moved to the earlier flight which was supposed to depart at 7pm but finally left after 8pm then to rub salt into the wounds on arrival in hk we had to bus it to the terminal. i arrived at my hotel at 11.30pm but my boss arrived at 3.30am i understand that flights are delayed from time to time however surely cathay can train its staff to be polite and advise customers what is really going on. ordkul via hkg. i found service on both legs of my flight to be not good at all. the crew were not attentive and spent most of the time in the galley. they hardly served drinks throughout the flight. food was average at best and the western options were not good. johannesburg to ho chi minh city return via hong kong. 372014  1972014. flight was delayed and caused missing connecting flight. delayed me by over 24 hours. ground staff were rude and unhelpful. customer service that i contacted when i eventually got home were not much better. will never fly cathy pacific again. business class ordhkgord seats 19a 19k. could not get online boarding pass so had to go to the counter in chicago. unfortunately they only open a few hours before the flight leaves. so about 50 of us had to wait in line for over an hour before they open the counter. no choice cant even go to the bar to wait because you cant get into the terminal without a boarding pass. poor selection of wine hard to believe that the most popular wine in america  chardonnay is not on flights tofrom usa. poorly stocked beverages every cpx flight ive been on has run out of various beers and soft drinks. meal marginal. overcooked beef. the service is bizarre. they are incredibly friendly and seem to be sincerely sorry as they apologize over and over throughout the flight for the various shortcomings. but having said that they are frustrating because they hide in the galley for most of the flight. never come through the cabin. seating on the plane is comfortable. checkin at hkg is awful. they assume you are familiar with the process lounges etc. they offer no explanation or guidance. i fly the airline because the seats are comfortable and they have reasonable award levels for flights with asia milesmarco polo. cx418 6 oct hkg to icn. a330 fully occupied. seat ok also cushion attached to seat belt very uncomfortable. food pasta was a nightmare completely tasteless. salt and pepper is not being served anymore. preferred not to eat. flew premium economy adl to hk with connecting flight to lhr on 27 august. flight left adelaide 90 mins late so missed flight to lhr. what followed was the most frustrating of experiences. 10 hours in hk then we were forced to fly via tokyo to lhr. delay of another 7 hours in tokyo. arrived lhr feeling dreadful. no compensation whatsoever was offered to us until our daughter complained and we were offered a 100 voucher each which we still have not received and we are now back in adelaide. then came the return flight last week. plane out of lhr delayed two hours. turned up at airport with bags packed as we had been told to do whilst still at home only to be advised that they could not get us on a flight out of hk for 48 hours. back home and unpacked bags. two days later had to fly home via melbourne as no seats available on direct adelaide flight. my wife and i travelled from sydney to hong kong on 3 october 2014 in premium economy. cathay pacific had not cleaned its onboard toilets prior to leaving sydney. shortly after take off we used two separate toilets on the plane. both toilets were filthy both had urine all over the floors and smelt. our second leg of our trip from hong kong to paris with cathay pacific had a delayed departure of about 1 14 hours. finally we discovered why there had been a delay. cathay pacific announced that the entertainment system on the plane was not working or more correctly that there was no power to the entertainment system. hence in premium economy we spent 12 hrs on a plane with no entertainment system no reading light and an inoperative flight attendant call button due to no power. the responsiveness of the flight attendants remained minimalist despite the inability of passengers to call attendants. overall cathay pacifics service and value we received for the money we had paid was very poor. from what i observed in october 2014 the standard at cathay pacific airlines has dramatically fallen. we flew from hong kong to london heathrow on 23 october. the flight left 35 minutes late. the first problem was that cathay pacific had not registered my vegetarian meal and were in the process of allocating this to a surprised passenger nearby who was willing to accept it. when we let them know that it was me that had ordered the vegetarian option the crew said that it shouldnt be a problem  there was probably a spare vegetarian meal aboard. not what you want to hear at the start of a 13 hour flight. for the record the other partners on the flights involved virgin atlantic and air new zealand had registered my request and made it clear within minutes of our arrival onboard that they knew where to deliver the vegetarian meal. we saw the cabin crew for the two meals and on three occasions after  the other aisle was serviced our aisle had little assistance. i was awake for about two thirds of the flight so i didnt miss them while i was asleep. we had to almost grab a steward to hand over our rubbish. this was not premium economy this was cattle class with extra legroom. never again. next time we fly we will avoid cathay pacific. i first flew cathay in 2011 to china which was a very good experience in all areas service catering entertainment etc however i flew cathay again in 2014 to usa and canada and was very shocked at how the quality of their service catering and entertainment had declined in a matter of 3 years. the staff who were previously helpful are now unfriendly lazy and unhelpful and the catering is atrocious. the food is poor quality and has little or no taste and rightly said by another reviewer they somehow no longer provide salt and pepper i understand times are tough with certain airlines but you wouldnt expect them to skim on basic condiments. the entertainment system has limited options and sadly i think the overall passenger experience in economy has gone downhill. dont think cathay will be my first choice in future. we travelled from hong kong to la on the 17102014 on flight cx880 we usually fly business but on this occasion we flew premium economy we have flown for many years using cathay to australia europe and the middle east so were expecting a good flight not long after dinner the staff closed all the window shades obviously wanting people to sleep so they did not have to work as was indicated by the total lack of any service they passed through the cabin about twice in 6 hours offering people warm water from a bottle where was the ice cold drink or tea or coffee i have never ever experienced such poor service in all my years of flying the staff on this flight had no recollection of customer service or relations to earn the 2014 airline of the year baffles me. we will certainly not be using cathay on future flights the aviation world is full of options. travelled business from paris to brisbane with cathay pacific via hong kong. the flight from paris to hong kong was very poor. business was full and staff didnt seem very friendly. they ran out of meal options and they couldnt find anything for me to eat for the main meal  very bad. the seat was comfortable and spacious enough but the service was like being in economy  cattle class with a bigger seat. i rang the buzzer but no ever came. the flight from hong kong to brisbane was marginally better crew did seem more attentive but food was average booked these flights with ff points would have been absolutely livid if i had paid for the flights. ordhkg oct 10. first class on cathay commands a premium but in the end you get little more than a bigger seat. consistency and orientation seem to be big problems. for example they seem to offer some f passengers an escort through security while others like me do not get one. they offered a padded mattress duvet to some passengers but not to me. for the most part i was ignored. the inflight service manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. the cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. they ran out of heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. dont get me wrong… the flight is not awful. the seat really is big. they serve 1 can of caviar krug champagne johnny walker blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume but it is a huge premium and from my limited experience the business class is a better value assuming you can get accustomed to the cathay service. they are really very friendly but they basically ignore you. flew ewrhkg in october2014. the lounge was shared with ba. no proper catering instead chips and semilousy sandwiches as well as beer and soft drinks. the flight itself was a hurried affair as everyone wanted to sleep. the fas seemed angry and couldnt wait to deplane. they didnt crack a smile and didnt want to be bothered with questions. the ewr catering was awful. the food service dinner and breakfast was for the most par inedible. cx 198 5th oct. cx 253 7th oct. cx 234 23 oct. cx 197 26th oct. traveled from auckland to london return from milan to auckland all flights in october  premium economy. seating disappointing foot rest hopeless. food strictly average as was service on all sectors. inflight entertainment also strictly average  films not current. cathay needs to up its act in premium economy if it is to compete. my partner and i flew premium economy in october 2014 from london to perth. the leg from london to hong kong was ok with very attentive cabin crew. we were both very disappointed with the seat and limited space in premium economy. we found the food and beverage service very similar to economy class. the leg from hong kong to perth was very disappointing as my inflight entertainment system was unavailable due to the tv screen being jammed. this was made worse as it had not been fixed for several days and the cabin crew were aware of it. i was given 75 american dollars to spend on boards as compensation. on my return to perth i made a complaint to the airline regarding my experience. the airline did reply apologising for the unavailability of the inflight entertainment system. i was offered another 75 american to spend onboard my next cathay pacific flight. i was not happy with the response from cathay and as a result will not choose to fly with them again. my partner and i were very disappointed with premium economy and did not feel it was worth the extra money really not much better than economy class. ive flown with cathay pacific pe jfk to hk many times during the 2012 and 2013 years  my experiences all horrible in short pe class is like an unwanted step child the flight attendants are simply annoyed because they are occupied in the main cabin. ive always had to dispose of my food tray because of abandonment and the extra seat pitch is just offsetted when the seat in front reclines  impossible to use laptop. want to give thanks to the real pe reviews here im saved from the 16 hours of agony and cost. i flew economy from brisbane to london via hong kong. the first leg brisbane to hong kong was very busy and i took the view that the cabin crew were very pressed. hence they made mistakes. for example i asked for red wine and got white wine despite the stewardess repeating my order to me. water was served from plastic jugs and tasted of cleaning fluid. clearly they had not been rinsed properly. and unlike most other airlines on such long haul routes there was no overnight pack containing eg. toothpaste and toothbrush etc. i believe cost cutting has gone too far with cathay. flew hkgewr. the business class was booked solid. the service was cursory at best. the dinner and breakfast if you wanted to call it that was an embarrassment to cx. the entire flight was terrible. if this is the best business class in the world i wonder what is the worst. you have my vote for being the worst. i flew from nyc to hkg. the premium economy section was practically empty yet staff were not attentive. finished drinks were left for hours before being picked up. the most important failure was the seat. the seat is not comfortable. they are made for short people. the seat gave painful pressure mid thigh. on my return flight today i heard another female passenger complain about the same thing. air new zealand has a much better product for this class. 9 dec returning on 12 jan. flights cx358 and cx901 outbound and cx934 and cx357 on return journey. myself and a friend decided to fly with cathay given then good reviews we have read but unfortunately we were not impressed by the level of service we received. we flew return from manchester to hong kong which is about 1213 hours duration. our outward journey was the better of the two legs no delay and the service was okay. i asked for a chicken dinner which was then forgotten and then i was given the only available option which i couldnt eat. on the journey back me and my friend were separated by 9 rows and both given a middle seat. after being sent to three different cathay staff they were unable to change our seats. to top it all off the flight home was delayed. the quality of service doesnt warrant the premium you pay for travelling with cathay other airlines are a better bet in my opinion. traveled business class between bangkok and colombo twice in last month principally because it is the cheaper than thai or mas. terrible departure times 23.05 from bangkok and even worse 02.25 from colombo. cathay now flies a330 instead of boeing 777 which i think was better. seat in capsule format very uncomfortable with recline minimal. in fully reclined position cant fully extend your legs. three hour flight was just about tolerable. i wouldnt go for anything longer. service on board is in a hurry to get things over as quickly as possible. wine bought to you seat in a glass rather than bottle. not impressed meals pretty mediocre. cathay used to be amongst the best but all these airlines are being eclipsed by the middle east carriers. 5th jan cx256 15 jan cx110 and cx161. what a disappointment all the flights were. heathrowsydneyhong kongheathrow. the most uncomfortable flight i have been on facilities virtually nonexistent i am diabetic and when i asked for a biscuit was told i should have taken my own food the staff continually imposed their routines upon passengers lights out windows shut. the toilets smelt very bad at the end of the flight. the food was very poor and when one of my friends asked for a bread roll they claimed that they did not have any and what they did have were for the breakfast. one of our party cannot walk and is wheelchair bound at one point she had to wait 20 minutes for someone to respond to her request to be wheeled to the toilet. two of us followed to assist and then had to stand in front of the toilet door for her privacy there was a complete lack of space  i would add that she is tall and very slim so size was not an issue. very disappointing and far from being the best airline. return flight form hkg to lax. i have no issues with the seats and food but the service is very poor. when i got to my seat i requested one of the cabin stewardess to help me store my cabin bag. the answer i got from her was shocking she said she would do it later together with me i can understand that she might not be strong or tall enough to like myself but she could either ask for another stewardess or a steward to help. even budget airlines help with the cabin bags. after paying to go premium economy we did not get any extra service. we had to use the economy toilets quite away back in the plane. we have always flown with qantas before and the cabin crew pay a lot of attention to you even though you are premium economy. they came round with water and snacks. we only saw the cabin crew when we first got on the 4 planes heathrow to hong konghong kong to brisbane and returning again and other than for meals. travelled on cx358 from manchester to singapore via hong kong that should have left on the 29th. the airport experienced some delays due to snow and was closed for a while. i have no problems with the delay as you cant help what the weather brings however we were boarded onto the plane where we sat for 6 hours going nowhere. cathay have their own infrastructure in manchester airport supplied by airline services who simply couldnt cope with the amount of planes that needed to be deiced. cathay did little to keep us informed and when the flight was subsequently cancelled we got off and put up in a hotel in manchester for the night. the following day we did eventually leave but the knock on effect of the delay was now felt by the flight when we arrived in hong kong there were no connecting flights and the ground staff were overwhelmed with trying to get us all sorted out so spent another day in hk airport. yes the planes are comfortable the food was quite good as were the facilities but their being able to work under pressure was very disappointing and frustrating also they do not accept the fact they could have done better. sydney to paris via hong kong premium economy return. i found the seats to be quite comfortable im short and fat and had little trouble in sleeping. inflight entertainment was adequate with a wide choice of soso titles. service was really quite bad with two forgotten drink requests and one missing meal over four sectors. staff were polite but incompetent and always flustered. food was simply bad. there were times when i though the pe fare not worth the money but walking into economy and then into business put that that right. premium economy is just what youd expect its not business and not economy its a halfway house. in summary the good seating ground staff priority check in and boarding the bad inflight service food transfer gate distances. overall ok not uncomfortable. i had written my experiences in business class ewrhkgewr a few months ago. at that time. i wasnt impressed with the service food and everything about cathay pacific. i assumed that it was a fluke and used cathay again with the same itinerary. it wasnt a fluke i cant believe that this is one of the best business class airlines. the reviews are very good except for the north american flights. in any event ill switch to united in the future. at least ill know their short comings. cathay did provide the best service between new york and hong kong. the service by the mostly hong kong crew was excellent. the cathay chef knows how to concoct those airline meals. the small portions are just what i want on a long flight. if you want more there are noodles freely available. so is the champagne wine and johnnie walker. everything comes with linen and silverware. the movie selection is huge and power is available for personal electronics. i usually manage to sleep half of the flight very nice. my last flight hong kong to jfk via vancouver in january began well in business class but soon went downhill. i was late boarding and the head purser made me a beautiful mimosa joking that the look is what counts. it was just the kind of nice little touch which makes for a great flight. surprisingly the food went downhill from that point. for the first meal i ordered the filet  it was cold overcooked and tough inedible. hours later the next meal was the same. the duck was greasy stringy and tough. i noticed that the entrees were lined up open on top of the trolley before serving. passengers at the rear got cold congealed food because they were slow with the service the food cooked too long then sat open the whole time. i tried to refuel with their ever available noodles but these came mushy though fragrant. very frustrating. except for the one purser who did not appear again the entire cabin crew was new. looked like they are training a whole new crew for this cabin. ive flown cathay for years and years and i know they will fix it. but meanwhile methinks singapore or eva for a couple of years might be good for me. this airline came highly recommended by friends and i think they must have flown a different airline to me. i recently had 4 international flights with cathay all of which were late for take off. our first flight mel to hong kong late out of mel was pleasant the staff were attentive the service went downhill from there. honk kong  new york late for take off which caused problems at the new york end having to pay a waiting fee for car service. londonhong kong an unpleasant trip staff tired and grumpy from the start toilets dirty and smelly and again a late take off. hong kongmel well what can i say late take off again almost an hour. staff should find another job if they dont want to do long haul flights unpleasant to the point of being down right rude. toilets were absolutely disgusting. the only saving grace of this airline was the seats enough room to stretch and get some sleep. my expectation is that flights take off on time and an occasional late take off is acceptable but come cathay 4 late take offs in one trip really is a bit much. cx 879 sfohkg on 1192014 in business. this was a very poor business class service to hkg. the sfo lounge is a disgrace no first section a 12 bottle of champagne served and even that was not chilled and hence not available as they had received the shipment only in the morning. seat 22a is in the 2nd small section of the business class cabin 3 class  no first on this service and it is not at all private or inviting and the crew made no attempts to make anyone feel welcome main boarding is from this cabin so very rushed and feels like an extension of premium economy rather than a premium cabin on a 5 star airline. no introduction or goodbye from the cabin service director even on aa they do that no welcome drink offered no news papers or magazines sorry none loaded sir. constant loud noise from the galley and the 2 main closets being opened and closed in this business section. meal service very mediocre. wines on the chilean promotion not loaded no other alternative. 2 wines to choose from and the champagne was served across the entire cabin from one bottle had to wait for it to be transferred back and forth and it was not chilled. lights dimmed after 3 hrs only to be jarringly switched on full throttle 6 hrs into the flight while one is sleeping for dinner service. we had 8 more hrs to go why does prearrival dinner need to be served when all we are trying to do is sleep average food and not appetizing in presentation. crew did dim the lights as i wanted to sleep but in general were not bothered one of the lav doors was always wide open and let out bright lights in the cabin and i stood up to close the door 4 times and the crew did nothing. no coffee water etc offered prior to arrival as galley was closed 1.5 hrs out of hk. even the new business class seat layout seems cramped even aa have better spacing on the exact same seats on their 777er and that is saying something. im sorry cathay you missed the mark completely  both hard and soft product on this service. yes they have good hk lounges but on board this product miserably failed to deliver. maybe my expectations are that of qatar business and this cx business is way way sub par. geneva to hong kong and return via london in cclass. outbound was ok but nothing special. return was really poor. the food choice was poor and they ran out of the prime dish. staff were not welcoming and were cold. asked if i could dine a bit later but that was refused. they appeared twice. once for lunch once for dinner. will go back to swiss. we flew lhrhkg and hgksyd 1112 january 2015. we were previously booked on malaysian airlines and took the option from flight centre to change after their misfortunes during 2014. wish we had stayed with malaysian. found cathay pacific inflight service and overall comfort to be far inferior to our previous international flights with both singapore airlines and thai airways. in addition we booked and paid for extra legroom on the legs tofrom australia. when checkingin at lhr i noticed that we had not been allocated these seats and to make matters worse my wife and i were allocated different rows. upon questioning this i was told that hkg was not open at that time so take it up with them when we arrive. the flight was delayed and upon arrival in hkg we were quickly and rudely ushered to our awaiting flight to syd. the cathay staff at the gate would not assist even though they admitted a mistake had been made and other people were now in the seats we paid for but they would not move them. we therefore spent the flight crammed into the middle of the middle rows in seats several rows apart. never again will we fly with cathay pacific and very little positive to say based on our experiences. cx736 and cx715 from sin to hkg. i have to say ive been on a few flights in the past year and in my opinion cathay pacific is comparable to a low cost carrier. ive been on all nippon airways and korean air and i expected that cathay pacific would do much better since its been regarded as the best airline in the world so of course i would have high expectations. but no and heres why 1 i did not feel welcome from the moment i checked in up to the point i exited the aircraft the atmosphere was cold to say the least. half of the cabin crew were robotic and the service felt really off to me. 2 food there was no problem with the dinner they served but what annoyed me was the fact that their cutlery was made of plastic. i hate eating with plastic forks and spoons and i was appalled that a five star airline would have the audacity to use plastic tools for people to eat with. 3 in flight entertainment not up to standard the content was fine but the equipment was not. it is exactly the type that jetstar uses and i hate the fact that there were no buttons and that everything was touchscreen. my complaints may seem petty to some individuals but i strongly believe that these three components are some of the basic foundation that defines an airline. i have travelled on cx flights every year since 2004 and i am a marco polo member but i do not find any difference in the staff service. when i asked for a comment form the flight managers kept asking to find out what comments i would be writing. though i had asked for a change of seats on 2 of my flights because there were empty seats. i was told to wait until the door was closed. i waited but the seats were taken by other passengers before the airplanes door was closed though i asked before them. when i was upgraded to business class the hostess chose to give me the noodles burnt and oily dumplings for breakfast. when i asked for a noodle snack in premium economy the hostess refused to serve me claiming that breakfast would be served in an hour actually 1.5 hours later. the staff did not ask what drinks i would like and they just served whatever they liked. hkgsin on a330300 cx735 business class. food was okay limited choice there were only two mains to choose from. not what i expected compared to what i had served on singapore. was given a plastic eyes mask cabin crew could be friendlier. cx 631 30th april. very ordinary service. i had high expectations but the airline failed to meet expectations. i had kids traveling and there was no boarding specific for kids. even during the flight the service was poor for kids. they did not eat and the air hostess did not care. never going to travel again. from chicago to hong kong  the airlines bumped me to business class which was great. hong kong to perth sat in purchased premium economy awful service was worse than any economy flight ive flown meat was so tough i had to shred it and attendants never came by to provide drinks during meal so i had the half cup of warm water they served 12 cup of coffee well after the meal and never returned to offer more cups were still at my seat when the next meal was served the flight was not full so economy passengers were stretched out to sleep by putting up arm rests which cannot be done in premium economy due to trays being stored in the arm rests. seats are difficult to push back for anyone not weighing much such as me so either pay for business class or settle for economy staff never strolled through cabin to see if anyone needed anything. i travelled nagoya to hong kong  plane and service were good. however flight from hong kong to auckland was very disappointing. we sat on the plane waiting for about an hour before it could take off. flight attendants were slow to offer refreshments. i had to ask for a drink as the middle section of the row where i was sitting missed out despite people in front and behind getting drinks. no apology. the guy next to me asked for a water as well which he got at the same time as i got my drink and he asked for a water for his wife next to him which she never got. overnight no one came around offering water and i had to press the crew service button for someone to take my breakfast tray away as we were descending in to auckland. there was a good selection on ife but it wouldve been better if there were more comedy films  most seemed to be drama and the controls were old school with the remote rather than touch screen and it wasnt clear how to adjust the volume or screen brightness. the information screen on the ife didnt explain this info i had to read through the inflight magazine in the seat pouch. very disappointing flight and end to an otherwise enjoyable holiday. i wont be flying longhaul via cathay pacific again. have used this airline fairly extensively as i live in china but my family are in the uk. found the experience in business class somewhat lacking so switched to another airline for a couple of years before trying cathay again for convenience. two hong kong  manchester return flights over a three month period left a very bitter taste. only allowed a very frugal 30kg of luggage in business class the wing lounge at hk is dirty with worn out furniture tasteless inadequate food on offer that is infrequently replenished managed by sour faced staff. only western type meal on board in business class was a very small pizza not what i would call an evening meal and insufficient hot breakfast so i went without. on a return flight business lounge at manchester little more than a pokey airless hole with very little on offer. small baby in business that proceeded to scream for around 11 hours of the flight and whilst as a mother i am sympathetic to this i havent paid a small fortune to listen to this in business class. cathay are one of the most expensive business class options yet offer substandard menus dismal lounges inadequate baggage allowance and insufficient attention to business class travellers who pay for a service that is decidedly lacking we travelled on 1342015 cx0104 melb to hong kong to paris rome to hong kong to melb premium economy. my husband was a first time flyer and very nervous about flying. we were shocked when we found we were separated with our seating and they did nothing to change it and we were put in front of the balk head on two of the legs. the food was very ordinary and economy got the same menu we had to use the economy toilets we didnt have priority boarding on all legs. cabin staff were very scarce throughout all legs unless they were going from business to the rear of the plane. the final straw was we were given a chocolate with one of our meals and couldnt believe it was 2 years out of date. we were given our last meal 2hrs before we landed at 12 oclock at night which was unacceptable as we were going home to bed at that time. traveled cx826 hong kong 152015. we started to load late then once we were boarding everyone came forward the whole plane was boarding in one line while a hostess went up the line stamping boarding passes  we must have stood waiting for a good 45 mins. we were in the second last row so we had to struggle past all the others to get to our seats. this flight takes 15 hours so we got two meals in total they did bring a snack but they closed all the blinds and turned off all the lights what snacks there were you couldnt see. the flight departed late as the incoming arrival from hkg was late. the staff were indifferent few similes unlike on philippine or singapore airlines or cebu pacific where looking passengers in the eye and smiling are the order of the day. the flight was also close to full so there was little chance of having an empty seat next to a traveller. the baggage allowance for check in is only 20 kilograms on some other airlines it is 23 or even 30kg. overall not particularly impressive and a case of living on their laurels. the inflight entertainment lacked a hits and memories of the 60s 70s and 80s channel. was travelling two adults and two kids with seating fixed at the time of booking the tickets and seat numbers specified on the tickets. when doing the online check in we realized that cathay pacific had decided to change our seating. of course they did not have the courtesy to inform us up about this to give us the chance to cancel the tickets and travel with another airline. so cathay pacific had decided to split our family up. 1 adult is seated with 2 kids and 1 adult is seated somewhere completely different  21 rows apart to be precise. we found this out after normal office hours and then discovered a that cathay pacific only has reservations desks as opposed to customer services desks that you can call. could not get their international 24 hour number to work. tried their hong kong number but after spending 15 minutes on hold i hung up. next morning called the local reservation office in zurich. sorry sir cant help with seat assignment it is a different system but you can do it yourself online had already explained that we tried this but there were no 4 free seats together or near each other or ask at the chekin at the airport. as any family reading this can probably imagine we arrived completely tired to our holiday after the long flight after plenty hassle of shuffling 2 small children back and forth in the cabin between mummy and daddy at mean times toilet times crying times etc. now we will see about the return flight after which we shall never set foot on cathay pacific again. an a330 which i realise is not new to the cx fleet but this aircraft was downright grubby. the padding on the seats was nonexistant and the fabric was worn and threadbare. these seats were unacceptable and for an 8 hour flight especially so. the cabin looked dingy and in need of a good clean. the cabin staff were are jaded as the furnishings. no sooner had we left the ground than everyone was ordered  and i mean ordered  to close their window blinds and they had to remain closed for the duration of the flight. so much for having a window seat. at one point while going to the washroom i literally had to jump out of the way of one of the cabin staff who was heading in the opposite direction and i never received so much as a thanks as he barged past. the meals were served with all the enthusiasm of a billionaire serving in a soup kitchen  thankfully it was all over quickly. the food itself was ok  passable for economy class. overall this was grim. im seriously trying to decide whether to give up on cathay pacific after this. its a shame  this used to be a great airline to fly with but now it seems theyre only interested if you travel in one of the premium cabins im speaking from experience. they should take a few tips from their hosts at doha. the inflight entertainment was passable if it wasnt for the constant interruptions for announcements  usually for trying to sell bits and pieces or announcements between the crew. a very long flight and so i chose a window seat so that i could look at the himalayas hindu kush ect. but not allowed to because the blinds were to be pulled down for all the legs of the journey both in and out of hong kong. apparently this is cathay pacific policy and is to encourage passengers to sleep thereby keeping them quiet. i can sleep well on a plane but not for 24 hours most airlines have eye shades. apart from a delayed takeoff the flight parishong kong b777 was uneventful. seats were a bit hard but good legroom. good entertainment system. predinner drink service well received. meals rather bland and tasteless. no cabin service to speak of. hong kongadelaide flight a330 late take off due to disorganised boarding procedure and extra security checks inside the airbridge which seem pretty brief pointless and frustrating to me. seat comfort better than b777 but seemed like less legroom. entertainment system had no sound fa went to check but never returned. another fa was blunt to the point of rudeness when i tried to use toilet 40 minutes after take off because seat belt sign was still on  yet 6 other passengers had already done so and several others were on their feet. no predinner drinks service. during meal service fa spilled a glass of wine into my lap. noisy sleepless flight. not happy. my rating below is based on this flight. in respect of all four of our cathay pacific flights to paris return i was disappointed with the online check in and seat selection process. not once did we get the seats we prebooked nor did the online check in work properly. i chose cathay pacific because of their previous top rating. it was a mistake. organisation of ground and inflight staff was excellent. a comfortable boeing 777 with 9across seating so the comfort of singapore airlines. which made it very strange that the meal service was so shambolic. staff disappeared for long periods passed meals amongst each other which then disappeared and required the staff to go look for more. the bun was hot on the outside but cold in the middle. tthe person next to me got water spilled on them by an attendant who seemed to be nannying them. the whole service took an hour and a half which was probably why only a single drink was served on a 5 hour flight. the premium economy service is non existent and no different to economy. you pay more and the only thing you get is a slightly larger seat. meal service is identical to economy class so i wont bother again with paying more for premium economy. as a marco polo member i flew 8 sectors with cathay in julyaugust 2015  some in economy some in premium economy and 1 sector in business class. if you compare to air nz and qantas premium economy service and treatment you get the feeling that cathay pacific could not be bothered. cathay premium economy is about extra space and absolutely nothing else. if all you are seeking is additional space then fine but this is not true premium economy. the meal choices and portions are economy class as is the service or lack thereof. there was not even a menu offered that subsidiary dragonair can offer in economy. one quick run to dump an economy class meal and drink and that was it for premium. not even close to premium service compared to other carriers. flew on 22815 hklhr 12h50m lack of beverages for the entire journey. the flight attendant will not even offer water unless you call their attention. i asked the flight attendant designated to our seat before the take off if i could have my meal first because i am diabetic and my blood sugar level is going down however this did not happen. it seems that the crew and service is going down compared to the other leading airlines. new york to hong kong with cathay pacific airways  in premium economy. their idea of a lacto ovo vegeterian steamed vegetables and 6 pieces of fruits plus some dessert. they didnt even serve a bread sowhile they were serving others i asked for one and she gave me a really tiny croissant  i requested for one more to which she said that she will first serve others and see if there are any remaining for me. i was on a 16 hour flight from ny to hk and was having my first meal after 13 hours of flying i slept through the main meal. i think it was mainly one young staff that was not well trained or just had poor attitude. i know it is petty when one puts things in the context but petty things make a lot of difference.  cathay pacific airways was a very disappointing airline. business class london to hong kong cabin service poor and meals inferior to other airlines  the meal was hardly different to economy class meal served on a plastic tray with limited choice. then economy class from hong kong to sydney  6 months ahead we requested a window seat and on check in 90 minutes ahead they could not even seat my wife and i together plus no window seat. never again. flew cathay pacific airways from hkg to doh. checkin was smooth however as in recent months the flight was delayed for more than 2 hours. food quality has declined compared to years ago. not all wines on list were really available and selection was limited to those on promotion list only. cabin crew had their hands full and rushed around the cabin. on the return flight bottled water was distributed to each passenger prior to takeoff the brand of this water unknown to most of the passengers.  i couldnt store my stuff in front of my seat on this cathay pacific airways flight. im quite short so struggled to get to my bags and important items  my phone fell out of my bag in the overhead compartment which was a big problem. lots of things werent working in my designated seat. sound stopped working the remote didnt come out at the side of the armrest and when i wanted to watch something halfway through my flight which was 13 hours the screen went black  even if i wanted to put the map on my family couldnt check in online as we booked with our travel agent and as a result we sat rows apart. food and service wasnt that good. i really did not enjoy the flight back home after a fun holiday. we bought our cathay pacific airways tickets 8 months ago to travel in november from toronto to hong kong on a direct flight. i used expedia to get my full fare ticket whereas my husband used his asia miles to redeem his. then last week i got a call from expedia telling me that our nov 11 afternoon flight got cancelled by cathay. we were bumped to the next flight out on nov 12. since my husband used mileage redemption there is no flexibility to move to earlier departure dates. i used 4 hours to call marco polo club airlines membership asia miles and expedia to sort things out. how could a major airline cancel a flight 2 months before departure big impact on passengers who make same day connections to other asian cities via hong kong. in our case i prepaid a nonrefundable hotel room. since i am arriving hong kong a day late i have to lose out my money for 1 night. my precious vacation is further squeezed to 1 day less. very upset. i will not use cathay pacific again.  the ground staff at sydney airport were a bit rude and unfriendly. airplane was very old the food tray did not come out so staff apologised and gave us a cushion to put the food tray on. my seat would not go back as promised. it looks like cathay pacific need to spend more money to keep the level of maintenance higher. the food was great but the staff were not doing their job properly i asked for a glass of water i asked again and the water came 30 minutes after the meals were served.  the food on cathay pacific airways was truly atrocious  i had ordered a gluten free meal and they seem to think that offering a plate of salad leaves and a few pieces of green limp peppers is the best they can do. the normal menu was a piece of salmon which would have been completely fine  clearly they have no clue as to what contains gluten and err on the side of extreme caution. the breakfast served on arrival into hong kong was marginally better and actually looked more palatable then the congealed food offered on the normal menu so much so that i decided not to cancel the gluten free meal for my return journey  big mistake breakfast on flight back into manchester was what looked like a piece of steak with lump mash  disgusting most of the staff onboard on the way out were friendly however the purser was rude and the not the customer service you would expect whether you were travelling in economy or business class. the service on the way back was practically non existent as they clearly expect on a 0100hrs flight that no one will expect anything  only one drink offered prior to the meal service and nothing offered with the actual meal. on request of a bottle of water  it arrived 20 mins later. the seats are fine however the inflight entertainment needs a serious upgrade in comparison to other airlines. as this is a relatively new direct service from manchester i expected more and would definitely not recommend this service to anyone. i dread to think what it was like in economy if business was so bad bahrain to cebu via hong kong. chose this airline to avoid manila. the new business class seats on the a330 cx746 were very good but awful on the boeing 747 cx921on my hkceb route. cabin crew were efficient but not caring or trained to strike up conversation with a passenger. food average for a 5 star airline. good inflight entertainment though with nice range of films. the 747 was an old aircraft with poorly designed business class seating facing at an angle toward the aisle so had to risk cringing your neck to view out of the window. both flights were delayed by nearly more than an hour on the ground. time was made up once in the air but it could be a little stressful if you have a tight connection. as has been mentioned previously lack of drinks was noticeable as they did not seen keen to top up a wine glass or get an extra drink for you. this route is not worthy of 5 stars but more on 3 stars when comparing with qatar airways or singapore airlines. we flew cathay pacific from london and their online check in did not work. had to arrive at the airport 3 hours in advance. flight from london to hong kong was ok. while returning the flight from hanoi to hong kong was delayed byabout 2 hours and we had a connecting flight from hong kong to london. this is where it became a nightmare. the flight staff made no effort to disembark passengers on a connecting flight first. the bus arrives late to take us to the terminal and full and we have to wait for the 2nd bus. im amazed we made it to our connecting flight. this airline is very frugal on alcohol service. after such a nightmare trying to get to our connecting flight would have made the flight easier with more generous helpings of alcohol. london heathrow to melbourne via hong kong. first time on cathay pacific. the lounge at heathrow is very clean and fairly quiet we arrived for the morning flight so not too many in there. called on time we proceeded to board. we were in the first section of business 1x2x1 and only 8 seats but we felt very confined i think the problem is that cathay pacific cater for the asian market and the seats are not made for anyone larger. the crew were welcoming and did their job albeit in robotic style the food was very tasty and the wines of good quality. the cabin was very knocked about scuff marks throughout and the toilets not that clean. the flight from hong kong to melbourne was much worse an old a330 its about time cathay pacific bought new planes this one was very knocked around my seat did not recline they did what they could but it was not very comfortable. again the food and the crew were good. we are a qantas ff and did get this flight back to australia by using points we flew over qantas and thought wed try cathay pacific but i would be disappointed if we had paid a business class fare. would we fly cathay pacific again probably not. i am usually flying 10 round trips globally per year for business purposes but this review is for a long family trip from auckland to hong kong. a bit disappointed with cathay pacific airways and it was our first time flying with this airline. the checkin at auckland was very smooth and friendly. the aircraft was a bit aged interior wise. the inflight entertainment system didnt work well spontaneous reboots on several screens during flight and the sound didnt work at all in one of the seats. the offered food service did not meet the expectations and they ran out of chicken meals long before they reached our seat and the only choice left was the fish. generally you expect a toothbrush kit for a night fight over 11 hours and that the flight attendants walk by offering water and juice at a regular basis but neither happened in this case. manchester to denpasar via hong kong. first time i travelled with cathay pacific and itll be the last. no problems on outbound trip but on return in bali got to gate and found flight to hong kong cancelled till next day due to bad weather. i would have been at least 36 hours late and would have missed days work. gate staff were only interested in handing out hotel vouchers and not interested in making alternative flight on other carriers leaving that evening. was told that no seats available. i pointed out that there were spaces on emirates flight the same evening. blank expression. getting nowhere so booked on emirates and paid 500gbp per ticket. complained when i got back. complaint ignored then told id be getting return leg refunded. today received 60 tax refund. atrocious. will never use again. unsure of why they are rated so highly as the outbound service was average at best my wife had broke her ankle he day before traveling back from the philippines  2 short journeys to hkg and then the long flight home. in the airport we had our wheel chair taken off us to go through security my wife then had to hop around the airport until our flight i asked if it would be possible to have extra leg room for my wife we were not after a free upgrade just so she could raise her leg. we were told no there were none available. there were spare seats with extra leg room on the flight  i took note of these and when i put in my complaint after standing in the isle for 2 hrs and being in the way i was offered a seat with extra leg room. very cross that they could and should have done more for a lady with a broken ankle  took a lot to get them to agree this should have happened on the flight. we now have upgrades for next flight to be used within 1 year as if we travel to hkg all the time. manchester to hong kong with cathay pacific. seat was comfortable once you get used to the angled layout in business class. flight was 11 hours 25 minutes. received one cocktail one glass wine with meal and only one bread roll with meals. no refills offered. you had to ask for anything else including water. meals were lukewarm. staff were friendly but functional. disappointing service level compared to middle eastern carriers. brand new aircraft but no wifi. bhlf. flew hong kong to manila with cathay pacific airways. tired cabin with lots of plastic and cloth instead of leather that was chapped and weathered. very cramped seating and very short seats made it unusually difficult to tuck my bag under the seat. tv screen was tiny like a smartphone and slightly out of focus. very limited movie and music selection. departure gate required taking a train. was disappointing to find that the online shopping catalogue does not match the inflight magazine range. in fact unlike the online catalogue there is no section dedicated to cx branded items  most of which although still advertised are long sold out. a few things that i did like however was the power plug which allowed me to recharge my phone. the docking area once in manila which was very efficient. the efficiency of managing bookings online. having been to the far east a couple of times a year for the last 15 years i thought i would try cathay pacific. what a dreadful experience. the crew seemed young and inexperienced. food was atrocious. had a beef dish which i left. breakfast was no better. it was a 13 hour flight. dinner served in the first 2 hours then nothing for a further 10 hrs. when breakfast did cone only the fruit and yoghurt were edible. complained about the same issue on the outward trip. received a response apologising for the late flight an apparently poor weather. my flight was not late and nor was there bad weather. seems the response was just copy and pasted from other complaints. baggage allowance was a miserly 20k. etihad and emirates give 30k. will certainly never use them again. cathay pacific economy class was disappointing. i had heard great things about cathay pacific before so i was excited to try them out on a flight from jakarta indonesia to newark usa with a layover in hong kong. overall cathay got me where i needed to go but not comfortably. i dont think ill be taking them again any time soon. i had a slight delay in both jakarta and hong kong but this was likely due to many people traveling that day and air control traffic.  i reached my destination around our expected arrival time and the flight was smooth. ground service in jakarta was perfectly nice but the cabin service both from jakarta to hong kong and hong kong to newark left much to be desired. the service on the jakarta leg was much better but it still took a while to get anything to drink. the staff were kind of smirky and not particularly nice but not outright rude. however the staff on the hong kong to newark leg were much worse. i had an arm injury and had difficulty getting someone to help me store my bag overhead eventually a kind fellow passenger helped but the fact that there was a staff member right there who ignored my request for help irked me a bit. then came the food service. it took so long to get anything to drink or eat. at one point i had to wait three hours for a cup of water even after pressing the service request button several times. i think this is unacceptable. two meals were served on this trip. the dinner option was okay but the breakfast was awful i couldnt even finish it. the chairs were pretty uncomfortable in economy. usually i dont have much trouble falling asleep on airplanes but my seats on cathay were really uncomfortable for some reason. im a very short person so leg room doesnt bother me much but if youre taller you will probably feel squeezed. on the other hand the entertainment system was excellent. although not as uptodate as the ones on ana and singapore airlines which have controllers for games the modes on cathay had a wide selection of movies and tv shows which helped keep me occupied while i couldnt sleep. i think it was the only part of the flight that really lived up to its hype. cathay pacific has a great reputation for flights around asia. i can vouch for them getting you where you need to go and having a great entertainment system but not for much else. im sure their business class is wonderful but if youre an economy class flier i would recommend checking somewhere else. sydney to manila via hong kong. a bit disappointing compared to my previous experiences of cathay pacific. at 6ft2 i dont expect to be very comfortable in economy but cathays seats have less legroom than some airlines. i paid for exit row seats on the return as the seat in front dug into my knees on the outbound. tv system worked well though not on until after takeoff which is unusual these days. annoying 3 minutes with of adverts before you can watch anything. meals were ok but pretty cheaply made think student meals. cathay seem to be cost cutting with no salt and pepper and plastic cutlery on all flights they are really stingy with drinks unless you ask. lastly crew seemed to have fake smiles and disappeared after service. \\r\\r\\n cathay pacific airways from hong kong to paris cdg in april 2015. stewardesses served meals and disappeared during the flight. when they showed up they werent kind. onboard entertainment was good and the food was average  the haagen dasz ice cream was the highlight of my flight. everything else was average. recently made 5 j class flights with cathay pacific airways. incheonhong kong manchesterhong kong hong kongsydney adelaidehong kong hong kongmanchester. compared to other carriers i use the cx experience is disappointing. one cocktail one bread roll one glass wine nothing offered twice. you have to ask. all flight menus said pralines  but only 2 of the 5 flights actually offered any chocolates then of course it was only one. the bridge lounge at hkg was great. the wing lounge was very poor and little to eat especially prior to boarding the hkgman service with a small offer of lamb stew or chicken no cocktail offer either. breakfast was a lukewarm omelette. the lounge at man is also awful. the seat however was very comfortable and much better than many other airlines. same seat in both a330300 and the b777300. cathay pacific from hong kong to cairns was probably the worst flight i have experienced. leaving hong kong it seemed as the crew had little control over the large amount of chinese family groups that were on the aircraft and their requests for passengers to take their seats were at first ignored.first time ever that i witnessed crew yelling at passengers to do as they were told. the food was terrible and the seat comfort was poor when the person in front reclined their seat. i will not recommend or use again. zurich to bangkok via hong kong and returning manila to zurich via kong kong premium economy and business. ground service good to very good in all stations except hong kong. issue handling very good. cabin crew with one exception bad. ife good. food average in premium economy good in business class. a once good airline turned mediocre by staff. flight out delayed. received ample compensation and well communicated. fas a huge disappointment. served ice cream before main course drink order forgotten and when fa politely reminded getting glares asked for one beer in the galley getting yelled at that she must search as customers on the flight drink like fish  a thing you do not say in front of customers didnt ask for a choice but already snapped at when premium economy food tray was put down no choice available. all other drinks have to be ordered. an outstanding senior japanese fa on hkg to bkk leg. she was fantastic. for years now on hkgmnl sector always take cheaper competitor pr that offers full service if schedule allows on longhaul connection. seats in premium economy comfortable and regional business seat as well. zrhhkg no drink runs. hkgzrh 2 after 9 hours flying. will i fly again. yes but expecting 3 star airline service from inflight staff and hk ground staff. and only if pricevalue is right. miles away from sq and even lh staff was friendlier and more engaging on hkg flight. kudos to call centre and ground crew in europe.    i took the cathay pacific flight from hong kong to taipei today and i did the online check in 2 days before. when i arrived the airport i printed out the boarding pass and made sure that we picked the seats as what we chose during the online booking. when we got on the plane our seats were occupied. we asked the flight attendant for her help and she asked us to find any unoccupied seats to sit down as the plane was about to depart. i asked the flight attendant again and she said it would be fine. later an old man with his family came and shouted that these seats were theirs and the man insulted us even though we said the flight attendant was fixing the seat problem. if the plane is full and it should have no more vacant seats that can be chosen but i wonder why would the flight attendant ask us to sit any vacant seats as we liked. the staff is so poorly trained and it led us to be scolded by this uneducated old guy. i will never take this airline again london heathrow to hong kong with cathay pacific and hong kong to da nang return with dragonair. the service was not exceptional but better on the way out than on the way home. entertainment options were good with individual screens on seat backs. leg room okay but the seats were hard. worst thing was the food i did eat it because i was hungry but it really wasnt good. same situation with dragonair although their service was better. check in was very good.    singapore to hong kong with cathay pacific. devil is in details. steward would not help put carry on above the seat. singapore airlines allows 30 kg  cathay pacific only allows 20kg and just made to pay 130 sin dollars for excess. the staff could not care less if you are unhappy.  my wife and i recently traveled melbournehong kong return with cathay pacific. having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy pe not a good decision. our problems started when checking in at melbourne airport. although booked as mr and mrs we were advised that we were not sitting together. after some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. however on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. on previous flights with other airlines domestic and international we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. the dinner meal choices were very limited. there was actually only one choice as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the pe section. in addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. when combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that cathay premium economy class is anything more than a more expensive ‘economy ticket with a somewhat larger seat. lots of ‘economy and not a lot of ‘premium. while performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago. based on our recent experience i would not recommend cathay pacific ‘premium economy it does not represent value for money.\\r\\r\\n    flew from sapporo to hong kong. i use to regard cathay pacific as a premium airline good food and beverages and service. however i was disappointed from the ground up. at chitose international airport boarding was chaotic seat numbersrow numbers were not announced and this caused a long queue even prior to boarding. this is somewhat unnecessary and uncivilized. food was bad a sweet meat dish that i could not finish. even more disappointing was there were no juicebeverage runs for the entire flight although it was nearly a five hour flight. i believe juicebeverage runs should be conducted on an hourly basis as it is dehydrating after a long flight. service is rather perfunctory and impersonal. could cathay please bring back the early 90s award winning service  good edible food and beverage and service from the heart\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n hong kong to rome with cathay pacific. my family of 6 traveled on cx293. having already had a poor experience on a previous flight in our round the world booking we arrived with plenty of food to take onboard. thank goodness we were prepared as we sat on the plane for 2.5 hrs. no food or drink was offered during this wait. during the remaining 13 hrs on the plane we were offered only 2 meals. the entertainment just like a previous flight with cathay was faulty for 2 of my party. in comparison with ba aa qantas cathay provides a very poor flying experience. we will never use again. sydney to hong kong with cathay pacific cx1620. my family of 6 found the flight experience very poor in all components. the quality of food and the amount was very poor in comparison to the other airlines we have traveled on. the entertainment system often stopped working during the flight and had to be reset and the headphone outputs did not work well for 3 of my party. the 9 hr flight ended up being 10 because of delays and we were offered only a small amount of food  no coffee of tea was offered during the whole flight. at one stage no service was offered for 6 hrs.    auckland to manchester via hong kong with cathay pacific in premium economy. on the first flight they ran out of both meals and the staff didnt appear to care. the second meal was served only 3 hours after the first and on a 10.5 hour journey this was not good. i was given an economy meal for both meals  not complaining about the quality of them just the uncaring attitude of the staff. the second leg of my journey from hong kong to manchester was equally bad. although i got the meals i requested sitting at the front this time so served first  the service was just as bad. not offered any coffee after dinner and just a plastic cup one third full of wine and no refill. staff indifferent again. i sent detailed comments as a complaint via cathay website and got no reply so a week later sent another one and requested at least an acknowledgement  still nothing bad customer service is obviously not just confined to the cabin crew. cant say im looking forward to my return journey. i do this journey at least once a year but this was my first time with cathay pacific but it will be my last. cathay pacific cx252 from heathrow to clark field via hong kong. aircraft landed in hk 1 minute late all connecting passengers were refused without explanation to board the next flight. we were told we must hand over our boarding passes and at no point did the ground staff explain whats going on. hustled onto a later flight going to a different destination and to add insult to injury had to endure a 4 hour coach journey with no toilet or refreshments or cathay staff. quite simple if cathay cant do the connection times they shouldnt sell the tickets and its irrelevant what class of passenger you are.    cebu to zürich via hong kong with cathay pacific. normally i dont write a airline review but this flight was the worst. we coudnt catch our followed up flight so we had to stay a whole day in hong kong. that wasnt really that much of the problem but they knew it 4h before that there would be several travelers which had to stay or catch other flights to their final destinations and they came up with no solution. we entered the arrival hall where cathay personal should take care of us. well it was just a pure chaos. they had no clue or some of them even didnt new that we missed our plane. 23h later 01.30pm they had finally a solution. i didnt excpect this. the following day we were not able to take our seats next to each other. we finally just had to watch for ourselfs where we gonna sit. they flight itself was a shame too the seats are worn down staff robotic and you have to search the toilets because there are less of them and so on.  poor airline never again. just landed back in manchester after an overnight cathay pacific flight from hong kong. have to say i did not know what to expect from business class and i cant say i would bust my bank balance if having to pay out of my own pocket. granted the seats are quite neat and you get a little luxury compared to the tightly packed economy. but i feel that food and service is actually not much better than what you receive in economy. they offered me a drink just before take off. they handed me one bottle of water shortly before serving me food. i did not want a full blown meal at 2 am and asked for the light option which was advertised as soup. but instead they gave me a disgusting salad with some fruit in a dish. ate the fruit and left everything else. after sleeping for the best part of the journey the next offering after only three visits was offer of juice and tea. followed closely by breakfast offering. thankfully recognise able in the form of scrambled egg with hash brown and a streak of bacon. shortly followed by another offering of juice. i asked for tea which never appeared. that was that. am i expecting too much family flew economy on the way out with me and from what they told me they had more attention and food  drink offerings than me. something not quite right here. so in short nice for space and comfort but the food and drink no better than economy and actually less offered.   hong kong to taipei with cathay pacific and again another unsatisfactory flight. the worst part of the flight is the impolite cabin crews. no smile no greetings and even worse wrongly advise passengers of whether there is a need to fill in the immigration form. the crews were only passionate in selling duty free items. food was bad. the only good part was the avod. dragonair has much better service on the regional routes. as compared to my previous flights with japan airlines and korean air cathay pacific has much worse service.    hong kong to mumbai. i am a long term cx commuter and a member of the marco polo club. while i have always been a fan of the cathay pacific efficiency the service quality both inflight as well as for the checkin staff has really deteriorated. its a rare occasion when i have seen their ground staff smile or try and make an effort to connect with the passengers and the inflight staff has similarly stopped any pretense at courtesy it feels like. and if you are traveling with small children it is almost inevitable that they would be subject to extra rigourous seat belt safety protocols. the recent overhaul of their marco polo rewards is also extremely disappointing with even small benefits like the lounge access or priority baggage handling getting dearer and dearer. not sure where cathay pacific wants to go eventually but they clearly are not doing their brand any favors\\r\\r\\n    melbourne to madrid via hong kong with cathay pacific on boeing 777 and a330. premium economy was very disappointing. initially we thought that we had mistakenly been given an economy class seat. the toilets were most unpleasant the same as the economy section used. service was minimal. not worth paying the extra. if you want to fly cathay pacific save your money and fly economy.\\r\\r\\n    manchester to sydney via hong kong. my husband and i were very unwell on a recent flight from hk to sydney. vomiting and diarrhoea for most of the 8 hour flight. we had already been on a long flight from manchester to hk and began to feel unwell as we boarded the second flight. we only had 1.5 hour transfer at hk airport and we did not eat or drink there. we advised the cabin crew on arrival in sydney i had vomited in bathroom as plane taxied on runway and although concerned to hear it they did not make any report or follow up. on getting home from the airport my husband then spent 2 days in bed and i spent 24 hours. we felt unwell for several days. we contacted customer services and provided completed forms as requested. we received acknowledgement of the forms 2 weeks after the flight and were advised that the forms would be sent to the catering team and we would hear back. 5 weeks on from the flight and we are still waiting for feedback. we had expected that with a potential food issue there would be prompt action. unfortunately this has not been the case. this is our first experience with cathay and we had expected it to be a quality experience. we are extremely disappointed with the poor customer service and will not be travelling with this airline again. the flight from auckland to hong kong cx0198 was very good in seat 30b.  the flight from hong kong to manchester was also late and was amongst the worst. the seating was crushed and the staff not up to the standard i have come to expect. the menu was switched so breakfast was served in the middle of the night and dinner served at 0730 uk time. i must have flown on boeing 777s before but cant recall when and certainly havent felt as crowded and uncomfortable in premium economy.  i have been travelling to or through hong kong for just over 64 years and that trip goes into my book as the worst. i have several more bookings made so will just have to hope for the best.    absolutely horrible except for inflight service. the cathay agents at sfo airports are terrible and have no idea how to help the customers. they are rude and inefficient. my elderly parents were flying to hyderabad and had a connecting flight at hong kong. when we were checkingin they gave us only one boarding pass to hong kong telling that the flight from hong kong got cancelled and they have sent a mail i never received. i requested the lady at checkin to help my parents find another flight as they cannot stay in airport for 26 hours. she assured me that my parents will be taken care with no options left i had to depart them. now the nightmare just began on arrival the wheel chair staff took my parents are asked them to wait for 30 minutes  they waited and no one arrived. the airline information counter indicated that the connecting flight was cancelled because of few bookings and asked my parents to check with lounges for availability. they had no clue what do and where to go. they satslept on airport chairs for 26 hours. my dad told me that some people who fought with airlines staff were given hotel accommodation and food was provided.     i flew cathay pacific from seoul to hong kong. i couldnt watch any movies because the system wasnt working. also there was no provision of water in between meals on this 3hr 55mins flight. i said to a steward that i thought my air fare included a functioning audio visual system he told me the seats were full and the only option was a seat far behind in the plane. when i took that seat the screen was positioned in such a way that i could not watch movie unless i moved my body forward away from the seat. no matter what position i tried i could not watch the movie unless i moved away from the back rest. at the mealtime when i chose the chicken option i was provided with pork.    hong kong to melbourne. i havent traveled with cathay pacific airway for years i used to really impress of this flight but not this time after years that i came back to this airline. sorry to say but it could be a lot better these days. i hope this airline can be improved and up to date. i would hope to travel with cathay pacific again where i can feel more welcome comfortable seat better food and drink service also more attentive service.\\r\\r\\n    \\r\\r\\nflew cathay pacific airways from singapore to hong kong. free upgrade to premium economy which was a pleasant surprise at check in but no difference compared to standard economy other than a slightly bigger seat. 3 hour and 50 minute flight with only one run of drinks service before breakfast. seat could not recline and seafood porridge tasted too watery. attendants did not respond and seemed impolite when i said thank you every time i had service.    melbourne to tokyo via hong kong on cathay pacific airways. the ground staff at melbourne and tokyo were exceptional however the airline itself i was disappointed with. the staff were more interested in getting their job done than customer service. we were sitting at the back and they served our meals last but within a few minutes they came around to collect the meal trays which is not a good experience for slow eaters. the seat on the boeing 777300 was really comfortable i liked how it was tall and that there was a remote but the tv kept getting stuck. the seat on the a330300 was bad the seat was short which means tall people cant sleep comfortably. also the inflight entertainment was bad with very few selection unlike other airlines like emirates. the food was terrible and i couldnt eat some of the meals at all. overall will not be flying with cathay again i prefer flying with singapore on the same route.    flying business class on cebu to hong kong route was a bit of a shock as this plane has a 2x3x2 configuration. this resembled more like premium economy so a huge let down by this airline putting on substandard business class. service was also like economy class  quick and fast with not much of a smile from cabin crew either. ife was fine though. food still average and these days its all asian style food so if you want western food you out of luck. unless they put on a new plane with the much more business class set up of 1x2x1 avoid this route. it was  a let down.    new york jfk to hong kong return. although generally good service per reputation several items were quite disappointing.  cathay pacific airways does not subscribe to tsa pre check so security lines at jfk are particularly long. second they do not have wifi which for a 15 hour flight is very isolating. also the return in premium economy was not markedly better than outbound in economy except for bigger seat. premium economy cabin service was spotty trays left out long after meal with no follow up coffee or drink refills during or after dinner service. food cart rammed my aisle knee very hard twice with little apology. as others have noted only 1 toilet for all of premium economy  which lead to long lineswait times. they did not recognize one world affiliate ffs on same level. i am lifetime gold in advantage but got nothing in terms of boarding seat preference upgrade consideration etc. check in was good but not above average. overall disappointing when compared to touted asian carriers and almost as poor as aa ual or dl long haul.    hong kong to london. tried checking in several times online in the end it asked us to check in at the airport so we did. a couple on our honeymoon were separated on the flight the rude assistants at the check in desk couldnt do anything about it as it was a full flight and we had to wait until the flight was boarding to see if we could sit together. after a huge debacle we got seated together at the very back of the plane with no apology whatsoever. i will never fly them again. bad food bad service old planes.    we decided to fly cathay pacific based on its excellent reputation. boy was i off base. worst service at check in that i have ever experienced. i arrived luckily 2 hours before my flight. told at check in that my flight was cancelled and that we had 15 minutes to make the earlier flight. the kicker was us400 in overweight charges for 2 suitcases. we were told that before we left that since we had flown business to taipei that the charges would be minimal. great surprise. pay up or be stranded in hong kong. manager of zero assistance despite showing jfk boarding passes. customer service on return home of no help either.    flew cathay dragon from hong kong to bangalore. inflight service not up to mark. very cold attitude. i asked for another beer which never came. response was unsatisfactory. they were doing service as if they are doing some kind of favour.  i was quite excited when i booked cathay bit was finally disappointed dont know if i will ever use cathay again. food quality can also be much better.    hong kong to singapore. a tired a330. a rather brusque stewardess with no finesse. small things  like taking a half finished drink away for take off even though we had a delay on the ground. food wheeled out on a trolley for you to choose means its getting cold by the time its a few rows back into the service. hardly surprising therefore that cathay are finding times tough. i would say however i took 2 x cathay dragon flights to china from hong kong and they were both very good.    singapore from bangkok and i had a disappointing flight. inflight entertainment was great good legroom but less comfy seat. however service was below expectation especially when the crew did not give a friendly smile and also food and beverage service was rather slow. no bread and butter and distilled water served with inflight meal. clearing of trays took ages and had to squeeze to move to the washroom. embarrasing moment celebrating anniversary trip.    amsterdam to bangkok via hong kong. my monthly route from europe to bangkok is normally with qatar airways. this time i a business class with cathay pacific from amsterdam to bangkok with a stop in hongkong. well wrong decision business class seat in cathay pacific is cramped and narrow and although there is lots of privacy the seat gives a claustrofobic feel. impossible to have a decent sleep on a 11 hour flight because there is a lack of width. service is not very attentive and food and beverage especially the wines are more economy class level than premium level. first class lounge in hkg is great although also here a lack of service of staff. the seat on the new a350 is even more cramped and narrow not suitable for long haul travel. all in all a very disappointing experience and cannot recommend. cathay pacific does not deserve 5star rating for their business class product. it lacks the services of qatar airways on every aspect a frequent flyer would expect. no more cathay pacific for me.    vancouver to hong kong the service was average and the food was not great. this was a 13 hour flight and one had to find the flight attendants when i wanted something. they were polite though rushed. the seats were comfortable but a little tired and the entertainment was excellent. the new lounge at yvr was excellent. i would fly cathay again but actually think air canada is at least as good.    mumbai to hong kong. this was our me and my husband first travel via cathay pacific and we were really excited about it as cathay is rated among one of the top airlines. but to our surprise cathay pacific disappointed both of us. the aircraft was neat and tidy along with the toilets. we cross confirmed with the check in counter staff to provide us two adjacent seats and despite her confirmation that the seats are adjacent we found that that they were two separate seats in the same row. the seats were very uncomfortable. many staff were extremely curt. it was a midnight 5 hour flight which was delayed. and they did not serve anything to us for the next 3 hour. the breakfast which they provided to us for an international travel was very basic and not making them stand any different from the other domestic airline food.    hong kong to london. business class seat is okay but not matching standards of the best airlines. lounge in hkg was okay but unbelievably crowded and no better than a pay to use facility and the airline has cut back on food in the lounge. onboard service was okay but staff seemed very demotivated and just plain tired. probably not helped by the very clear cutbacks in the business class items served inflight nowadays compared to 3 years ago. the food was awful and portions tiny and even amenity type items seem to have suffered major cuts. it seems the airline has let financial problems filter through to what the passenger receives.    singapore to bangkok. staff were friendly but not attentive.  food was poor quality very simple meal with no salad or appetiser.  no second round drinks were offered during and after meal service. only plastic utensils were used in economy class. food tray were not collected until the end of flight. however aircraft is new and ife was good.  cathay is doing cost down in the difficult time but i think it has affected the customer experiences.   ive been flying with cathay for 26 years. my family and i are all marco polo members ranging from green to gold. today i waited 9.5 hours at the airport for my flight from sydney to hong kong cx110 now cx162 and now im told itll be another 30 mins wait. i understand that hk is experiencing bad weather and i was told the plane had a mechanical problem but there has been problems with the way they dealt with this issue. they never made an announcement about the cancelled flight until well after the anticipated boarding time. when we approached the front desk we were told that the flight is cancelled and we were transferred to a later flight. staff said if they made an announcement then it would create a commotion. it makes no logical sense. i said lots of people are probably still waiting for the announcement. fast forward to the plane ride the most shoddy plane ride ever. ive flown with many airlines  even down to tiny airlines like air timor. this has got to be the worst plane ive flown. the backs of our seats could not be controlled and went up and down just by leaning on it. we were shifted to the back for take off and the tv did not work i have to say the inflight manager was nice about it. the cold water button in the bathroom didnt work. i saw staff roll their eyes after talking to passengers. as i was put in the last seat on the plane on this service i also heard all the gossip about passengers from the staff at the back. i have booked 3 more flights with cathay in the coming 2 weeks and im really dreading it.    kuala lumpur to vancouver via hong kong. shockingly poor customer service. so many things went wrong and the staff handled everything so poorly.  flew kuala lumpur to hong kong. apparently there was a bad storm in hk so we couldnt land. circled around landed in macau refueled landed back in hk to be told our connecting flight to canada had taken off. if our flight couldnt land how come the other flight could leave staff took a horribly long time on the computer offering us new airlines. we were bounced around three different airlines to be told in the end that we couldnt board any of them for a myriad of reasons. offered us overnight accommodation but couldnt find our baggage. came to the airport to ask for a letter for delayed baggage claim and was bounced from one department to another all saying that they couldnt do anything. things go pear shaped all the time. but the staff that handled it were close to incompetent. asked for flight alternatives and got yelled at as he couldnt understand simple english. ive flown budget airlines with better trained staff.    hong kong to zurich. amazing that cathay cares so little about their business class passengers that they on a 12 hours night flight could not speed up their first leg connecting flight of 3 hours by 10 min or delay their connecting flight by 10 min and catch up over the following 12 hours. instead they bumped 2 business class passengers and sent us over manchester and then manchester to zurich. our advice  dont fly cathay if you can at all avoid it  that is the only way we as passengers can ensure they care in the future.    i take a flight from duesseldorf to hong kong. online checkin not possible. checkin on counter are ok staff are friendly but seated in the last row. during the flight the cabin was very cold. crew only provide a second blanket. the food was served almost cold because i sit in the last row. uncomfortable seating opposite the lavatory and in front of the kitchen.    new york to taipei via hong kong. was not able the checkin online for some reason. kept getting an error asking me to checkin at the counter. so i arrived early at the airport and the checkin lines were divided by classes like all airlines do. except there was service at the first class premium economy but no one was the economy counter finally after the premium economy were all served the counter called for the economy customers. the man at the counter had no smile and looked impatient and just asked me to put up my luggage and printed out the tickets for me. did not even ask me which seats i prefer if i could check in online i wouldve picked my own seat. then came an awkward moment of silence where we stood staring at each other. then i asked is that all he finally spoke and said yes you will be boarding at gate xx. he wasnt rude but just didnt feel the friendliness that i was expecting.    vancouver to hong kong. very bad experience with the inflight service. i travelled with my husband and 8 month old daughter from vancouver to hong kong with cathay pacific for almost 12 hours. in the middle of the long flight a turbulence occurred and the seatbelt sign came on. so i grabbed my baby and held her on my lap then put on my seatbelt as i could not find the baby seatbelt that the flight attendants have provided earlier. one of the flight attendants came to check on us if our seatbelts were buckled and asked me if they offered the baby seatbelt to which i said yes but i could not find it so i will just look for it later after the turbulence. fa then freaked out and raised her voice saying what do you mean you cant find it you have to find it now then turned on the overhead light disregarding my sleeping baby then shoved my right shoulder away from the back of my seat so she can take a look and try to find the baby seatbelt. knowing that she wont stop harassing me and my baby i woke my husband and asked for his help. when he saw how the fa was treating me and my baby even he got surprised and blurted out whoa whoa whoa ill take care of them myself. to which the fa said she just did not want to wake the baby. a totally contradicting statement to what she was doing just minutes ago. i filed a complaint to their customer relations department and got a response through email saying that they understand how annoying the situation must have been for me and that they have shared my letter with the inflight services manager so that they can follow up with the staff members in question.  they do not care about the experience of their customers and they have rude flight attendants.    i intended to take a flight from basel to munich and transfer to another one to split. the original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes which is more than enough. however the boarding time was delayed twice as i was waiting in basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. so i asked the front desk what should i do in order to catch my second plane and she  couldnt give a useful answer saying you should be able to catch it. as i got on board i asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. all the feedback i got was i couldnt give any information and sorry we dont have the device to check. by the time i get off the plane i still have five minutes to catch up. however i have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. this is simply no way for me to speed up. i ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. so i have to go to the service center for the rebook. but the queue is super long. they only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  and the officials didnt even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. this isnt my first experience of a tight transfer so i do have some example to compare. i remember when i took a swiss airline from beijing to zurich the plane was late due to frost for two hours. however during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. and as soon as i arrived at the zurich airport there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. eventually everyone was happy about it. if the connection could just be a little more well organized they could help me catch up my second flight and help many others.    boarding shambolic. no separate line for business class. drive 20 minutes in packed stuffy bus and waited another 20 minutes in hot stuffy bus. then another 10 minutes to another aircraft and noticed that the crew and cleaners were just boarding. another 20 minutes waiting liked packed sardines. no announcement no apology nothing.     london to osaka via frankfurt. i received an extremely unpleasant experience. not a single flight departed on time causing severe delays during my journey.  worst inflight meal service i have seen. no response to my complaint regarding the disruption of my journey. it seemed like lufthansa tries to save money by cancelling partially booked flights and putting everybody on the last flight on the day. i had that experience in frankfurt when two frankfurt – london flights were cancelled and everybody was placed on the latest flight in the evening. i will make sure to avoid this company at all costs in the future.    munich to mumbai. a new a350 business class is very unconfortable with 2x2x2 seating. the quality of food was extremely poor for me. crew members with unpleasant attitude to me. economy class passengers leaving the plane at the same time as business class.    milan to miami via frankfurt. entering the first time into the a380 lufthansa aircraft first time into this super extra large plane. shocking finding out that the charger of high phone is located under the central arm rest. hostess not smiling food products poor. space between seats too limited. first time after 10 years flying with lufthansa and probably arrived the time to say good by to this airline.    tokyo to buenos aires via frankfurt the trip from tokyo to frankfurt was very good the staff experienced and respectful. my big disappointment occurred while flying from frankfurt to buenos aires. i asked the stewardess to help me in order to put a backpack in the luggage rack as i was holding my baby and she refused to help me i had to ask for help from another passenger. i also requested services from the staff and the person assigned to the area pretended not to see or hear the passengers calls. when i was getting my return flight from buenos aires to tokyo the flight was canceled and rescheduled we had to wait around seven hours. someone from lufthansa staff in buenos aires did not want to inform us about the arrival times to our destination. i was assigned a second flight from frankfurt to tokyo with only one hour difference i was not informed that i would travel with another airline and they did not confirm whether i would be given seats with a crib for my baby i had paid for this seat as flying from buenos aires to tokyo can easily take more than 30 hours. i asked the staff to confirm this information but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to tokyo so i had to request the information from another staff. finally the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so i was afraid that i could not connect flights on time. in frankfurt you can experience some delay while making flight connections. no one from the airline assisted us even though we had less than forty minutes to get to the second flight due to the flight delay. luckily some security from the airport gave us a priority in the security line because otherwise we would not have arrived on time.     tel aviv to munich. lufthansa has to think about their boarding procedures in tel aviv. we waited 25 minutes for boarding and it took us a long time to get all passengers inside the a321 so we left tel aviv with about 30 minutes delay. the cabin staff were kind of stressed and unfriendly due to a group of passengers who stood in the aisle all the time during the flight. once they announced  there will be a delay at the arrival and they will give further information about connecting flights. the passenger next to me asked how long the delay will probably be but the stewardess did not know. they also announced a gate as arrival position in muc which doesnt exist. the seats were good with enough space even for tall passengers but  only two lavatories for 180 economy passengers there was no inflight entertainment. really poor for a four hour flight. the meal was pretty good and rich but we had to wait 15 hours to get our first drink and there was no second beverage round as on the outward flight to tlv.  lufthansa makes many promises with their advertisement of being a five star airline butare not able to keep many of them on longer flights with the a321. i will think about an alternate lowcost flight next time.    copenhagen to barcelona via frankfurt both ways delayed. left cph arrived an hour late in frankfurt. they bussed us from the plane at terminal a through the maze to terminal b. i flat out ran through the frankfurt airport to make my connection. when i got in of course there was no overhead room. attendant told me i could go check at the back of the plane was sitting in row 6. leaving barcelona the flight to frankfurt is currently delayed an hour and a half. this time dreading the run through the airport i ask the attendant what the eta is because i have another tight connection and he says he wont be able to say until we are 15 minutes from landing. i will never be flying with lh again.     new york to tel aviv via frankfurt. worst airline experience we have ever had. bumped from business to the back of coach paid full fare for the tickets because of overbooking. arrive for our connection in frankfurt to find they changed our children from 3 seats together to 3 random middle seats. no explanation or solution. just a shrug. wifi doesnt work no entertainment on fratlv flight. business class on our connecting european flight is literally three coach seats with the middle seat blocked off. never fly this airline again.     stockholm to los angeles via frankfurt. stockholm to frankfurt was delayed and we couldnt make it to the frankfurt to los angeles flight after waiting at lufthansa customer desk in fra we were going to be send to la via denver 5 hrs later. the lady at the desk forgot to transfer the lufthansa ticket to united denver  los angeles once at denver airport the united flight was also delayed 6h just 1h before boarding we were called to the frontdesk to let us know we couldnt board the plane to la as lufthansa hadnt transfer the eticket to united. we called to lufthansa so did 2 united ground personal and lufthansa staff didnt believe any of us not even the united personal according to lufthansa system we were already in la and not in denver. we had to stay 1 night in denver we were told the next day we would have our new tickets nothing in the morning we called again lufthansa 45 minutes waiting and finally got to speak with an agent who couldnt believe it and we had to explain all again. we finally got some kind of ticket and we could check our selves in united website. we arrived 24hrs later to la. nearly 1 month after the trip lufthansa has only sent the automatically email thank for your email and nothing more. i have never had such a terrible experience. no more lufthansa for us we always booked lufthansa to usacanada even when air franceklm british airways have cheaper fares than lufthansa. very sad experience specially cause none of lufthansa seemed to care about what we always had to explain and none believed us nor the united personal at denver airport. very poor customer service.   frankfurt to hamburg. checkin online 15 hrs before departure there was no possibility for me to choose seat. 20 minutes waiting at the so called fast track. chaotic boarding but first time for me in weeks that they did not go by bus.    hong kong to lisbon via munich. i found some staff in lufthansa rude and impolite. i got simple basic manners never extra nice. the flight attendant gave me the menu but didnt say a word or even smile or make eye contact. she then took the menu out of my hand without saying a word to me. just kept on chatting with her colleague but didnt bother to say excuse me can i have the menu back and give some sort of explanation. at munich airport i tried to confirm with someone from the lufthansa staff if my gate had changed and she replied i could have a look at the information on the board for myself. i was polite and friendly andim used to have the same treatment in return. but in this case that just didnt happen.    kiev to manchester via frankfurt. i booked this trip for my mother to celebrate her 79th birthday with me in england. her flight from kiev was delayed. her return flight from manchester was at 9.20 am which would give me plenty of time to get to the airport. after the ticket purchase the return flight changed to 6.15 am which made me to spend an extra 130 to stay at an airport hotel. the flight change in frankfurt to kiev was 50 minutes. the plane set off from manchester 54 minutes late so my mum missed the flight at frankfurt as she did not have enough time for the flight change. i also booked a wheel chair assistance for her. nobody collected her from the plane in frankfurt as it was promised by lufthansa. it took ages for her to find the gate at frankfurt to kiev and it was one of the reasons why she missed flight to kiev. at frankfurt she had to wait 12 hours before she was given a seat to kiev. the gate at frankfurt to kiev was changed just before the boarding. she arrived to kiev 12 hours later than expected and wasted the money for her train ticket from kiev as she missed it too. the whole journey was a disaster. i will avoid them forever.   poor communication and very unhelpful staff. our flight was delayed without notice and we were held at the gate with no information for hours. our pilot is missing so our flight has been delayed yet again without any certainty of if we will fly out tonight or not. we were told that we are welcomed to sleep in the airport if our flight is postponed. worst experience ive very had at an airport.    chennai to miami via frankfurt. treatment in chennai to frankfurt was very poor by the cabin crew members. it was completely different in frankfurt to miami flight. why lufthansa maintaining two different standards i have not paid anything additional to in frankfurt to miami to get extra treatment. cabin crew members are answering irresponsibly sometime. they even not allowing us wait in front toilet.     singapore to munich. very poor seat comfort small leg rest it is not spacious. not very pleasant staff even  food quality was low. there is no privacy in business class.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n   flew lufthansa from frankfurt to london heathrow. i had to travel whilst 7 months pregnant and was anxious and apprehensive about the journey. i had done everything i could in advance to make the journey go smoothly such a reserving a suitable aisle seat in advance and paying extra for this. when i boarded the plane my seat was taken with no real explanation and i was told i could not sit there and the luftansa staff member was unsympathetic towards my need to be in a comfortable aisle seat. it took a long time for a very unsympathetic response to my complaint to come from customer services. i will not be flying lufthansa again and i do not recommend other pregnant travellers to book with this airline.    barcelona to houston via frankfurt.  my lufthansa flight from barcelona to frankfurt in may was delayed and i was not able to take the connecting lufthansa flight from frankfurt to houston on my prebooked premium economy class. lufthansa asked me to change the flight and rebooked me other flight with economy class. i had no choice but took it. by doing that i lost the privilege of the services of premium economy and reduced flyer program points. i purchased the more expensive premium economy ticket with lufthansa and was downgraded to a less expensive economy class. after the trip i contacted lufthansa and they refused any compensation associated with this trip. this is an extremely bad experience with lufthansa.  it is not worth the money to purchase premium economy class since you spend the money but you may not be able to have the services of premium economy class when there is a delay in flight that is not your fault.    houston to athens via frankfurt. my experience was horrible. they cancelled our international flight from houston to frankfurt 45 minutes before boarding time. their cancellation caused us so many consequential damages costs. we contacted them explaining the situation  but they said they were not willing to pay for our consequential costs. they did not offer a voucher as a sign of apology or compassion.  a total chaos in the gate as well. they did not make any announcement for the cancellation and we had to be notified by expedia through a text message. ground staff was horrible in helping people booking the next available flight we had to fly the next day.     los angeles to amsterdam via frankfurt. the 7478 is an interesting plane to fly its new and a classic at the same time. unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. i was seated in row 16 the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy where seats are sold at premium prices. the seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong not a chance to get comfortable. ife could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could so gave up on that. the insult after injury was the main meal a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo the german kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. a passenger was apparently smokingwhere and when it is of course not allowed  but to wake up 400 passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead fa in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. also bags did not make the flight and although lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip like gate changes they didnt bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in lax why needless to say we were not too impressed by lufthansa and consider this flight and airline as bad as it can get these days   this is my 3rd bad experience with lufthansa in the last 3 months and i think i need to share it. i was travelling business class from zagreb to frankfurt and then to london with a layover in fra of 1hr 45min. boarding at zag was done without priority boarding. when landing at fra the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. not only no separate bus was used for c class passengers but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. when i reached terminal a i had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates b where my flight for lhr was departing from. i have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within europe yet lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. the queue for the security was one of the longest i have ever seen in my life. as a business class passenger and star alliance gold member i attempted to enter the fast track. a lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just no despite me showing her my c class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. i asked her three times whether lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word no. i waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. when i reached the gate boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. the lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said please go and all passengers just run towards the plane. there are not a lot of benefits for business class european flights. people pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. what should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. i have experienced inconsistent and bad service from lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that i would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly dont waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.    birmingham to frankfurt. i am disabled and they insisted i enter a departure gate despite knowing this had no toilet facilities then took mine and my daughters passports away from us when i had to get to the toilet. they were flippant when i complained ignoring me completely. i would suggest you avoid them.    houston to frankfurt. the flights was delayed about 1 hour on my first trip. now this flight is 50 mins late. long time between calling the stewardess and receive what you ask. very limited drinks during the flights. i ask couple of times for additional food and they say it is not possible. very expensive.    gdansk to london via munich. when i purchased the ticket there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at munich  frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so i chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. if lufthansa sells the tickets the transfer should be possible. in fact i had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. when my first flight arrived in munich i had to run. but there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. it would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate but then i realised from the live departure board that my flight to london has departed. as that was lufthansas last flight to london on that day i had to wait until the next day to fly back. there was a long queue at lufthansas service centre as well. they arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. the airport hotel didnt turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. there was a hotel at the airport lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. they should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time. i tried to complain to lufthansa however their website didnt allow me to do so. so i emailed their customer service. they acknowledged the receipt but i havent heard from them since then. i wont fly lufthansa again.    geneva to frankfurt operated by air nostrum hope service of engines is better than that of the seats see attached foto departure was 75 min late and outside position with bus from as far as possible.    the flight from frankfurt to berlin was alright but nothing special with a drink and two small and hard cookies. however the return flight was less impressive. a twohour delay for which there was just a lukewarm excuse. the meal consisted of a tiny package with hard chips  after the unexpected waiting time at tegel airport in the evening hours not really satisfactory. the crew seemed hurried and mostly interested in their free time after work. altogether much room for improvement.    los angeles to munich. i had problems the video display. i noticed others with problems also. it took several requests with several attendants over greater than an hours time for attention. after several reboots the screen froze and i did not have a video display the entire flight.     frankfurt to florence. everything was ruined by lufthansa. we have arrived to frankfurt airport check in passed security control and we waiting for boarding. 15 minutes before flight they said that flight is canceled and we have to go to a counter. we went to counter. there was long queue. it was approximately 20 flights canceled due to bad weather. so after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. staff was quite rude they told us to go to another counter in departure area. we went there. there was several times longer queue. here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. here staff was more friendly. they put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. next morning we have repeated exercise. in boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats so we have to go back to counter. i ask is it possible to talk with manager. answer was quite rude go to counter and there will be your manager. we run to counter. this time we reach it in 40 minutes. they rebook us on waiting list of 1150 flight and told us that at noon air dispatchers strike in italy will start. there i realized that we may reach florence by some miracle this evening otherwise we may not get there even till our train to verona. we decided to change plans and cancel our flights to florence and from verona. they told us that we have to go to different counter on second floor. another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. they told us that here we can only cancel flight but to start procedure of returning money i have to go to site and feel up some request. they told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. of cause it took us 2.5 hours to get it. mean while i feel up that form. it was not from the first attempt that i was able to submit it. to summarize our experience of cause there could be different circumstances like weather conditions strike etc. but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers figure out their needs try to find some solutions. nothing of this was done. in addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions just postponing it. and for sure making client wait hours in queue and kicking them from one counter to another just because managers dont want to look for a solution is extremely bad attitude.     i am a frequent flyer with animals to europe and every time i travel with lh i have problems. the last two times i was quoted prices for my dogs and when i arrived at the airport the price was different. i have filed a claim and have had absolutely no satisfaction. when i calculate my travel i include the cost of the dog and my ticket purchase to determine which airline is most economical this last trip the over charge was in excess of 500. i have friends that also travel to europe with dogs and they were charge the amount i was quoted on the phone so i dont understand why i was charged more. i have submitted to the claims department their payment document and mine to show the error but still no response. lh has a problem with their service center that needs to be address. i just spoke with someone a few minutes ago after a long hold period and was hung up on. i dont know what it takes for this airline to address my issues.    athens to hamburg via munich returning from frankfurt in 0april. the food was mediocre to bad the service was overall although there were a couple of notable exceptions mechanical or indifferent at best sometimes bordering on downright rude. once the food was served on all 4 flights with the partial exception of fraath service was nonexistent. we were not proactively offered anything drink etc on flight athmuc the curtain between business and economy was left open for most of the flight with the result that the business class lavatory was used by people from economy. none of the cabin crew tried to stop them. surely one of the benefits of flying a business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom the boarding process was chaotic  any notion of priority boarding was a joke. on 1 flight by the time we boarded other passengers had filled the storage space. since we were seated at seats 2d and 2f where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers i believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle empty seats. to his credit the steward very kindly helped us find a solution  no preflight drinks were offered on one flight no menus were offered. we were offered a choice of meat or paella.  why should people pay the significant difference in price and travel lufthansa business at least on flights within or close to europe    helsinki to brussels via frankfurt. not much good to say about this trip. woke up 4am and was at the airport 5.15am to take my 6.10am flight to brussels via frankfurt. after coming to the airport we are told that the flight leaves at 14.10. no warning or message sent to me before. at the airport the staff was very unhelpful and was told to search for the lufthansa counter and try and change the ticket. i did and queued for 25 hours. after that i managed to get on a finnair flight with poor seating and poor service. no food voucher was given or no apologies and worst of all no lufthansa staff helping or advising. just queuing and poor service. and flight back was also delayed by 15 hours and extremely slow service on the counter with 1 person only working. what can i say...disappointed.    frankfurt to vancouver. in mar to april 2018 i decided to travel as a rt from yvrfraikafrayvr as i went to visit my family by lufthansa and in returnthe way back when i get to frankfurt they announced after 4 hours delay that the flight from frankfurt to vancouver has been canceled so all passengers had to get the next flight which was not until the next 14 hours as i do not have a schengen visa to get a hotel in the cityfrankfurt i had to stay in the airport the whole evening and all night long to get the next flight for 830 am. they gave me a tiny thin blanket and i had to sleep on the cold metal chair which was the only object to sleep at the whole time and had to try to be awake for half of the time to keep my eyes on my baggage so no one can steal any of my stuff. its obviously not true that the airport doesnt have any room for passengers who their flight get canceled. i was so frustrated and i had to be at work the next day but what ive got instead was a very poor customer service reps and no one was around who could be responsible or at least give some solutions no one helped me regarding to that issue anywhere i went to ask for help were so very unreasonable and couldnt give me any convenient answer  i do not recommend anyone to fly with this airline   although a very comfortable flight from munich to amsterdam we were unable to bring aboard any hand luggage due to the size of the aircraft. hand luggage was promised to be returned at the aircraft upon landing. when we landed however we were instructed by airport staff to move to baggage claim without support from lufthansa personnel there was nobody from lufthansa at the gate. a group of us decided to stay behind and eventually got our luggage from lufthansa but this caused a significant delay which caused me to miss my train. the people who had to wait for their luggage at the baggage claim had an even longer delay since their baggage needed to be transferred.    brussels to ljubljana via frankfurt. before flight from brussels we werent informed about the delay. we boarded one hour later than scheduled departure. we were waiting in the plane one another hour and the consequence was missing the connection flight in frankfurt.  arriving to frankfurt airport i asked at least four persons for navigate me to the waiting hall where i got vouchers for hotel and taxi. i didnt get any information and boarding pass for the connection flight. call to the given phone number of the  office was unsuccessful. i couldnt check in for the new connection flight via internet. the only chance was to go to the airport at 5am and i found the free seat at the next flight.  as a very regular customer of lufthansa i am normally a fan and very happy with the service they offer and provide. unfortunately my last flight frankfurtlos angeles lh 456 was an exception. having been offered a complimentary upgrade to business class at the gate i was then downgraded on board back to economy with minimal apology nor effort to find a suitable alternative. i understood the issue as the business class seat had in fact been sold to a passenger on business class standby but given my status and the value of business i give lh every year it was disappointing. on this occasion the situation was made worse by a particularly difficult neighbor and some average service on board. as i said not a normal experience with lufthansa but frustrating all the same. lh457. departure and arrival on time. confusing boarding practise in los angeles. narrow seats not comfortable. meals on board ok. service average  recommendation only if lh is less expensive than competitors singapore airlines  emirates. disappointed with the recent buenos aires to frankfurt flight. several crew members seemed rude and unmotivated when an elderly lady boarded with a light and small suitcase the flight attendant refused to help her stow it away. other occasions the crew were not helpful to a family travelling with small children removing food plates instead they walked over it and complained about it. other than that service was been ok flight attendants served passengers with water and juice several times during the night in addition to the selfservice bar area with small snacks and beverages. dinner was ok breakfast was very disappointing. unfortunately there are not many alternatives on this route. however on the outbound journey the crew both on ground and on board were much nicer and all flights were on time. lh 411 2 march. my seat was in the first row on the aisle. due to the service it was not possible to stretch my legs for a long period of time. after the flight i still had pain in my back. the onboard service was not very satisfying and the meal served was not really edible. 8314 frajnb lh 572 and 23314 jnbfra lh573 equip a380. on the flight out the aircraft was clean but the seats were very hard and on the flight out the staff had a poor level of english no manners. the worst part was the new inflight system the touch screen was poor at responding to input on both flights. regarding food they only had pasta left by the time they had reached us. highlight of going with lufthansa was ground staff. the worked hard in our personal needs. overall half the price as ba but bring a soft pillow if you want to sleep. ordvce lh 431 on march 18. lufthansa economy class is terrible. courtesy comfort and service provided should be improved and they should add premium economy. my 9.30 lh309 flight on 2332014 out of florence italy was cancelled due to rain. only one lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flights customers. after retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in florence we were to board a bus to take us to bologna leaving at 13.00. it actually left at 14.15. no representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. when we arrived in bologna one lufthansa representative said to get into line 35. when we approached the lufthansa representative at line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. when i pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. she came back without my ticket and told us we couldnt check in until 2 hours before the flight. finally i got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. the meal voucher we were given in florence was not honored in bologna. finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in bologna 2 hours before our flight. when we arrived in frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. the whole experience was awful. stress levels could have been lessened if lufthansa people were wellinformed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. walking around the airports in bologna and frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because lufthansa representatives didnt have a clue or gave us misdirections was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. i understand they cannot control the weather but lufthansa can control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport. lh431. seats are terrible  the person behind you only has to touch your seat and it feels like a punch in the back. in addition when the person in front of you decides to use the reclining function its almost impossible to move or get out of your seat. you have to follow suit in order to have some breathing space. a second glass of wine for dinner would have been nice. i was supposed to fly laxfrablq on april 2nd. due to the pilot strike the flight was cancelled. after over one hour on the phone with the representative i was offered a free of charge rebooking for april 4th ironically the 3rd day of a well preplanned strike. the representative knew less about the strike and the cancelled flights than i did after that useless option was given i was offered a seat on the 5th which unfortunately by this time was making the entire trip pointless. i asked for a refund lh declined even if they failed to deliver their part of the transaction. unacceptable i am a 15 years plus miles and more customer i will now switch to a different airline. my preferred airline to keep my status sen. i like the fact that they welcome to you personally aboard as a senator. this was not done on this trip however. the next space in the economy is not all that great but that is probably true for most deadlines. what i do not like about lufthansa is that they have greatly reduce their miles earnings on certain flights as of this year. if my chances to renew my status were further reduced i would probably look into other airlines more often as well. on this trip i had a nice seat in the exit row. unfortunately i had a huge guy sitting next to me so it was all cramped in anyway. in addition the baby across the aisle cried the entire night however these are not lufthansas fault of course. the flight was on time even 20 minutes early. flight from muc to ord economy class on airbus a330 windows seat at emergency exit. checkin online drop luggage at priority counter star alliance gold was quick. boarding on time first time since a long time priority boarding crowded but ok. interior was the new economy class with the latest entertainment system. seat is more uncomfortable than previous versions. entertainment system cannot plugin headset unless monitor extracted  so not possible to use during takeoff and landing step backwards compared to old system. selection of entertainment system was ok operation slow audio terrible not loud enough. food pasta pizza again poor quality. service less frequent than usual with limited choice. restrooms not very well maintained. flight attendants not overly friendly for one this might have been her first flight so she was struggling which is ok of course for the first time. hndmucath on a346. 24 hours before i checked in on a seat on emergency exit. i was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. thankfully economy section 30 full so i jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. the seat was quite comfortable. food and beverages quite good. on time performance. now on the below par section. the cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. complaints made but nothing changed. ife a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. a worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. poor audio and the headsets completely useless. cabin crew quite the opposite of ana crew on my inbound frahnd. actually robotic. no smiles no interaction. they served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. after 9 hours they served a dinner box again as in lunch there was a choice between japanese and western. priority on my luggage was not honored in athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel. all in all a below par flight from lh. frasfo lh454 13 apr 2014. laxfra lh457 25 apr 2014. first class flight inbound seat was broken. system needed to get restarted 4 times during the flight then adjusted manually. food salad was unenjoyable. main course beef fillet looked very good but was tasteless. service onboard not first class at all. slow and not attentive. lounge lax great facilities. however very thin food offering. business flight outbound entertainment system crashed 3 times. old business class seats. 8 april 14 lh 008 hamfra. packed flight. deadheading stewardess decides to dump her 2 sizeable pieces of luggage in the overhead bins above the emergency exits instead of taking her stuff to the back of the plane. result no space for paying passengers luggage legroom cant be used naturally working stewardess had to rearrange a bunch of bags and coats and spread them throughout the airplane. paying eco customers are rated lower than deadheads. viefrahkg business class on an a321 then top deck on the new 747800 with new business class seats. all flights on time. first leg acceptable although no ifemoving map and food service was merely a tray of small but tasty canapes. on the flight to hkg must say that the new business class seats are very narrow and not particularly comfortable to sleep in. theres also no privacy screen between seats. meals were acceptable although on both occasions my first choice was not available which i found strange being in the middle of a halfempty cabin. service is functionalautomated not very warm and cabin crew didnt appear happy to serve unlike siaemirateothers. the ife monitors were not sharp high resolution like onboard new austrian business class. all in all would rate 610. dont expect anything special its not 4* service. lhs strengths are vfm and reliability so you can count on getting from ab on time and a reasonable price if not in luxury. laxfra. seats 45 bc was poor with faulty design of folding tables. the rice and vegetables at dinner were overcooked digestif service was too quick the bread rolls were served very cold and only on request. during the sleep  overnight period an night inadequate supply of drinks 2 times in the cabin to offer water only. there was no distribution of toblerone. on our outward flight lh 452 all was great  5 stars i used to have very high expectations on lufthansa which was wiped out with my recent business with them. the flight attendants were rude and never responded to call lights instead they turned it off without responding and i have to get to the galley each time for a cup of water. mine was a long intercontinental flight with total of 19 hrs flights. the seats are congested and old. poor quality entertainment system one of headphone speakers not working replaced with another one with without much difference. my 2nd flight was delayed almost 70 mins. i have made at least 8 business class segments in long haul flights in lufthansa in the last 12 months and can certainly say that the service is poor. the 747400 that i flew from buenos aires to frankfurt and frankfurt to tokyo are old the business class is in bad shape the seats are uncomfortable and have the most uncomfortable inclination. the entertainment system is outdated and limited. catering is at economy class level. service is no better especially on the flights to buenos aires flight attendants appear tired uninterested in helping and some just plain rude. service is slightly better on the flight i took to tokyo and hong kong to munich which makes me wonder if the latin american market is just less interesting for this carrier. in any event the crew attitude appears in general as just do not bother me never a reply to the call button. i am a frequent business flyer and definitely regret to have chosen this airline and will avoid using this service again if i can. one final comment headphones are attached to the seats and on two flights i had to take the headphones covers that had been left from a previous passenger in order to put the new ones provided to me that is definitely not good service and not a good hygiene standard. i was flying from washington dc to frankfurt on sunday may 25 with flight lh 419. good seats food was terrible service was not good i was not greeted by the purser as a senator & star alliance gold member inflight entertainment very outdated small screens. flew yesterday from munich to lax. seats arranged in bulkhead 8 months ago only to find agent and seatguru were wrong 6ft long legged female. we kept getting delivered special meals which we hadnt ordered nearing identical each time which were just as bad as the regular meals zero aircon in our section very grumpy attendants many people in our section asked about the aircon but nothing was done. if you stood near the galleys to get some air you were greeted with nasty attendants wanting to know why were we up. very odd customer service. my wife and i booked a return ticket leaving heathrow to caracas venezuela via frankfurt. the final part of our journey was an internal flight to barcelona venezuela where we had planned to visit family. this part of the journey was without incident the return flight was a nightmare. we were due to leave caracas on may 2013. we started our journey very early leaving to take internal flights from barcelona to caracas. upon presenting ourselves at check in we were informed that our tickets had been accidentally canceled and that it was an internal error of the airline and would be corrected. another person was called to the desk from the 1st class check in who said that the flights had been cancelled and that we could not travel as a refund had been issued. no explanation was offered and no one knew on whose authority our tickets had been cancelled. we were told the only way we could travel that day was to buy another ticket for nearly 3.000 money which we didnt have available at the end of our holiday. the desk attendants refused to help us in any other way. lh431 ordfra 3614. aircraft and flight were excellent however the cabin crew were not satisfactory. service was quite slow and at the same time quite hectic crew were a bit unfriendly did not come back after a request when i went into the galley they at first ignored me talking to each other. on the flight to chicago this was completely different lh430 30514. june 8th  flight lh450 from frankfurt to los angeles. after takeoff when the aircraft was at cruising altitude i needed to visit the bathroom. the flight attendant advised me in a very rude way to get back to my seat. we asked for wine during the flight and were advised to wait for the next service. lh crew usually walks through the aircraft with water etc. this crew did not. the food they served was not good. overall lh450 flight on sunday june 8th was the worst experience i have had with lufthansa. had awful experience on flight 428429 from charlotte nc to munich germany and back. food and drink ran out before all passengers were served no effort was made to correct the problem. very unresponsive flight attendants as well as purser. would never recommend this airline. i connected to lh at frankfurt from a united flight originating at sfo. the arrival and departure at fra both involved aircraft parked on remote pads and being ferried on stuffed buses to the terminal buildings where insufficient gate space apparently exists. as i was about to get stuffed onto a bus an imperious lh gate agent demanded i surrender the bag in which i carry my cpap machine. she couldnt have cared less that i was told to keep close hold on it on all my travels and other airport staff have no problem treating it as carryon. furthermore there was plenty of bin and underseat space on the flight. other than that nastiness the flight itself was fine and lh probably deserves its 4star rating excepting for transfers at fra. flight 464 from frankfurt to orlando june 21 2014. trip started in istanbul june 21 2014 on flight 1305. we booked our flights 9 months ago. my seat on flight 464 from frankfurt to orlando was 39c. i checked in online double checked at the frankfurt gate still 39 c. once onboard my seat was given to another who booked late. the new seat was in another section of the plane nowhere near my husband. since the flight was full the attendants would not move this passenger and were unhelpful. the purser was surly and rude. flight from perth to frankfurt via singapore. pleasantly surprised that the lufthansa a380 flight was more pleasant happy crew and comfortable than the codeshare singapore airline flight perth to singapore. however the return flight from toulouse to perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into frankfurt. the almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re book almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot was a disgrace. it is the fear of this recurring which means i will be highly unlikely to fly with lufthansa again. vancouver to munich lh 477 4 july 2014. i found the food to be substandard for a european airline and they also only serve german wines. the seats are so cramped in economy class that it is hard to stretch yourself. they give you warm napkins only on the onward flight and not on return flights. i was carrying my suits so i asked the flight attendant if he could hang my suit in the wardrobe for me and his body language was so obvious that he did not want to oblige my request only when i argued with him did he agree to hang my suits. flight attendants are generally unfriendly they hardly smile and it seems that they are doing the passengers a favor they generally make a big thing even when your baggage is overweight by 2 or 3 kgs they only allow 23 kgs per passenger in economy. compare this to emirates where you get a generous baggage allowance of 30 kgs per person on economy. when i checked at vancouver airport for my return flight my baggage was only overweight by 4 kgs but one of the airline staff members was very kind and allowed me to check my bag in. if not for her i would have had to certainly pay an excess baggage fare 27 june 2014 flight lh454. i flew lufthansa from frankfurt to san francisco on an a380 and it is not an experience i would like to repeat. i know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. what made this flight memorable were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. i hope the a340 and the a330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come. flew 4 flights in total with lufthansa whilst in europe. found the planes to be new and pleasant. the service from the check in staff and cabin crew however was nothing short of rude. very blunt and did not pay any attention to staff during the flight most were in conversation even during meal service. i asked the fa on one flight to store a small piece of art for me to which she said there was no room. not impressed with their punctuality around boarding and departure. the flight i took 3 days ago vancouvermunich was one of the most unpleasant flights i have taken of late. i am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again i was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. it is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. i take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option lactoovo is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. flying with other airlines i never suffer back ache but do on lufthansa flights. i have seen standards drop over the years and find partnerstar alliance partners are usually better. the staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. the onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films tv and languages. i was very disappointed with my flight itinerary. when i called lufthansa to book my outbound flight to munich germany i inquired that 25 minutes to arrive at the gate to my connecting flight out of ohare airport was impossible but she assured me i should not have any issues. well i did my flight was late and i had to run though a crowded airport to get a shuttle bus to the connecting flight gate united airlines flight ua 6115 and ua952 on july 4 2014. my flight arrived at 5.25 and my connecting flight starting boarding at 5.20. my inbound return flight home was the worst lufthansa flight i had been on. the plane was a smaller plane only 1 lavatory to serve the economy area on the plane and the food was horrible. i am considering never flying lufthansa again. aug 1 2014 jfk to vienna flight os88 operated by austrian air through lufthansa. return aug 14 2014 prague to frankfurt flight lh1397. frankfurt to jfk flight lh404. my first and last trip with lufthansa i booked in feb 2014 for a trip in aug. my wife and i are senior citizens and booked bulkhead seating knee problems. when we arrived at the airport we were informed that our reserved seats were given away. we were given no explanation and promptly given two middle seats in different aisles. when i protested i was told there was nothing that could be done. later we were given middle seats next to each other. the tv screens did not work properlya perfect ending to a terrible flight. lh411 from jfk to munich 18th august 2014. i sat in economy class together with my kids. the comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. seemed that they were more interested in talking than working. i am frequent traveler and spend thousands of euros on lh tickets every year and have experienced the following the prices have increased and the service and quality decreased. i do not feel or see any value for money. there are very few flights between london and hanover so thinking lufthansa was an organized airline my firm booked me a flight via frankfurt. its a mediocre flight from london to frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport this seems to happen a lot with lufthansa flights from london to berlin and dusseldorf too. after an involuntary tour of the airport i battled my way through security customs and immigration to get to the hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. to my way of thinking this represents misselling as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes not at frankfurt anyway. perhaps lufthansa regard english passengers as underpeople. to add salt to my wounds lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. i complained again at frankfurt customer service which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam but was only offered a €10 coffee voucher which i declined as an insult. i can only assume that lufthansa is now competing with german wings for the most miserable service. try and leave a comment on lufthansas web page and they actually believe people still use fax machines. lh 426 fra to philadelphia tues 16th 1pm but changed to lh432 to chicago at 5.10pm 16th. american connecting flight number to philadelphia arriving 1.15am today. flight from frankfurt to philadelphia cancelled and rebooked on a later flight arriving almost half a day later. these things happen but the systematic rudeness and lack of consideration of the staff made matters worse. ive often found lufthansa staff are among the most lacking in consideration of any airline. lh 464. the plane was changed between flight booking and the flight itself therefore all passengers especially families could not sit together as originally planned. everything was mixed up. the way the flight attendants worked with this was not very helpful. many children were on this flight. the flight back was much better. nevertheless i would book lufthansa again. just off lh2051 txlmuc. probably ranks as one of the worst flights ever  no welcome onboard plane totally full however no help from crew in stowing luggage  busy chatting among themselves. pilot eventually told us they would delay the flight if we did not manage to stow baggage ourselves. rude and snotty service inflight with no smiles. seats uncomfortable and too short. in addition to that all flight delayed as usual. lh is going downhill. my wife flew on 1062014 from newark nj on flight lh 403 to frankfurt and from frankfurt to chennai india on lufthansa lh758. for health reasons my wife needs a wheelchair as she has trouble walking. we requested a wheelchair for her at the newark frankfurt and chennai airports. everything was fine in newark nj. however when she arrived at frankfurt no wheelchair was provided. lufthansa staff advised her there was no wheelchair and to walk slowly. when my wife told them she can hardly walk and carry the carryon luggage they ignored her. finally one lufthansa staff walked her to the bus to the next flights terminal but she did not help in any way. seeing my wifes inability to move the carryon another kind passenger helped her. when she arrived at her terminal she had to wait for the cart to drive her to her gate. lufthansa staff needs to be trained in customer service especially service to individuals who need assistance. these flights are not inexpensive and there is no excuse for this type of rude and incompetent service. lufthansa flight lh763 from delhi to munich october 4th 2014. outdated and worn business class seats. possible to recline fully but narrow. really close to nonexistent service. despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. after initial takeoff beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. food quality like in a cheap charter flight. no one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer not even a cup of coffee. i recently flew on luthansa flight lh414 munich to washington d.c.. plane was good but the service was marginal. flight service was very rushed. one got the impression that they wanted to get everything done quickly so that they could sit in the back and talk which this is what they did. i sat in the last row of the plane. oct 19 lh783 a group of us travelled to france in transit at frankfurt airport. our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in feb 14. it took us 40 minutes at klia lufthansa counter to sort this out  each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. on our return leg 7 nov 14 our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with lufthansa malaysia. the check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at cdg airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. the return flight paris to frankfurt lh1043 was retimed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at frankfurt. so we had to run for our connecting flight to kl. there were no lufthansa staff at the gate to provide assistance. flight out of krakow to munich cancelled due to heavy fog. lufthansa in krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. lufthansa staff at krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in germany rebooked next day to munich one hour layover then home to chicago. flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding chicago. i asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. we arrived late in munich so the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to chicago by minutes no one at gate in munich to assist us. finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be rebooked. rebooked to frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to chicago the next day. when we boarded short flight to frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting in munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in frankfurt. arriving in frankfurt we had to go to service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. he directed us to belt 16 baggage claim b to get our luggage. we got there no luggage talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at a and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. she finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. frankfurt airport is huge and lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. the clincher is when we boarded our flight to chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration what happened to not being able to hold the plane horrible service. unless lufthansa is the only airline flying to where i am traveling i am not using them again. no one seemed to know and much less care. i flew mumbai to boston in mid october 2014. what a massive disappointment  legroom worse than spicejet i am over 6 ft tall i travelled all the way with my knees resting on the back of the seat in front. staff not particularly friendly. they dont serve water at the seat  when i asked for water i was told to go and serve myself in the galley. in frankfurt my flight to boston was displaying on the screens but no gate indicated for a long time. i approached a member of staff to ask and was told i am not the information counter. what kind of customer service does lufthansa think it is providing the return flight to india was not much different. i have vowed to never to fly this airline. regular lh410 flight good food and inflight entertainment as usual only problem was the freezing temperature onboard. staff tried to increase it during the flight unsuccessfully. oct 19 lh783 a group of us travelled to france in transit at frankfurt airport. our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in feb 14. it took us 40 minutes at klia lufthansa counter to sort this out  each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. on our return leg 7 nov 14 our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with lufthansa malaysia. the check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at cdg airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. the return flight paris to frankfurt lh1043 was retimed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at frankfurt. so we had to run for our connecting flight to kl. there were no lufthansa staff at the gate to provide assistance. chennai to fra. it was a old 747 flight the ife screen was very small and useless no touch screen. there was no great selection of movies unless you know german. i wish i carried ipad. the fas were rude not interested in customer service. for the 10 hour flight from chennai to frankfurt first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. just before landing a small light breakfast. seats were cramped. i was disappointed with lh and will not fly again. flight lh797 dec 11 2014 from hong kong to frankfurt in economy class i dont have a frequent flyer status yet however i try to be loyal to one company. new boeing 7478 in economy  you get what you paid for i always say  but due to my unpleasant experience below some observations that should be taken into consideration. seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 7478 feels incredibly cramped  lufthansas smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious  i get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane but on a 12 hrs flight you dont want to feel like a sardine in a can hostesses not attentive in general. in the future i will rather fly with lufthansas sister company swiss airlines which i personally find of a much better service. unfortunately the crew on this flight was neither very friendly nor attentive. one of the stewards didnt want to talk he just indicated questions by nodding. the flight was not completely full but the crew seemed to be strained  maybe due to problems with the entertainment system  so that they only seemed to care for the guest who couldnt use the entertainment. i am used to a much better service provided by lufthansa  my last flight to ny in september this year for example was one of the best flights i ever experienced  the crew was very attentive the purser introduced herself to me and offered me another seat. they even brought me food from the business class. im not expecting this for every flight but i expect the crew to be friendly and attentive. laxfralax. 1 of 11 lufthansa flights in the last 18 months. some of which were affected by their relentless strikes. i found it to be hit or miss depending on cabin crew. the planes are always clean but never comfortable. the food is always there but can be an insult to taste buds. my last flight was cancelled due to them having a pilot strike. didnt get that message until a day after which by then was irrelevant. i went to a lufthansa counter at cologne airport to get help. their helpline was hopelessly backed up. the flight crew on both legs of my trip seemed arrogant and unresponsive. i missed the beverage service as i was looking out the window  the flight attendant was one row forward by the time i noticed her and simply ignored my attempts to get her attention. they charge legacy rates for substandard service. i will more than likely shop for other airlines for future trips making sure it isnt a lufthansa code share. i felt disappointed on my flight back from toronto to frankfurt in august. at the checkin counter i paid an extra fee since my bag was heavier but that was no problem. i asked if i could bring another handbaggage but the answer was no. i felt ripped off when boarding i saw people with 34 bags each one when allowed is 1. and moreover i couldnt put my bag over me but 510 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be because a young couple had 2 backpacks 2 bags and 2 sleeping bags. i spent 1000 dollars and 150 more for the fee and i had my worst flight because i was so pissed off. and at the airport i had to take the money at the atm paying commissions because the credit card machine didnt work. paid for a full priced business flight from frankfurt to cairo and got stuck on a plane with economy seats no inflight entertainment whatsoever im giving it one star because theres no option for zero no magazines except for newsweek and time no english language newspapers in short i will be avoiding lufthansa in the future even if they downsize for any particular reason on a route without giving the discount why not have ipads with movies i felt disappointed on my flight back from toronto to frankfurt in august. at the checkin counter i paid an extra fee since my bag was heavier but that was no problem. i asked if i could bring another handbaggage but the answer was no. i felt ripped off when boarding i saw people with 34 bags each one when allowed is 1. and moreover i couldnt put my bag over me but 510 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be because a young couple had

paying commissions because the credit card machine didnt work. basically uneventful flight. relaxed and stress free boarding. perfectly on time both departure and arrival. however cabin staff on my side of the aisle was in training. hopefully. forgot things full command of english or german deficient. couldnt answer question on what the food is. all acceptable however not the lack of friendliness. that is unusual at in my experiences as frequent travelers with lufthansa. senatorgold status. i flew on the new 7478 that lufthansa put into service from lax to frankfurt. the cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. i was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. the service was prompt and pleasant. although i dont eat airline food the cabin crew completed service and quickly quietly cleaned it up. the aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant l.e.d. than the standard type. overall better than many other transatlantic flights ive made. fraiad with lufthansa. i was upgraded to premium economy due to senator status and a full plane so they bumped upwards. it was a new 747800 so the screens were ok and picture quality good. positives better food than regular economy. better legspace and seat pitch than regular economy. negatives lousy headphones same as regular economy so could not hear the movie properly. premium economy cabin was messy. strange sharing with regular economy in 4 rows before premium and approx 8 rows behind in mid section. so premium was in the middle of regular economy so it did not feel special in any way it was just as flying regular economy but with better legroom. service level was same as regular economy due to the location of the cabin. i dont think it is worth the extra cost 600 euro more for round trip fraiad for so little extra comfort. if lh reaches thai airways premium levels then it is worth the extra money. i recently flew from mumbai bom to frankfurt fra lh757 and frankfurt fra to newark ewr lh402. in general i am happy with lufthansa service compared to united flights i flew earlier. however i noticed a significant difference in service for the flight leg from mumbai bom to frankfurt fra lh757 compared to frankfurt fra to newark ewr lh402. on lh757 flight attendants were not very friendly one of them was complaining that he had a tough night as far as i am concerned most of the passengers were ready to go to sleep as the flight was scheduled at 3am. so there was not much to do for the flight attendants. i would say it was very light duty for the flight attendants. in economy class during the food service water was only dispensed once. coffee was never served. when asked for water after dinner it never was delivered now notice that on this flight alcoholic drinks were not even offered most of the flight time flight attendants were not seen. on the leg from frankfurt to newark lh402 flight attendants were extra friendly offering passengers help in finding places for luggage. offered alcoholic beverages. extra non alcoholic drinks. after the main dinner service there were extra offering of beverages like tea coffee and water it seemed like a totally different airline why the difference lufthansa had a 10hrs flight from laxfra with this airline and the service at the airport was okay. i did onlinecheck in 24hrs before so i only had to go to the bag drop counter. the line was very long so i had to wait a long time. the funny thing was that the checkin line was much faster. boarding was fast. the impression i got of the crew was that they were very unfriendly and were very stressed. the seats were comfortable for a long flight. leg space was okay if the front seat isnt reclined. a plus was the inflight entertainment a large selection of movies music tv shows and games. the food was better than average a choice between two dishes. i had the chicken which was okay for an onboard meal. breakfast was an omelette with spinach and hash browns a plus is that you have a good choice of beverages and alcoholic drinks. all in all it was a nice flight with average food and stressed stewards. in the past service was much better. lh 402 mar 8 2015 from frankfurt to newark. there was a standard that on star alliance flights the gold members got following standard benefits on board. a priority boarding b personal invitation on board by the steward c free seat next to passengers one to provide more comfort if possible. on this flight everything was wrong. boarding was chaotic there was no priority boarding. no invitation. the flight was not overbooked but stewardess seated another person next to me so she reduced my flight comfort significantly. she could have seated that person easily somewhere else. it didnt happen for the first time. the service standard of lufthansa has decreased a lot during last 9 months. i flew with lufthansa for a connection flight the duration of which was likely no more than 34 hours it was a shorthaul flight. i needed to freshen up before landing there were no seatbelt signals up so i seized the opportunity to use the lavatory to freshen up. as soon as i finished and exited the lavatory there was a flight attendant waiting for me. i opened the door and this woman was standing in front of the restroom with what seemed like arms folded and a scowling face as though id done something wrong. no i wasnt in first class and yes my freshening up in the lavatory may have taken some time. but at the end of the day i paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom. she said not one word and basically stared me down as i walked back to my seat. needless to say the customer service was lacking from the flight staff and i will never fly with lufthansa again. i went from frankfurt to singapore in a a380. lufthansa had changed my prepaid comfort seat to a standard seat because of an equipment change. drinks and food came in the wrong order. no menus were distributed. staff were not service minded and looked more interested in playing with their smartphones in the gallery. movies could not be seen with english subtitles. not the level i expect from lufthansa. oslfratxlfraosl. a couple of hours after i checkedin online the day before i was supposed to travel oslfra txl lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my lufthansa oslfra sector was cancelled due to lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. this lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. furthermore it was all in vain trying to call lufthansas reservations in norway and elsewhere in europe  lines were too busy to get through. so despite my very busy schedule i went to oslos gardermoen airport where sas do the ticketing for lufthansa. in a very short time sas rebooked me on the sas direct morning flight from oslo to berlintegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by lufthansa and lufthansa pilots on strike. i paid extra to fly on lufthansa as i had to be in berlin early but in hindsight sas was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion  paying a premium to fly lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort given the pilots strike not just sas but also norwegian and ryanair would have been better on this occasion. on the return sectors txlfraosl the service was very good and significantly better than i what experienced lately on lufthansa. however all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between lufthansa and capricious lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between oslo and berlin. this time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other star alliance carriers but preferably not lufthansa. i flew lh710 franrt on an old 747400. this plane was very old. most cramped plane i have been on. my ife screen was broken so i wasnt able to watch movies for eleven hours. cabin crew wasnt that nice. one steward didnt smile at all. i would have expected more from a 4 star airline. food was ok nothing special. all in all it was an awful experience. this was definitely my last time with lh 5 may bommuc lh765. 5 may mucgva lh2382. business. ground staff was unfriendly. airline grew ok but nothing special. new bclass seats are not as good as other 4 star airlines. not worth the money for b  class at least. i wanted to fly lh 639 dxb to muc. when we were ready for take off the air conditioning failed and plane returned to finger. air conditioning was repaired we took on more fuel then some more tests eventually pilot announced doors park and flight cancelled  go back to departure gate where ground staff will take care of you. we did 3 ground staff had to take care to rebook some 300 passengers  a most unpleasant experience. i am sure the staff did their best but lufthansa for sure didnt. during 5 hours wait in the queue they only offered some water inside the gate the queue was outside in 18 hours waiting time for the rebooked flight nothing else. frankfurt is too big for transfers between a and z gates unless this airline helps passengers with carts or at least notifies next gate of that passengers are on their way. our intl luggage didnt make the connection all due to what lh called damage to the first plane which was solved with a 30 minute late arrival to bud. we were traveling from bud to iad through fra and it was gruelling and impossible for someone with bags or who cant sprint for 1 mile. flew round trip from denver to frankfurt in may. as noted in previous reviews service was curt lacking in smiles or friendliness. return trip the bathroom was the dirtiest smelliest mess i have encountered on a plane. is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight i have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst ive ever had. what really has made me decide to never fly lufthansa again is this i paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. when we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available. i was told by customer service that paying extra to reserve a seat gives you no guarantee or rights to those seats and my request for a refund was denied. absolutely terrible customer service in my opinion. travelled from frankfurt to hong kong on 20 may. thankfully connecting flight from hong kong to adelaide was codeshare with cathay pacific who provide a true premium economy experience. lh served choice of 2 meals in foil trays coffee and tea in paper cups. hot paper wipe was provided to freshen up cathay provide a hot towel. whilst cabin crew were efficient smiles were rare. basic headphones provided rather than the noise cancelling variety provided by cathay. no priority check in or boarding. plastic tumbler of orange juice given as welcome drink just before take off. cathay offer choice of sparkling wine sparkling water or orange juice served in a glass once you are settled in your seat. blanket provided barely covered knees and legs. cabin is only separated from economy by a small screen. seats were comfortable with a reasonable incline although those on cathay were larger and more incline. think it is a stretch to call what lufthansa offer premium economy. disappointing. better value would be to purchase an economy ticket in the exit row. quick check in though staff werent friendly. delayed flight resulted in missed connection  no apologies or customer service. i was left to fend for myself in a 30 min wait to get rebooked. rebooking agent acted like she was doing me a favour. staff at frankfurt dont appear to enjoy their jobs. my partner and i were flying from frankfurt to hong kong on june 28th  we sat at 34bc. we were left no choice of meal options twice in a row as we were served last for both inflight meals dinner and breakfast. the crew served the meal from the same direction from the back to front of the cabin both times and when its our turn we only got whatever was left. we can understand this the first time but the second time it happened we didnt get to choose our food we felt being treated unfairly and to us it clearly showed that lufthansa did not care about attending to customers needs and respecting their right of choice. we paid our fares as everyone else it is not about we really have to have that particular food its about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice. we have flown lufthansa quite a few times and were very disappointed this is the way lufthansa treat their customers. check in was quick and efficient. while boarding the aircraft an announcement was made for priority boarding of business class passengers and those with star alliance gold status. as a gold member i moved into the priority line and when checking my boarding pass the gate agent complained about me going ahead even though the announcement clearly allowed for it. once on board the aircraft was in pristine condition. as it was not a full flight i moved into a row all to myself and had a very comfortable journey. the fas were not particularly friendly and performed the inflight service like preprogrammed robots. the dinner served was fairly basic but quite tasty. flight left late but the crew me up for the delay resulting in on schedule arrival. the bags took nearly 40 minutes to come out and those tagged priority came out last. overall it was a good travel experience but below the standard i have come to expect from lufthansa. first time flying with lufthansa for a long haul flight. seats food and entertainment systems were on par with other european carriers. the real winner here was the international inflight wifi capabilities. the service was a bit hostile and pretentious at time. the meal service seemed a bit rushed and flight attendants nagging passengers to finish. my family took a long haul flight with lufthansa to berlin via frankfurt. they only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. by the time we came down from the plane at frankfurt i happened to look up at a clock in the airport and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. we walked to the gate and it was a long walk. an airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to berlin. he just said the area downstairs was too crowded so we cannot go down. he held us up for 1015 mins. finally we were allowed to go down and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance as compared to over ten in heathrow airport. that takes another 10 minutes or so. in the end we reached our gate 2 mins late and the plane had left without us. after that customer service was nonexistent. this is no fault of ours. they could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. we were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didnt show up. we tried this for one flight and i refused to do it again. the next available flight was 5 hours later. but we would have reached berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to london. i have booked this ba flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in berlin. yet we had to miss it. to add to the insult we were told we had to take the flight to berlin or they would recalculate the total cost. in the end we had to pay out to get a connecting flight to london from lufthansa. on tuesday 7th of july 2015 we checked in to flight lh1285 to frankfurt from athens. when entering the aircraft we noticed that the seats in business class were the same as in economy and the legroom was the same. the seats were uncomfortable. usually when you come into business class in an airplane you are greeted with a drink water juice or wine but not on that flight. the stewardess did not pay much attention to us. no english newspapers. we had a little boy with us 8 years old and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. we waited a long time until food service started even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. we were served 20 min later. as i said before the seats were very uncomfortable and as i am not a small man i could not put the tray all the way down because the legroom between the seats was not that much. 7th july 2015 frankfurt to keflavik iceland flight lh856. the same poor quality seats. we asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. the reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used the stewardess onboard was very nice and tried to calm me down the reason she said that the seats weren´t better than this was that the flight was short haul. i fly all over europe at least 15 times a year and everywhere the business class has better seats.  lufthansa used to be the best european airline not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. i am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. as a business class traveller with a senator gold card i would expect the best treatment so if i am treated as i have recently been what must it be like for other customers 1 hour delay from london heathrow about 30 minutes on arrival to frankfurt no busses there to meet the flight i guess is airport rather than airline problem. no information on the flight the head purser first doubted that what i said about my onward flight gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not lufthansa´s task to give information on a lufthansa connection with a lufthansa ticket this is most definitely a problem of the airline. with a direct transfer i would have made it now it was a night in frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. add to the misery that i was finally told by the pilots that i should hurry to the gate although when i arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. recently end march 2015 on a late arrival from amman to london again with a lufthansa through business class ticket via frankfurt i made it running to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again no information whatsoever from the flight crew. i am afraid lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. what a shame when only better information would deal with this problem. the very value for money that i used to appreciate  pay more but get something for it  rapidly slips with such treatment. flew lh from lis to fra on a boeing 737800. flight on time. check in at lis was a breeze and flight on time. breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. got to fra with a 2 hour connection. had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. got to our gate and sat down to wait. after 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time i went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. they did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. lh then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in mumbai instead of 1am. the food was awful. seats on the 747 as uncomfortable as the a330. crew were polite. departure procedures from heathrow were very slow. the flight to frankfurt was delayed with no explanation offfered. no seating was available at the gate. it was a mater of just wait and dont block the passageway. no information was given on board about the connecting flights. no effort was made to fast track passengers to make connecting flights. enroute to the gate to get the johannesburg flight we were informed by other passengers that the flight had left. again there were no announcements. no lufthansa representative was assigned to deal with passengers that were stranded. the group was split as some passengers did not have visas to enter germany. after much walking and asking random people what to do we found a service desk with staff willing to assist. this was also stressful as it was late and everyone was going off shift. the airport was near deserted except for the confused and stressed passengers some of whom were travelling with small children. we were given a taxi hotel and meal vouchers for the overnight stay. we had no luggage so a change of clothes and toiletries were an issue. we have been rerouted via lagos with a 6 hour layover.  the flight attendants were surly service poor and the seating uncomfortable. the 747 had the new slim seats and the passenger in front of me had his seatback reclined the entire flight. the movie screen was so close to my face. the beverages were passed out in very small plastic glasses and rarely more than half full. one has to ask for 23 cups to get a healthy amount of fluids. the flight attendents hid behind the curtains much of the flight discouraging passengers from walking in the aisles.  we were told at checkin that out 5 and 6 year old children would be in separate seats across the plane as there were insufficient adjoining seats. traveling with young children is stressful for any family but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most peoples idea of hell. after 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane sandwiched between strangers. i know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges but it doesnt make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane.  maybe lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats. im not sure the current policy is very customer inspired for the family traveller or the individual that could be sittings next to an unsupervised emotional and tired young child.  flew from athens to frankfurt with lufthansa. the meal was not the best yet tasty and enough in quantity. as the flight were on about 6am we were served breakfast  an omelet with baked vegetables a small piece of bread some jam butter and the drink of our choice. most of the cabin crew members spoke greek fluently which was of great assistance to the nonenglishgerman speakers on board. however the service was not good for my standards as i spotted rudeness coming from several flight attendants. one would expect much better by one of the biggest airlines worldwide but i had a good overall experience. lufthansa return hong kong to munich in premium economy. onboard the seats were quite narrow and smaller in comparison to cathay and not very comfortable. there is no proper divider between economy and premium economy and no separate toilet. the return from munich it was raining heavily and we had to take a shuttle bus to the plane. when we arrived at the plane everybody just ran for it. no staff there with umbrellas or to coordinate. given how strict lufthansa are eg. with luggage weight the number of pieces of luggage etc you would think they had better coordination in bad weather.  dusseldorf to jakarta via frankfurt. thanks to my star alliance gold membership i was able to use the first class check in which was very nice. staff really friendly and helpful. in contrast to that however was the receptionist at the lounge. she was grumpy and unfriendly. the lounge was rather crowded. food selection was ok and there was a rather vast selection of beverages available which was nice. dus to fra is too short for any kind of service for economy class. the hardware is the lufthansa hardware for short haul flights. nice and comfy for short flights. transfer in frankfurt was unpleasant due to the long walking distance. i went directly to the gate where the boarding procedures were comencing shortly after. i was able to use priority but the procedure seemed very smooth. shortly after take off menus were distributed however only to some of the economy class passenger. also there was no choice between food options later on. i know some passenger had a different menu. crackers and drinks were served. i ordered water and tomato juice but my juice was forgotten and i was left with only salt and pepper until i had to remind the fa. approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.  food was tasty and the portion itself was comparable to other economy classes. the seat comfort was better than i had expected. the seats recline nicely and there is a decent amount of legroom available. when i wasnt enjoying the new very good entertainment system i was able to catch some good sleep. during flight the fa served water and juice and there was a self service bar for drinks and crackers in the galley. shortly before arriving for a technical stop in kuala lumpur breakfast was served. containing of scrambled eggs and potaoes along with the usual items. most of the passengers left in kuala lumpur and the airplane was pretty empty when we were heading to jakarta. a nice and fresh sandwich and drinks were served on this short trip. overall i would say a good experience. not the top level five star experience you get from some carriers but quite ok.  munich to dubai via frankfurt with lufthansa on an older a340 with 2x3x2 seat layout in economy class which is nice for couples. for the ife the sound plug had a loose contact. tables werent cleaned properly and crew messed up the special food orders. when prompted they said it sometimes happens. checkin had very long queues for manned desks. only automated desks had shorter queues. my husband and i occupied seats 45h and 45g on this flight. we are both seniors. our row was directly behind row 44 which is the bulkhead row. sitting there i expect that there may be a baby or two seated in front of us but not five 5 as was the case on this flight. as the plane attained altitude the woman in front of us changed her babys diaper in the seat. the staff softly mentioned to her that changing should be done in the restrooms and then proceeded to reward her behavior with a multitude of gifts for her two children. the children acted out screaming and yelling setting off the other children in the row during the entire flight. they were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. surely five is too many young children too be in one row making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight so they dont constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them. at the very least all other passengers should get their fair share of attention from the flight staff. this arrangement demonstrated very poor judgement on lufthansas part. checkin staff failed to enter the correct frequent flyer card. the quality of the food was below anything i have ever experienced. we had to ask for our food as the fa had forgotten us during dinner and breakfast he was probably the most unfriendly fa i have experienced. the cabin got quite messy after a while. in dus in spite of having priority handling our luggage was among the last ones to arrive. on the plus side ife was state of the art and the seats were rather comfy. staff on the ground were rude at best. i did not book lufthansa but was transferred to lh flight after air malta cancelled my flight. ground staff took almost 10 minutes to figure out my visa even when i tried to help they refused. the good thing was the food which was edible. i will avoid them in the future. positives about our lufthansa flight from frankfurt to denver. premium economy seats were the same price as economy and offered about 1 more width 4 more leg room and much bigger entertainment screen. entertainment system was gate to gate. negatives  we were supposed to board at 12.30 and depart at 13.20. by 13.00 there was no boarding call and no communication from the ground staff at all. boarding completed about 30 minutes late we taxied for a while and then the pilot parked and turned off the engines no communication for 20 minutes to explain what was happening. waited 3.5 hours on the ground with almost no communication. the crew only came though the cabin two times during the 3.5 hour wait once with water and once with crackers. everyone was starving since they had been expecting to get lunch right after take off and was very aggravated by the lack of any service not even a juice was offered. the kids lunch served at 6pm was 5 slices of potato cooked in ketchup with shrimp salad terrible and neither kid could stomach it. during the flight the crew only came though with water twice on the whole 10 hours. dinner was either shrimp or mushroom not something many people would like. frankfurt to bangkok the boarding was quick since the staff didn´t know how to handle premium economy passengers. we were greeted by the cabin staff and found our seat 25ac. the seat is nice and has a lot of space like lh old cclass seat in 1992. there is juice as welcome drink instead of sparkling wine. avod screen is big and the choices are much better then on my last flight with lh. the food is the same as in normal y but there is not always glass or china most drinks are served in plastic cups or paper cups for hot drinks.  during flights nobody showed up to offer water or juice. our lactose free meal ended up in a vegan meal which was inedible. for breakfast we got the same vegan meal again even complains where not even solved. the seat is nice and very good but the food and service on this flight was not worth it. our flight to rio de janeiro from frankfurt was delayed from 2200 in the evening to 0900 in the morning. lufthansa couldnt provide a hotel because there are no hotels in the transit zone of frankfurt airport we had to sleep in the airport in the couches because we had no schengen visa. the staff from lufthansa sent us to zone b saying there is some sleeping area there but there is nothing similar to that. he said that restaurants are open whole night there but that wasnt true and only 1 shop was working. on the flight back a flight attendant was rude another one forgot we asked for tea. food was poor vegetarian pasta or chicken is not what i expect on a long flight. sandwiches on the flight from frankfurt to london were okay. we bought tickets well in advance and they were cheaper than others. checkin at ams was not smiley and we had to interrupt their talk to be attended. the aspire handling lounge at ams was poor in food and beverages. boarding was quick seat pitch was small 2a. very pleasant and quick service with nice drinks and tasty snacks onboard. fantastic shower rooms are available at senator lounge at frankfurt t1 concourse c welcome by a smiley lh ground staff food and drinks poor for me meatball sausages etc. direct boarding to plane was a real comfort. i had booked an upper deck seat 88a the fas were not there to welcome onboard no smile not answering calls no food during night shift there was some on lower deck. i found the food barely eatable with cheap wines and champagne. tokyo narita to london city via frankfurt. it all started fine the staff were pleasant in a getting the job done but not overly bothered about customers. the seating was fine the choice of films and tv fine. the food is odd  if youre going for dairy free its just bizarre combinations of tasteless food chicken casserole with potatoes and overcooked glass noodles. however it all went wrong when i got into lcy to discover that my luggage had gone to heathrow. something about the plane only taking the first 15 pieces of luggage and weight restrictions. also that they could either take the luggage or the passengers.  however it went from bad to worse as it has been 2 days and my luggage still hasnt arrived. well it did  at 1am this morning but was taken away when nobody answered the door. how very selfish of me not cooperating with the courier for being awake at 1am following a long haul flight. im pretty furious and now have to take another day off work in case my luggage arrives today. i tweeted lufthansa and theyve been no help at all. frankfurt to london city. lufthansa is usually an okay airline but this flight was a disaster. when we landed at lcy we found out the pilot decided not to take almost any luggage on a fully booked flight as it would have been too heavy for the regional jet. staff were not particularly apologetic at lcy just herded people to fill out forms and promised bags will be delivered by next morning which turned out to be a lie as bags still have not turned up yet the next evening. they outsourced this task to an appalling company that even they can not contact as they never pick the phone up or respond to emails. they also booked us family of 4 in rows 3 27 and 28 even though since this was a connecting flight this was done 15 hours before the flight not a last minute check in.  very disappointing as we have been flying with them regularly. berlin to frankfurt with lufthansa on an ageing a321 the worst experience ive had an a lufthansa flight.  the crew were not friendly not rude but ive seen better crews. the captain did not even welcome us on board. i know lufthansa are a great airline because ive flown them many times but this time was not so good. i still recommend lufthansa. i needed to travel with my family from frankfurt to hamburg and unless you are prepared to go by train or rent a car abt 500km lh is the only option. being aware of this monopoly they charge outrageous fares for the chosen dates the cheapest return ticket was eur 260 per person. when booking online by mistake i booked the return flight not one month later but one year later. when i noticed the error i immediately contacted lh but due to office closure hours etc. was only able to actually speak to someone more than 24 hrs after booking and was then told that i could only correct the return flight by paying an additional eur65 change fee per person and additional cost as the corrected return date would only be available at an even higher tariff – the ticket price per person for this less than 1hr flight would have reached astronomical heights of more than eur 400 per person. the only other option would be to file an online complaint they dont take complaints by phone asking for a waiver of the change fee. i went down that option and now one month later i still have not received any reply from them seemingly they just have too many complaints. the flight was as good or bad as any low cost carrier chaotic boarding in fra no room for hand luggage seat pitch seems rather cramped and not exactly friendly service. my conclusion is that this airline is not at all interested in providing any sort of customer service. hamburg to prague via frankfurt. the majority of passengers going to prague did not speak german but flight attendants spoke only german and english. the sandwich and wine was good and the flights were on time. while in my opinion the leg room for such short haul flights is adequate i dont like their seats. my seatback moved backwards once you lean back.     rude cabin crew and a bad experience on this short flight. we were sat at row 4 with a curtain blocking the view to the business rows. a flight attendant giving the safety briefing was standing on the front of the aircraft whom could not be seen from row 4 behind the curtains. she did not like when we lifted the curtain to see the safety instruction.  a bit later on during the flight when they started to serve hot drinks the flight attendant started to serve coffee. my wife asked for two milkcreamer with her coffee she was given only one. she asked again for the second sachets as the flight attendant dismissing the request and started to walked away she said her colleague would serve more milk this was the first row on economy she served so she did not run out of milkcreamers. she ignored my wife and walked away. a bit later during the flight we asked for some milk for our 2 year old son. the senior flight attendant said they dont carry milk on the aircraft. we flew with lufthansa 10 days earlier on the same type of aircraft and they had milk for a baby.  seats were average there was no inflight entertainment on this short flight.    dallas to frankfurt with lufthansa  a bad flight in business class. the seat is lie flat but in a old 222 configuration. food was no better  as the fa reached my seat there was only 1 option still available. the quality was okay but this should not happen in a business class. in addition the crew forgot to serve the welcome drinks in a whole row. flight was on time. ife was good selection of films and series was good wifi works well but all in all not recommended when you pay so much for a business class ticket and get this product. other airlines offer better products for lower fares.    the lufthansa flight from athens to munich was comfortable and the aircraft was quite clean. i was quite surprised however with the flight attendants and their lack of helpfulnessfriendliness. i had to catch a connection in munich and since our flight was delayed i asked the attendant if she knew when we would now be landing. she glared at me and told me i should have listened to the announcement the captain made and walked away. to be clear the announcement was inaudible which is why i called her over for clarification. i was very polite and i think within my rights to ask a flight attendant such a simple question. most of the attendants were cold and unfriendly sometimes ignoring passengers.\\r\\r\\n flew lufthansa from bogota to frankfurt. all announcements and services were done in german as well as english and spanish. dinner and breakfast were served and both were pretty tasty. the flight attendants completely skipped the coffeetea and digestif round after dinner but did two duty free rounds instead. while lufthansa finally has individual ife the selection is somewhat limited for 11 hour flights. most movies are old and the music selection is very poor. almost only unknown musicians are available. the flight departed and arrived on time though. drinks were available in the galley throughout the flight however this was never mentioned during the announcements. the seats get uncomfortable quickly and the blankets are too small.    marseille to hong kong via frankfurt. my first flight from marseille to frankfurt was ok one of the flight attendant was nice and smiling. i do get that fly attendants are not waiters but trained professional here to assure our security but having them smile is much appreciated. we were a bit late it may be only 20 minutes but it shortened my connecting time. second flight from frankfurt to hong kong was not good. being served last and not having a choice of meal is something i do not care about. i was pretty close to the galley and could hear fas chattinggiggling very loudly for most of the flight and they should have cared a bit more. most of them were quite cold and they were not serving drinks enough. the seats werent comfortable and once the front seat reclines it feels way too cramped i was surprised it could be reclined that much. sit back and enjoy the lufthansa entertainment programme is more like sit back and enjoy your own device. i thought i read they updated their ife not long ago well it looks more like they gave it a vintagy feel with movies from 90.  so i would rate lufthansa as my worst flying experience and  dont recommend them. although i am generally very happy with lufthansa standard this flight from buenos aires to frankfurt was not one of their best ones. the seats were comfortable and rather spacious there was a choice of two menus for dinner and no choice for breakfast. ife was ok although if you fly two long haul flights a month you will start to feel the limited choice in the movie selection. the cabin crew was generally good although one was unsuitable for his job it is the first time that a steward pushes me on my shoulder while i am eating and tells me do you want something to drink overall the airpline was quiet and a comfortable flight. prague to toronto via frankfurt. lufthansa improved its economy class in recent years. i hadnt flown economy class on lufthansa for at least 8 years and finally their got individual ife screens. the movie selection is pretty limited but i really liked the live tv option. the flight attendants were reluctant to speak english to me. drinks were served throughout the flight and were available in the galley at all times and the food as okay. despite being over 6 feet tall i cant complain about the leg room and the flight arrived ahead of schedule. not a real business class on a four hour plus route from frankfurt to tel aviv. basically an economy seat with a table between. service no different than coach. a total waste  at very high . lounge in frankfurt was stuffed with people minimal snacks. my last time using lufthansa business.    i take approximately 100 flights per year. i hadnt flown lufthansa on an intercontinental flight for a while and i was extremely surprised to find out how much their standards had gone down since my last long haul flight with them. flew from san francisco to istanbul via frankfurt. check in was very efficient and fast lounge in sfo was uniteds first class lounge which was nice. once on board we were presented with the slippers pajamas and amenity kits. 50 minutes after take off i decided to ask for a glass of wine as nothing was offered. food was really some of the worst i have had. from presentation to taste it was a fiasco. the crew was efficient but unfriendly. seat comfort and bed was perfect. once in frankfurt connecting first class passengers were not met like with other airlines and we had to struggle through that crazy airport taking sky trains and tunnels plus another security check which by the way doesnt exist on most other airports if you are coming from the usa before reaching the first class lounge. the lounge itself is perfect with all amenities. connecting in frankfurt is a nightmare and unfortunately lufthansa is on the bottom of my list for intercontinental flights especially with the price they charge for first class.    dublin business class lounge is back in the dark ages. almost as bad as rome and thats saying something. fridge not working so no cold drinks. food was very light so saved myself for the flight bad mistake. they have a press button survey machine at the entrance to the lounge  they know its bad. hit the unhappy face. the flight food was delivered before any drinks. had to wait 10 minutes for the non dedicated business class staff they did economy class as well to get around to serving me a glass of water so i could eat the lousy prawn and inedidable chunk of tuna. second glass if wine no serving economy class passengers. luckily the flight was just under 2 hours. im now in the business class lounge at frankfurt z concourse. no staff to serve a drink but two staff sitting behind a desk doing nothing the virgin lounge at perth airport in australia is much better. come on this is frankfurt germany lufthansas hub airport and perth airport is better best part about the lounge its very quiet. maybe i should have coughed for the lufthansa senator lounge.    i got a ticket from strasbourg to athens via frankfurt return. this includes a lufthansa express bus on the sxbfrasxb segments. i missed the sxbfra segment and got to fra 200 km with my car 2 hours before the flight and with a valid boarding pass. however while trying to board the plane i was denied entry and i was informed that all the rest of my segments were canceled including return from ath. they argued that i missed the 1st segment the bus and when i complained that this is only a bus they said that they treat the bus the same as the plane keep this in mind.  they wanted me to buy a new ticket because my ticket was not rebookable and then see when i would fly after much grief they allowed to board fortunately there was 1 seat but warned me to call lh as soon as i got to ath. so i did and asking them to show me where are these terms stated that is if i miss the 1st segment and in particular the bus all are canceled they couldnt. after much debate they  issued a new ticket for me for the return for small admin fee.     new york jfk to frankfurt. my wife and i were seated in 32ef middle of centre 4 seating with our backs up against the toilets and galley. there was no way of reclining our seats and very little leg room. this was bad enough for a 7.5 hour flight but as soon as we were in the air the passengers in front of us reclined their seats the backs of their seats came back to very near our faces. also with their movement we got our knees whacked. what really gets me is that we paid for what comfort economy class offers but this was subeconomy standard we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. the laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. we hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. after a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. this happened again later on when the need was desperate. still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down. while this was going on the toilets further up the plane were doing business as usual. dont the cabin crew care about the health of passengers  due to the strike on 29th nov lufthansa cancelled my flight. i had to rebook a flight at a lot of inconvenience at short notice. in the meantime i have been on hold for over an hour and given up and tried their email feedback form in order to claim my refund. why when lufthansa cancelled the flight they cannot automatically refund my money is beyond me other than to keep my money as their process is too long and difficult so people give up and i have enough to do because of their cancellation at the last minute.     i was supposed to fly out of new delhi to boston via frankfurt on 26th november when the pilot strike was extended and i became its latest victim. my flight to frankfurt was just a few hours away when i got a text that the other leg of my journey from frankfurt to boston had been cancelled. i could not afford to be stranded in frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate i managed to book another flight through british airways which would land me in boston just a few hours later than the cancelled lufthansa flight. so seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later i finally landed in boston. the following day i decided to reach out to lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. a curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through but she would not divulge the amount to me. i went ahead and told her that i had spent 1700 to rebook my flight just so i could be back in time for my wifes surgery at which point i was told and i quote  that was your decision and your problem. we are not liable for it. so was it my fault that lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem and they have had this issue for years their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. the only reason that i have posted this review is that i do not want another person to go through what me and probably thousands of others have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. i would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance you are better off going with a more stable airline as lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever. spare yourself the anguish that we have gone through and find yourself another reliable and more customer friendly airline.    chicago to moscow via frankfurt. extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  our flight from chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. ok i get it troubles happen. we had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable united lounge in chicago. on the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened  meaning you have to hold it. when the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked but neither my flight nor my husband was. even though there were some flights departing after our flights we were not announced to be rebooked. when we came out of the plane there was a service person from lufthansa answering questions. my husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said if you run you can catch your flight. it was 930 am and my initial flight lh1444 was boarding at 915 in a different zone we landed to z zone in fra airport and my boarding was at b gate. knowing that fra is one of the biggest airports in the world i though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as running through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. however when we came to the service desk there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that i should run to catch my flight. it was 935 am as mentioned before my boarding started at 915 am. so if two people told me i should run i decided to leave my husband who was traveling to prague and try to catch my flight. the trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport then i had to go through train and security check being out of breath when i finally came to the gate it was 950 am and my flight had already left. the lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and i should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. in the lounge they changed my ticket to 1240 pm. same time was the flight time for my husband but as he was flying to prague and me to moscow we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. when i was boarding the plane there was no walkway but a bus and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. and the employee on the desk was extremely rude screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. on the plane the seats were not even with adjustable head. we had to wait for 45 minutes plus to 4h flight for some luggage to be loadedunloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. during this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered.     flew lufthansa from tucson to chennai  no delays. i got to my destination on time. however while travelling from houston to frankfurt the air hostess was very rude to me. an air hostess asked me to switched seats so that a family could sit together. because of this i had to take my bag to the upper deck. unfortunately there was no space available in the overhead bin and the air hostess gave me a hard time. i felt as though it was my fault for agreeing to help out. my return flight to tucson was even worse. due to a delay i missed my connection from frankfurt to houston. i had to wait in the customer support line for over 3 hours while they tried to figure out what to do. i was finally rebooked ua 59 on a flight that left 26 hours later than my scheduled flight to houston while i knew for a fact that there were seats available on flights that left to the united states from frankfurt. i was given 30 euros worth of meal vouchers. they didnt give the passengers without a transit visa a proper lounge to rest in. their exact words were we will give you some blankets and pillows. please sleep near the gates in terminal b. due to fatigue i failed to realize that i just had 1 hour at san francisco to clear my customs and catch a connecting flight to tucson. as expected i missed my connection but united rebooked me on a flight to tucson in less than 3 minutes.    berlin to munich. what a disappointment this 50 mins flight was. 10 minutes late may seem not much but it adds up. the service was really bad. food served without bread. service interrupted without getting a glass of water due to mild turbulence. one wonders what justifies the price paid for the ticket unless i have no other alternative i will not fly this airline again.    munich to cologne return in business class. the return fare was more than 700€ the service was mediocre at best. although there was plenty of time for the flight attendants to conduct the service on this 1 hour flight they did not ask the passengers whether they would like to have a second coffee or juice with breakfast. even worse was the experience with the return flight. my meetings in the cologne area finished early i hoped to be able to change my fight to an earlier one without any additional charge. however i got told that i would have to pay another 50€ although the business class on those earlier flights was half empty. this brought the fare to more than 750€ for a round trip with 65 minutes flying time.     the most inconvenient transfers ive had. booked flights from malaga to auckland via frankfurt and tokyo on lufthansa website. when buying online i did not notice that my stop in japan had an arrival and departure from two different airports in tokyo. no transfer information provided. had to change 26€ to japan currency and transfer my luggage in a 110hr bus trip. no reply from lufthansa to my 3 complaints. i would expect the airline is responsible for all the transfers between flights including my luggage.  in my opinion lufthansa has not given me what i thought i had bought.    toulouse to bangkok via frankfurt. all the flights went well.  my opinion concerns only the aftersales service and the followup of the complaints. i was forced to return promptly for personal reasons and i contacted the company for a change of date of return. my return was on march 7 2017. the customer service assigned me a file number by mail and im still waiting for their news i had to buy an emergency ticket on another company to go back to france. no customer followup from lufthansa is deplorable. i still have no news from them and ive been home for 15 days they are ticket sellers only.    munich to bilbao.my last flight experience with lufthansa was not really nice due to the way boarding was handled. i couldnt stow my belongings in any of the overhead locker. i went to the aft of the aircraft looking for space but no luck. i was told by the crew to find space myself. i was really disappointed by the lack of care of the crew.    i was very inconvenienced when they cancelled flights from oslo to berlin via frankfurt on which i was booked due to industrial action. i have also experienced several rescheduled flights which were an inconvenience but they were quite accommodating with rebooking me onto alternative convenient flights. it so happened that a trip to malta this year got one of those rescheduled flights. this time i did get rebooked onto alternative flights to my liking however i it was a nightmare... with several emails phone calls a visit to the airport in malta only to be told to call their call centre in south africa. to cut a long story short lufthansa keeps stooping lower even when you thought it had reached rock bottom. ive come to the conclusion that flying ryanair is probably better than flying with lufthansa maybe cheaper too.    i recently flew from manchester to atlanta via frankfurt and back with lufthansa. i was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. i was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly 1000 i would have to pay to choose my seat but i decided it would be worth paying 20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together 80 in total. the first issue i had was that the seats we were given on the flight from frankfurt to atlanta and the return leg were not the ones i had booked. we ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. on both flights 10 hours we were served vegetarian food because apparently lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. to make matters worse i was later offered a hot dog for lunch because they had run out of pizza. the hot dog was still completely frozen. i didnt make a fuss i thought that i would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. the flight itself was comfortable and smooth so i wasnt too unhappy until i spoke with lufthansa customer services. they told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that type of seat and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. so ultimately i have paid for a seat that i didnt get i had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the 80 back.\\r\\r\\n    flew the biggest bird in the sky the a380 from singapore to frankfurt. flight time 1213hr. food couldnt be any worse. mini portion tasteless portion. that first meal was aprox 90min after take off. for the next 8hrs nothing zero. ok lets kill some time with ife aka inflight entertainment. so slow awful menu movie selection is a joke. time for the toilet. but whats that queue oh thats just aprox 300 people sharing 4 toilets so you need to wait 1015min to get in. finally meal 2 or should i say desert some cake with a piece of bread and jam. i forgot the part about placing the ife remote control in the armrest simply brilliant. accidently pressed button around 25 times. never again.   flight from munich to new york jfk with lufthansa. about 4 hours delay due to a technical problem detected while the aircraft was taxiing. very poor information by the captain. finally deplaned by stairs in heavy rain and after waiting for the buses for about 45 minutes. change of aircraft and departure from another terminal at muc which has obliged us to pass again through passport control. nothing offered by the airline during all these hours. barely a cold apology. we didnt know then that the experience with lufthansa could even get much worse  our inbound flight from jfk to fra was cancelled the day of departure. it seems that lufthansa has become unreliable. very average service. distant and unfriendly crew. very uncomfortable economy seats. not very clean aircraft.    mexico city to munich. the business class seats are narrow and the resting space for the feets has an odd strange design very small. the food was good but unflexible the service was something between good a kind of inattentive. you have to pay for the internet. i will stick with my favourites and continue to avoid lufthansa whenever it is possible    hong kong to frankfurt. expecting professional and friendly crew but turned out that most of the cabin crew seems quite unwilling to serve passengers but only to finish their job. seats are quite narrow. food choices are attractive but unfortunately passenger at last 10 row of lower deck didnt have a choice when breakfast time and the crew say nothing about the no choice situation but just put down the meal. washroom are a bit dirty and is busy all the time. didnt live up to my expectation.    ive flown this round trip route between frankfurt and san jose twice and both times lufthansa has left my bag behind. its impossible to get items replaced or even check the status of your missing bag. inflight food was skimpy for me with no snacks or food besides crackers between meals. its convenient that they fly direct between san jose and germany but ill book someone different next time.   flight from seattle to frankfurt start afternoon in sea arrival early morning in fra so it was a night flight. unfortunately aircraft was a boeing thus seats much narrower than in an airbus. flight on time and very calm  usual very good lufthansa standard. however cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. beverages were only rarely offered collection of garbage even more rare. during the night cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. about 2 hours before landing i asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage i.e. three empty cups. she said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products which i know and she had other guests to care for. she would be back later. i asked when as i was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing and she said soon. i did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. had a flight with air canada from frankfurt to calgary three weeks earlier and they offered beverages much more often and they also collected garbage. it was my first time that i experienced rude lufthansa cabin staff but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during longdistance flights and they also collect garbage more frequently. breakfast only savoury omelette with roasted bacon and onions. i prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of german breakfast on a flight to germany with a german airline some bread butter jam maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. i am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers wishes but a choice between a northern american breakfast and a continental german breakfast would have been highly appreciated. why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner pasta or chicken i still recommend and choose lh for shortdistance flights within europe. first because of lufthansas safety standards second because i can cope with some kind of thirst during short flights.     flew frankfurt to singapore. arrived at frankfurt from oslo and we had about 50 minutes to walk about a kilometer to the other side of the terminal and passport control and check in. long line of people queing to board not by row numbers little delayed in leaving. sat down the back by the tail seat 93e. short of crew on this flight for some reason could clearly see the results as the service was slow and the crew function like robots no smile just doing the motions. food standard fare nothing special inflight entertainment was bad not much to choose from not a good selection and the touchscreen was slow to respond. i prefer the asian carriers as the service and crew are much more efficient and effective but this time i didnt have an alternative. next time i will try to avoid lufthansa just another average european carrier.    athens to vancouver via munich. despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from munich to vancouver our experience was frustrating flat out disappointing.\\xa0we could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online your name ticket number etc may be incorrect and your routing does not match your ticket.\\xa0error messages were different every time we tried so you didnt know what exactly was the reason. we were questioning whether he even had a ticket. called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 247. we had to wait. tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. had that message shown at online check in it would have avoided some undue stress and costly intl roaming charges for calls. original gate from athmun was rather close to our munyvr however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. on arrival the gate of the current flight had changed and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight.\\xa0boarding an a330 munyvr was a disaster. other than frequent flyersbusiness class boarding first it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. if youre a seasoned traveler you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most if not all used it.\\xa0safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go.\\xa0upon arrival into yvr we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in mun and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. they were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. total 40hrs. we wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from lufthansa.\\xa0it has been 7 days and still no response.\\xa0    frankfurt to rio de janeiro. i was badly impressed with the disorganization of the cabin crew.  they were really slow to serve breakfast and the process took like 23 hours. they were also very rude and answered sharply to our questions using imperatives and raised voices. i expected a highquality service from lufthansa but i was deeply disappointed.    oslo to malta via frankfurt. this company apparently has good schedules an okay product and okay service. the weak point is that i often experience changes in the flight times i fly this route several times a year and about 4 round trips a year on lufthansa. the airline expects you to be understanding and accommodating and doesnt give compensation when it causes its passengers inconveniences like changing the departure time of its flights or changing the aircraft type at the last hour and your booked and paid premium seat is no longer available. when you ask to be accommodated on another flight like a later flight after a schedule change lufthansa provides a bunch of excuses. their customer service call centres are a waste of time.     manchester to oslo via frankfurt. first of all our first flight is delayed but when we arrive at frankfurt airport we are told that we will be able to reach our connected flight with assistance from your employees. we were at the airport 12.30 from manchester our next flight got scheduled to 13.45  at 13.10 we were outside the gate with at least 20 other people and were refused entrance overbooked they were helpful at the service desk however to get to the hotel is terrible rooms are messy the food voucher we got is turned in to a buffet.  im stuck at the airport hotel with nothing to eat and i will not be able to go to work tomorrow. we already sent in a complaint but i expected more a flight carrier when things that no one of us have control over happens.    we flew on air dolomiti which i understand partners with lufthansa on october 20 2017. our flight lh 2301 was scheduled to leave amsterdam at 8.55 am but did not leave the airfield until 9.43 am. while we were waiting in the airport there was never an announcement as to why it was late. we had an international connecting flight to los angeles leaving at 11.20 am. we barely made it there and i was having a meltdown. as anyone who has ever been in munich airport will agree it is not the easiest to navigate though. the only time air dolomiti said anything was before they landed apologizing for the delay. once again no explanation. we are done with lufthansa.    london to dresden via frankfurt. first time with lufthansa short queue checking in at heathrow so good start but soon after entering the airport flight information was showing a 25 minute delay. eventually boarded plane and flight took off around 1 hour late problems with crew apparently. during the flight we were  told that they had no information about connecting flights and should check the flight boards in the airport. but as soon as we landed and i switched on my phone i had an email stating that i was booked on the later 2205 flight to dresden. facing a 4 hour wait at the airport i went to the very busy lufthansa service desk where i asked if i could use their airport lounge. as i was only an economy customer and not a lufthansa member the answer was no. i was given a 10 euro voucher and a copy of my rights as a passenger.    newarkliberty intl to munich lh0413 18 sept 2017. i did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from lufthansa but their service was appalling. the flight was delayed due to late arrival of the plane. quite worn out plane not much of a welcome on board dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. i do not mind not smiling fas if the level of service is high. on this flight i learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class definitely not expected from 4star airline. frugal menu had one appetizer salad with no other choices. i chose fish for the main course which was greasy overly salty and poorly presented. everything came on the same tray. during the meal no drink refills were offered i had regular coke so i had to ask for a favor. after i asked for the tray to be taken away fa took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. i expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. so again i had to ask for one. not happy with my request fa asked what i wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. after such feast i tried to sleep but the seat was though full flat bumpy and extremely narrow even for me i am a slim person. so the only comfortable position was lying on my side. finally i was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where fas were loudly talking without lowering their voices. about 1 hour before landing i asked for breakfast. it was not served right away so the seatbelt sign came on. fa told me that now the breakfast could not be served. no single positive emotion during the whole flight. extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about lufthansa. my flight back with united polaris business class was a pleasant surprise – frankly i expected the opposite for these two carriers. lesson learned lufthansas business is an awkward decoration of a comfort class with a flatbed though very uncomfortable. given the price for the ticket almost 9 thousand us  i will choose lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative.    dresden to frankfurt. flight was delayed. the seat and the table was dirty. dinner did not look appetizing. no entertainment programm. flight attendant was not that friendly. there is no value to economic class except the expensive price from business class    montreal to munich. not impressed i flew premium economy. the leg space is ok. the seat is extremely uncomfortable. i have tried the premium economy of air canada ba air france air new zealand corsair and this one is the worst. food was terrible. service i dont remember. movie choices not terrible. i dont think i will fly lh again.     bangkok to frankfurt delayed by 3 hours no proactive communication. just an information received last minute with wrong information about boarding time. boarding was a mess. finally i got into the plane and the entertainment system did not work. not good this time.    frankfurt to buenos aires. nothing to say about the punctuality. poor service onboard i asked the hostess fór á glass of water and she told me to go on my seat. poor space for my legs and no  slippers in economy class. onfly service sometimes did not work.    frankfurt to buenos aires. flying lufthansa for the first time on a long haul flight star alliance gold in economy. the flight was 10 hours late due to a strike that wasnt lhs fault  they provided us with a hotel near the airport but the logistics of getting to and from the hotel was a  mess and we just made it in time for our flight the next morning. onboard the crew did the minimum and were not friendly. the meal awful toilet was not clean when i used it. my ife took time to load and freezes frequently. i will avoid flying this airline in the future  it was very poor and unfriendly in economy.    munich to delhi. i discovered  they are cutting edges and providing very low quality services. i tend to travel with star alliance companies due to mile accrual however on several flights i noticed that despite paying a full price ticket i was not entitled to any miles at all. in addition on a flight from munich to delhi the inflight service was terrible. the flight attendants were arguing between them and delaying the serving of the food. in the lounge when asking about a flight connection the staff almost seemed annoyed that i dared to ask them. the leg space on the plane was small.    sydney to changsha. a very disappointing flight. the aircraft did not have seatback ife instead they provided small tablets for movie watching. the quality was very poor with a limited movie selection. the seats were worn with almost no padding let in them. the flight attendants were in a rush to serve lunch and then close the blinds so that they could do their disappearing act. ground service and check in was very slow at sydney airport. i was unable to have my frequent flyer number added to my record as the agents were not familiar on the process. the toilets were in pretty bad shape about half way through the flight. the food was soso. the selection was noodles or rice with chicken or beef it looked like slop. drink service was limited.  flight attendants rarely smiled.     bangkok to toronto return via beijing outward in july and returning august 2017 and i would not recommend  them. i had delays on both outbound and inbound journeys which totaled 52 hours in delays which i believe is unacceptable. while i got a good price the information was very poor. when i checked into bangkok airport i was notified of a 3 hour delay. this turned into a 6 hour delay and eventually an 8 hour delay we were initially suppose to leave at 140am and took off at 10am. as there we no hainan airlines ground staff at the airport until 6am i had to call china to get updates. when ground staff turned up at the gate at 6am they gave us a small snack box as compensation. at beijing airport we were told we had missed our connection and told to go and collect our luggage with little guidance from the ground staff. we asked hainan to be put us on another airline but we told that was not possible and we would have to wait 24 hours until our next flight we missed our connection by 30 minutes and they didnt hold the flight. i  asked if i could push my return trip back by one day but i was told that this was not possible. the beijing airport hotel we were put up in was in poor condition my hotel room has a wall covered in mold and the food at the hotel was inedible. on returning to beijing airport we found out that we had another 3 hour delay to our flight. no compensation was provided for this delay. when we did finally board the aircraft we waited on the tarmac for an additional 2 hours supposedly for weather delays.  when i arrived at toronto  airport i was told there would be a 1 hour delay which turned into a 2 hour delay.  arriving into beijing i was told that i had missed my connecting flight and i would need to wait another 24 hours for the next flight. i complained about the previous hotel and was put into a slightly better hotel than the outward journey but still smelled of cigarette smoke despite being in a nonsmoking room with an ashtray despite all of the delays i received very little compensation. i have never received such poor communication and customer service.     shanghai to boston via beijing. long check in line at shanghai pvg very small presence. usual departure mayhem not airline specific. flight was uneventful and unremarkable could have been domestic aa dl or ual. transfer at beijing was a pain. had to pick up checked bag and drag it to next terminal to recheck and go back through lines again gate departure from beijing was weird. no announcement no boarding by rows or zones just very distant gate. they did not even change the display to show boarding etc. no english spoken. crammed bus transfer then up outdoor stairs to boeing 787. cabin was clean seats okay with nice high backs. pet was awful western content was odd. inflight service was rushed and robotic. cold like much customer service in prc. beverage service was skimpy 13 plastic glass of wine food nondescript asian. very basic experience all around. overall not any where near experience on other 5 star carriers.     beijing to seattle. english speaking skills very poor. boarding with too much checking keeping people in a long line outside the plane before going up the stairs taken to the plane by bus and then checking again when entering the plane. though i could hear the movies loud enough on a low volume  crew messages were very quiet and could not be heard properly. they could not understand the order had to show on the menu. asked for tomato juice 2 times and the guy gave me orange first and then tomato juice.  my seat was coming back up straight by itself after reclining couldnt be fixed and the plane was full. automatic chinese subtitles for the movies. the wifi  internet was not available during flight.  after landing early we stayed on taxiway for more than 10 minutes with no info on why were not going to the gate. the leg room was not amazing. the amenity kit was quite nice socks toothbrush and toothpaste eyeshades earplugs and earphones. food was good and plenty beverage options were nice and of good quality.  flew in late dec 2013 and early jan 2014 in business class from chicago to beijing to bangkok and then back. the new dreamliner was a nice comfortable flight. some of the flight attendants dont speak english well and one of the flight attendants on the flight from chicago to beijing was obviously very new and was struggling  but tried nonetheless. at checkin there always seems to be confusion about what the transfer process is in beijing. one of the real pains is that they will not issue you both tickets when you check in. if your transfer time is more than 4 hours be prepared to sit in the airport until they open the checkin counter. note the airport in beijing terminal 2 in this case is not set up for international transfers. you will have to go through immigration and customs so do fill out both the arrival and departure forms despite any advice to the contrary which we received from flight attendants. the immigration process is not straightforward and we were shuffled from line to line despite being in the correct line to begin with. after making it through security again confusing and not straight forward dont get your hopes up on the lounge  its a run down lounge with poor amenities  big disappointment after seeing the lounge in terminal 1 advertised for domestic flights. in all flying internationally with hainan is not an all positive experience but of the airline listens to its customers and resolve these issues to bring it up to he standards and ease of flying as with most world airlines there is potential here. xian to shenzen. checkin quick. done with mediocre english but enough to get it done. only foreigner on board. staff efficient at best. food was pretty bad in general an ok flight to get from ab but that is about it. beijing to toronto hu 7975 july 17 2013. very uncomfortable seat too small. when the person in front reclined her seat it crushed my knees. the inflight entertainment at my seat did not work on either flight of a round trip. the screens of several people around me did not work either. march 14 hu 7982 taipei to guangzhou  737800. old dated plane with uncomfortable seating and a very pungent bathroom. no electronic equipment allowed on entire flight  flight attendant will go out of their way to make sure your electronic equipment is switched off. will avoid this airline from now on. food was good though. iah to ord to pek. i flew american airlines through a codeshare flight and transferred at ohare onto hainan airlines economy. the new dreamliner plane seemed pretty nice and the seats were comfortable their mango juice and coconut juice is delicious. two hours into the flight i was asked by one of the flight attendants to turn off my phone which was in airplane mode. i told the flight attendant who spoke very limited english that its in airplane mode but he insisted that i must turn it off. aside from the crews and pilots lack of english skills the food is just subpar and the sides they give you are barely edible. the inflight entertainment system kept restarting every 10 minutes. flight 489 pektxl. bland food the drinks were served an hour after they served the meal my entertainment system didnt work and they couldnt even supply me with any magazines. very disappointing.    this flight from prague to beijing was operated by a dated boeing 767300 aircraft. old seats in economy with very limited recline. the entertainment system that was out of order. onboard magazines only in chinese. the use of mobile devices in airplane mode is prohibited by chinese government regulations. both meals consisted of rice with meat brown sauce and frozen vegetables and rather bland and greasy. no drinks offered outside meal times. only water and crackers available from the galley. crew did not seem interested in providing good service and disappeared between meals. lavatories were not very clean. during the entire flight a cold draft was coming from one of the emergency exit doors just in front of seat 47a. boarding was at a remote stand as beijing terminal 2 only has a small number of jetways. about 10 minutes on a very crowded bus with airport staff shouting at passengers  mainly chinese tour groups. departure about an hour late arrival 35 minutes late. flight 7907 xiycdg. 12 hour flight with no entertainment system for anyone in economy class. very bad service as crew hardly understand english and toilets were very dirty. there was no toilet paper for the last hours of flight. horrible experience.    calgary to bangkok return via beijing and all in all it was a decent airline. the check in from calgary was easy with no complications. the boeing 787 was clean and everything appeared in good condition. the seats were comfortable and had adequate leg room im 188 cm or 62. the entertainment system had a few new movies and a decent amount of older content. the food on the flight was pretty good but the beer was awful.the flight attendants spoke a minimum amount of english. you would think theyd put staff onboard who could. the boeing 737 flight back from bangkok to beijing departed at 0130. shortly after take off they served us our meal again it was decent food. then we reclined and hoped to get some sleep on this red eye flight. nope that was not in store for us. the tv screens kept dropping down blasting us with light and audio over the pa system. the flight attendants kept making announcements and turning on the main cabin light. on a red eye no one wants anything but sleep please let us sleep. so all in all it was a decent four flights but not spectacular. i was not greeted when i got onboard with a hello or thankyou or goodbye when i left. will i fly with hainan again yes if they are a cheaper or have good connections.     hong kong to brussels via beijing on 29 june.  i was travelling with my wife and 2 daughters aged 3 and 5. first for some reason i wasnt able to checkin online as a result we had to queue up quite a long time to checkin. the first part of the flight hong kong to beijing was operated by hong kong airlines which belong to the same group. the first flight despite being over 2 hours delayed was fairly pleasant the cabin crew was nice food was ok inflight entertainment wasnt that great but for a 3 hour flight it was more than enough. landing in beijing at the time of departure of the second flight i requested assistance to the cabin crew for the connection. at our arrival at the gate a woman was waiting for us and took us to the gate to board the second flight. she was actually running and didnt look behind to see if everybody was following. a fellow passenger was pretty annoyed by that but for me it wasnt a big deal. the problems started to come up at the security. ground staff were very rude and checked the kids roughly with no smile which scared them a bit. arriving at the gate we handed over our boarding passes but we were told the seats had been changed. they gave us 4 different seats at 4 different places of the aircraft. when complaining about this issue we were told to get on the bus and check with the cabin crew. boarding the plane i immediately told the crew the problem. they told me please take your seats we will check once everybody had boarded. really you expect a 3 and a 5 year old to sit alone in the middle of stangers. i refused and had to discuss with other passengers myself to get seats together. the service onboard was a disaster. first i ask for a baileys the fa told me i give you our cocktail which is made with baileys and coconut milk ok no i would like a baileys. she was unhappy because she had to go back to get the bottle. when she came with the meals i asked for the child meals. she told me very rudely theres no child meal if you dont order them in advance which i did when booking the flight. a few hours later i asked for a beer no more beers after first service. when serving the breakfast i asked for hot chocolate for the kids we dont serve hot chocolate anymore seriously  again unhappily she went back to make the hot chocolate. when we arrived in brussels our luggage didnt follow as it could have been expected we got them the next day though.    seattle to xian via shangai. my connection from shangai to xian was cancelled due to severe weather and the stewards did not provide any information until the flight was cancelled. they pretended to not understand english. once the flight was cancelled they brought us to probably the dirtiest inn in shangai. they did not provide any information on what to do the day after. no information on what would be the next available flight. after trying to call the customer center several times no answer to the phone we tried to reschedule. no way. they pretended to not speak english and they treated us very impolitely.     guangzhou to manchester via beijing. i went through security 3 times due to lack of communication. in beijing i waited 2.5 hours for the bus to take me to a hotel as i had missed my connection and was getting my next flight 24 hours later. the room and  the hotel was extremely dirty. hainan airlines have no complaints procedure i could find.    worst experience in my life ga423 flight from denpasar to jakarta was canceled. flight should be scheduled on 19.00pm but delayed until 2015 delayed again to 2240 and finally one of the staff from garuda informed us that the flight was canceled. they forced us to take airasia without compensation. no heavy meal and compensation given.    jakarta to amsterdam in september. before takeoff a passenger had his seat reclined and fully extended forward. only at the very last few minutes before takeoff did the flight attendant ask this passenger to adjust his seat back to upright position. he only slightly adjusted the seat. seat space and adjustment were not as comfy as in cathay or sq. the seat could only extend a certain distance forward or back before the seat back had to move to adjust. the food was substandard. my fave champagne billecartsalmon brut rose that used to be served was downgraded to a fairly ordinary brand. the entertainment was pathetic for me. i pressed the call button and no one came. so i turned off the notification light. i pressed the call button again. still no one came and i finally had to flag down a flight attendant who walked past.   had the misfortune of flying garuda from yogyakarta to jakarta last night. i had taken particular care booking a vegetarian meal for the flight. however the same was not available on the flight. the flight attendent on ga 215 was completely inconsiderate and even said i could have the nonvegetarian meal instead. this complete lack of understanding is not what i expected from an airline that claims to be awarded for its service last year i had flown garuda from surabaya to jakarta and i faced the same issue. being a frequent traveller myself vegetarian food is a basic option that all airlines across the world have. hopefully this is the last time i fly with garuda   jakarta to london. served a meal with a label for date of preparation or expiry for the day before. when i asked for a replacement i was told there was no other food available. staff could not understand why i was annoyed and could not deviate from their standard  script.  other meals i had were very standard. inflight entertainment was limited compared to some airlines. i wont be flying with them again.    the flight had just 3 passengers in business class – my two sons and me. the flight attendants were friendly but service was not great as they tended to spend a lot of time in the galley. with such a small number of passengers they should have been more visible in the cabin & i should not have had to use the call button. food had no choice of starter three choices of main courses and one dessert – no cheese course. perhaps the meal service was more premium economy than business class.     surabaya to denpasar. being a garuda platinumskyteam elite plus member provides little benefit. the front row of seat is available for platinum members if the seat is available however it seems that many of these seats are under airport control. on this flight i queried the checkin agent at my originating airport & she said the flight was full. on arrival at surabaya i stopped by the checkin desk and was again told that the flight was full. imagine my disappointment to note that the flight was not full and that first row of economy had at least 3 seats empty.  waiting to fly from denpasar to melbourne travelling business class. temporary lounge at airport. not enough seats for passengers. no toilets and had to queue at ladies toilets where there were only 5 toilets for thousands of passengers all leaving around the same time of night. toilets were dirty no toilet paper no hand towels with overflowing bins. not impressed at all and not sure any of the staff understood english. ga 571 july 30 2014. i flew from bpncgk and it was two hour flight. i was going straight from jakarta to hamburg with emirates. the service that i am not happy with is their baggage allowance and seat comfort. the allowance that i got was 20k while my emirates flight i got 30k. garuda indonesia is supposed to be the flight that people use who are going on a connecting flight to abroad through jakarta. if they give us only 20k i dont see any difference of garuda indonesia and other lowcost domestic flight e.g. lion air. the seat was hard and you cannot sleep throughout the flight unless you want your tailbone to hurt for the nest several days. flew business class melbourne to denpasar and returned 2 weeks later flights ga719 and ga718. was accompanied by my wife we are in our sixties adult daughter and her 2 year old son. flight out was good  ground staff flight crew food entertainment were excellent. flight back was the exact opposite  1 spent too long waiting for a delayed flight in the very poor garuda business lounge in denpasar airport. massively overcrowded and poor facilities. 2 gate was changed without notice from one close to where we were to gate 9 at the other end of the airport. wasnt even announced in the bus lounge. 3 after significant hassle with a pram and a 2 year old we eventually reached the gate to find boarding had commenced again no announcement. 4 at the business lane gave the attendant our documentation. he did process that quickly but immediately let other passengers through both business and economy. we were trying to get the stroller checked into the hold pacify a crying toddler at 11.30 at night and get our hand luggage together. people were allowed to almost trample us has to very loudly object in order to get some understanding and a bit of consideration. 5 flight staff were poor did not circulate for drinks meals were poor. 6 on the overnight flight despite valiant attempts none of us managed to get the seat into a comfortable sleeping position. never again. ga716. my wife was due to fly jakartamel on a sunday in mid october. she was advised that her flight was changed to go via denpasar. we are not complaining about the terrible delays nor the lack of english announcements. what we are complaining about is the totally disgusting state of the toilets onboard before we left jakarta. whilst it was economy class there is no reason that the facilities cannot be clean. we arrived to bali from ireland without any problems and we were excited for our final flight to brisbane. a half an hour before we were to board our 11.15 flight we were informed that it was cancelled and we would not be flying until 7 am. told it was due to bad weather. some passengers were offered a hotel however passengers in transit had to stay in the lounge. at 5.30 the next morning we made our way to our gate where we waited until 7.30 before being informed that our flight was again cancelled. again transit passengers had to remain in the airport while other passengers were brought to a hotel. during this time we were asked for our passports so that they could be stamped but when they were returned we were informed that we werent allowed to leave the airport. eventually we were told we could go to a hotel to freshen up and we would be brought back to the airport at 5 o clock that evening. 5 came and we were informed that we were delayed an hour and would be picked up at 6. once we arrived at the airport we were soon told that our flight was again cancelled and we were given lots of different excuses. some people decided to board other flights to brisbane via melbourne and sydney. we returned to the hotel in the hope of getting on a flight the next morning but as we expected it was cancelled again. at long last we eventually got a new boarding pass and awaited our flight. all passengers waiting for the flight were very unsatisfied with the service and the treatment we received some of us were delayed 52 hours and we did not even receive one simple apology. when i set out to book our family holiday to australia garuda come up as the quickest most direct route. they were also very competitive on their pricing and having read some reviews i thought we had a great deal. anyway i bought 4 tickets flying from gatwick airport via jakarta to sydney with an initial stopover time in jakarta of 1 and a half hours meaning our total flight time was going to be around 22 hours. below are the bullet points of what happened since the time we booked our flight these are the ones i can add. i will definitely not be using garuda again. flight time changed 6 times. actual outbound flight became gatwick to amsterdam had to get off the plane and sit in gate for 1 and a half hours amsterdam to jakarta now a 10 hour stop over jakarta to sydney. total flight time increased by 10 hours. inbound flight took the same form. sydney to jakarta jakarta to amsterdam amsterdam to uk. 10 hour stopover in jakarta and another hour and a half in amsterdam. so added over 10 hours to the journey. total time lost for both flights  20 hours. most airlines let you check in 24 hours before –garuda is 12 hours. our flight was at 1.10pm on the saturday so we had to check in at 1.10am set the alarm. logged in and they basically gave only 18 seats to choose from out of 150 seats. what is the point we ended up having to keep the seats they already had allocated to us as there werent 4 other seats together so it was a complete waste of time getting up and checking in. on talking to others at the airport they couldnt even login at all the return leg was better from a flight perspective as we knew what we were in for however we could not even check in online this time. there was no online check in facility available although they didnt say this on the website. we stayed up until 11.30pm to be told we couldnt check in online but had to do this at the airport. got to the airport 3 hours before the flight and still had to wait over an hour in a check in line. back to the dark ages of how travel used to be to sum it up completely messed around with our booking poor check in and website no garuda officials to be found anywhere in jakarta. serious lack of communication around the initial stopover and absolutely nothing regarding non delivery of cases. a month before our flight ga713 syd to denpasar was diverted to jakarta instead of denpasar without reason there was no connecting flight to denpasar that day so we were told wed have to find accommodation in jakarta at our own expense until the morning flight. garuda did offer an alternative theyd pay to put us on a domestic\\r\\r\\nflight to melbourne to connect with ga719 so we took it. the flight was disgraceful the cabin temp was hot and stuffy and even after multiple complaints by passengers the cabin crew did nothing about it. service was slow waiting over 30 minutes for someone to come was appalling some passenger call lights were on the entire journey\\r\\r\\nwithout ever being acknowledged. when the lunch service arrived the food was cold the so called cold beverages were at room temperature. they ran out of ice 2 hours into the flight. the return flight ga714 was an overnighter we were kept at the gate for 20 minutes with no explanation. being an overnighter most people wanted to sleep for whatever reason they left the cabin lights on. for reasons beyond any comprehension they had a drinks service at 1am when most passengers were sleeping. sindpssin. flight was ontime food was nice flight attendants friendly. the only downside of it was the aircon  not working properly while waiting for takeoff. passengers were left sweating for almost 20 mins. flight back to sin was delayed for almost 30 mins then once onboard there were problems with the electrical system. we were waiting almost 20 mins until being told to leave the aircraft because they needed to change the plane. there seemed to be a problem with coordination with the ground team. we were told to wait  after 20 mins  asked to queue for the meal  only to be told to move back to the gate to board the plane after 10 mins. knowing that the problem still persisted  they finally gave in to change the plane  why waste our time then one last thing the inflight entertainment was not good  there were few new movies  but other that old and movies i had never heard before. the touch screen navigation was clunky and my console restarted repeatedly while playing the movies  forcing me to watch the ads again and fast forwarding to the last point. regardless all the issues i feel garuda has done a very good job in transforming from where it was 510 years ago however definitely there are plenty more rooms to improve. perdps return. as per previous reviews  your garuda experience depends on where you get on the plane. we were once again delivered a mediocre checkin at perth international on the early afternoon flight on the 27th of december. they are more interested in checking in economy passengers at the business class check in. when someone at economy checkin waved us over it resulted in a long very delayed checkin because the clerk had to keep walking over to the business class checkin for lounge passes etc. the qantas lounge ran out of food when we got there and when i brought that to the receptionists attention i was informed that there would be more food in 5 minutes. the 5 minutes turned out to be an hour. normal chaotic boarding followed  no priority boarding for business class. service on board was good except the cabin staff allowed economy class passengers to use the business class toilet and did not even try to prevent it. back to perth on 3 january early morning flight. they forgot to load the menus and we had to ask them for drinks during the flight  it was not offered on their own accord. garuda is starting to drop the ball and as their prices are not very competitive anymore i think that i would start looking at other airlines premium class offering to bali. garudas inconsistent service offering in their premium class on this route is just not worth the money anymore. jakarta  singapore 29 june 2013. meal was horrible earphones were not working on one side volume was hardly audible. service crew were simply lifeless and lack of warmth. not even a budget airline like airasia provided such disappointing experience. cgkbkk on 119 and bkkcgk 149 on a 737800. decided to try out the national carrier. to bangkok  delayed. booked seat but the attendant said it had already been released or not booked. dont understand. on the way back delayed again. was given a middle seat while again had booked a front row aisle seat. toilet queue was long and waitress asked us to queue in two rows for the toilet with the national carrier you get to carry your cabin luggage down the stairs brave the drizzle stand on the bus to your terminal before you realize that its all stairs up to the immigration area. i cant believe this. this was my last flight with them. i paid full fares for my tickets and was wait listed for executive class. very disappointed. ga 412 november 11 was scheduled to depart jakarta at 1700. around 1655 there was an announcement at the gate f2 that due to operational reasons the flight would depart from f7. a little after 1700 we were bused to the aircraft & the door eventually closed at 1742. 42 minutes after the scheduled departure time. neither at the gate nor onboard was there an announcement telling us why the flight was late. is around 1800 the pilot advised that we would not depart until around 1900 2 hours after the scheduled departure time due to airport traffic. if garuda had been able to board the aircraft and close the doors ontime we may not have had to wait 2 hours why is garuda incapable of keeping passengers informed ga0324 on 22nd dec 2013 cgksub flight was delayed for 2 hours due to traffic. no refreshment at least water served inside the terminal. we even stayed inside the aircraft for more than 30 minutes before departing. a woman carried her crying baby was still walking around trying to calm the baby down while the aircraft was moving and seatbelt sign was already on. ca didnt warn her to sit down. the entertainment didnt work. ga0323 on 3rd jan 2014 also delayed approx. 1.5 hours. isnt it probably better to rearrange the schedule and fly on time fortunately i had 6 hours before flying to doha. ga89 amsauhcgk no online checkin possible in netherlands resulting in bad seats. when drinks were served we asked for a red wine which was not possible they said only served with meals. ife missing flight info channel. overall performance mediocre to bad. ga88 cgkauhams 65 mins delay  arriving at auh we were told to stay in aircraft during cleanup and refuelling sat for 90 mins in parked aircraft while there was time enough to get out and stretch legs. same wine problem as in ga89 but wine was served during breakfast. never again. ga319 subcgk 27 jan 2014. with the service and facility that they have i think the price is quite high. the service is no good and not friendly at all. entertainment facility is very limited and due to the sound i couldnt really hear clearly. the food is awful i ordered a special meal and when i got the meal it was already spoiled. ga 0416ga 0720 on 14th feb ga 0721ga 0439 on 1st march destination cgkdpsbne return. i traveled with my 2 sons parked the stroller before we entered the flight but when we transited in bali the flight attendants said i needed to get the stroller at baggage claim. carrying one boy in one hand with a cabin bag and another boy was not easy i was informed by checkin staff that we would be served a kids meal but later on flight attendants said they didnt have any. no toys or enough inflight entertainment available for kids either. although i am a gold frequent flyer and flying all the time with garuda for business purposes i will not recommend it for those travelling with kids. i was flying ga 236 may 31 and ga 247 jun 1 cgksrg vv. well after many pleasant flight with garuda this time i am very much disappointed. both flights were not on time the first was 40 minutes delayed but the return stint was delayed for 3 hours without any proper announcements. i understand that this can happen but it should be handled properly. denpasar to jakarta with garuda indonesia. tried to checkin online the night before but since we have an infant with us i cant do it online. called the customer service to try to reserved seats for us they told me that for passengers with infant cant check in online because theyve allocated seats automatically by system so i thought this is great. and today when we try to checkin at the airport they put us on the back of the plane. i requested a better seats because the customer service told me that infant seats are reserved automatically but in the end theres no such thing. cant believe they lie to us. another dissapoinment when its time to board the plane usually a 5 star airline will prioritize passengers with infant but not this time. when i complain they said that they cant see us even though i was sitting not far from them. with such lousy service they are clearly overpriced.    i was flying from london to jakarta with my daughter for my wedding. when i tried to check in 48 hours beforehand it wouldnt allow me to. i repeated this process many times until it finally allowed me to check in just 24 hours before the flight. the only two seats left with them were 38j and 38k. i contacted garuda customer services by phone and they said theres nothing we can do or maybe you did something wrong. they suggested that i get to the airport early and at the check in desk ask for a seat reassignment. i arrived at terminal 3 heathrow early only to be met with chaos and mayhem. after a long wait i was told that there are no other seats to be moved to. we checked our suitcases in and was told to carry our own suitcases back out the door to a cordoned off area where they were holding the luggage. everything was fine until literally 5 minutes from boarding the plane when an announcement was made that no suitcases will be on the flight except business and first class. i spoke to the garuda lady and told her that my wedding was in 2 days time and she understood my situation and wold make my cases a priority. next ensued a 13 hour flight with no sleep because of the awful seats. when we got to jakarta we completed a missing baggage claim form and yet again i told them wedding in 2 days please mark very urgent. they did mark as urgent but this made no difference. despite numerous phone calls to the garuda i wasnt reunited with my luggage until the 5th day of my trip. when i did manage to speak to them they were totally unhelpful.   flew with garuda from singapore to bali twice and i was happy with their service. third time was not. choice of food ran out before reaching our turn. no beer served. the seat was cramped. the food served was terrible and my kids could not finish despite being hungry. slow in serving food. only one flight attendant serving food in our section and she was slow. normally they work in a pair. mobile app for online checkin was disappointing. cannot select seat cannot make meal request. when i called local airline office i was told my ticket is limited and not allowed to make requests. this was not make known to me when i booked. overall it was a lousy experience and thats the last time i fly with garuda.    flew haneda tokyo to jakarta. i often fly garuda i notice the lack of consistency in the service quality. in this flight id say i experienced one of the worst. prior to takeoff the male fa closed the overhead compartment leaving part of amenity plastic bag dangling despite a few rounds of takeoff preparation checking by fas nobody noticed it that i had to warn him as it may increase the chance the compartment will open during takeoff. from his response id say he did not seem to understand the importance of the issue in view of safety. he also lacked basic skills in service when serving food it seemed like he was doing it for the first time and was very clumsy eg giving me a cup of tea with sugar but no stirrer.    jakarta to surabaya. never had a problem with garuda before but since i just had a baby i found out that garuda is not very baby friendly. one thing thats really inconvenient is they cant bring your stroller after you landed. you need to take it on the baggage claim. ground crew say you can turned out the stewardess dont know anything about the common practice of delivering a stroller.   melbourne to jakarta saturday 9th december 2017. appalling flight from an airline that has worked hard to change its image over the years. after a mix up with the gates we trudged to our plane and were then bundled in and off we went. the staff seemed distracted from the moment we got on and the usual feeling of welcome was missing. i fly garuda because it is not a budget airline this flight was advertised as having a meal i did not eat at some of the new restaurants in terminal 3 at jakarta airport as i thought we would be eating on board. what we were offered on board was a packet of nuts or a strange wrapped chicken thing. the drinks trolley was practically empty and my travelling companion could not get a vodka and tomato juice. the plane did not appear as though it had been refilled. disappointing as the food and drinks are usually good on garuda flights. trying to get staff attention during the flight was impossible what was going on secret air cabin staff business    yogyakarta to jakarta. the flight was delayed and we took off 2.5 hours late. i asked the check in and they said it would be about 15 minutes. after boarding we waited another 30 minutes before pushback doors closed. no apology that we were late. missed flight to istanbul now in fm7 hotel for two nights and €2200 for new tickets to toulouse.     bangkok to jakarta. i have been on ga most of the times for many years but this is the worst. notified to be 60 min delayed and finally it was 90 mins late. onboard ran out of blanket even before take off. poor food and no words of apologies. arrived at a bus gate and makes it even more late.    london to bangkok. good flight despite a few little problems seat and inflight entertainment good food very nice and plenty of choices. i find this aircraft a380 not as good to travel on the crew have too many people to look after so the service is disjointed and sometimes very poor. not helped by some passengers requiring attention every 510 minutes   do not use this airline for connecting flights flight delayed by 55 minutes meaning that i had 15 minutes to transfer stopover time was 1hr 10 mins. staff provided false reassurance that everything would be okay and not to worry as next flight to seoul would be in an hour or two. i had to catch this specific flight so i ran as hard as i could and managed to transfer within 15 mins. the plane shut the door as soon as i got on board and departed. upon arrival my baggage was left behind in bangkok. next flight was ~9 hours time. the staff in bangkok provided false information. if i had missed this flight i would have had to spend the night in bangkok. bag was suppose to arrive at the place i was residing at 900pm 14 hours after arriving in seoul. bag did not arrive until 1230am the next morning. i made a complaint on the day and still have not heard back 2 weeks after the incident.    our flight from sapporo to bangkok on 1st april was late into bangkok. we had a 55 min connection to catch tg409 to singapore. i was flying with wife and 2 young kids. after we took off we asked about our connection in bangkok and were reassured by crew the flight would be held as there were several passengers that needed to catch the connection. we landed 4.10pm our connection was due to leave 4.25pm. there were no ground staff holding signs about our connecting flight and after 15 mins running through the airport with young family we arrive at departure gate to find it had departed. we were told no compensation was due as flight tg671 was delayed by fog on take off. it was a sunny morning in sapporo when we took off  not a hint of fog. after 3 hrs we caught a later flight back to singapore that was 40 mins late into singapore. thai airways have a lack of organisation and information at bangkok terminal.     thai airways from bangkok to paris return. flight was on time and boarding was done quite fast. the cabin staff on the way to paris were fine food was poor quality seat was fine and enough space for my legs. on the way back to bangkok staff were not as nice and food was worse. where was the famous thai smile the only good thing about this flight is because its direct. the cost of ticket is expensive compared with other airlines.     im a star alliance gold member taking first class from paris to bangkok in apr 2016 with my 4 year old son. the onboard experience was not what we were expecting. there was a lack of foods and drinks and it was difficult to get crew attentions  most of the requests were forgotten. our prior foods request were abandoned  front areas access limitation front fc toilet walkway and lounge requested for all other 15 first class passengers with only one back toilet.  we had 2nd meal during the flight as its dinner time in paris my boy got a plate of omelette and i got a bowl of noodle.  i was having a bad choice to select thai airways.  i had booked and paid tickets on thai airways to fly from bangkok to chiang mai and the reservation did show the tg letters in front of the flight number. being a star alliance gold card when i checked in at the business counter i was refused the 20kg additional luggage allowance we are entitled to. and also told the flight would not give mileage. explanation this is a thai smiles filght the supposedly low cost airline subsidiary of thai. this is totally dishonest as this subsidiary of tg has as two letter code we. i have flown on many low cost subsidiaries of major airlines but all are coded under different 2 letters. so warning to my fellow passengers.    milan to brisbane via bangkok. first leg on old boeing 747 in upper deck a lot of space quite and good storage room the bathroom small but always clean. food was preordered and was very disappointing half cold overcooked and pretty bad presentation. the crew was not efficient not friendly but rather arrogant  not the famous thai smile. the seats were old not comfortable and no flat bed. entertainment was pretty basic not business class standard in 2016. second leg from bangkok to brisbane in new boeing 787. very disappointing seating for a new aircraft with a 222 configuration in a row so no free aisle access from the window. the seat was more comfortable then the old boeing 747 and provided a flat bed. food and service as on the first leg was very disappointing.   bangkok to seoul. i have flown thai airways numerous times over the last 4 years. they have had nothing but my respect for the quality of service provided friendliness and excellent flying experience. on this past trip i flew with them from bangkok to chiang mai and then chiang mai to bangkok and on to seoul. on august 26 the flight was delayed leaving chiang mai by 10 minutes. the connection time in bangkok was only scheduled to be 1 hour which made the connection tight and tighter with the delay. upon arriving in bangkok there was a line up for transit security however it moved along fairly well. because of the delay i boarded with everyone else and that was no a problem for me. as i was seated one of the flight attendants was clearly not amused or friendly that i had not been seated before. that thai friendliness and welcome was not there. a few minutes later as we were taxing for take off the youngest of the flight attendants in business aggressively and rudely barged in to the space in front of my seat and grabbed pillows and rudely announced that they were going in the overhead bin. i have never experienced such rudeness from one of the thai flight attendants before. this same flight attendant repeated her performance prior to landing in seoul. i coupled that with the lack of welcome and friendliness upon being seated and it was not the greatest of experiences with thai this time on that flight. if they were not pleased with the tight connection and my inability to be earlier to my seat then they should take that up with their airline and not blame me. as for the other flight attendant with the rudeness she needs to be more familiar with appropriate etiquette. the quality of food cleanliness of the aircraft were of the same very high quality that i have come to know and appreciate with thai. hopefully those 2 flight attendants will not be on my next flight. i can only give a 6 on this rating because of those two persons.    bangkok to london. this was the poorest flight from thai airways i have experienced. it was in marked contrast to the dozens i have taken over the past 30 years. the flight was 7 hours late and we were put up in the bkk transit hotel this was fine although the hotel is pretty humble. the lounge prior to boarding in the a concourse was looking scuffed and it was crowded food was not great but coffee and fruit were fine. delays at the gate as well but so far was still in reasonable spirits. the a380 seats arent the best but at east all offer aisle access. in the air the meals were reversed with breakfast first given the delay this was now a day flight instead of a night one. crew were unresponsive and glum looking. breakfast was very overcooked had to ask for everything including missing cutlery. two cracked and chipped glasses offered one badly cracked showed lack of care and any inspection. they were genuinely apologetic when this was pointed out but this was a rare show of passenger focus. did not see crew at all during the majority of the flight for any period of time between meals water was replenished once. dinner was not heated at all and asked for it to be reheated as it was inedible. no predinner drinks offered one drink with dinner never saw any offer of any top ups in cabin to any other passengers. not offered water with dinner. drinks were replenished on request. in general i felt that you had to ask for everything there was no anticipation of passenger need. we wanted the flight to be over as quickly as possible an unusual response to business class. i wondered if the feeling of grief over the recent loss of their king may have had an impact. would still recommend thai and hope that our next flights are better with them.    i am a platinum member with thai airways. i was travelling with my wife with thai airways from sydney to shanghai via bangkok returning from dhaka on business class between september 2016 to october 2016 for holidays. this review is for one particular flight experience from bangkok to sydney on tg 475 business class. at the check in counter in bangkok i requested the staff not to provide a seat near the toilet. she told me my assigned seat upper deck front seats is not next to toilet. on boarding we found our seats to be next to toilet and had to endure passengers frequently visiting toilets and suffering bad smell wafting every time some one coming out of the toilet. also we experienced a rude steward who was unprofessional with a number of passengers including us like serving with a glum face and shoving foods etc. at least 6 passengers complained about his behaviour. we talked to a senior staff and the said steward offered apology. the food in the business class was unpalatable  i ordered a lasagne and it was totally uneatable.  munich to melbourne via bangkok with thai airways. disaster of a plane. this b747 must be 30 years old. outdated seats no flat sleeping not enough room for hand luggage in business class they wanted me to bring my luggage downstairs to another seat and refused to put it into luggage space in upper deck. food is at best average. very limited selection and not high quality. female staff are nice but males seem to be ex thai military. no wonder these planes are half empty. never again.    kuala lumpur to bangkok on september 30th has been the worst experience with thai airways so far. due to late arrival at klia the boarding didnt commence on time and on top of that they announced some sort of unspecified technical problem which eventually delayed the flight by over one and a half hour. during the flight there was no apology from the cabin crew just a casual mention from the captain about the delay midflight. onboard meal is nothing to write home about these days but its an airline meal in economy class so what do you expect. upon delayed landing the aircraft taxied to the far end of the airport without any gate and sat on tarmac for another 20 minutes or so. 200 passengers had to get to terminal by bus just after midnight. many passengers on this flight missed their next connecting flight to elsewhere. the misery did not end there yet. they announced onboard that the baggage collection carousel was number 11 but in fact all luggage were put on carousel 23. passengers were waiting near carousel 11 for a long time until a few of us checked again and informed all. what has happened to the excellent thai airways service and food i was excited to be using a dreamliner for the first time flying from bangkok to brisbane. i was very impressed with the quietness in the cabin the seating and the tricky window tinting. i was also looking forward to some good thai airways service and food after using budget airlines on this route for a couple of years. i realize that cabin staff can have a bad day and the crew were efficient but it wasnt what i remember thai airways service to be. but my biggest disappointment was the food. \\r\\r\\n    night flight out of vientiane to bangkok. the flight was delayed for almost an hour and many passengers including me had a very tight connection in bangkok. no explanation was given in vientiane airport. onboard no announcement from the captain nor the crew about the delay. no apologies. asked the one of the crew and found out that all the weather was bad in bangkok so the incoming flight was delayed. i understand this is unavoidable but at least they should inform the passengers of the reason. the only thing nice was the food.    bangkok to london. the service fell far below what i was expecting. on this return flight the stewardess made as little eye contact as possible was churlish and off hand to the extent of being rude. the meals were adequate but lukewarm and during this long flight no additional drinks were offered. if i went up to the galley i was shooed out and the requested drink would eventually be delivered. if i attenpted to order via the call button the response just as unfriendly. this attitude was prevalent throughout the cabin crew from thr csd down. the choice of film and tv very limited to anything recent. a very poor selection. seats were comfortable and information from flight deck good. check in efficient. upon return however my soft sided case was wet inside and had obviously been left uncovered in the rain at bangkok.     flew bangkok to kuala lumpur and economy was almost full. we were lucky on that day as the initial 777300 was upgraded to a newer and more comfortable boeing 777300er. the seats were great but headrest felt a little cheap. the meal was the worst airline meal ive eaten. the crew said the rice was fried rice but it tasted extremely bland. the inflight service was not as i expected by way of least pleasant service from thai airways flight attendants.     dubai to jakarta via bangkok. i had high expectations for thai airways in the star alliance group but failed so miserably. on all four flights the boarding time was not as printed on the boarding pass. all of them boarded at the departure time or later and one flight was delayed because of technical reasons. i booked from thai airways website and because the amount was over 10m rupiah i had to come into the sales office in jakarta to pay in person. because my transit time was 18 hours i received transport and accommodation in bangkok but even that i had to request and no details were given on the transportation procedures. at the indra regent hotel they didnt provide breakfast despite thai airways saying that breakfast was on their account. when i asked thai airways to clarify this with the hotel they said its on the hotel. the entertainment systemscreens were very old and dated resolution wasnt good. the headphones jack didnt work on one side and the magazine pocket wasnt fixed properly so the magazines kept on falling. after the meal service picking up the trays took very long and on one of the flights i had to call the attendants to pick mine up because they skipped me. attendants werent friendly. to have a blanket i needed to ask not on every seat. checking in at dubai was the worst. line was so long. local staff had no customer service skills. i tried thai airways because of the price  but was not happy with the experience and probably wont recommend it to others.     sydney to bangkok. the lady who checked me in at sydney was surly and unsmiling. the boeing 747400 was old and looked worn. the crew call button in my seat didnt work and the list of movies contained not one name i recognised  just old b movies. was the crew were surly and unsmiling and hid in the galley for most of the flight. the worst part and something that always seems to happen on thai flights that arrive late in the day  the plane was parked way out in the airfield leaving passengers to climb down a set of stairs and take a very long bus ride to the terminal.  our bags were then delayed meaning that i had to wait a whole hour after the flight had landed for our bags to arrive on the carousel. i asked the ground staff why given that thai is the national flag carrier aircraft that arrive in the evening are not parked at the terminal for the convenience of their customers. all i got in response was that this was their process. thai used to be a great airline. how far they have fallen astonishes me.    flight date 9122016 tg 565 seat 11g. flight is okay no sky entertainment. food was nice and service okay no drinks offered you had to ask for them. the most disturbing thing was the arrival where you have to travel by bus to the terminal.     4122016 frabkk tg921. as i arrived at the airport late due to a train delay so there were no queues. i chose seat 17a near the window since i prefer this type of seat. now i find that the window seats are quite flimsy and connected to each other so if your front or back neighbor turns your seat also moves. so on the flight back to germany i chose the middle seat and there was no more of this problem. i was seated close to the front and chose my preferred meal but it was not available. the stewardess seemed to forget there were also people to serve and did not ask what drink i wanted. inflight entertainment lost sound during the flight and they promised me to send an upgrade voucher in 2 weeks time.     taipei to london via bangkok. this is the worst travelling experience ever. their ground staffs have been informed by tpe check in counter that there were 4 passengers on tg 635 tpebkk will miss the connecting flight tg910 from bkk to lhr because the first sector flight from tpe delayed for 1.5 hours. but no one in bkk airport anticipated this by booking the hotel for the passengers. when we arrived at bkk airport the customer service said they had not booked the hotel room and airport hotel was fully booked. we were asked to wait at the counter for almost 3 hours while the staff disappeared helping another passenger with the visa. it is midnight and everybody was very tired but who cares. we were just sent to airlines lounge at 3am to wait for the hotel room which was just ready at 5am. we ended up staying at bkk airport for 13 hours. the whole mess created by their service made my trip so miserable.     bangkok to paris. the boarding started with a delay and boarding was chaotic. the business class was fully booked and a fully booked 60 seats business class is rarely pleasant. the flight attendant in charge if the left part of business class a bit tired and didnt smile. she was not efficient and service was too slow. the guy in my right served by an other friendly staff ended his dinner before i had a chance to start mine. no welcomeno personnal message as they do with platinium and gold members. i do not like the business class in the a380 as its too busy. fortunately the food was good they have finally improved the meals.    london heathrow to bangkok return. internet booking easy but very limited seats to choose from even 11 months in advance. second year of chaos at heathrow terminal 2 compulsory multi airline baggage drop. when i eventually reached the checkin desk i asked for my bags to be checked through to the onward destination told this was not possible as it was not with the same airline. news to me as i have done this numerous times if airlines are codeshare or in the same alliance etc. check in staff are not interested in giving customer service so why airlines use this facility is beyond me. boarding chaotic no sign no announcement just a woman shouting who could board over a full a380 flight resulted in everyone boarding at the same time as passengers were asking each other what was happening. aircraft was the high standard of the a380 – good leg room touch screen ok recline with good menu and quality of good. staff had an appalling attitude they did not hide the fact that they would rather be doing other things than providing customer service on this flight\\r\\r\\n    bangkok to singapore with thai airways. they changed my seating without prior notice. i was the last passenger to be served and no choice of food. wrote to thai airways but no reply. they gave me the reference code but no follow up since then. worst service no more thai smile no choice of food.    we had a chance to fly thai airways from melbourne to chennai via bangkok. the travel was quite good and so was the inflight entertainment and meals served. the service by staff on board and the ground staff seems to have forgotten whats known as smile and they look as if they dont want to smile.  the staff need extra training on communication and etiquette if thai airways boasts itself a royal airliner.\\r\\r\\n    bangkok to tokyo narita in business class was poor value for money. the lounge at bangkok suvarnabhumi disappointing with poor selection on of food. the boeing 747400 is old and the business class seats were not lieflat on an overnight flight it was impossible to get some sleep. the food was very bland and seemed similar to what you would get in economy class. entertainment selection is very poor and they would not turn it on until the plane reached cruising altitude. when compared to other asian airlines thai is worst.    frankfurt to krabi via bangkok. the airline of the land of smiles disappoints. two flight attendants on my flight to bkk were lacking refinement or dedication to customer service. topped only to arrive with a delayed connecting flight into krabi. upon arrival at my final destination i had to deal with the fact that my checked luggage was not there. its gone missing. and the department of lost and found could not even locate my bag at all. thai airways disappointed in each and every aspect. technical issues may occur but the utter disrespect shown by onboard staff is inexcusable.    bangkok to mumbai by thai airways 777. the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours. while boarding the flight we were not welcomed warmly. when i gave a call for a glass of water they did not respond. i had to go to fetch some water for myself. the seats were quite comfortable but was not impressed with their legroom 3132 inch setas pitch. the flight arrived at mumbai airport after a delay of 2 hours. i will not fly this airline again.    thai airways needs to improve. the a330 on route from krabi to bangkok seemed to be a very old and outdated model. shows major signs of wear and tear. special meal was not catered and the onboard staff were absolutely careless. on the night flight bkk to fra no decaffeinated coffee was available in the upper economy class galley. it caused major confusion amongst the onboard staff to make decaffeinated coffee readily available. even a main purser was unable to straighten out this problem. highly disappointing and undignified and unworthy of a four star airline. luggage arrived in frankfurt with major damage.\\r\\r\\n    i had a flight from kuala lumpur to auckland with transit via bangkok airport. upon checking in at kul airport my new zealand visa was verified by thai airways staff. i have a 5 year working permit and its not my first trip out of new zealand and back. me and my luggage was checked in all the way to auckland. however i had to pick up my boarding pass for kul  auckland stretch in bangkok airport. at bangkok airport i was advised by thai airways representative that they need to verify my visa. on my remark that it was verified in kul airport already i was advised that their internal system isnt working and they cannot check. i was told to wait. after waiting for 1 hour i came to the counter and asked what is going on. a thai airways representative said he sent telex to new zealand immigration and theres no reply from them. so he cannot put me on the flight unless he gets response from them. he said my visa isnt real and there is something wrong with my passport thats why theres no feedback. i told him to call the immigration. he said they cannot do overseas calls. eventually i called auckland airport and asked to put me through to immigration. i talked to the immigration officer who confirmed that its not the right thing that thai airways is doing. he talked to the representative then and gave me the direct number of the immigration office that deals with the airline inquiries. i called that number and while talking to the immigration officer the thai airways staff gave me the pushed the boarding pass. my first and last flight with thai airways.    hyderabad to phuket via bangkok and bangkok to hong kong. i used my miles and more mileage to buy the ticket. i find thai  airways seats very very uncomfortable. the india departure was in the middle of the night i eat in the lounge so i can sleep on that short 3 hour flight but it was not possible. i dont like angle lie flat seats. the crew from hyderabad to bangkok was the nicest but the crews on the other two flights were cold  i felt if at all plastic similes. the business class service is nothing to talk about. non of the 3 short flights were amenities were given and everything was basic.    flew thai airways from bangkok to melbourne. my screen wasnt working so i notified the air hostess. she looked annoyed but went away muttering something about fixing it. a fair amount of time passed and nothing was happening. i started pressing buttons on the control then she appeared and practically snatched it out of my hand and said something like dont touch takes 10 minutes. so i waited and waited and waited. in the end i gave up and decided to try to sleep. i put the blanket over my head and relaxed. within 10 minutes she was tapping at me saying try now try now. it didnt work. she asked if i wanted to move seats i said yes. so finally sitting with a working screen. then when the meals came around i was given a vegetarian meal. i tried to tell them i didnt order it but they said just wait i felt like a child in school being chastised same hostess who was supposedly fixing my screen came to me and asked what the problem was. i said i didnt order this may i have a normal meal. she then went on to to say why are you in this seat its not yours. i said you told me to sit here because my screen wasnt working.    thai airways puts family with children as last priority. i was flying bangkok to phuket with my two kids and had a stroller with me. as with all airlines i was asked to leave the stroller at the entrance of the cabin which i did. but what came after was a disaster. thai airways made all the families with children wait for their strollers till the last luggage came of the baggage reclaim. so its really no point flying business class as we still had to wait till the last luggage as with other families whom had to wait for their strollers.    thai airways service from hong kong to tehran via overnight layover at bangkok was mediocre in terms of crew service and time management. it has come to my concern that thai has had serious delays at hkg recently on their service to bkk. crew was mostly unhelpful and quite rude and robotic in their attitude when asked for an immigration card. the only reason to keep me flying with thai is their newly introduced service to tehran via bangkok and also their topnotch gastronomic experience which was on par with my past experience flying on their economy and business class.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    \\r\\r\\nflew thai airways from bangkok to london. 12th feb 2017 no sense from flight manager at check in who made no mention that tg916 was delayed. at gate c4 the staff member had no idea why the flight was late. we left the gate 1 hour later. issues with on board service. flight manager told me that their english was not that good which contradicts their corporate policy. appalling service from cabin crew poor inflight entertainment and very poor quality food. we touched down at lhr late. we fly thai airways business class every year from zürich to sydney. although i have always loved thai i was very dissatisfied this time round. the food on the zürichbangkok leg was terrible and on the bangkok sydney leg even worse. the only time we could eat the food was from sydney to bangkok. they are obviously saving money the service also clearly lacked the famous thai smile lhrbkk return. outbound service was all smiles from the two ladies servicing our section. food beef was served in the same foil type dish as an economy meal and the quality was about on par with economy  dreadful a ready meal from a supermarket tastes far better and what does that cost makes you wonder who makes cost cutting decisions and whether they factor in the real costs of losing a customer. return journey i had the lamb which was pretty much inedible. crew on the way back were poor in our section with no smiles and just seemed to be going through the motions. the seat is angled lie flat which makes it impossible to sleep. only mild positive really was the ife with a fairly decent selection of movies and all in their original uncut versions. basically you get more space but the food is no better than economy. worth an extra 1300 over the economy ticket  you decide. having submitted a less than positive review of my bangkok paris business class trip i am bound to do the same for my return. alas the same problems thin and uncomfortable seat poor selection of newspapers and magazines on board is it so difficult to stock more than bangkok post iht and fin times along with time and golf mags the airport itself was busting with reading material and the food my wife and i agreed was simply inedible. my beef was too hard to cut accompanied by poor roast potatoes and a selection of tasteless cheeses. staff were okay and there were many spare seats. poor thai once a great airline. lhrbkk. new years eve flight and the crew clearly wished they were celebrating. was the only down point of the journey  no smiles. but food drinks in flight entertainment and comfort in economy were all very good would fly with thai again. london  bangkok 45 times a year for the past 10 years business class on tg917 and tg916. i am a gold card member and would add that i am 6ft and 20st. my main gripe is that since the a340600 has been introduced the level of service has gone downhill in my opinion due to the increase in seat capacity but same level of staff. the importance seems to be on serving rolls steward comes round numerous times whereas the wine serving is sparse and never served with the meal which is a shame as it is very palatable especially the white. the thai lounge is much better than the london lounge. films can vary a lot but in the main tend to be american. seating at my weight is never going to be that comfortable. overall i will still fly thai but please you need to improve the service at least to how it use to be. bkksin tg401 11 apr. i will follow up from my previous comments and say it almost seems that their service keeps deteriorating each time you fly with them. 11 days into the month of april and they still have marchs inflight entertainment guide. the inflight crew along with the inflight manager were very cold and did not have the charmingly friendly smile. to end the terrible service run they forgot to serve me my meal as well and when brought to their notice was followed by the all too common sorry. if long transit times were not an issue for me i would have stopped flying thai it is just not worth flying business class with them anymore. melbournebangkokphuket return. melbourne to bangkok the aircraft was clean and in good condition and staff were wonderful. on the return flight i could have been forgiven for thinking i had changed to a different airline. the staff had little or no interest in the passengers and seemed to ignore the requests for assistance. the food quality also dropped on the return leg. i had expected more from thai. bkkfra a340. not what i expected left disappointed. no personal avod makes for a long 11 hour flight. service from fas was average took late night flight so i dont recall food quality probably slept through it. aircraft was worn but clean ladies received orchids upon departure. probably wont fly thai air in the future. i do recall seats being very thin and uncomfortable. sydbkk and bkkusmbkkchiang rai. i am not overly enthusiastic about this airline. the cabin crew always seem to be very rushed and not so polite. whenever i am in thailand people seem to smile wherever you go but never for thai crew. they always seem to be disinterested and annoyed by passengers. food was fair avod was good but the feeling they left was unsatisfactory especially because of the rude crew. not just on one leg but on all sectors. flights tg917 and tg916 boeing 747. dissatisfied with thai airways this time. food was awful only ate a small amount of fruit all meals were unappealing. would not travel business class again  not worth the money. going out from heathrow to bangkok my partners screen did not work we booked seats on the upper deck in january rows 26 going out and 16 on our return. arrived at bangkok airport at to check in for flight and was told a passenger had just booked our seat. onboard when we asked for a gin and tonic told they had run out and offered champagne. bkksapporobkk a330 j class. very disappointed with the food and service both outbound and inbound. it seems that their service keeps deteriorating each time you fly with them. lunch was simply inedible inbound. they served a piece of boiled fish hard as rock on top of white rice and white sauce. this simply isnt a premium business class service anymore. having flown thai many times it is noticeable standards have fallen. tg 920 from bkk to frankfurt on 23rd june 2013. flight facilities were ok but the food was dismal. for breakfast they ran out of pancake option half way and did even say sorry to the customers. as we pay for our flights it is the duty of the airline to make sure customers get what they ask for. otherwise they should not mention that in the menu card. it is very unprofessional to say that they do not have an option which is already mentioned in the menu as an option. flight attendants were not very attentive. i enjoyed the inflight entertainment programmes. next time i will think twice before choosing thai airways. nrtbkk. business on a380. i like the a380 a lot generally and thais new business class product designed for this equipment is a huge improvement over other iterations of business in the thai fleet. unfortunately they have not done away with the lurid purples and pinks but otherwise the staggered 180 degree life flat seating units are excellent. staggered arrangement gives lots of privacy though window lovers will find that in every second row the main armrest with its storage remote control and reading light etc is between you and the window itself. nonetheless the whole deal works and works well. the seat is wide enough and long enough though the alcove for ones feet is a little narrow. there is a lot of storage a huge fold down table and a good sized hd screen though the range of ife selections is thais usual humdrum which seems to be much the same as uas ife. cabin service started out very attentive and graceful but after dinner the fas pretty much disappeared did not answer the call bell and seemed miffed when i poked my head into the galley to ask for water. as for the food well it was as usual with thais business class product not good. interestingly enough the next day i flew with bangkok airways on a short domestic hop and the food in coach was way better than thais business class dinner on the leg from nrt. perbkklhr quite unhappy with the experience thought the value of the tickets would pay out. very dissatisfied with the food and seat very disappointed with the staff service aircraft is very small but noisy aircraft felt gloomy and dirty with not enough legroom. overall very disappointed. flew bkkdmebkk business class day flight. no flat bed still on this long haul flight. food same as economy class served in aluminium container. staff not very friendly. tg 561 from hanoi to bangkok on june 28th. staff performance is low they seemed to be very stressed since the flight was full due to summer holiday. food was bad and cold. alcohol drinks only on request. they were stressed if you asked for immigration applications. no inflight entertainment. even though we came in on an a330 we had to stop at a parking position on the field and be taken by bus to the terminal. they built an airport for 45 mil. guestsyear and we have to travel by bus. bkksyd was one of the worst flights i have experienced. the boeing 747 used on this route looked like it had never been maintained in its 20 years of service. the seats are so uncomfortable if youre 1.75m or taller you cant even lean you head back because the seat back is too short. there was no avod and no overhead monitors just a few projectors which didnt even work correctly. service was not very friendly and food was also less than average. i would definitely not recommend flying thai on this route until they consistently use stateoftheart aircrafts. i flew with thai round trip sydbkk in september. i had no trouble getting emergency exit seats and at no extra cost. the seats were comfortable. the meal provided from sydney was lunch and a snack before landing in bangkok. it wasnt to bad. the meals provided on bangkok  sydney were delicious. the inflight entertainment going was so bad and wouldnt load at all. on the way back there was no inflight entertainment at all. the fas really didnt appear at all interested in their customer service. after breakfast was served on the return leg the cabin was darkened and the two rows of seats they had reserved by the galley were occupied by the fas and there they sat talking and giggling for hours. i think thai needs to perhaps encourage the fas to provide a little more customer service than they do at the moment. overall it was a good experience and i would use thai on long haul again. flew thai smile from bangkok to macau and back. nothing to smile about considering its an international sector. seats good for thais anyone above 57 will find it very difficult to sit in. food comes in a plastic bag  a bottle of water a small pudding a tiny sandwich. in spite of clear weather in macau a day after typhoon usagi spared the area flight came in 3 hours late and further delay to land as only one runway operational in bkk  another 40 minutes late missed my connection to krabi rude staff at airport refused to change my ticket to the next mornings flight until i complained. sat at the airport for 14 hours. thai smile in the land of smiles for once didnt make me smile never again. nov 16 2013 tg 476 syd to bkk. the seat was comfortable. food was quite poor for first class some of it was not as described and some was inedible. service was poor desite the fact that there was only two of us in first class. when i asked for a topup of ice my dirty glass was returned to me with the ice  lipstick marks and all. the toilets were continuously occupied by the staff so the two passengers had to wait  what a joke. ground crew took forever to line up the portable staircase massive incompetence. cmbbkkcmb. beware of thai smile i have to admit that i was not aware of thai smile before my experience on 2326 nov 2013. i booked my flight on the thai airways website the flights had a tg prefix and the confirmation email came from thai airways international. i deliberately chose thai airways as i wanted a quality of service better than the alternative of sri lankan airways. the whole journey left me disappointed. i thought i was on a full service flight but obviously wasnt. the plane was new  but was incredibly uncomfortable due seat pitch and leg room. staff are young immature and rather clueless about customer service. food was nothing special. thai smile should be operated as a completely different airline and have a different prefix. i felt misled that i had booked a low cost service whilst using the regular thai airways website. no where on the ticketing does it mention that it was thai smile service. i have flown thai on many occasions and always been happy however now the reputation of tg has been shattered for me. i dont understand how you can interchange a lcc service with a premium service using the same airline code when clearly they are a world apart. im not a complainer but thai airways really need to address this. melbkkhktbkkmel. melbkk food was good. plane was clean but entertainment system did not work. no apologies from crew just dont touch for five minuets. i was told in a stern voice. crew came around with drinks regularly. however no smiles at all. only smiles we got were from qf ground staff helping with boarding. crew members just were pointing which aisles to go down. bkkmel. food was inedible. it was a frittata with no taste at all. no one ate it. dinner was disappointing. plane was clean. entertainment was good. safety was lacking. crew did not demo just played a video. they did not secure cabin for take off for example did not check seat belts foot rests chairs etc. did not feel very safe. the checkin agent in bkk did not speak. overall not the friendly. next time i would fly qantas. bkkhktbkk 18122013 tg211. 19122013 tg216 in business. there is no seat selection or request possible on domestic flights in business. even when you checking in online 24 hours before all seats are gone. i also travelled in f from frankfurt to bangkok and would like to say that the service is not up to date. the service is overpriced and has little features and benefits. the cabin attendants show little respect. thai used to be a reasonable airline. service on board is nonexistent. i am very disappointed. had a flight from bangkok to oslo. slightly delayed but that was ok for me. when i got onboard i was impressed by how friendly the cabin attendants were. however that changed after a couple of hours airtime. the flight was 13 hrs. during that time the staff came around with drinks only twice. yes 13 hrs and 2 cups of water. so after the first 3 hours i pushed the service button. there came this lady asking what do you want i told her i would like something to drink. her response was unfriendly and that i had to go back to the galley and get it myself. at the next meal handout the cabin attendant looked angry. ive never experienced anything like this i was calm and neutral at all times and still got treated this way. perbkk on 28 nov 2013. i had a 1 year old and a 3 year old in tow upon reaching the gate in perth i was told that thai does not allow boarding of kids first. i had specifically requested a bassinet seat for my one year old but none were available which i took in good grace as it was a day flight was not too much of a problem. on my return on 8th december night flight we were given a bassinet seat upon take off i asked the flight attendant for the bassinet to be provided so that the baby can sleep. was met with a flat out no saying the baby was too big for a bassinet. he is 9kgs and according to thais own website the cut off is 13kgs. i asked 3 other flight attendants and they all said the same thing. whenever i have travelled singapore airlines or even qantas this has never been the case. so disappointed with the service levels. never again. tg 565 dec 18th and return on tg 564 jan 3rd. pros good on time good choice for inflight entertainment. cons food is not so as a few years ago cold and not tasty. choice of drinks is less no alcoholic drinks. service is low they ignored me twice with food and drinks hence i had to call them. delbkktpebkkdel. definite evidence that certain sectors get preferential treatment from certain members of the industry. while bkktpe is operated in a brandnew a332 bkkdel passengers put up with a dated b744 with those reducedheight seats so you can see the big screen at the front of the compartment. meal service is excellent on the tpe sector with crew coming round to offer extra rolls or on drink runs. service on the del sector is gruff with crew forgetting your rolldrinks. metal cutlery only offered on the tpe leg. especially on the del leg the flamboyant colour scheme pink yellow blue and purple as the four seats in the centre block compounds the sense of chaos in the cabin. inconsistent service we travelled outbound london to bangkok business class on tg911 on 15th january 2014. throughout the flight the service was second to none and we had thought thai had really upped their game. the staff were superb the inflight meal service extremely well presented and of a good standard. the entertainment reasonable. sadly the return journey in business class tg 910 on 2829 january 2014 fell so very far short of satisfactory. the staff were surly and obviously didnt want to be there and not particularly helpful. the drinks and meal service was shocking the staff were on a mission to throw everything at the passengers as soon as possible so they had nothing to do from there on the drinks and meal service was completed within less than an hour of take off before we had chance to have a drink our meal was virtually thrown at us and cleared before completion. similarly the breakfast service was faster than mcdonalds and the meal dry and inedible scrambled egg which had solidified the whole return journey felt unwelcoming and one i would not wish to experience again especially given the premium pricing hence sadly reducing my overall rating of this airline from what could have been substantially higher if based on the outward journey only bkklhr 747400r on night flight. excellent plane again on the newly refurbished 747 with suites in first. lounge good at bkk although i must say that if you have a private sitting room as we did it is difficult to attract any attention from the staff. we always flight thai first on long haul to the far east and until this flight have always been impressed with the staff service levels. however on this occasion they were a down one member of staff and b used a staff member who had only worked in first twice. thai cannot have provided her with any training so although she made every effort she had no idea how to serve dinner or drinks and was nervous and unsure throughout the cabin service. the flight manager explained that thai now have a policy to shuffle staff between all classes and all aircraft types. that in itself is fine but please guys  do some training first no wines offered with dinner we had to ask and were brought an open bottle  no choice no proper predinner drinks service main courses were forgotten so we were offered fruit and cheese after the starter the wrong menu was used we had preordered orchids were missing from the suites vases mix and match pyjamas long delays in clearing the tables so we had to ask for it to be done eventually. i still will recommend thai unless this happens again next time. the saving grace was the helpful cabin crew and ground staff who retrieved my passport on landing at lhr which had fallen through a hole in the suite wall down into the floor along with a large collection of menus safety cards mineral water etc a design fault which need bunging up. aucklandbangkok 811430114 tg491 and 492. boeing 777200 was good. food was average movies etc were good. cabin crew were uninterested. overall okay. flew on 15 january 2014 from bkk to cdg via tg 930 in business class. new a380 beautiful aircraft most comfortable business class. as i was not hungry at dinner time i advised the cabin attendant that i would skip the dinner but would like a snack later. around midpoint in the flight i went to the galley and asked the attendant for some food. i was told that no food would be available until the breakfast service several hours later. i was given only two small packets of crackers to last several hours until the next full meal service causing me several hours of discomfort. unbelievable other than that the flight was great. i had the most unpleasant night flight from bangkok to copenhagen. seats are so uncomfortable it is impossible to get more than an hours sleep. food is really horrible. service is nothing like you would expect from thai people who are usually always so nice and kind and service minded. i asked for vegetarian food i was not able to book it previously and the hostess came with ham and salami. i dont think i will try thai airways again. oslbkkaklbkkosl oslo legs on new b773s while auckland legs on older b772s. screens much better on the newer planes. seat comfort good on all. ife was excellent with plenty of movies to choose from. however i was very disappointed with the service and food on all legs. half the crew seemed grumpy the whole time and not a smile was to be seen. two very bland meals were served on each leg. we got hungry midflight on several of the legs and asked if they had any snacks but all they could offer was some crackers and cheese. crew were not particularly diligent in going round with waterdrinks during the flights so most of the time i ended up going to the galley myself. overall a disappointment. have experienced a lot better on some of the other asian and even european carriers. thai smile bkkmfm. no smiles on this flight zero entertainment revolting food nothing for kids. pretty much the same level as service as nokair except at tg prices. check in at bkk is for all thai smile flights international and domestic so be prepared for a long queue. glad we didnt opt for business class which are the same economy seats with the center one left empty flight was on time though. bkkaklbkk. no flat bed in business class very uncomfortable seat food was as good as economy class food on regular airlines  doesnt match business class and price offered. very little service with uninterested staff. only good point is its a direct fly. very disappointed overall. cdgbkk tg931 and bkkcdg on a380. new planes. clean and airy cabin. lie flat seats ok but narrow. ife good. staff efficient but robotic. main meal lunch outbound rushed and dinner inbound again rushed. pre meal drinks served with one tiny bag of peanuts and on return served with nothing at all quality of food served on board between mediocre and poor. overall an inferior business class experience. both flights perfectly on time. bkkcdgbkk a380 seat 77j economy. not a bad flight but very limited space for tall people like me. food ok wine served in plastic bottle is terrible. flight attendants looked tired and bored. forgot something in the plane on arrival of course they didnt find anything and we were the last to leave the aircraft. we went from sydney to bangkok then bangkok to phuket and return. food was just passable. service really needs work. pressed the attendant buzzer and was walked past a number of times. not even asked if we would like wine with our dinner and were squashed in i doubt i would use this airline again. the only good thing were that the flights were on time. sydbkk in first class. thai airways managed to stuff up my complete itinerary just days before my departure. the flight was cancelled without notification. no calls. no emails. nothing. i was eventually put back on the original flight. the cabin looked worn out the flight attendant didnt look motivated at all and the food quality was extremely poor. overall it was a sad and disappointing experience especially for first class. i will avoid thai airways in the future. bkklhr tg 910 07082013. miserable rude check in staff and then to find the gate boarding staff even worse. no thai smiles on this trip. cabin crew were better but not as attentive as other options on the lhr route. the ground staff got the journey off to a bad start which coloured the whole journey sat on tg911 london to bangkok for 4 hours on the tarmac before this flight was cancelled due to engine failure. staff seemed to be out of their depth. eventually put on another star alliance flight to bangkok which was a cheaper flight than the one we had paid for. when checking in for return to london thai airways had given our seats away. after a lot of haggling got onto flight. shocking service. staff poorly trained but worse were rude and arrogant. they tried to get us to accept an economy flight when we had paid for business. i will never fly this airline again. tg916 bkklhr a340600 royal first class. i checked in online 24 hours before the flight and was able to confirm seats 1a and 2a which i had already allocated beforehand. because we were transiting through bangkok from koh samui we had to get our boarding passes at bkk. arrived at the royal first class area and were greeted by two eager porters who took our bags and another member of staff took our passports. we were ushered to the seating area whilst the formalities of check in was completed. we were then ushered off through fast track security and then onto fast track immigration which again was swift. after immigration you descend an escalator which takes you straight into the royal silk business class lounge however as we were flying first class a golf buggy was awaiting us at the bottom and we were whisked off through the business class lounge and along the corridor of concourse d to the royal orchid spa. as we had booked a massage at the check in desk we were dropped off outside the spa. there are no calls for boarding in the lounge instead lounge staff come and find you 20 minutes before the flight is due to depart and escort you to the aircraft. boarding was swift and straightforward. shortly after taking my seat a glass of champagne was offered along with papers magazines and the menu. aircraft servicing the lunchtime departure to the uk is the a340600 and so the royal first class is of the older open seat variety. the cabin does feel very spacious with only 8 seats but it is an old layout. there is plenty of storage although not as many sockets and connection points and cubby hole cupboards as on the new 747 layout. for couples travelling together the middle seats 12e and 12f are definitely the ones to go for however if you want a window view you can sit in tandem as we did and have either 12a or 12k and dine together if you fancy a chat. flight pushed back on time the food service started well with the drinks service and warm nuts and the canapés. the crew did not come around and ask for our meal order instead choosing to serve everyone in the cabin the same early courses and then proceeded to offer the main courses from the wheeled table. they completed missed out one of the main course choices. by the time we were served the food was cold and unappetising. even though this was a daytime flight i wanted to try to get some sleep so proceeded to make my bed at which point one of the crew came out of the galley and continued the process for me. the seat on the old a340600 does not go fully flat it leaves the head end slightly elevated which quite frankly was causing me some severe problems with my neck when lying on my side i probably only got 23 hours sleep. lights were switched on 2 hours before landing and the afternoon meal was served. i opted for the chicken and leek soup which because it was served to order was hot and delicious. we landed on time and bags were collected within about 30 minutes of landing. the thai airways ground service at bangkok was absolutely secondtonone from the moment we checked in we were very well looked after the flight however left a lot to be desired and was shame considering the excellent service we had on the outbound flight. our flight was sydlhr return via bkk seats 14a & b in all sectors below are the relevant points. sydbkk 744  the sound on the audio and video channels for both seats continually broke up rendering system useless out of 2 wines only 1 available. bkklhr 744  again the sound and audio for both seats continually broke up and again unable to use ife out of the same 2 wines on offer only the same wine on the first leg was available. lhrbkk a340600  as on the previous 2 sectors the same white wine was not available from the same list. bkksyd 744  i bought a book as we were again flying a 744 unfortunately my overhead light would not switch on and just to add to the farce my wifes overhead light would not go off on a positive note the ife was working. after our dinner i asked for a second coffee only to be told by an extremely arrogant cabin crew member that i had not finished my first one yet this is not in any sense hospitality this is just being down right rude. my wife and i have been travelling with thai for 20 years i can hear you saying more fool us but no more. weve always thought thai among the best international airlines but not this time the business class lounge at bkk airporttheir key location had the ambience of a greyhound bus depot. crowded uncomfortable with modest food offerings that were inedible. flight tg 473 july 25 2014 bkk to brisbane was awful. the socalled beds in the aircraft were not lieflat and so uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep. the food was poor and inedible not even economy standard. the flight attendants couldnt care less. so from now on its bye bye thai after flying with many airlines i decided to use thai as it offered a direct flight from melbourne to bangkok. business crew were not helpful and looked like they were enduring their jobs and taking out their frustrations on the passengers. i found them to be rude arrogant and unhelpful when i asked for assistance with my cabin luggage due to a back injury i was told i had to put it under a seat. when i explained that i was unable to bend to do this my case was unceremoniously shoved in by a senior crew member. their controlling manner and inflexible routines made the trip a relief to be finished. the food was not worth eating  rubbery scrambled eggs and dry tough salmon. i will never fly with thai again. i have had much better experiences in economy with other airlines. heathrowbangkokheathrow business class. average at best. disappointing lounges particularly bangkok with tired furniture and decor. i have never before been in a business class lounge when you couldnt get a glass of wine the flight accommodation was not good with uncomfortable seating which did not covert into flat beds. on the outward leg the cabin was reduced to darkness after the first couple of hours into the flight despite it being early afternoon which made no sense except perhaps for the cabin staff. same on return but quite acceptable as this was a night flight. half way through the flight the toilets ran out of hand towels. on both flights the service seemed rushed. we have had much better experiences with other national carriers particularly singapore and emirates and will not be flying with thai again. very negative experience thai airways is very pricey and their service is getting poorer over the years im a gold member and i often travel with them. they now switched back to old 747 from bangkok to london and despite flying business i hardly noticed any difference with the economy class in terms of quality. seats are very narrow and not very comfortable the video screen for the onboard entertainment is noticeably smaller than for other seats and old also difficult to return to its stowed position without any difficulty. old movies same as few months earlier. food in particular was very poor and with little choices i had better food on economy class in the past and service was also very poor compared to the past little care to details. this should probably be my last business flight with thai airways. nrtbkk on a380. this was my second and hopefully last flight in thai first class. they should just not be allowed to call it first class business class on singapore or eva is better. last year i flew thai from zrhbkk on a340 and was disappointed  i thought maybe i just had an old plane and a bad crew. turns out its the standard for thai. a380 is a fairly new plane but it was already quite worn. the f cabin just isnt designed that well  there is a lot of wasted space on some lounge in the front that no one used. much better to put another bathroom in that area like emirates have. the seats are ok but the armrest is only on one side which i didnt like. the tv screens are big but the entertainment selection is quite poor. the service would be ok for business class but its definitely not polished enough for first class. again i dont want to compare them to their major competitors but thai is miles behind. it just feels like its not genuine its very mechanical. about the food. i ordered a speciality meal thinking it would be better boy was i wrong the white fish was inedible. i dont know what they did to it but it tasted like a shoe. i had to ask the flight attendant to give me salmon from the standard menu fortunately she had some left. it wasnt a culinary miracle by any means but at least i was able to eat it. not sure what champagne they were serving but it wasnt good either. now since this was only a 6 hour flight there were no pjs and it didnt seem like they had bedding for anyone either at that point i didnt dare to ask just slept on the seat. also we didnt receive the standard rimowa first class amenity kit but rather a business class amenity kit designed by porsche. so disappointing. the fa didnt make any attempt to apologize or explain that. i would definitely prefer to fly ana business class nrtbkk. flew from vienna to bangkok then on to melbourne. absolutely terrible experience as i was told at vienna that i would not be sitting with my children from bangkok to melbourne so upon arrival to bangkok went to the ticket desk and a nice man sorted it all out so that i could sit with my kids. when we boarded a very rude hostess said that my daughter could not sit in the exit aisle without a parent sitting next to her. i was travelling alone with my four children and the man sitting next to my daughter said that he was happy to take care of her in case of emergency and i was only separated from her by the aisle so i could easily reach her. the hostess insisted on one of my children moving because the plane was full and we could not all be moved. my children were very distressed because one had to move and none of them wanted to sit alone as you can imagine as they are all under the age of nine. i was so upset at how insensitive this hostess was forcing one of my children to sit alone a three year old. i will never fly with thai again disgraceful. thai international bkkmel 19 december 2014. checkin at bkk was easy and the staff friendly although the agent forgot to return the ticket printout. on time departure using boeing 777200 although the aircraft was showing its age looked quite scruffy and in need of a thorough refurbish. crew were surly and had no interest in providing service in fact they gave the impression that the passengers were an inconvenience. ife worked but the programme selection was very basic even the latest release movies were old. havent flown long haul tg for sometime and based on this experience wont be doing it again soon. tg 911  30th jan 2015. inbound flight tg916 on 27th feb 2015. i have been married to my thai wife now for 25 years and we have both travelled with thai airways for most of those years. i have just returned on tg916 on the 27th feb 2015 and it is so sad to see an airline as good as this going down in quality. the food ran out the audio didnt work one toilet was out of order to the the extent the flight crew actually removed the toilet pan right next to my seat. when i said my audio did not work staff checked it and totally agreed with me but did nothing to help even though the flight had 9 unused seats. i know thai people do not like to lose face but this service loses face for thailand. what a shame. flew from london heathrow to bkk and return. absolutely terrible. on the 11 hour nightflight there the seats were uncomfortable and cramped and the staff were extremely rude. my entertainment system did not work and when i asked to move i was ignored. no toothbrushpaste or eye mask provided. i did however believe that this could be just a oneoff bad flight. i tried to upgrade to business class for the 13 hour flight back to lhr but was rudely told it was full. the return flight was just as bad if not worse than the first flight. my entertainment system did not work again and the staff were just as rude. they seemed to disappear for around 6 hours during the flight it was not a nightflight either leaving us with no offer of even a cup of water. when i eventually asked for a cup of coffee i was brought 20 minutes later a stonecold one. dinner was served 2 hours before landing although our row of 3 was served around half an hour after everybody else  i think w e were forgotten as we had to ask for our food when we eventually got our food they had ran out of the beef option leaving only the seafood option. as i dont eat fish i asked if there was any other option at all before being told i would just have to go hungry absolutely terrible from start to finish. will never fly with them again nor recommend them to anyone. flew business class from bkkcdg on the a380. the flight left and arrived in paris on time however the experience was not what was expected and i was left disappointed. the food and service in business class was awful and it started with inattentive and grumpy staff that looked like they had not slept in days and had no interest in offering the royal thai service the seats were very cramped and was not comfortable even in the flat bed position. food was terrible and felt just as if it was from economy class but served on a plate. thai airways is having a tough time at the moment and from this experience i can see why. they are always one of the most expensive airlines and coupled with this terrible service and quality i cant see them getting out of their ditch anytime soon. long haul from bkk next time will certainly be on another airline even if there is a short transit. pekbkk in business old but upgraded 747 upper deck with new seats and new ife. service was faultless and forgettable. nobody went the extra mile or even the extra inch but we got what we paid for. nice seats and nice food i cant remember what we had and that probably sums it up well. we booked a flight with thai airways from phuket to bangkok with the intention of catching an additional flight from bangkok to saigon with another airline. the flight from phuket was originally delayed 15 minutes but we didnt start boarding until 4.45 we should have been departing at 4.30. when we got to bangkok we could not land so we flew around for half an hour until the runway was clear. we landed an hour after we were expected to and ended up missing our flight to saigon. when we talked to the customer service desk they said it was our fault for us missing our flight and would not do anything to assist us. very unimpressed with the service and would not recommend taking thai airways. terrible how the once quitegood thai has declined. bangkok to sydney on an old 747 with partially reclining seats. the food was almost inedible service was croaky and the comfort levels poor. service on thai to europe at least has flat beds and a reasonable meal selection the was shoddy. out on 18th january return 2nd march. both flights on the 747 as our son is a full time wheelchair user and can get to seat on lower deck without transferring to an aisle chair. terminal 2 a nightmare as no assistance was offered and signage is poor. 747s being phased out not before time as both flights the seats were stained and cabin in need of a good clean. out to bangkok again in july and looking forward and hope this flight on the new a380 if we can access the upper deck in business class with our son and cabin crew have improved. food on a par with most airline food  uninspiring inflight entertainment kept dropping out and had to be reset 3 times. we fly with thai 23 times a year to bangkok and sorry to say the service seems to have got worse on international flights. on 28 mar 2015 tg930 bkkcdg a380 cdgmrs with another airline seat 37k. the plane departed from bkk with 40 minutes delay so my luggage could not make my final destination in mrs due to very short transit at cdg. the flight was not full so middle seat were not taken but unfortunately a passenger just took it for herself. food and drink outbound were ok. however flight attendants completely forgot to clear the tray from my seat due to the lady sleeping with 2 seats i pressed the call button for someone to take the tray away and a lady came and took it with an unpleasant mood. during the flight only one or two rounds of drinks were served. before landing no hot towels were given and then breakfast was served they ran out of my choice so i had to take something else which was ok and kind of edible enough. apart from these miserable flight attendants attitude and lack of food and drinks the plane is new in good and clean condition seat was wide enough for 5ft 9 man with good leg room although pitch was not much compared to other 4 or 5 starairlines toilets were clean. overall rating for outbound bkkcdg i give 6.510. inbound flight on 5 apr 15 tg931 cdgbkk seat 75e upper deck it was a completely different story. flight crew were friendly and attentive. food and drinks were plenty and hot towels were given before landing. a gentleman next to me seemed to have problem with his seat and food. flight crew were very helpful trying to get what he needed including sandwiches during the flight. overall of this trip was great. i could rate this journey 9.510. the glory days of thai airways are gone and have been for some years now. i fly thai several times a year in both business and economy and find them to be very poor. unfortunately they offer the only direct flight on some of the routes i need to take. on this particular flight the disappointments just kept adding up. from the poor service provided by flight attendants who were more interested in chatting in the galley to the very poor quality meal and drink selection. for the price they are charging for a business class ticket one would think they could provide some decent wines and video entertainment. seats are not flatbed and were not long enough for my 180 cm frame. the business class lounge was very poor although not operated by thai they should not be using 3rd party operators that provide poor food and drink selection and no in site rest rooms. what continues to amaze me is how 2 of the top airlines are operating only a few hours from bangkok and yet thai airways cannot seem to emulate them in the least  how hard is it to go and study what singapore airlines or cathay are doing lhrbkklhr. i have always been a big fan of thai but have to say was left feeling disappointed on this occasion and will consider other carriers for our next trip. 747s are very old and looking worn out going out my ife was broken. food service has gone down hill with no extra little touches provided anymore and quality has diminished. service  what has happened to that thai smile attitude  service was functional and once dinner was served cabin crew just sit in galley chatting until breakfast service. i can see why thai is losing out to the middle eastern airways and if someone from management actually reads these reviews i urge you to invest some of that amazing thai hospitality back into your airline tg 282 from koh samui to bangkok. service at the airport was polite and nice. business class booked and paid for full fare. the seats were the worst ive seen. these bc seats were smaller than economy legroom. we were asked to move from the 2nd row of the plane to the first row as our 2 inch recline of the seat meant that a child could not open her tray table in the bc seat behind ours. weve cancelled all remaining thai flights as a result. cabin crew have lost the genuine smile and welcome. they were somewhat rude. on our sinbkk leg tg404 28 apr 2015 while clearing the trays one of them spilled coffee onto my husbands seat he was in the restroom. i immediately motioned to the crew but was ignored. soon afterwards i pressed the attendant button but none of them answered the call. after about 10 mins i eventually used my own wet tissue to remove the stain. on the bkk sin leg tg409 2 may 2015 i was a little unwell but waited till all passengers had boarded and the crew were doing the round before takeoff and asked for a blanket. the crew gave a nod but did not return with any. after the flight took off and crew left their seats i reminded another crew member that i asked for a blanket. she just glared at me and mumbled a little and went to the rear. a while later she dragged a plastic bag of blankets obviously just routinely giving out blankets to those who might not even need them for such a short haul. finally i got mine not because i asked for it but because its the routine im really disappointed with their service  so unlike 20 years or so ago when i would happily fly by the then thai international if it served my destination. i as very unhappy with the service on tg628 from hong kong to seoul on april 24 2015. the flight was fairly empty in business class only 67 passengers. staff were not friendly and inattentive. i saw cabin attendants asleep in the business class seats while i was trying to look for service. during the flight no water was offered and i needed to keep asking for it. on tg 629 from seoul to hong kong on april 26 2015 the flight was marginally better but the service was rather disappointing. the staff member collected the tray but left the empty glass the tablemat and other utensils behind. after 15 mins i had to ask them to collect those. just surprised how she could be so inattentive given there were very few passengers in business class on board. we flew on the new boeing 777300 on the hndbkk leg and thais last two b737400 on the bkkvtebkk legs. on the return leg to haneda we flew the b747400. hardwarewise i think everything was great. the food was good seats were comfortable and the plane was clean. the ife could be improved further though. servicewise i would say thai airways is inconsistent. on all the four legs flown i saw cabin crew from the the super helpful and friendly to rude and unfriendly. if thai could improve on their service i think thai deserves another star. i am very disappointed by thai airways. i have always believed it was one of those oriental gems and that i would enjoy a silky flight. unfortunately it started very badly as i made an error in the booking and the company charged 100 to correct it. the flight itself was unimpressive mediocre food mediocre entertainment and mediocre staff. the crew was unsmiling. at least the flight was more or less on time. the new seat design is comfy only the middle seats are quite close to the neighbor. food very good choices. beverages reasonable. inflight entertainment with lots of films. monitor does not allow you to tilt vertically or sideward. headphone is very big and heavy and it does not have the noise suppression. they took the menu after i order the food. i ask for white wine and they just brought any wine even that they had 3 kinds available.  our trip started well in united lounge at heathrow but we had  poor service on the plane. the business seats on boeing 747 were narrow with thin padding and mine wouldnt recline. the flight attendant wasnt interested when asked for assistance to fix the seat. he disappeared and never came back. finally after the meal we got someone to come and they forced the seat to recline but it never worked properly. the seats are nowhere near lieflat and are quite uncomfortable. there was a limited range of movies and hardly any tv programmes. how hard is to offer a decent range of entertainment the food was mediocre and seemed the same as you get in economy. the breakfast was terrible – a hard fully cooked egg that was called poached on a tough muffin. we were never offered the bread basket. the steward walked straight past us. we had the same disinterested service on our next flight on a 777300. the food was a bit better but not great. there were no snacks offered overnight. the staff seemed more interested in serving dinner quickly so they could spend the rest of the flight resting and chatting. and seats were even worse. even fully extended theyre far too short and the footrest flops down to the floor with any pressure on it at all. the most uncomfortable business seats weve ever had. two very disappointing flights.  the service has became like a robot style no emotion or friendliness from cabin staff they only do the minimum or what they are paid for. food was okay but nothing special for being in business class. seat was very uncomfortable very narrow hard and not long enough.  i am tall 63 and usually my feet dont touch the end of the seat but this time i had to fold my legs. probably the worse business class seat for long haul i have experienced. ive flown thai in 2001 and ive flown with them again. nothing much has changed aside from the newer planes and ife. the rest is about the same. when it comes to service and resource management they still havent quite got it right. at pkt checkin they decided that each counter would have its own queue. that confuses me since they were for the same flight and this split queue system is known to make wait times very inconsistent. ground crew seemed very shy and were not keen on speaking to us or at least they were so quiet we couldnt hear them and the same was observed for the cabin crew who also seemed somewhat distant. their ife looks like its 10 years old and is due tor an update despite the system being touchscreen. as for positives the plane was delayed but it did arrive on time so ill commend them for that and food is reasonably good. better than the slop that cathay pacific serves to passengers. thailand has a service culture absolutly unique in the world and tg in some far past had it too but no more. cabin attendants and pursers give you minimal attention. if wines are drinkable no better no worse food is terrible instead of serving the wonderful thai cuisine tg offers some sort of european style food. seats are the most positive aspect of the journey somewhat narrow and difficult to get in and out they are nevertheless 180° lie flat and no problem. all this comes after an awful ground service especially in their hub bkk. at checkin at noi bai i did ask for an aisle seat but the ground staff from vietnam airlines did not seem to care about my request and just put me in a window seat without informing me. there is also no priority at noi bai security they asked me to wait until the economy passengers were finished and then business could follow. we usually use thai airways for our travels because of their previously friendly and patient service. an argument not to be underestimated when traveling with toddlers. however for our round trip this time staff were just below all expectations. instead of water they came around 3 times with wine. we had to wait 1 hour at munich airport in the airplane because some passengers thai military apparently came late for unknown reasons with filled shopping bags. no excuses or explanation from staff. upon our enquiry we were just told we are tired too. entertainment program was not turned on  of course  during the waiting time. even with a brand new a380 the computer had to be started over and over again until it finally worked. this does not inspire confidence into the board computer for the pilots. to be mentioned that tickets for thai are not cheap. overall a lousy experience and we will avoid thai for next trips. short hop to vientiane on thai airways boeing 737. thai airways has an issue with service consistency. you never know what you would get. the crew on this flight was average and not living up to the service standard that theyre promoting. another issue is the air conditioning. it was literally freezing cold on this flight. flew thai airways business class with wife from shanghai to bangkok. i am a platinum member but now mostly use singapore airlines pps member. terrible food in the business class. thailand is famous for its cuisine whereas this business class food served is so low standard. i had a lamb with potato and my wife had a fish with rice. it seemed the caterers in shanghai supply food of a very low standard. the cheese and fruit platter is unimaginative and they have served the same for last 20 years or so. no thai food was served during the flight. what is going on with thai airways no wonder they are not in the top tier airlines. its a pity that a country is so famous for its service food and hospitality yet thai airways serves such bad quality food. at shanghai the check in for business experience was terrible. staff hardly greets you even you are a platinum and flying business class. you get what you pay for with thai airways. seats are 1990 and better than economy but miles away from the others. poor movie selection and although we flew in november and december and the inflight magazine listed new movies they were not changed. the smallest glasss ever for drinks. food was ok but again basic. lovely safe flight but staff did not smile and were just going through the motions. its a pity because the thai people are so nice. my family and friends travelled from dubai to hong kong via bangkok return. cabin staff with no smile and was reluctant to preserve an economy class meal for the kid who was sleeping  i was told to take it then or i might not be able to have it later. the hostess who served me was grumpy as if someone was forcing her to do this job  hong kong to bangkok return. the outward journey on the a380 was late plane was dirty i found food and inflight entertainment poor. the return on the a330 was delayed for late boarding passengers. food was mediocre wine was a full glass this time movies no change from december.  frankfurt to bangkok. the j class on the thai a380 is far superior to their tired boeing 747400s. the configuration of the seat makes for a good private space and you get a lieflat sleeping experience. bizarre service on this leg with a mature crew who were forgetful and clumsy. a first for me to also be tapped on the arm as the service approached me from behind to ask what i wanted to drink and subsequently eat.  the poke didnt happen once but twice. astonishing. the service was interrupted twice by turbulence. this delayed the service by 60 minutes at least and you could tell the crew were getting tetchy as they tried to make up for lost time ie. crew rest time as they literally threw the desserts and coffee at me. food was poor quality for a j class experience. the wine selection was also very basic. ive previously stated that tg j class is a leisureplay carrier and whilst nothing wrong with that be aware if youre expecting something better. compared to their rivals their business class product is inferior  hard and soft factors.     this bangkok to london flight was a culmination of 6 thai airways flights on a recent trip. after take off was asked if i would like a drink  yes a beer please  which appeared and was poured with the question. would i like her to leave the can my wife also had to request that the can of coke be left. dinner chosen and for some obscure reason cabin crew have allocated their service format so that in my case i had finished my meal before my wife had been served hers  even though we were sat next to each other. no wine was offered on this flight or on our outward leg so perhaps an economy drive is in situ. breakfast menu was shown and requested the thai omelette and a cup of coffee  the coffee came and when clearing cup i was asked if i would like another. i declined another coffee came but no breakfast was not in the best of moods so bit my tongue but did mention it to cabin crew member who stated that she was the purser  who then said sorry have since related this to thai airways but not holding my breath as still waiting for a response other than an automated one from customer relations for an email sent on 19022016. automated response states high volume of correspondence means a delay in answering  all complaints as a frequent traveller to bangkok mostly with thai airways for over 25 years it saddens me to say our next trip airline is up for debate  certainly not on the a380. yangon to heathrow via bangkok. both flights were delayed for 12 an hour for no reason we could make out. food on long flight was awful. who would want sweet pancakes with what i think was a solid custard warm ham and a totally anaemic sausage we had vouchers from bangkok airport to spend in the onboard duty free but the trolley went past me. i assumed it would come back but it didnt. i rang from for an attendant but whilst waiting an announcement came to say it was 40 mins to landing and the stewardess said they couldnt sell duty free  i believe this was because she saw my vouchers. i was annoyed as id wanted to purchase a few items. the plane itself was comfortable and we had good seats on the long flight near emergency exit so loads of leg room. however very cold despite a blanket and wearing warm clothes. ill think twice about travelling with them again    bangkok to munich. boarding was very quick and efficient and we were soon sitting on our seats that we had reserved online in advance. the aircraft was pretty worn ife screen was tiny and the resolution reminded me of flights i took between shortly after personal screens were introduced. at least the content was on demand. the seat was rather comfortable and every passenger got a blanket and a pillow. however the seat felt narrow and it was not possible for me to find a comfortable sleeping position without constantly touching some buttons of the ife remote which had the result that the screen was constantly switched on again. the crew was disappointing they were not able to live up to the reputation thai has. although they were very efficient and service oriented i almost felt as if they were yelling at me. the cover of my armrest was loose and fell off. when i told the fa she put it back and said  its okay. needless to say it fell off again shorty after. food was ok but not exceptional.     hong kong to bangkok. the plane was filthy and meal served out of hong kong was inedible  many complained about it and asked for another one but came up the same. the price was the only saving factor. the person in front just dropped his seat during meal service without a care in the world unfortunately have the return to look forward too    economy  seat 33g i fly thai airways for business 24 times a month and the condition of the thais aircraft seats and service are hitting rock bottom. the seat and suspension i was assigned was significantly broken. luckily i changed to an empty seat next to me which was unoccupied. after i changed seats i lifted the cushion on the broken seat to reveal the horror of trash stains hair smells and filth. the entire airplane was dirty with stains black handprints crusty tray tables and hair everywhere. food service was chaotic and i received my entree after the food service was over and trays were being collected. mobile appwebsite is old slow and inefficient.    hong kong to bangkok on 2 july. the flight was scheduled for a 1310 but announced a 1h delay upon check in. then it got delayed further and after 4hrs of delay and a 75hkd voucher for food the 400 passengers were being patient and waiting for feedback but then the delay got extended beyond acceptable timeframes 5hr then 6hr then 7hrs and eventually over 11hr delay. we started boarding at 0015 and took off later. i was flying to bangkok for a business trip i had to call my clients and inform them of my delay.  i landed at 3am and only checked in my hotel at 4am. i was told i would be given a letter upon arrival with details of the delay and use that letter for the complaint. when we landed nobody was there to greet us or give us any letters. i wanted to claim a delay compensation for the hassle. after 4 weeks of emailing thai airways only my first email was responded 2 weeks later and no other emails were responded and no compensation received.     i was disappointed for my brussels to bangkok return flights at the beginning this year. i managed to get a cheap ticket the plane gave the impression to be old. the crew seemed to rush for everything in such a way and i had to asked to be served food and drinks. and quality of the food was no more what it had been during years.  at breakfast it was difficult to get another bread. at night on one flight there was only 1 fa available and i waited long time to be served water i finally grabbed it myself from the counter. at least the plane will be better on my next flight a350 now it seems. hope they live up to their standard again with the new plane.    bangkok to tokyo the plane interior cabin crew and food seem to be a huge downgrade now. seat was not clean still have some rubbish in the seat pouch. crew could be more polite. food was awful and didnt give much choice for beverage.    london to bali via bangkok. thai airways left my luggage on the way to my destination. they said it would be on the next flight. after persistent emails the only places i could get responses out of were the bali airport luggage department and their twitter account. both of which consistently knew nothing and send me away to contact other departments and email addresses. 6 days later they found a bag that matches mine. upon confirmation it was clear the bag never left england. as i was no longer in bali i requested the bag to not leave the country and be sent to a home address as sending it to bali would cause it to be further lost. the next day i get an email saying good news were sending it to bali right now. to which i got a boat back and two hour drive plus a hotel to get to the airport to find they decided to put it on the next one. eventually i got the bag 16 hrs before my flight back to the uk. the whole thing cost me a fortune and i was one of several people this happened to on the flight. further to this the flight was pretty poor with meal choices that ran out.     bangkok to hong kong. as evidenced by the last 3 of 4 international departures with thai airways from bangkok they seem to more frequently be parking their aircraft at a remote location and then busing passengers which is a headache and not a comfortable start to the trip. the aircraft was old and worn with ife of poor quality. the inflight meal this time was quite bland and poorly presented. with the flight half full a little more effort could have been put into attentive inflight service.    perth to bangkok. the perth check in was not smooth the staff did not seem to know what he was doing and he actually confused with my ticket. air hostess attended bell after 20 mins with no apology. worse customer service. food was overall average.    bangkok to melbourne. i was looking forward to this flight. what i experience let me think that thai is on an upward slope. first the plane didnt dock at the terminalfinger and 250 passengers had to get down stairs take a bus get up again to get to the airport. i didnt mind but seeing the fathers carrying the strollers and the mothers carrying the crying kids and seeing the people having problems taking stairs i thought it would have been easier to relocate the plane instead of relocate 250 passengers. once on board apparently things got delayed and the flight crew was pushing people to move quickly instead of helping passengers. the food was ok not special but they totally skewed up the vegetarian options. my seat was broken and extremely uncomfortable. and in order to get some water during the 9 hours daytime flight i had to get to the galley. all in all my impression was that this airline does not deserve the high rankings.   munich to osaka via bangkok. avoid b747 business class where ever you can first it is a mystery to me how you can waste such a lot of space for such an uncomfortable seat. it is not angled lie flat or even flat at all. i wouldnt care about an angle but these seats are too short im 186m and have several angles so at maximum you can lay back somehow and the footrest isnt stable so whenever you move even in turbulence it will sort of swing. secondly service shows much effort but little result. for instance there are attendants all over the cabin but if you need any kind of refill wine coffee water you have to go to the galley and ask for it. thirdly the lounge at bkk completely overcrowded had to wait for an hour to take a shower which was a mould lovers paradise and dont even think of the famous spa if your transit time is below 5hrs. in a nutshell outdated product inefficient service poor lounges not worth the money. on their 747s i would not even call it a business class. a good premium eco will be a much better product and deal.    my wife and i decided to fly thai airways as we had flown with them a number of years before and had a good experience. on this occasion there were a few issues. the first leg from london heathrow to bangkok was excellent flew an a380 great flight. the second leg from bangkok to sydney was on a clapped out 747 the flight itself was mediocre but the service was very poor. the major problem was on the last leg from bangkok to london heathrow we were supposed to fly an a380 but apparently the plane was broken however it seems the plane had been unavailable for at least 710 days prior without a replacement a380 being found. after a delayed takeoff which again appears to have been the case for more than a week we shuddered home on a 777 must be the noisiest plane i have flown on in 40 years. i booked a longhaul flight on an a380 as i am very tall and the legroom is usually good and the comfort is usually excellent. not so the 777 my knees were in constant contact with the chair in front for a 12 hour flight. if i book an a380 i expect to fly one just like if i book a mercedes i dont expect a ford no more thai airways for me.    singapore to bangkok it is more the normal than the exception that you are forced to take an airport bus from the plane to the terminal. bangkok airport being thai airways home base you should expect that you would get premium service but not with thai airways. you may be packed in an old bus like cattle. there is no customer service. not worthy of star alliance. as this is a low cost quality.    bangkok to frankfurt. after take off a full dinner with electrical candles is served on this flight. breakfast served on this flight before landing in fra and you can choose your own breakfast in the evening. the seats for business class are very comfy since you get full leg room width which give you much more freedom in movement during sleep. the screen is huge approx. 17 inch. the remote control is a tough screen type. there are 2 type of seating at tg for the a380. the new one is slightly better with better remote control. some how the floor is very noisy during the night when staff are moving around. the amenity kit is okay. the headphone set for long haul is a noise cancelling type and is very good.    kuala lumpur to bangkok. overall service was not friendly. food average in business class. seat was not tidy and not clean. inflight entertainment was bad.    chiang mai to bangkok. worst airline with terrible customer service. this flight was purchased between 3.304.00pm for a 720 pm take off on the in the same date of flight the flight was delayed two times and thus caused me to miss my connecting flight on a different jet airways ticket to mumbai. at the first onset of delay i notified the flight crew that i had a connecting flight and they assured me there would be no problem due to this 20 minute delay and i would be able to make my flight. then there was a second delay and i got really nervous i again went to speak with the flight crew at the boarding gate and one lady reacted very poorly shouting and ranting to cancel my flight because i would not be able to make it this made me very nervous so i asked for the supervisor she said i may not be able to make the connection but she would notify jet airways and the ground crew. when we landed 45 minutes late no one was alerted to help.  the staff was completely unhelpful eventually the duty manager came and he said it was my fault that i didnt have enough time to make the connecting flight. jet airways said thai airways needed to send an email about the delay and the problem could have been resolved. it was a horrible experience.    bangkok to paris. we boarded over 4.30 hrs late with excuses but without the slightest snack. the staff smile can never make me forget this unpleasant adventure. clean comfortable seat thai food too spicy cannot eat also cannot change. its a pity for me never again thai airways.    brisbane to bangkok. thai airways is not a premium airline in my opinion. boarding was via bus at bangkok airpor. staff are very unfriendly and lazy. no thai smile on this flight.  food the worst i have had on any airline.    horrible cramped a380. not cleaned properly by heathrow staff video screens filthy and toilet used was dirty. food was average. cabin crew disinterested. return flight cancelled due to commercial reasons beyond our control  only advised when we arrived at the airport.    manila to bangkok. chaotic check in at terminal 1 very slow many queue jumpers  unclear which line to stand as internet etc lines etc. very few facilities in this old terminal  stumbled upon the manila club which is a pay to enter lounge. pp750 for drinks including alcohol and snack type food. free wifi. all in all a quiet oasis in a noisy uncomfortable terminal  recommend it. told to go to gate and had to queue for over 30 minutes. boarding was stop start. the ife wasnt working. the food was really spicy and i couldnt eat it. free wine and spirits. eventually arrived 30 minutes late into bangkok bused to the main terminal. at least there is a benefit to that as not far to walk to immigration. took advantage of the fast track service from bfs premium services.    singapore to bangkok. i find inconsistent level of service flying thai. my recent flight was an evening flight and i guess the crew were tired and no smile which was ok. however during meal service i requested the steward to ask the passenger in front of me to put his seat upright as it was impossible for me to dine properly. the light steward reply was you can ask him yourself.    tokyo narita to bangkok. a rude chief flight attendant on tg677. i am puzzled why thai airways have a habit of changing the aircraft closer to the flight date. this time the plane was downgraded from an a380 to a 747400.  we had the unpleasant experience with this rude  male chief flight attendant. our seats were 23ab so we left our handcarry items in the overhead compartment that was labelled as that. then rude attendant telling us that we should be putting our belongings in the next compartment instead. the funny thing is that this compartment was not even labelled and how will we know that this compartment was meant for us relocating our belongings was not an issue for us but the tone of this attendant was off putting.  i thought cabin crews are meant to assist passengers when needed very bad to see such individuals as it really destroyed the whole flight experience for us.    manila to phuket via bangkok.  ground staff were friendly in manila however when we are about to board they informed us that there will be a delay as they need they check the aircraft which is fine. they informed us it will only take 30 minutes. after that they let us board the plane the  fas some were friendly some are not. i have issues with my seat and i asked for the assistance however he shrugged and said and i will do it for you.  i thought we are about to take off however we are delayed again of another 30 minutes.. im so disappointed and i missed my connecting flight. good thing the ground staff in bangkok airport helped me to get another flight to phuket.    delhi to phuket via bangkok. as soon as i reached bangkok airport for changeover flight to phuket not a single staff was there to actually help me with the changeover or guide me regarding the next process which was visa on arrival as it was my first international trip these guys kept telling me you will get assistance on ground. though no one was present to guide. while returning back through the same airlines again i landed at the same airport for changeover. though ground staff was present this time but she guided me in the wrong direction which created unnecessary confusion. on raising this issue with thai airways he was so adamant and so rude that he said its ok since you were able to make it. what if i would have missed my flight because of their staff inefficiencies staff on the flight were rude just after one glass of whisky he ignored when asked to refil the glass. after more than 20 minutes on raising the issue to more than 3 staff the glass got refilled. one of the worst airlines i have traveled through in recent times. domestic airlines are far better in customer service than thai airways.    london heathrow to bangkok. on our flight last week there was a noisy crowd of men on the plane who were drinking and who the cabin crew had to ask to keep the noise down on a few occasions. the hostess looking after our section was probably one of the most miserable i have seen. never smiled was abrupt and generally had attitude if not really caring. not all of the crew were the same thank goodness. overall i was quite disappointed.'"
