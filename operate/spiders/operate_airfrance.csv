Boeing 777-300,Premium Economy,5,July 2018,4,1,2,no,Miami to Warsaw via Paris,2," |  We flew Air France from Miami to Warsaw connecting in Paris. Air France has only one round trip a day from Miami to Paris. I had been tracking the flights for three weeks before our departure date, on flightradar. Most of the time the incoming flight was late.  On July 11, 2018, I received a text message from Air France at approximately 10:30 AM stating that our fight would be delayed one hour, from 7:40 PM to 8:40 PM. The plane departed at 10 PM, two and twenty minutes late.  We arrived in Paris forty minutes before our connecting fight to Warsaw. The plane sat on the runway for approximately twenty minutes, because our gate was not available. I cannot understand why this flight could not have been assigned another gate. Most of the people around me missed their connecting flights, like me. We ran as fast as we could to the connecting flights gate. We arrived ten minutes before flight departure time, but the gate closes twenty minutes before departure. We went to customer service, with long lines and few people working behind the counter. The first connecting flight to Warsaw was filled. They put us on the second connection, approximately six hours later. Thirty minutes after getting my connecting flight changed, I received a text message that I missed my original connecting flight, brilliant. In my opinion Air France could care less about their Miami/Paris, one round trip a day. Their customer service needs a lot of improvement. This was my first and last time to fly Air France.

End of last week they cancelled my flight from London to Paris (CDG) which meant we arrived in Paris CDG at 22.05pm at night.

Because I had a connection in Bogota I took my time to ask the person in the counter if he could check if my bags where on board, I flew Business from Medellin in Avianca, and the AF person left me a couple of minutes waiting before boarding, I suppose checking if my bags were ok and he told me I was fine. The connection was like 1 hour and if my bags had priority on them I assume there would be no problem. When I got to Paris, as I already told, my bags didn't arrive and I went to the service counter of Air France to ask for help. The first response was go to the carousel again for 30 minutes more, I had waited like 45 minutes, that sometimes bagas appear. I did as I was told and then went back to file my missing baggage. This time they filed my request and told me they will contact me for future delivery because my bags hadn't reached Paris and they didn't know where they were. For the next 4 days I was not reached by Air France by email, phone or anything regarding my bags. I called them several times and the answers were: first we haven't located your bags and then the bags are in process of being delivered to you. Also I tried to check the status of my bags on their site, as I was told I could do, but the system never gave me accurate information. Finally the 12th my bags finally had arrived with no previous contact with me to arrange the delivery or even to let me know finally my bags were on Paris. Just a single paper saying 1 zip open on the small suitcase. When I checked my bags the smaller one had thelock broken. I filled the complain at AF following their procedures and until now more than 20 days later the only contact from AF has been  an automated e-mail. I just expect AF to compensate me for the basic things I had to buy. ",Couple Leisure,3,nan

As we arrived at CDG from MAD, I got the mail that the flight AF116 was canceled and the replacement was AF116A. We managed to find food in the very expensive CDG airport. After dinner, we went to the door only to find out they were giving out food vouchers, the found staff insisted they broadcasted it however we really didn't hear anything. Also, we saw many people getting their vouchers at the time, meaning that many people were not aware of the vouchers earlier. What i didn't like was the ground staff's attitude. After 2 hours, they said due to technical issues with the engine, they had to postpone another hour. 30 mins after it, they said again that the flight would be delayed from another hour. I respect the ground staff because I understood it was not their problem, but I believe AF already knew that they would be delaying the flight for anther 2 more hours but they were just reluctant to admit it. We arrived at PVG 4 hours later than scheduled. Not to mentioned the old and slow entertainment system on board and the not tasty at all food offered in the airplane.",Solo Leisure,5,nan

Boeing 777-200,Economy Class,4,July 2018,3,1,4,no,Paris CDG to Seattle,4," | Paris CDG to Seattle. Pre-flight experience was the worst I've ever had in 38 years of flying. I arrived 2.5 hours before departure. Air France employees detained me after I waited 30 minutes in the security clearance line up, and found my carry-ons to be 16kg instead of the max 12kg. The agents who nabbed me from the security line gruffly told me to go to ""#2"" in French. After some futile discussions, I realized they wanted me to go back to another terminal and line up with the folks checking in. I was aghast, as this line was extremely long (which is why I always check in ahead of time) and a bit of a walk. So I go back to this other monster line that a nearby agent informed me was the correct one. After waiting 45 min in this line, I was told I was in the wrong line, that I need to be in an adjacent line. So I line up for another 30 min, and when I get to the front the attendant wants 50 euro to check one bag. Which is fine, but her card reader was broken. So she tells me I need to go to another line to pay the bill, and takes my bag. I protest, saying I will miss the flight if I line up again. She eventually takes me by hand to cut in front of this other payment line in another terminal, then to the front of customs. I felt like a criminal because of their cheapo weight policies that even the worst American airlines haven't instated. Can't you just do this at the gate? So silly and ruined my flying experience with much unneeded stress.",Business,3,nan

On the plane, before the takeoff or taxing I was sitting and listening to music. The steward came up to me and asked showing him my phone to see if I had a plane mode on (which it was). When I refused showing him the phone , he grabbed the phone and checked the airplane mode. Both flights of mine (LAX to CDG and CDG to DUS) were delayed for over 1h. The seats were extremely uncomfortable. If the person in front wanted to extend the seat, you would have it on your lap (and I'm only 5'4) what makes working completely impossible. The entertainment was 3/4 in French. I understand it's a french airline but  not everybody speaks french or wants to have the subtitles taking half of the little screen.",Solo Leisure,1,nan

Two Air France aircrafts at the same gate (F29), one to Florence supposed to leave 30 mn before the Marseille one, leaving therefore 10 mn to board to the second one. Unfortunately first boarding was delayed (due to staff at gate, a staff much more interested in preventing big cabin luggage than to speed up boarding process). Therefore stress started to grow between passengers of the second flight. It seems that staff at gate was unprepared, even after the obvious delays. They remained smiling, behind their desk, not helping the lady to security check. On board nothing important. Pilot succeeded is reducing delay on arrival.",Solo Leisure,3,nan

At Cairo airport , the scheduled flight was boarded to depart 40 minutes past midnight. After sitting on the plane for approx. 90 minutes, announcement was made to disembark (I would add the flight had already pulled away from the gate and then returned). Anyone who has ever been to Cairo airport knows that communication is not easy in the best circumstances and no fluent English speaking staff were available. Okay, move on through security and airport terminals to locate Air France / KLM ticketing to receive new flight details and if necessary hotel accommodation. During almost 8 hours in a queue to achieve this, passengers were not given any refreshments. There was nowhere to buy anything, not even a machine. All passengers were told not to leave the queue and the reason it took nearly 8 hours for me and my travelling companion to be rerouted was because on average it took 15 minutes for every passenger to receive new tickets and where necessary a voucher. This was a debacle, no order, people pushing in airline staff running around doing nothing to help passengers but much shouting in Arabic. Naturally the connecting flight had to be rescheduled. After 10 or so hours we reached a nearby hotel and were at last able to get something to eat and a much needed sleep. ",Family Leisure,3,nan

This last time made me take the decision to no longer fly with them. After leaving more than 1h late from PTP we arrived in Paris when my connecting flight to Marseille already left. When I talk to the assistance (very rude) they made me feel like it was my fault if I missed the next flight and that they were making me a favor to put me on another flight - 5 hours later! Knowing that there was space on a flight earlier than that. When I asked for it, they told me ""not possible""! They prioritised other passengers from another airline (which was also late). No food/beverages vouchers offered. The flight back was ok, but flight attendants were talking in front of passengers in a very casual way.

When I replied that I had been advised to reticket here by Air France at Orly, I was asked contemptuously 'Well what do you think my job would be if I we reissued tickets here? I'd have a line of people and nothing else to do all day'. Air France poor culture of customer service never ceases to amaze me.

Once in the plane there was a guy next to me taking up half my chair and half on the other side, cos of his huge size. After 12 painful hours I arrived in Bangkok. But my suitcase did not. It should have arrived today, but now they say it will probably be tomorrow. My holiday is on a hold right now because everything I need is in my suitcase, also this forces me to buy clothes and other things I need in daily life. There was no choice in meals.

Outbound flight was a Boeing 787 so boarding took some time. Onboard seat comfort was very good as was legroom. This aircraft operates as a long haul product and I would have no issues in recommending it for a flight of this duration. Once at Paris deplaning took some time but otherwise fine. Return flight was on an A318. Online checkin again so very simple and straight forward. Not an AF issue but worthy of a mention is the lack of restaurants in CDG terminal 2E so something to bear in mind. Return flight left on time and again the seat was very comfortable and an enjoyable experience. Both flights offered a drink and quick snack which was great.

Boeing 787-9,Premium Economy,5,September 2017,nan,1,nan,no,Amsterdam to Cairo via Paris,3," |  Amsterdam to Caïro via Paris. The first KLM flight was delayed by over 45 minutes due to two passengers deciding not to fly and their luggage had to be off loaded, but they apparently they couldn’t find any free baggage handlers to come and do that, Captains words. Eventually it was done, But we had a very tight connection for our Air France flight in Paris to Cairo. When we arrived in Cairo it was without our luggage as they had no time to transfer it. We were told It couldn’t be sent till 24 hours later on the next flight to Cairo, but that next day we were flying to Luxor to join a Nile cruise so it was going to take a further 24 hours to get to luxor and two more days to get it on board the boat so for four of our seven day holiday we had no baggage. A week on and we are seated on board our late night flight after a long day for our departure from Cairo, we boarded AF flight at 11.50pm and sat on the plane were eventually told there was a technical issue and waited for 40 mins. The plan then pulled away from the gate stopped and then returned to the gate, after 1am we were told by the captain that the co pilot was sick and the flight was being cancelled and we had to disembark and this is where Air France Failed terribly. Things happen, However in this case, the airline still has a duty of care to passengers, Air France had no staff of their own and the debacle begins. We disembark and are told we have to go to baggage collection downstairs and retrieve our luggage. Once there after 30 minutes we were told we wouldn’t be able to retrieve our luggage till after exit visas has been cancelled and to do this we all had to go back to the boarding gate. Being so early the escalators had been shut down but after we climbed the stairs we had to sit with allot of screaming and shouting passengers whilst they found the one customs guy to cancel our exit visas One guy for over 300 passengers, he assisted many Egyptians first and those who screamed got priority and after an hour or more he penned an x across the exit visa, which I could have done myself. So back to luggage collection past 2 in the morning and told we had to go to another terminal with luggage where the Air France counter was and were told to wait in a line in front of the airfrance counter to be re-ticketed. We stood for over 6 hours till 08.10am To finally get a result. But after spending 8 hours over night, with no sleep awake for over 24hrs, standing in line with no food or drink, no opportunity to buy any, no water being offered by ground staff, I feel the duty of care Failed.

The seats looked far more comfortable than they were. There was very little incline on the seats, however, the bottom of the seat moved forward a few inches. There was a foot rest on the seat and on the seat in front, which helped, but the seat is not well padded nor is there enough of an incline to allow for rest. The cabin crew was indifferent and not attentive. The big surprise was the food. I didn't make the trip for the meal, however, this was by far the worst airline food I have had.

Good legroom, friendly staff and good service for this short haul flight. Because it was busy in Amsterdam, flight left too late, but arrived on time. So overall good experience. Arrived in Paris at time. Unfortunately the time at the border control took very long (approx. 1 hour) so I've made it just in time to the connection flight. Second part CDG-LIM won Air France 777-300. Old plane, and so was the IFE. Seats were cramped and legroom was so so. Seat had an USB port. It was a daytime flight of 12,5 hours. After departure (which was on time) the served already the lunch. You couldn't make a choice, and there was no drink service before or a towel. After the lunch was been served we didn't see the crew anymore. If you needed a drink, you had to go the galley by yourself. There were limited snack (little ice creams and small sandwiches). An hour before arrival we got a snack (orange juice, small piece of bread and a cake). It was not much. The food tasted good. Overall I thought that the service was limited (especially if you compare it with other airlines or with partner KLM). You pay a lot of money, and therefore you don't get much service. The same features with the IFE, which had limited options and didn't work properly. So I'm not impressed with the services provided by Air France. Third part was back from LIM-CDG with AF 777-300. This plane was slightly newer, and the legroom felt better, and so were the seats. IFE was still old. This was a night flight. Service started just after departure (same as on the way to LIM only one meal option). The service on this flight was limited too. On a night flight I don't care about that, but in the night your neighbour sometimes want to pass because they wanted some water (they dont walk by once a hour). So that annoyed me. I've slept the most of the flight, despite that my neighbour wanted to pass two times. Second (breakfast) meal was not much, so also here was the service under par. Last part of the journey was CDG-AMS with AF A320. Legroom was ok, seats were good. Service was fine for this short haul flight (sandwich and drinks). I wouldn't recommend flying with AF based on my experiences. You pay a lot money for the ticket, service was limited and the quantity of the food was below par. Furthermore the IFE was old and didn't work properly. The seats are cramped and the legroom was so so. I like to fly with KLM (friendly crew and enough service), but AF is not comparable. So if I book with KLM, I check first if the flight is with them or with AF.",Solo Leisure,2,nan

Firstly I had troubles with the booking as Air France is using a system where ""Young"" (18-24) and ""Adults"" (25+) are separated. Initially I booked an adult ticket as it was not as expensive as a ticket for young adults. I searched the logic behind this and still haven't found yet - whatever, I called the customer service to help me book this ticket and I was charged 10€ for a reason that I still don't understand. During the journey, it was quite frustrating to see that Air France does not have a small Amenity kit for economy passengers. Once arrived on San Francisco I found out that my baggage was still in Paris. 48hrs after I made the reclamation, I still don't have the missing baggage and the customer service isn't answering yet. Still not have a commercial gesture but fighting for it.

On-line check-in was a bit of a problem so I contacted AF via Facebook, explaining the problem. They acknowledged my message almost immediately; four hours later texted me that the issue was resolved and they had proactively checked me in. Boarding in Paris I was met with sincere smiles from all the cabin crew. Interactions were light-hearted and good humored, and cabin service was at all times professional and upbeat with an obvious desire to satisfy passengers. Crew never seemed rushed and routinely chatted with passengers. I am fortunate to be Elite Plus with SkyTeam, and was seated at the end of the cabin. As meal carts were rolled out, one flight attendant came to me and asked my dinner choice to ensure I got it. This simple and thoughtful gesture was significant because it showed attention to detail and a desire to serve. I don't like the 2x2x2 seating; video library is awkward, and food is unappealing but the empathetic service made for a wonderful flight.",Solo Leisure,5,nan

Delayed by over 5 hours on BOG-CDG due to 2 damaged tyres when we were about to take off. Was supposed to be repaired in 60-90 mins according to captain but took close to 5 hours. Luckily I slept through most of it. A340 was old, smelly and dirty with a pathetic IFE (think old LCD screen a few inches wide) so I did not even consult. At least A340 seats are more comfortable and wider than slimline seats on newer planes. Toilets were dirty. Food was poor, saved by offer of champagne and spirits etc. Announcements in English very poor, hard to understand. This is very much a DIY airline, take your chances. Upon arriving in Paris, no assistance for onward flight despite 6 hour delay on what is already long trip. However, miseries were not over, since, due to an unexplainable problem, the CDG-EDI leg was also delayed by 1 hour! Incredibly poor management and customer experience.

Defeats the purpose of paying more for business class and having priority boarding. Lounge in terminal 2E was horrible. Hardly anything substantial to eat, not even bits of sandwiches!

CDG-BKK boarding a bit chaotic because there was no priority boarding for those passengers who sat at aft zone of aircraft and everyone wanted to board the aircraft accordingly. Therefore the aircraft gangway were blocked by passengers who seated at the front zone putting their handbags into the overhead bins. Cabin-Crews were aged but very friendly and professional, helping passenger putting their handbags into the bins to avoid the traffic jam at gangway. Flight full on Boeing 777-300 with cramped 10seats / row therefore nothing to say about the seat comfort except the small footrest. AF is one of the few airlines which provides the seat footrest for Y passengers. Flight 30 minutes delay (due to chaotic boarding?) After taken off a hot towel was given followed by beverage service with nuts. 1 hour later hot tasty dinner was served with red wine in mini bottle and other good selection of drinks. After dinner most of FAs were gone and only one FA was on duty at each galley but self-service bar with soft drinks and ice cube was open throughout the flight. Excellent IFE with wide selection of music and movies in a variety of languages but limited new movies were available. During the rest time ice cream was served by the 2 FAs who were on duty. 2 hours before landing hot towel is given and hot tasty breakfast (with no choice) was served. All in all a good experience and great value for money. I can confirm that AF is a 4 stars airline and one of European best airline in Y Class. l will definitively fly with AF again",Couple Leisure,5,nan

The plane took off and I had started to sleep, however the staff started changing peoples seats, upgrading other passengers and re-allocating people.

Upon check-in I was informed I had been ‘downgraded’ to premium economy. When I enquired as to why, I was told the airline had overbooked and that I was not the only business class passenger who had been downgraded. The seat I was assigned in premium economy was the very last middle row with 4 seats and there was a partition behind separating it from economy so the seats do not recline. The entertainment screen did not work and although I had to advise a male flight attendant of the problem, it was not resolved until a few hours later after having to ask again. The headrests are convex so the neck is thrust forward. This is a very cramped premium economy class cabin and I’m an average sized person. There is a token leg rest bout the incline is minimal. The washrooms were in economy. At least the seats recline in economy. The fact of the matter is I paid for a business class ticket and was downgraded with no advance warning. I’d been traveling 12 hours prior to this flight. Shocking standard of service and I will not use this airline again.",Business,1,nan

It took more than 25 minutes from parking to getting into the bus, which led to missing my connecting flight to Montpellier. I had to change airports (from CDG to ORY) and arrived at MPL at 1745 (instead of 1405). I claimed for compensation and received an email FROM AF that they acknowledged my claim and that they would transfer a total of 271 Euro (250 + 21 for the transfer CDG-ORY which I had to pay). Three days later another email arrived, saying that Air France made a mistake, that they were not responsible for the delay of the passenger staircase and that they would not pay the compensation or the 21 Euros for the bus to Orly. They claim that a missing staircase is an unavoidable circumstance for them, which is ridiculous, as ground handling (including the provision of the staircase) is the responsibility of the airline.

Prior to the departure date I tried to book additional luggage online with Air France for 80 euros unaware that I was actually to fly with Etihad Airways. I was unable to book online for additional luggage and so called Air France. I was informed by Air France that although I wasn't able to book additional luggage online that they would put a note on my ticket for me to pay only 80 euros for the additional luggage when checking in at the airport. With this information I felt no need to investigate further. Upon arriving at the Charles de Gaulle airport to check in I was informed by Etihad Airways that I needed to pay 321.17 euros for the additional luggage! They informed me that there was no note on the ticket. When asking Air France at the airport to assist me with this they informed me that the only note on the ticket was that I had attempted to book additional luggage online, nothing about having to only pay 80 euros. Air France said they could do nothing about this situation and I had to pay the fee Etihad was demanding of me. Since I wanted to bring my belongings home and time was ticking I felt I had no option but to pay the amount demanded of me by Etihad Airways. Upon arriving in Australia I contacted Air France to request compensation for the additional amount I was asked to pay over the 80 euros. I informed them that had I known I would have had to pay such a high rate for the additional luggage with Etihad Airways I would have sought other cheaper methods to get my belongings home. Air France refused to give me the amount of 241.17 euros that I requested and said that I ought to ask Etihad Airways.

nan,Economy Class,5,December 2017,nan,1,nan,no,Nice to Paris,1," |  Nice to Paris. One person in our group was travelling with her Brazilian passport with her maiden name and her American Green Card with her name after she got married. Both Brazil and USA say that you don’t need a new passport or visa if you get married before they get expired. So, because of the frequent traveler programs etc (and because it is her name nowadays), her air ticket was showing her new name. We traveled from Paris to Malaga and from Madrid to Nice with those documents without any problem.  The lady in the Air France check in said that she couldn’t allow her to check in because the name in the passport was not the name in the ticket. After we insisted for a while, she decided to check.  She walked very slow and she left behind a line that was growing and growing. After many minutes, she came back and said that the supervisor was coming and asked us to wait in the side. It was 4 minutes before the closing time for our flight. The supervisor came 15 minute later. She was not told about the green card.  Of course we were right, so she decided to allow us to embark and call the airplane telling them to wait for us. At the security point, they didn’t allow us to go through as the boarding time was gone. We stayed until they told us that the plane was gone and that they were going to place us in the next flight. The next flight was at 8:25pm. They sent us to the VIP lounge as a way to apologize. I couldn’t help to think how a bad employee that is not interest in doing a good job can cause damage to a company. But it was only the beginning. The plane was not ok to flight. They were waiting for another plane to arrive from Lyon to accommodate all the passengers. Because we were travelling La Premiere, they relocate us to a flight to Orly. Many people would like to have been relocated as we were. But because of the lady that didn’t allow us to check out in the earlier flight, we were occupying the spots that could have been assigned to another passengers. We arrived at Paris. Our luggage arrived as well, but of course the girls’ strollers didn’t. Besides, we had to take a van to Sheraton Hotel at Charles de Gaulle that costs us 120 euros. We were supposed to be at CDG at 7:40pm. We arrived after midnight. The kids were tired. We had no strollers that until now were not find. And we were told that the strollers will be send to our home in California. If we don’t get them in 45 days, we can present an invoice and get a refund. What am I supposed to do without the strollers for more than a month? I’m not sure if I will ever travel Air France again. ",Family Leisure,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,November 2017,3,1,1,no,Bogota to Rome via Paris,3," | Bogota to Rome via Paris. It's one of the worst airlines considering how much they charge. First problem: I wanted to upgrade (by paying the difference onboard ) I was told it's not possible. There were plenty of empty seats both in premium economy and in business. So why was I told I couldn't buy an upgrade? Second and most important issue: flight arrived a little late (5 minutes delay) but missed my connection to another flight with Air France. The terminal where I arrived was really far, had to go through security and immigration and yet when still on the flight the screen showed the connection. All I know is that it took forever to arrive to next flight and gate was closed. So off you go to the transit desk to get another flight. The attitude and the rolling of eyes is extremely annoying and to make it worse I'm told I missed the flight. After a lot of arguing there are no flights (in any class, can you believe it? Well I don't) so I'm given a room in a hotel inside the airport. The airport hotel is called Yotel and the rooms without windows are like 2 meters by 1.5. Basically smaller than a box.

nan,Economy Class,3,December 2016,3,1,nan,no,Vienna to London Heathrow via Paris CDG,4," | Vienna - Paris CDG - London Heathrow in Economy almost a year ago. Booked the flight directly with AF/KLM on their website. VIE-CDG was actually a codeshare flight operated by OS. Not a routing I would have normally booked, but affordable options were limited due to a late booking and a long weekend in Austria. The flight from VIE arrived in CDG 15 mins delayed due to an ATC slot, which should not have been an issue, but it was. We had a scheduled transfer time of 1 hour, which was now reduced to 45 minutes. CDG is a disaster and even the scheduled transfer time of one hour would have been not enough to be at the gate before the official flight closing time. Long lines at passport control with no special lines for EU-passports and no short connection lines. Also, nobody there from the airline or the airport to assist with short connections. Then a bus transfer between the terminals that seemed to circle the whole airport with multiple stops and which took almost 30 minutes. CDG has to be the worst organized airport in Europe. When we arrived at the gate (the very last at the end of the terminal) just before the indicated departure time, the gate was still green as open. When the gate agent saw us coming she welcomed us by saying she knows that the flight from VIE was delayed, but the gate is now closed. The flight was probably oversold so she quickly closed the gate. When checking in in VIE for this flight we were informed the flight was completely full and only two last middle seats at the back of the plane were available (sounded a lot like oversold to me). AF then rebooked us to another AF flight leaving 6 hours later. When looking for earlier alternative we were informed the next AF flight was booked solid, so no chance (not good but understandable). When we asked to be put on an earlier BA flight that had availability (as stipulated by EU Law), we were told “that’s not AF policy”. When asked why no transfer support was available given the delay and short connection time, we were told “that’s not AF policy”. When asked why they did not hold the plane a couple of minutes as we were at the gate before the departure time and they knew that a 6 hour wait was the consequence, we were told “that’s not AF policy”. We were then issued a meal voucher, but we had to wait for hour at the counter till AF got the approval from OS Otherwise AF would not issue it. Because, we were again told it is not AF policy to take responsibility whatsoever for a codeshare flight. Ridiculous and insulting! AF’s policy basically seems to be to do the utmost to inconvenience its passengers. The flight to LHR itself was actually okay, as the plane was almost empty and lots of seats unoccupied. Service was average for Y. But given the whole transfer experience and attitude with AF at CDG I will do whatever it takes not to board another AF plane. I have been happily avoiding AF for the last ten years because of previous bad experiences, and I will happily continue to do so.",Couple Leisure,2,nan

Agent at security told me that I had to check in my walking cane. Making my walking difficult. Despite having reserved and verified a wheel chair, that information was lost.

I did inform the cabin crew that I had an AF transfer to Singapore, they said that operations were informed and there would be no problem. I rushed to gate K30, and I arrived at 20.30 approximately. So 20 minutes before departure. I was told that I was too late. I said that I was in time, that the AF plane from Madrid was late, that they knew about it, that the plane was still at the boarding gate. The only reply I got was that there were procedures. This of course is totally unacceptable. Why an AF plane cannot wait 10 minutes a passenger who is slightly late because the incoming flight, also from AF, is slightly late? With already a boarding pass. Is this an AF procedure? To disregard information showing that a passenger will be slightly delayed due to well documented late arrival? I took the same flight the following day and the last passenger boarded after 20.45. Did the procedures change? I also just want to mention that I was offered a night in a hotel of medium category in a totally lost area. No compensation whatsoever was offered. I of course had no clothing to change and also not any warm cloth. I also had no opportunity to buy it. Even if this is not a reason for a different treatment, I will mention that I was travelling business class and that I am a gold frequent flyer with AF.

I arrived at the airport well in advance, and since I only had cabin baggage I could proceed directly to security, which is a big advantage at Ben Gurion where there is often a long line at check in. I had tried to order a gluten free meal for the flight, but I realized I could not do that since the meal at the first flight was considered breakfast, where there is no option of gluten free, and on the second flight they only serve what they call a ""snack""; so there is no option there either. So there goes one of the reasons not to choose a low cost carrier instead. Buying a cheap ticket at Air France you don't get any check in luggage anyway, so the difference compared to low cost airlines is minimal. Well, you get some kind of meal, if you manage to eat it, and some coffee for free. But the worst part is the seating comfort. I have recently flown with low cost carriers like Ryanair and Norwegian, and both of these have had more leg room than Air France. I am not very tall, so if you are a bit taller than 1.90 m you will probably have to pay extra to get a better seat at this airline. They also make people pay in order not to have to choose between the last available seats 30 hours before departure. The airplane was decent enough, but since most passengers don't want to pay extra for baggage there was lots and lots of cabin luggage, and the staff were a bit too aggressive when trying to stow it away. Also one of the toilets on one of the flights did not have tap water. It would have been better if that was marked on the door. So I am sorry to say that Air France tends to get worse and worse for every time. The only reason to choose Air France is if you can manage to get enough time in Paris to go into town. Otherwise you can just as well choose Ryanair.",Solo Leisure,3,nan

Boarding was efficient and fairly prompt and we got away on schedule. After take off, a drinks service was completed, followed by dinner and then one more drinks run. I was sat at seat 40a (changed my seats at check in, I prefer a window seat). Cabin crew were nice enough (could have done with another drinks run) and the cabin was super clean. The seat was AWFULLY uncomfortable, there's something about the way it's positioned, one can't quite get ones legs straight out under the seat in front. This makes for all sorts of contorted positions throughout the flight and a charming game of leg olympics with the strange man seated in the seat next door. Connection in Paris was quick and well done, flight from Paris to LAX was torture. (Probably more down to the flight before). Service was arguably better on this flight though, and the crew - WAY friendlier. It took ages to get luggage at LAX though. All in, everything was ok.

I assumed they were enjoying what they were doing and enjoyed treating the passengers as customers. On the return two days later it was the same. There was no problem with the guitar - another happy team worked the cabin of a completely full A320 which was comfortable, and a decent amount of space between seats. Again a snack and drinks were served and the flight was very smooth in appalling weather.  I didn't realise it was still possible to enjoy flying, so thanks Air France for your professionalism and good humour, and look forward to flying with you again.",Family Leisure,5,nan

We were told that we were going to be bussed to an airport hotel because of the storm. They sent us to a hotel at Disney more than 45 kilometers from the airport. They provided no transportation back to the airport which ended up being very expensive. My baggage was lost. Customer service was terrible throughout. Not an ounce of compassion or even a hint of an apology. Just poor and arrogant customer service.,Business,1,1
Boeing 777-200,Economy Class,5,December 2017,5,4,4,yes,Buenos Aires to Paris ,4, | Flew Air France from Buenos Aires to Paris. Very nice flight. Travelling long haul with my 2 year old daughter alone for the first time. I got the flight with airmiles from the Brazilian airline GOL for a very good price especially considering it was the week of Christmas. I was able to use the Aerolineas Argentinas lounge at EZE which was well equipped. Boarding was efficient and having taken our seats the purser came up to introduce himself to me (I am Flying Blue Platinum) which I thought was a nice touch. Food was very nice and my daughters child meal was exceptional. Seats were for economy as good as can be with sufficient leg room for me (I am 6 feet 2). Flight was punctual. Horrendous turbulence which caused distress to some passengers which was very professionally dealt with by the crew. Recently moved to Skyteam from One World and each time I fly with Air France / KLM / Alitalia / Delta I become increasingly pleased that I did. Thanks Air France for making my Christmas happy!,Family Leisure,5,nan

A Business Class flight attendant came with a wet towel and cleaned. Despite the on board experience was very good from that point on Air France ruined my short stay in Sao Paulo delaying one of my bags. We checked in 2 hours before departure, the bag was marked Priority Elite etc. Upon arrival at Sao Paulo poor attitude, thinking that offering $100 refund for purchases of clothing resolves the problem.

La Reunion had been under a tropical hurricane for the last few days and we didn't know if we would be available to go back to Paris. Eventually, all went well and the weather seemed to calm down just for me to go back home. I had quite an argue with the airport security staff because I had left my Swiss knife in my cabin bag. It's wrong, I get it, and it's my fault. But I made her notice that I traveled from ORY to RUN with it in my cabin bag too with no problem (maybe the Orly airport staff should review their screening training). Anyway, confronted to this problem, I went back to the Air France check-in and the staff was very helpful in providing me another bag to check-in with my knife in it. I was finally able to pass security and reached out for the Skyteam Lounge. It was a bit busy but big enough for everyone (although, too many kids for me). Food was good, I had several delicious samosas while waiting for the flight and a nice red wine. There also was plenty of plugs for my devices. Heading to the airplane, someone misled me to the Economy class in the skybridge without checking my ticket (I guess men in their twenties are not the usual Business traveler). The woman who had helped me checking my second bag was passing by and recognized me. She led me to the correct door and was very nice and helpful. This flight was full of kids again. My flight attendant was nicer than the one on the first trip. He was caring and smiling. He helped me clean a stain on my shirt due to this delicious vinaigrette salad sauce. The flight was very bumpy and the old Business seat did not allow me to get to proper sleep this time. I still was able to rest in good conditions in any case. The breakfast served was very good and croissants seemed to be fresh. All went very well until Paris ORY.",Solo Leisure,3,nan

nan,Business Class,4,January 2018,5,5,3,yes,Paris to Reunion,3," |  Paris to Reunion. This was a last minute leisure trip so I paid quite a high amount of money (3,800€ round trip), compared to other AF Business seats, to go to La Reunion. I am not a big fan of Orly airport but SkyPriority worked very well until the Skyteam Lounge. Although quite small, it was very cosy with a bay window over the check-in hall. Food and beverages were not fantastic but enough to wait quietly for my flight which was 20mn late (not Air France fault though). Onboard, I experienced the old Business Class seat which I already knew when I booked (the Best&Beyond is rare if simply not existent for the French abroad territories). It still a bit baffling. Business class was full this day (14 seats) and, since it's a family destination, full of kids, at least half the cabin. I honestly think kids should not be allowed in Business but those ones were calm during the entire flight so I cannot complain. The flight attendant was nice and caring but nothing extraordinary. She promptly brought our nice dishes. I had pre-ordered a meal and everything was good in this area. Concerning the IFE, I was honestly surprised by the low quantity of movies available but it didn't really matter for me, since I soon went to sleep on this 11h flight. Everything went well upon arrival and even though it was a bumpy flight on an old slippery seat (because of the inclination), I was quite fresh and ready to enjoy my vacation.",Solo Leisure,4,nan

Economy seat are quite comfortable and the inflight entertainment is pretty good. An hour after take off lunch was served, food was good and more bread was offered during the service. Another lighter meal was served before landing in Vancouver. There was also a bar setup at the back of the aircraft with some snacks where passengers could help themselves in case they were hungry during this long flight. I travel very often and I have to say Air France is doing very well compared to other European airlines. Totally recommend flying Air France.",Solo Leisure,5,nan

There was a problem with the galley kitchen and only one stove was working so my wife's dinner took 3 hours. She waited an hour for her main course and the selection she chose was unavailable.

I was concerned as according to schedule I only had one hour and five minutes to catch my connecting flight to Dublin. However the flight actually arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule and I even had time to visit the Air France lounge in CDG. It was a pleasant surprise that the chief steward addressed me by name! The service was impeccable and a small collation offered. The cabin crew handled the situation extremely well when people were getting on board with more hand luggage and stuff than they should. Surely management could address this? The crew already have a difficult job without having to deal with passengers who whinge when there is no place in the cabin for their stuff!,Business,4,nan
A320,Economy Class,5,March 2018,4,5,nan,yes,Geneva and Paris CDG,4," | This short flight was the first shuttle of the day between Geneva and Paris, no need to say that it was full. However, the staff well managed everyone to enter the plane on time. The only thing is that everyone kept their luggage to save time and, since there was no room anymore in the plane for additional luggage, many had to put their luggage back into the trunk. I guess Air France should advise passengers that, when the plane is full, it is better to register your bag. With so many passengers willing to save time and limited space, we ended up leaving the airport 20mn late because of those passengers. For the rest, it was very early and I felt asleep for the first 30mn. It was a really nice surprise to find a pain au chocolat waiting for me on my tablet. Usually, flight attendants do not serve you while you are asleep, especially in Economy class. I was very thankful the AF FA did it for me. Upon arrival, our luggage were delivered super fast and I was able to go to work in Paris as a usual commuter. Thank you Air France.",Solo Leisure,5,nan

In the end, when I started complaining, they all answered “I don’t care I don’t work for Air France” indeed they were representative hired by Air France but none of their staff were actually present. In the end, after 2 hours of battle, they changed my flight for the next, 9 hours later, refusing all assistance such as hotel assistance, meal etc. The problem, if there is an issue with your flight (even if they are the cause of the issue) you are on your own, they won’t provide any assistance.

All the passengers were in the aircraft waiting for it's aircraft. Due to delay in flight in Chicago my connecting flight in Paris to BOM. Air france arranged us in other flight from Paris to Hong Kong and then to BOM. I had to wait for 12 hours in Paris airport as the airline did not give any accommodation and gave 11 Euros voucher that can be used only 1 time. That voucher only got us coffee and sandwich and we were at airport for 12 hours. Due to this delay I reached 24 hours later than the original time at the destination. My Baggage got lost and I received it only after 2 days. When I called Air France for compensation for the seat I reserved they said the flight was delayed due to bad weather and there is nothing they can do about it, they just gave me a $50 gift voucher, my seat purchase was itself of around $75.

Boeing 777-300ER,Business Class,5,February 2018,4,5,4,yes,Dubai to Southampton via Paris CDG,3," | Dubai to Southampton via Paris CDG with Air France and FlyBe (codeshare). Efficient check in at DXB and lounge in Dubai is the Skyteam lounge. The lounge seemed fine, efficient staff, modern look and clean. Snacks looked fine (though I did not try them) and reasonable drinks selection. Boarding on time, clean aircraft and good business seats. I chose Air France over BA on this route to try out an alternative. I have now flown a few times with Air France and rate them highly. However, on this middle east red eye flight, I feel that BA sleeper seats are better than those of AF. The service from the Air France staff was excellent though. Snack served after take off which was fine, breakfast was OK, BA serves better juices and coffee in my view, but the food component was good. Landed on time in CDG (layover of 11 hours). The FlyBe flight to Southampton was fine, friendly staff. All in all a good flight. What is not clear though and this was also true of AF ground staff is where these flights are sold as Air France flights on a business class ticket (and priced as such ), and then the short hop to UK is with FlyBe (which lacks a business cabin), we should still get access to the lounges of Air France (relevant if you have a long layover). In fairness to Air France, I had asked them about this in advance (told we would have access) and then when I turned up with my children today, the agent said, technically we did not have access. However, she used her discretion and let us in as we had flown from Dubai with them. Whilst I do not know what is right or wrong, its gestures like that which make me really like Air France.

After racing from one end of the CDG terminal to the other, with no help or direction from Air France staff, I made the connecting flight at the last moment. How on earth someone elderly or infirm would manage this?? The seat & tray table area was dirty - crumbs and food present. One toilet for an entire aircraft over 4 hours.  My bags didnt make it to London, and were delivered late the next evening. However, the food was reasonable and the cabin crew were polite. The price was good.

Pre-boarding was a pain due to extremely long ""sky priority"" waiting line, which was extended due to the delay. Service from the predominantly French-speaking crew was excellent: friendly and efficient. Quiet, with few announcements, a great contrast to many US carriers with their incessant chatter. Seating in business (I was in second business cabin) is I believe called herringbone pattern - I had selected the single row along the right side of the plane, 19L. Roomy, nice niche for headphones, ipad, etc. as well as room for a personal item on the footrest. Electric outlet at seat, personal lighting handy and next to niche. Lie-flat seat. Soft quilt and pillow. I had a little trouble getting the seat back up to full upright but minor. Amenities kit a two-parter: shoe bag, slippers, and socks on arrival, cosmetics bag with toothbrush, paste, eyeshades, earplugs, headphones cover, comb, creams after seating. Plenty of warm washcloths to clean up. Champagne or OJ to start, meal service with appetizer, main course, cheese course, sweets from the cart. All excellent, though they had run out of the spring veg risotto and could use more veg options. Snacks and other meals well spaced. Overall a very pleasant flight!

Departure more than hour late from Brussels.  Delay that ended at the stopover at Charles de Gaulle which left only 40 minutes for changing terminal, saving my golf bag that Air France did not want to take from Brussels because luggage out of dimension. At Charles de Gaulle, the operator, following a telephone call that she gave in our presense, was assured that the golf bag would be on our plane (AF90) despite our late arrival at our stop over joining the M50 boarding gate with shuttle to Terminal M and run to the end of the 300 m long hall where M50 gate is located without any help with electric car. After landing in Miami, waiting 45 minutes in the plane before a door could receive the passengers. After the customs formalities, waiting for the arrival of my golf bag. After +/- 45 minutes we were told that my golf bag was not on the plane (like 65 other luggages). Air France Miami assured me that my luggage would arrive the next day (Friday March 2). From there, it was only disappointment on disappointment because the luggage was not there the next day nor the day after. After multiple complaints, phone calls from us, it became apparent that the situation on the Air France’side was no longer under control since a mundial  research had been launched. As a result, I bought what I needed to be able to practice the sport for which we are in Miami. Air France had assured me, in a mail, that the Company would refund me on the basis of the supporting documents. I sent the vouchers. After 6 days, the luggage was found and now, the Company tells me that they will refund only 20,7% of my expenses.

We were one couple who suffered this fate. The flight from CDG managed to lose the baggage of at least 10 others. After 12 messages via social media we finally had a reply - we were even promised an upgrade for our return journey home - the bags finally arrived at our resorts 4 days after us.

I gave them my bag, they returned it damaged beyond repair, but they won’t compensate me. I really am a bit grumpy. The amazing thing here is that AF are telling me that I should have submitted a damage report when I collected the bag at Vienna Airport. Well guess what? The bag wasn’t delivered to Vienna because they lost it as well! When AF found the lost bag and delivered it to me a day or two later, damaged (beyond repair), I was three hour’s drive from the airport, up in the Austrian Alps, nowhere near a luggage damage report counter. So I could not provide the report they have requested. I did provide AF with a photo of the damaged bag, an email from a repairer stating that the bag is damaged beyond repair, and details of a very modestly priced, suitable replacement bag. AF’s email to me states: “Having reinvestigated your claim, I am afraid we cannot constructively add to our previous correspondence.” “Please be assured that we will never deny compensation to a passenger in situations where it's awarding is applicable.” Rubbish. It appears to me that the standard AF response to luggage damage claims is to deny them without even looking at the facts.",Family Leisure,1,nan

My outbound trip was in economy class, and the return was in Premium Economy, this upgrade cost just $300, but I don't think I would pay much more for Premium Economy on Air France as the difference between the two classes was negligible. All flights departed on time, and the service was generally fine - polite, friendly, but perfunctory. Once the meals have been served, the crew disappear and you seldom see them. At least snacks and drinks are left out in the galley for self-service. IFE was good - an interesting selection of movies, including some new releases. I found the Premium Economy seats uncomfortable - in fact, I think I prefer Economy seats because you could actually recline them; the Premium seats only slid forward, and I found them very uncomfortable for sleeping, however the legroom was better than Economy. I really dislike the wastage of Air France - with exception of the meal tray, nothing is reused - all dishes, containers and utensils are disposable, and so the staff come around at the end of the meal and chuck everything in the bin.

As soon as you board, we were welcomed by the senior stewardess, with a choice of champagne, orange juice or water. The plane left on time. Food was quite good even if the chicken was over cooked and dry. One thing which is weird, they serve the cheese at the same time the appetizer. Very good entertainment system. Good choice of movies.

The kiosks could not print out a boarding pass nor could Delta in Minneapolis. It is amazing at JFK no one can help before 1PM. I landed in Paris before 6 am. They did not have enough time to put two pieces of my luggage on the plane before it took off at 10:30 AM. Boarding time was supposed to be 9:15 am.  They started to board at 9:40 am for a 9:50 departure. No reason for the delay other than no speed. They missed their window for departure so the airport delayed the flight another 30 minutes. When I got to Kiev only one box arrived. No second box or my suitcase. I have a meeting at 4 PM today and a video shoot this morning. I have only jeans and a warm shirt. I guess I have to take an extra carry on with me with a suit, underwear, shoes, shirt, tie, pills etc. They did not put it on a later flight.  Air France has no grasp of speed or customer service.

A rip-off because business class from CDG to Tel Aviv is an economy seat with an empty seat next to you. You might get away with that on a short hop within the EU, but on a 4+ hr trip, at this price, it's just not acceptable. It was an overnight flight, and I just assumed, as with the BA flight to TLV, there would be a flat bed. So, it was my fault for not checking. I got an economy seat that barely reclines, perhaps 4-5cm. Needless to say I didn't sleep much. And, in search of another way to get more enraged I checked the price of a flexible economy ticket for the same trip the next day. It was €700 for a flexible ticket. So I've paid not far short of €1000 extra to sit in the same seat as everyone else but closer to the toilets. Great. Merci beaucoup.",Business,1,nan

So he forced me to check in this one and buy extra baggage for 40 Euros. I was disappointed for the slightly difference which i didn't plan but I chose to respect the rules of Air France. However, what did I get back? I paid money for checkin baggage but didn't get the same respect! When I got the baggage, I notice, it was damaged.  Air France took the money but didn't responsible and respect the customer who obtained the rules. It is sad. I asked for refund 120 Euros. They haven't get back to me yet.",Couple Leisure,1,1

Did not like it at all. Next time I will choose their B777-300 for the trip. They updated business class seats on that plane. Service are fine, but I didn't feel like sitting in business class. Maybe too many people on A380, the service quality is lower than other plane. I flew B777-300 to Paris, I felt good about the service and plane, but not with the A380.

While I understand not all delays are the fault of the airline, it was disappointing that Air France did not contact me-a Sky Priority Customer-informing me of this, and that I had to call the SkyTeam hotline and wait for an hour to get my reroute (through Atlanta).

My booked Itinerary was from Mumbai - Paris - Cincinnati. I kept Cincinnati as my port of entry because I didn’t want to be in a hurry to do my immigration and then catch a domestic flight. But when I went to Mumbai airport, they changed my itinerary at the last minute from Mumbai - Paris - Atlanta - Cincinnati and leaving only 2 hrs between getting down at Atlanta and boarding flight to Cincinnati. The flight from Mumbai to Paris was 3 hours late. The flight from Paris to Atlanta was 2 hours late. When I reached Atlanta and went to Delta Airlines counter, I was told that I don’t have any ticket from Atlanta to Cincinnati for that day. I had to run back to another terminal where Air France was to get my ticket confirmed and again come back to domestic terminal to board the Delta airlines flight. I boarded the flight just 10 mins before take off. My arrival time was 1:38 PM EST as per my original itinerary and I reached at 10:30 PM EST to Cincinnati which is 9 hours late.

Boeing 777-300ER,Premium Economy,1,June 2018,2,4,3,no,Singapore to Kiev via Paris CDG,1," |  Singapore to Paris leg. Overall the Air France premium economy is worse than some Economy class on some carriers. The better part of the experience stops after priority check-in, increased luggage allowance and priority boarding. Surly flight attendants working on PE (which also handle economy) class. No welcome on board drinks and peanuts offered for PE class on that flight. Food was below average, portion was above average. Drink rounds are few and far between. Even asking for another glass of OJ on the second drink round during meal service is refused (water, tea and coffee offered). FA was very lazy when I ask for more water when I came to the galley in between meal services, simply pointing at bottles of water set up on the tray and expect us to serve ourself, while she was sitting (yes, sitting) on a stool and reading a magazine. The seat looked nice and with more spacious leg room, the seat does not recline, it just slides forward, making a very uncomfortable sleeping position and causing back pain for my elderly travel companions. The pillow is not enough to overcome the weird (lack of) padding on the normal human's back part of the seat. Request to have more pillows or blankets could not be accommodated, as the flight was nearly full, most empty seats already have their pillows taken. THey switched my short-haul intra-continental return flight from AF to Joon, and the departure time from 06:15 to 04:15 without giving us options to change (they do have codeshare flight at 10:40). I am so dreaded for the return flight, for having to seat in those uncomfortable seat for 13+ hours for the return leg to Singapore. AF economy seats are better if you concern more on the seat recline instead on the leg room. Paying more than 2x of the cheapest economy fares and having tried competitors' PE class, I reckon Star Alliance and Oneworld airlines offer a much better values for PE flights out of Singapore to Europe (cheaper fares, hot towels, welcome drinks and snacks, better seat padding).",Family Leisure,1,nan

I am not an illegal immigrant. “No! You can’t speak to the ILO, this France!”, she yelled. During this process my daughters aged 5 and 7 became distressed and started crying as the Air France boarding agent shouted at me; I asked if I could get my children some water. “No, no! Don’t move!” She shouted. Finally the agent said “Go back where you came from” before frogmarching me and my children out of the airport. At no point was any concern showed for me or my children, both UK citizens. No advice was given, no help or advice offered.

Four of us flew business class. The 1st bag Air France left behind was in San Francisco. Not lost, left behind. All bags checked in at once and somehow one bag, for a sky priority business class customer, didnt make it on the plane. Now, I can overlook the horrible food they served on our business class flight. I can even overlook the semi attentive flight crew. I can’t overlook paying big dollars for priority service and instead being given the run around and lied to about our one bag! Four days later it arrived in cape town. Four days! The second leg of our trip was from Cape Town to Zurich again via Charles De Gaulle. And one bag didn’t make it to Zurich. All bags checked in at the same time. In fact it appears Air France has self bag checkin now and what a mess! It’s a totally backwards system. Cost savings by cutting employees is going to kill this airline alone. Anyhow, like I said, one bag, not lost. We know where it is. It’s at the Charles de Gaulle airport. Four flights left Charles de Gaulle to Zurich after our flight. Still they failed to pick the bag up and place it on a new flight to Zurich. Seems simple enough. But no, in fact so difficult when you Call to follow up on the bag you literally get the most useless people on the phone who have no clue how to get the bag from point A to point B. They may as well not have a person there are al - like the baggage drop off. Four of us take two international vacations a year. Usually business class to several destinations.

nan,Business Class,3,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,3,I took a flight from Paris to Tokyo Narita on 777-300. Usually I took this route on economy or premier economy but this time I upgraded myself using mileage So my expectation was high. But it was very disappointing to see the quality of food and wine as well as maintenance of business class seats. Foods were not interesting and wine was simply cheap. I do not expect much in air but I did not feel that I was entertained. Seat was not functioning well and entertainment was extremely limited. It seems that AF lost interest in attracting good customers on this route. I would suggest staying in economy or taking another carrier's business class such as JAL or ANA.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,4,nan,nan,no,nan,3,Air France AF681 on March 23 2015 from Atlanta to Paris was extremely harsh on me while I was traveling alone with my 13-month old son. They took away the stroller before I entered the flight and promised to give me a replacement at Paris. They gave no reason why my own stroller would not be given back to me and will directly be sent to New Delhi - my final destination. I had bought this stroller specifically as per Air France requirements/size limit. In Paris CDG airport they initially said they will give me a stroller at baggage claim (that makes no sense as I was not collecting my baggage). Then they said it will be given after I walk down to the next entry point. Finally they said they will give it at the boarding and I said that I will not need it at that moment. Carrying my son in one hand I had to manage my backpack and two more pieces of carry on baggage and had to take numerous stops before I reached the next flight. Not to mention I had to go through the security check too. Had my parents not met me in Paris CDG airport mid-way to join me on the next flight I would have missed the connecting flight that I had to catch within about an hour. Even in AF681 flight there were no attendants to help me to even mix the formula milk for my son and my co-passenger helped me. Website mentions about kid's meal that I had ordered beforehand only to find out that this will not suit my baby. I had to order baby meal (which is basically milk) but no one mentioned that when I pre-ordered meals over the phone before my travel.,nan,3,nan

Food service was truly awful: the food is standard economy fare OK but the actual quality amount taste and presentation of the food (whether Western or Chinese menu) is terrible. Staff service was marked by its absence. Drinks very limited. Video system old does not work well and not much choice. Climate control in cabin poor the flights became hot and stuffy. Cabin dirty.

After the no-frills flight from TXL to CDG and a stop-over stay in Paris, we boarded the B777 through the SkyPriority gate (which we also were able to use at check-in and security) and found the seats to be quite good: fixed shell (very rare in Premium Economy) and ample legroom, Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones, a decent IFE screensufficient storage space. As others mentioned before, there is no real decline and the seat cushions were worn out which led us to use the cushions handed out to make sitting a little bit more comfortable. Good quality amenity kits were handed out. Food and drinks: after champagne for aperitif, designated Premium Economy menu cards were handed out. We were served the main cabin economy lunch, but on a different tray. The food was among the best we have had in economy both quality and quantity wise. It was accompanied by wine which was presented restaurant style in a real glass. Digestifs were followed by a cornet filled with sweets. Before landing, a yummy pizza pocket was served. Fight attendants were always approachable, friendly and courteous.

We noticed a large downgrade in service from a similar flight we had about 4 years ago. What surprised us the most was the very average service in flight, such as not picking up meal plates, refilling our beverages and the like.  It also
seemed like we were supposed to take our trays back, go pick up our beverage at the cart and fend for ourselves. The meals were not much better.  The salmon I was served was well done and I still don't know what the ""side"" was. My observation is that we were not the only ones who raised their eyebrows to a fairly disappointing Business Class experience. True be told, it reminded us of what traveling in coach was 12 years ago.

In addition I had order seats so that I could actually sit next to my wife. It would have been nice to sit next to her for the 9 hour flight. Just because you pick the seating and pay for it does not mean you actually get what you pay for. Beware. I have traveled several times to Paris and this was my first and last time using Air France.

The crew in First Class were not trained and qualifed for First. Staff did their best and were friendly but service was more J than F. Due to late departure, they had a problem with catering, many items for the dinner were missing. The food we had was superb, however too many things were missing.

The breakfast served before arrival in Paris was only a little better - a limp omelette with a couple of pieces of vegetable. The entertainment system kept freezing. I watched 2 movies but never saw the end of either them! Having spent the previous few weeks travelling on Asian carriers around Asia and India I was struck by how far European Airlines have fallen behind in customer service and in-flight catering.

nan,Economy Class,1,nan,3,nan,1,no,nan,3,I chose Air France to fly from Edinburgh to Florence through CDG. Out tickets were purchased as through tickets and I noticed that they only provided for a 50 minute connection from the AF Hop regional hub which is at the far end of the airport and only accessible by bus through immigration and on to pier E. I emailed twice to seek confirmation that this could be done and was assured on both occasions that it could. Suffice to say it cannot and our connection was missed by 20 minutes (even our case couldn't make it). This is when you fully experience the sharp end of AF's customer service staff who consider you to be something on the bottom of their shoe. We were put on the flight some 3 hrs later sitting at opposite ends of the aircraft despite me telling them my wife was a nervous flyer. During our deliberations at the desk business class went from being full to (upon further pressing) empty and being held so on the rather unlikely event of 8 people turning up half an hour before the flight and buying business class tickets. I didn't want to fly business class but simply suggested that a couple of other passengers could be upgraded freeing up two seats together for my wife and myself. I asked to speak to a manager - none were available. I was told that I was only an economy passenger and that to get anything better I would have to purchase two business class single fares amounting to almost 1000 Euros. Suffice to say when the flight took off there were 6 empty business class seats whilst I was in row 6 and my wife rather uncomfortably in row 24. We could have flown directly with Ryanair to Pisa but I prefer to fly the Flag Carrier experience for a quality of service that was sadly lacking with Air France.

The service was surprisingly friendly and good on this flight - I will give them that. CDG is the predictable mess - delays lack of information and the busses to shuttle you to connections so loved by Euro airports.

I was feeling unwell due to heat stroke and asked for a brandy but was told that spirits were not available - only soft drinks water or beer. During the flight I needed water I had to use the call button several times before they came to see what I wanted. Later when I asked for more water the attendant said that I could always get my own. No other food served for almost 10 hours and then just a snack. It is the worst long haul flight I have ever experienced. The service was non existent.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,3,nan,2,nan,2,no,nan,1,Departing from Washington Dulles to CDG Paris AF0027 June 21st and returning from CDG AF0026 to Dulles 7/2. I will never fly Air France again - my 13 year old daughter and myself went for 2 weeks to Paris - flew Business Class. Going over the food was good (not great) however I noticed how frayed some of the seats in business class were which was just the beginning. Seat is horrible so no sleep for me coming back my tray table was broken (yes in Business class) so I had to prop it up with my knees as I didn't want to sit apart from my daughter. The food was terrible and the seat again was horrible if you are trying to get some sleep.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,3,no,nan,3,I have being flying regularly with Air France for the past 9 years in economy and business class. Normally inflight economy service is excellent with good range of food and beverages available and being offered. On the flight from Paris to Bangkok (July 12) although the plane was newish and with good entertainment the service was absent. The dinner service was a tray with no selection of food or drinks. It contained a pre-packaged cocktail and red wine. No other beverages were offered and no other drinks or snacks offered during the flight. At one point during the flight I went in search of a glass of water not having been offered or provided anything for several hours. I was given a drink and told to go to another galley where I might find ice cream if I was lucky - not even the crew knew what was available. This took self serve to a whole new level. This was one step away from a pack lunch. I chose Air France above other less expensive airlines as I had always enjoyed Air France service and variety offered. A premium airline cannot charge a premium price and fail to provide service otherwise why pay the price when a cheaper alternative provides the exact same thing. I will not fly Air France again.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,1,nan,1,yes,nan,2,CDG-Dusseldorf. Check in was quick with the machine and involved zero interaction with staff. Lounge was basic but I guess it is normal since they have only European flights from Terminal 2F. Boarding as usual is chaotic but Priority boarding announcement was still made less than a minute before general boarding was called. Once on board fantastic friendly and elegant purser welcomed and greeted passengers. For the price of the ticket the catering was awful with cold tasteless amuse bouche served. Seats are all the same across all cabins with 2 rows of business class (2 passengers sharing 3 seats) and a row of premium economy class (3 passengers on 3 seats) then a curtain separating economy class which gives an extremely cramped and stressful feeling. The cabin crew did their best but honestly the hard product let everything down.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,3,nan,2,nan,4,yes,nan,3,ATL-CDG 7/13/13 B777-300. Take off and landing on time etc. Nothing special or terrible to report. I thought the business class on Air France although not bad is also not good. Seats recline OK but not especially comfortable. The 3 across the middle of business class seems outdated to me these days. The food was terrible for business class. Terrible fish horrible cheese wine selection OK. Overall no reason to compliment or complain and given the ticket price I think I was just about getting value for money.,nan,3,nan
nan,Premium Economy,4,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,Return trip Hong Kong to Paris. Outbound flight was delayed 1.5 hours but landed close to on time. Seat was hard but putting your pillow and blanket underneath you helps. I prefer normal recliner seats to the Air France shell seats as the recline is minimal. Food was reasonable and staff service was much warmer on the return flight.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,5,Singapore to Paris return. Arrived at Singapore airport and read an email saying my family of 5 had been bumped and told to come back the next day. After speaking/begging with a very helpful Air France rep we were put on a Singapore airlines flight leaving roughly the same time. Flight back from Paris to Singapore on an A380 was great excellent cabin staff who were extremely pleasant and helpful with my young children food was good plenty of drinks entertainment was a bit limited for adults but the kids loved it. Overall preferred the Air France flight home more than our unexpected Singapore airlines flight over.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,Upon checking in at Bangkok I was told I would have to pay $100 US for an a second checked in bag despite only having 20 kilos. I have travelled on international flights for 35 years and have never heard of this policy. When I requested an emergency exit seat as I am over 6 ft 3 I was told all these seats were taken and anyway they cost 70 Euros extra. On boarding I observed 2 empty emergency exit seats. Finally I was dismayed at the on-board food they served and expected a lot more from their national carrier from a country that supposedly has some of the best cuisine in the world. I could not eat the food as it was stale and tasteless. All I could stomach on a 14 hour flight was a very small ham roll. Never again Air France.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,3,Arrived at CDG 3 hours before flight with my young daughter to be told that our flight home was overbooked and that this wasn't unusual as Air France overbook all of their flights. We were handed standby by boarding cards and 3 hours later at 9pm it was confirmed that we wouldn't be able to board the plane by the most bored looking ill mannered unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service representative I have ever encountered. We were eventually taken elsewhere and issued with a voucher for a hotel and meal. We were vaguely pointed in the direction we needed to travel and told that with children it would take about 45 minutes to get across the airport to the hotel shuttle bus stop. After a torturous trek across the airport we eventually got to the bus stop and then to our hotel so late that the restaurant had long since closed and the only food available was from a vending machine.,nan,2,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,3,nan,4,yes,nan,4,CPH-CDG-MIA / JFK-CDG-CPH. I upgraded to Business class on the CDG-MIA flight operated by an ageing 747-400 but everything worked just fine cabin was clean and seat comfortable. JFK-CDG was an A380-800 aircraft. We had a delay of almost 2 hours on departure from JFK due to ATC but captain kept us informed and was very apologetic. In general food was good but it could be better. Flight attendants were outstanding especially on both long haul flights they were just some of the best I have ever had. The worst was that I missed my connection at CDG and the customer service agent wanted me to wait for 6 hours when there was an available flight 1.5 hours after our late arrival. Overall very satisfied with AF. Chapeau to its cabin crew!,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,We flew from Venice to Paris and will connect from Paris to HKG. Flight from Venice to Paris was 10 mins late and the flight to HKG left. Next available flight is 24 hour after. Customer service staff were rude and unfriendly. We requested to have seat upgrade due to 24 hour delay and our request was rejected. At the airport we requested lounge access and they still declined request. In addition seats are horrible and your back hurts after a 12-hour flight. Food was cold.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,2,no,nan,3,SFO-BLR (SFO-CDG-BLR) this week. Flight departure delayed by 13+ hours due to technical problem. We were literally waiting in Paris Airport almost for 16 hours and we were neither given accommodation nor not alternative flight.,nan,2,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,4,nan,3,no,nan,1,IAH-CDG-SVO. Both flights late. Catering good and onboard staff friendly. Seats not up to specs for business class especially CDG-SVO where the legroom is smaller than in some competitor economy cabins. CDG-SVO delayed 2hrs due to technical problem and then another 35 minutes for wrong catering being loading onboard. Overall below expectations and not fair value for money paid. Air France service has deteriorated in last years and the only positive is the cabin crew that does it's job with a sense of pleasure. CDG airport is a nightmare and a story on it's own.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,3,nan,3,no,nan,2,"Recent trip from BOS to CDG as a SkyTeam Elite was anything but pleasant. I am enrolled in Delta's program rather than AF's (though I probably fly AF and KLM more than Delta) and the whole ""SkyTeam seamless travel"" ad campaign is an absolute joke. My platinum status did nothing to upgrade me to the Premium Economy seats though it is supposed to - at check-in AF said I could only upgrade for a fee. When I asked to speak to a supervisor the story changed and ""all the Premium Economy seats are already taken but if not we would of course upgrade you."" Getting on the flight 3 out of 27 Premium Economy seat were occupied. I politely asked the head steward if under the circumstances I could take a PE seat and he gruffly said that I should have asked on the ground - it was impossible to ever upgrade passengers once on board! No one is actually bad they just don't care and have learned that they can fob off any complaint. Flight attendants do an adequate job of serving dinner then you don't see them again the food on board is also adequate economy seats are expectedly uncomfortable IFE screens tiny. The best thing about AF are the CDG lounges. The worst thing is the uselessness of working to get status on SkyTeam when partners can be utterly arbitrary in honoring its benefits.",nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,5,Flew from London City Airport to Brest on 20th August Flight AF5291 and returned on 27th August Flight AF5290. Having arrived 2 hours before my flight at London City Airport and being second in the queue at check-in I was told I was being put on stand-by as Air France were not sure how much luggage they would be able to carry. I was told to go away and return 40 minutes before my flight and that I may have to divert to Paris or stay in a hotel at City Airport overnight. Being an elderly person travelling on my own I was concerned by this and this was not helped by the attitude of the Air France staff. Having booked my ticket 6 weeks ago and arriving in plenty of time before check-in I feel that this was totally unacceptable. I will certainly not be travelling with Air France until they improve their service and their attitude towards their customers.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,Flying from Atlanta to Paris CDG in Economy. We were held on the runway at Atlanta due to thunderstorms. Not the fault of AF but where were the crew? It was stiflingly hot but no sign of water. The menu looked good but the meal was abysmal. The champagne aperitif turned out to be a choice of a long opened bottle of fizz or a plastic bottle of vin de table. Miserable staff who then disappeared until offering a low grade snack before landing.,nan,1,nan
nan,First Class,5,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,Brussels to CDG and CDG to Narita in First Class on Aug 2nd 2013. I had booked in business but upgraded. Boarded a train in Brussels allowed to wait in Thalys lounge comfortable but basic no service on the train but luggage handed over and rather short trip of 75 minutes in first class. Collect luggage on the platform in CDG pretty quick an AF staff member welcomed us on the platform. Small waiting lounge while our luggage was checked in accompanied through priority immigration and security line then to the First class lounge. Accompanied and driven by car to the plane and introduced to the crew on A380. A nice female attendant took good care of us all through the flight very professional a quick lunch (just a main course and light sweet as I had eaten in the lounge). After lunch I changed into the pyjamas offered coming back to my seat the FA had turned it into a bed with mattress soft pillow and comfortable quilt. Nice breakfast of apple pancakes and tea. After landing first to disembark welcomed by AF staff priority lane for immigration and by the time we entered luggage hall our case had already been collected by another AF staff waiting for us with a luggage cart. All in all a very good experience.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,3,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Paris to Washington (IAD) in economy on August 27. We had a pair of seats aisle + window with a convenient individual mini-storage bin by the window on top deck of Airbus A380. Extremely quiet and smooth flight. Aircraft very clean and in excellent shape. Reasonably comfortable seats with small footrest and excellent video/audio selection (wide music selection and at least 30 movies to chose from in a variety of languages). Departure delayed a few minutes due to a couple of passengers showing up late. Crew was pleasant and helpful. Food was average for economy. Open bar in the rear throughout the flight is a definite plus. All in all a good experience. Value for money was top by definition: frequent flyer award tickets earned in Delta FF program (yes FF tickets can be had even in high season at least when you book 9 months in advance).,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,3,nan,1,yes,nan,3,Flew with them back in February and March. One is ABZ-CDG. Another one is CDG-ZRH. Both are returned flight. Enjoy all the flight even there was nothing much to comment as they were all short flight. Check-in at Zurich was nice as the staffs checked through my baggage straight into ABZ even though I bought two separated tickets. Sandwiches snacks and drinks are offered onboard which were alright. There is not IFE. So can't comment on that. Would have been much better to get a proper meal for the price I've paid for. Overall satisfied with the airline and would fly them again.,nan,3,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,3,nan,3,yes,nan,3,August 21st Paris to Minnesota aboard AF 340-300. Flight delayed an hour because of a problem with the air- conditioning. Once again we enjoyed the larger seat and extra leg room. I especially like the option which allowed me to raise the seat front to support my calves. When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priority’ which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner. In fact many non priority bags arrived long before ours; including those belonging to our friends to flew economy. As a result we barely made our connection (2 minutes) our bags did not.,nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,3,nan,3,yes,nan,4,August 1st - Minnesota to Paris aboard AF 340-300 flight was great. Enjoyed the larger seats and more leg room food was average wine with and after dinner was good. The air-conditioning in the airplane was not working correctly so we sat on our blanket and pillows which offset the hardness of the seat. After dinner we were offered liquor flight attendants were friendly and accommodating. Since we departed at 8pm shortly after dinner the lights were turned off encouraging passengers to sleep or take advantage of the in screen entertainment. Screen size was exceptional big and easy to watch movie and TV selections were average. Breakfast was served about an hour before landing again the food was just average. Would fly AF Premium economy again absolutely so much better than economy.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,2,CDG-VIE took this morning flight and it's so disappointing to see the standards drop so low. For breakfast if you don't drink Tea of Coffee it's Bread (croissant) and water no juice of any kind. Crew look suitably embarrassed. And you have for the inflight entertainment the reading of their Air France magazine. The paper cup and napkin is collected in a rubbish bag very quickly after serving and then the crew disappear. Virtually a low cost company.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,3,Frankfurt to Clermont Ferrand - connecting in Paris with both segments on Air France. Connection requires you to switch from terminal 2F to 2G in Paris which involves exiting the airport taking a shuttle and going through security again. My first flight was slightly late as a result I got to the gate 10 mins before departure. They refused to let me on supposedly they close the doors 10 mins before departure. Granted I am a frequent flier the flight probably does not have more than 2 dozen people on it I was already checked in and on my way from the other terminal. You would have thought they would make an effort. Unfortunately that's a recurring problem and since they have a monopoly on flights to smaller French airports like Clermont Ferrand they could not care less about what people think. I absolutely do not recommend this airline to anyone. Very high prices terrible service no consideration for customers. If you can avoid it I recommend you do so.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,3,nan,3,yes,nan,3,AMS-MRS on a newly configured Air France A319. The seats don't really recline a la Ryanair but they are far more comfortable. Service was minimal but I appreciated getting a real (espresso) coffee. Staff service was excellent although no explanation or apology was given for the delay. Arrival to Marseille smooth and bags came out quickly. Would fly again.,nan,3,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,2,"We were in the upper deck of the A380 on a direct flight from CDG to LAX last month. Navigating CDG is a challenge but the very comfortable lounge was a welcome respite after trudging what seemed like forever. This was our first experience with the A380 and were very pleased with the remarkably quiet upper deck. We also appreciated the dedicated passenger ramp at both ends of the journey that made entrance and exit very easy. The flight crew was outstanding very polite and personable. The were very accommodating to my requests for meals whether light or full whenever I wanted them. Food and wine quality was excellent. I echo the comments of other passengers regarding the seats. I'm 6'2"" 200 lbs and the ""sleeping"" position was very uncomfortable for me. Sitting comfort was just okay. My wife is much shorter so it wasn't as much of an issue for her. As an aside the seats on the AF 777's are no better. I'm not sure who AF Airbus and Boeing used to test the design for a business class seat but they obviously recruited no one my size or larger. That aside the overall experience was very good and I would recommend AF.",nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,1,nan,3,no,nan,3,I flew AF 256 on 20/8/13 upgrading to premium economy at CDG for a substantial price. Unfortunately my expectations were not met with what was a less than satisfactory onboard service. On boarding I was allocated seat 21A which I identified immediately was broken I brought this to the attention of the male flight attendant. The seat would not stay in its retracted position and I had concerns that this would not be safe. I was most disappointed when this was not dealt with. He returned to say that it would be ok and continued on. The service in general in prem-Eco was less than satisfactory. On arrival into SIN and deplaning I brought it to the attention of the female cabin crew positioned between pre-Eco / economy and asked that it be reviewed prior to the return flight to Paris. She stated that her flight was finished and it was not her problem. It is for this reason that I would not consider flying Air France again.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,2,no,nan,1,"We have traveled all over the USA and Europe for over 30 years. This trip was 3 weeks long we were on American Airlines British Airways Iberia etc. with the same luggage. But Air France charged us £60 each for small carry on bags that all other airlines allow free. The check in clerk was very rude and rigid in typical French fashion. They were proud to say that they are different and do not belong to the ""One World Alliance"". The on board experience was just as bad flight attendants were rude and unwelcoming service was poor. This was a pleasure trip and Air France took all of the joy out of air travel. We will never fly Air France again and would not recommend.",nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,3,BSL-CDG-IAD / JFK-CDG-BSL. The short legs on ATR 72 were nice solid. Quick round of drinks and choice of snack. Easy check in / boarding due to small plane and few passengers. Changing in CDG between 2E and 2G absolutely without a problem via airside shuttle bus and many signs. CDG-IAD on A380 with mixed results: Economy seats on upper deck are a plus when travelling as a couple - only 2 seats at window with nice little storage compartment between seat and window. Very good choice of films/music on IFE. However for an airplane of 2.5 years of age the interior looks like straight from the 90s: egg-shell-whiteish plastic and a smallish screen. The weirdest thing is that the screen is offset to the left to accommodate the remote control on the right. This makes for awkward angles of head/neck while watching films. Seats quite hard but enough leg room for me (6 ft 6). Crew very nice and open bar in the galleys throughout flight. Still do not understand the boarding process: They started boarding 40 minutes before departure despite 500+ passengers and a more thorough check due to flight to the US. Departure therefore almost an hour late. JFK-CDG in 10 year old 777-200 with the same seats/video screens/interior design. Crew very nice. They recognized me not fitting in my regular seat (albeit officially the same pitch in 380 and 772) so they moved me to bulkhead seats with lots of leg room. Seats very hard. Weird time of serving a good selection of (for airplane standards) good food: After a midnight takeoff they started serving a full dinner despite almost all passengers longing for sleep. All in all a good experience with some quirks that need to be cleaned up.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,4,nan,5,no,nan,2,BKK-CDG-HAM. My AF Flight was a morning flight at 9.45 am. Check-in staff very friendly and helpful flight full on B777 10 seat abreast in Y Class very tiny seat with footrest tiny aisle very cramped. Crews very rude didn't want to speak English 2 hours after departure crews begun with service lunch (only 1 choice) but high quality and quantity with bottle of red and port wine packed in the food tray only soft drinks and beer were offered finalized with coffee and tea. 30 mins later Duty Free offered after Duty Free informed that self- service bar with soft drinks was offered at the galley from that time on FA's were absent. No water or beverage offering during the flight until next snack service (sandwich croissant cheese tea and coffee) 2 hours before landing. Luckily AF has a very good IFE on board. Transiting at CDG 2E to 2F was smooth and easy (not horror as reported). CDG-HAM on A321 with croissant and soft drink. Other disappointing: no glass of champagne for Y class as advised in the website and newspapers.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,1,yes,nan,5,BHX-CDG-BHX. Outbound flight fine on time and good service on board consisted of complimentary snack and drink. Plane was an Embraer type narrow body with a 2x2 configuration. Plenty of leg room and leather seats made it a comfy experience. No IFE as only a 45 minute flight. Return flight I arrived late at the check-in (25 mins before the departure time). I can't praise the AF ground staff highly enough for getting me on that flight particularly as I was due to attend a wedding back in the UK. The flight was the same as the outbound one. AF still takes some beating on this short hop.,nan,5,nan

Crew were nice and the flight was on time both at departure and arrival. Meals were good and on best standard around for Airlines. Now there comes the downsides: the seats are some of the worst I've flown. Then the IFE crashed throughout the airplane just few minutes after takeoff the crew restarted it 3/4 times without success. Lastly was the seat was not cleaned at all: there was trash in my front pocket and some trash under the seat also the two rows near me was full of trash the crew apologized and cleaned while before departure. At least a nice and gentle crew.,nan,3,nan

The short flight was full and as is often the case one passenger could not read her seat allocation so a double seat allocation occurred which was quickly and pleasantly rectified by a member of all female cabin crew. Upon arrival in Paris I was in no hurry to disembark (unlike everyone else on board) so spent a little time chatting with the cabin crew and was even invited into the Flight Deck to meet the Captain and First Officer where the flown route was explained in some detail. All in all very pleasant and charming crew. The only minor complaint I would note is the lack of information on the ground in Geneva to explain a 45 minute delay.,nan,5,nan

Warm welcome onboard from FAs. Seats configuration was 3-4-3 (B777-300ER) with an awful and uncomfortable seat (mine was in row 23J in the Economy zone). Obviously folks from AF who have designed this seat had never traveled in a 12 hours long-haul flight! Food was correct while FAs service was really poor - our FA just skipped the coffee during the 2nd service before landing for a long time chat with another passenger and ignored the rest of the passengers!,nan,2,nan
nan,Business Class,2,nan,3,nan,2,no,nan,3,Manchester - CDG - Hong Kong 16 Sep 2013. Business Class. I'd summarise the AF experience as adequate but at the lower end of BC experiences. The 777 BC seats are somewhat tired these days and the stupid design means a window seat passenger cannot get past the PAX next door if they are reclined. Food was somewhat poor compared to the trip I made from Shanghai to CDG a couple of months earlier - didn't eat anything on this leg (serving foie gras is just offensive AF). Cabin staff not especially friendly. So better than EC but only because of the extra room. AF really need to get their act together - I won't use them again.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,2,nan,3,no,nan,2,"When my sister and myself were informed about a flight delay I went to the boarding counter and asked staff if it would affect my connecting flight from Paris to Singapore. I was informed that we would not miss our connecting flight and someone at Paris would escort us to the connecting flight. However when we reached Paris we were left to ""scramble"" with some other passengers to find our way to the boarding gate for the connecting flight. When we reached the boarding gate we were informed that we had missed the flight (AF256). The staff we approached for help rudely directed us to the customer service counter. When we asked to be put on the same flight we were informed flatly that ""all the flights are full and they could only get us flights separately"". After much insistence she ""miraculously"" found us a flight which we could take on together! We were given free accommodation sharing the same room. We are frequent travellers and it was our first time taking Air France and what a memorable experience!",nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,5,nan,2,no,nan,2,Boeing 767 on a trip to Paris (CDG) via Singapore. The only element that was good was the refreshment they were typical western style. Not good was the seat they are not wide enough very narrow. On the flight back it was the same.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,3,yes,nan,5,I want to commend the cabin staff on Flight AF006 from CDG to New York JFK on Wednesday October 23 2013 for their help and professionalism. My husband is disabled and cannot walk. He needed to go to be bathroom and a steward helped me get him to the lavatory. He has MS and I needed to clean and change him. When we left the bathroom he could not walk at all and two Air France stewards carried him to his seat. I had unfortunately stuffed up the sink and they closed the bathroom without saying a word. They were so understanding.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,LHR-SFO with a change at CDG. LHR-CDG flight was a short one enough to give an overall good impression. Flight lasted less than an hour but were offered drinks and a pastry breakfast. Staff were friendly and the cabin was clean. Flight from CDG-SFO was brilliant. Very satisfied with the entire flight the seats were comfortable! Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Once we began to taxi on the runway the personal video screens changed from the standard screen to show a live camera from the cockpit! The video screens themselves were really good. There were no grids and the picture was clear. The sound also worked well. The controls were responsive and there was a really good selection. Impressed with the food. I usually pre-order a special meal but I decided to chance the standard meal. I had a chicken in sauce main course with couscous. I got a nice roll with a good sized wedge of packaged brie a large thick slice of packaged pineapple and a really tasty good sized chunk of brownie for dessert. 1.5-2 hours before landing we got our second meal. I got pieces of seasoned chicken with potatoes and a sauce. There was lemon tart for dessert along with another bread roll and package of cream cheese. The entire flight was enjoyable. The plane was comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and polite and spoke fluent English. The announcements from the cockpit were clear and the captain gave little updates throughout the flight. I would definitely fly Air France again.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,2,JNB-CDG-TLV in economy on 17th October. Even if I had 3 seats for myself flying in economy on this A380 is not any better when it comes to comfort of seat compared with other airlines. Crew were very good and helped as much as they could. Food was ok even if appetiser was of poor quality. Most of all I appreciated the new breakfast concept in economy a warm crepe with a very sweet sauce. Small bread roll and croissant jam and some fresh fruit salad usual breakfast drinks. Much better then cold cuts and cheese with some dry bread roll and fruit compote we used to receive well done AF nice improvement. CDG-TLV same service as usual and as early morning flight out of CDG we received what to me looks like a very poor breakfast but food on European flights is always poor.,nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,2,nan,4,no,nan,3,Flew from MRU to CDG on 19th of October. Aircraft was the high density edition of 77W. Aircraft new clean and in good condition. Boarding on time however a delay of almost one hour occurred without any notice or refreshments. The service was dreadful. I fly very frequently especially with partner KLM but this was the most disappointing service experience. No drink round before dinner no drink round after dinner. No water for the night. FA showed herself 2 times on an 11 hr flight for dinner and breakfast. FA in galley ignorant and unfriendly. AF staff were below par especially in Premium Economy. Will avoid AF in the future and choose partner KLM if possible.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,3,From Paris CDG to Montreal Trudeau and from Atlanta Hartsfield International to Paris CDG. The crew were very polite and helpful especially for the flight back food and beverages were very good much better than other airlines I've used. Nevertheless the seats were hard especially between Paris and Montreal. I highly recommend to avoid flying with the old 747-400 of Air France.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Beijing to Paris on 14/09/2013. PNC run being particularly welcoming. The service was friendly and attentive. For once a real team effort. Clear PA announcements in French English and Chinese (a Chinese PNC was on board). Good seat and good VOD. However the cabin aircraft was dated and should be renovated.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,3,Both the Atlanta to Paris and the Paris to Aberdeen flights were great. I appreciated the staff. I do not speak French but found I had no problem communicating with the staff. It also had the best meal I have had on a flight. I was on Air France 681 and 1272 on September 21 and 22. Luggage was taken care of flights on time. I was impressed.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,3,nan,3,yes,nan,4,Singapore to Casablanca return via Paris. A decent enough product without being outstanding. On the upside the cabin crew delivered good service with the stewardess on the Singapore/Paris run being particularly welcoming. Seat comfort was good and I got plenty of sleep. And the flights were all on time. On the downside the food wasn't great: edible withouth being especially memorable. I would happily travel with Air France again.,nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,I would not fly Air France again nor would I recommend the airline to anyone. I flew from Singapore to Paris and returned from Frankfurt through Paris back to Singapore. The meals served were not of high standards the length of the flight requires at least snacks to be offered as well as a meal.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,Flew JFK-CDG September 2013. Loved the experience. Comfortable seats. Great food and included wine. Excellent service. On time! I will do it all over again.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,On Sunday 11/03/2013 they canceled a whole flight from Bologna to Paris France without telling the passengers. My wife on her route back to US from Italy was supposed to be on that flight and they gave her an alternate flight with KLM 12 hours longer and later. The timing was so bad that thanks to the delay of KLM she missed her last part of the flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. After 40 hours on the way 24 hours of delay and missing several academic and business meting she arrived on Monday. I never trust Air France ever again.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,I flew the A380 from CDG to Washington DC on Monday 21 October and it was a great experience. I had booked a business award flight in seat 66A upper deck and I have no complaints about the quality of the seat the tidiness of the cabin or the high quality of the food served. The crew were nice and professional and I have nothing to complain about. It was a great experience from checking to landing. The food was very good and even though I could not get my first choice the second choice was very tasty (duck with chestnuts and mash).,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Travelled from Melbourne to Paris 11th Sep code share Cathay Pacific. While the seats on Air France were not as comfortable as Cathay the service was considerably better. The women who looked after us were fabulous. Friendly polite and happy! This fare was much cheaper than other business class flights but the flight did not reflect this. We were very surprised with our flight considering the reviews were not great. We will certainly consider Air France again.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,We recently flew from San Antonio TX to Paris France with final stop in Barcelona. The dates were October 9th and October 21st. I was extremely pleased with the service crew and food that was offered. The service far exceeded any other flights I have taken in the last five years! The crew actually looked like they enjoyed their jobs and were very accommodating.,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,4,AF275 Tokyo-Paris CDG. Rather small and non inviting lounge at Narita very limited choice of food and drinks (comparing to Delta's Crown Room next door). Flight delayed for 4 hrs due to tech problem but all passengers were kept informed some snacks and drinks were served on board while waiting. After take off decent lunch was served food very nice but surprisingly wines choices were limited and not very good. Seat ok IFE as well snacks soups ice cream were served between the meals dinner before arrival was very tasty decent portions and choice. Excellent cabin crew definitely big plus. I missed my connecting flight had to stay overnight in Paris hotel and two meals were booked by AF next morning travelled home. Good service despite delay. Recommended.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,3,Travelled Paris to Johannesburg on the evening A380 flight on 27 September. The economy cabin at the rear is surprisingly cosy for such a large plane and noticeably quieter than any other wide-bodied plane. The dinner and breakfast were both excellent; choice of entertainment very good; and service both professional and friendly. Would be happy to recommend Air France.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,1,yes,nan,4,"From ORY to MRS on March 17th 2013 (AF 6047). The same day the other way from MRS to ORY (AF6006). Same round- trip on August 2nd 2013. ORY-MRS AF 6049. MRS-ORY AF 6006. I've been flying Air France for more than 11 years. Despite some delays due to ATC strikes or technical reasons (mid-exit doors unable to operate on A320 once 3hrs of delays offset by a 4k Miles Prime compensation) this airline fulfills my expectations. I don't fly a lot but I've done almost 50 flights over the years so my comment is based on a true experience. The crews are friendly experienced professional committed to making sure you're alright anytime while onboard. You'll always be welcomed as it should be. However things changed since I first flew them. The seats in short/mid haul flights are now lighter which means you can't stretch out anymore really bad point. Food isn't that bad but always on this flight's type this is a snack more than a meal. Entertainment just doesn't exist on short/mid haul flights neither outlets for your computer. That's why I think prices are sometimes quite high regarding the same flight on another day. Moreover at the 2nd main Paris airport there are a lot of delays mainly caused by the staff of the airport so when you fly from Paris choose the first hub ""CDG"" far from the city compared to ORY (Orly) but way more efficient. To summarize a bit this is French way of life great customer care recent nice and clean airplanes (inside and outside) mainly European made. Just give them a chance make it your favourite airline and you won't be disappointed.",nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,Return flight MUC to JFK via Paris was a very satisfying experience. Everything went smooth not the slightest delays and I was impressed on how friendly and considerate the service was on the long-haul flight. The transit at CDG was extremely easy in the Air France Terminal 2. Best part was the flight on the A380 on the way back because the entertainment system was superb finally a working touch screen and good head phones. The trip to New York was operated by Delta also no complaints.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Flew LAX to Paris and on to Athens and back the same route 2 weeks later A380 economy. Full flight 500 on board. If you have tight connections in Paris and are at the back do not book those connect times the airport terminal changes are what seems like miles to walk and then long lines at immigration but once on the plane if you make it the service is the best I have had. The crew wonderful to your needs and the food great and too much to eat really. The snacks between meals and the free wine and beer the best. First rate movies and free head sets to keep you occupied was nice. There is ice cream whenever you desire it. The only downside is that I fly Delta usually domestically and they advertise that AF is their partner but what rules go for Delta usually do not apply to AF especially their pet policy internationally - beware otherwise the A380 is awesome.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,As long as you fly Business Class you are good but the Economy Class has very hard seats and after 11 hours your back will hurt. This is probably the same for other airlines. I usually fly from LAX to GOA (Italy) via CDG from two to four times a year. I really wish there were better alternatives but it so happens that Air France has the shortest flights. Once after booking online on their website my trip I realized I made a mistake and although it says that all flights can be cancelled within 24 hours it took a lot of effort to get my money back. They seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing. More than once the flight from LAX was late and my connection was lost. I had to spend the night in Paris at a very cheap motel with bad food and uncomfortable beds. If you have the extra money to avoid Air France cheap accommodation you'll be fine. Food and staff are usually ok but when you try to contact the customer service for a refund good luck you'll need it. Of course if you want to purchase a new ticket they are very available and will help you immediately.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,3,Will never fly Air France again between LAX-CDG. I was 2.5 kg above the weight limit and the fine was 70 euro or about 90 US dollars (ridiculous). Check-in at CDG took 2.5 hours (5 lines required) and barely made it to the gate. Airbus A380 extremely uncomfortable.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,3,Washington to Paris. Boarding 30 minutes late but staff on boarding told me that flight will be in Paris on time. It was very important to me because my connection flight was only 1 hour after arrival time. After boarding plane stood more than half an hour in Washington so departure was more than 1 hour late. During the flight I tried to find out arrival time and departing gate of my next flight (also AF). Air-hostess promised me find it out and to give me an answer about 30 minutes before landing. I did not get the information and on the exit from the plane same hostess made a movement as - sorry I forgot on you. My display was not working and after two requests to the crew I did not received any answer if display can or will be repaired or at least excuse if it cannot be repaired. The drink I ordered was given to another passenger. All crew members were very happy and had good time together chatting and laughing.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,Dreadful service on Bangkok-Paris-London return flights. Food awful service even worse. Stewardesses snooty no drinks during flight and questions about snacks rebutted.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,3,Heathrow via Paris to Cancun return. Excellent check in and lounge at London Heathrow and transfer in Paris is fine. The lounge at CDG (being their home hub) was a little on the tired side and far too overcrowded. Onboard seats and catering good on the outbound leg. On the return the biggest difference is the seat as AF do not have lay flat seats. Overnight flight back was okay (minus the seat issue) with staff and catering excellent. Transfer back via Paris all ok and the short hop back to Heathrow was wonderful.,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,4,nan,4,no,nan,1,Business class AF0990 Paris Johannesburg on A380. Flight was fine and service as can be expected. However the business class seats of AF must be the worst in the airline industry. Cannot believe the manager responsible for buying these chairs is still working there. They must know by now that this seat is an affront to the travelers using them. While the whole competition and even their sister company KLM goes full flat AF decided to develop a chair which sets back time a least 10 years. I am very sorry for all the French travelers that have no other choice then use this airline. I definitely will never again.,nan,1,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,2,nan,3,no,nan,2,Kansai International Airport to Paris. The scheduling of food and service was terrible. We took off at 12.30 and were served lunch around 14.00 (2 p.m.). Then after this service the window blinds were pulled down and the lights were dimmed (in the middle of the afternoon!). There was no further service until l5 minutes before midnight - a duration of some 9 hours! when a dinner was served. The pursers vanished (to sleep?). Someone came round with an ice- cream on a stick at some stage. Why Air France wished to turn day into night on what was a day flight that arrived in Paris at the end of the afternoon is beyond me. Why they should consider that a break in service of 9 hours is acceptable is beyond belief. What they have done of course is to use the same service timetable as that for the flight out - which made sense in that context as it was a night flight arriving early in the morning of the following day. Under those circumstances it was logical to give passengers the chance to sleep undisturbed but not for daytime flight. It just requires some basic common sense to understand that a day flight is different from an over night flight.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,2,nan,2,nan,2,yes,nan,4,Paris to Boston in business class. The plane and seats were great except one toilet was not working and closed. The main issue was lack of clear English announcements. Even though the flight was coming to Boston but there was nothing in clear English. This made the situation for us painful. We were served with some appetizers mainly duck. I did not like it and the hostess made a comment in broken English as if I was not hungry. When the main meal was served she did not include me as if I did not need anything to eat in a long flight. My wife sitting next to me was served that main meal while I was talking to her. Before landing they served something that I can only describe as least desirable. It had a tiniest of half a sandwich without any meat or egg. A big cup of heavy marinated fruits. In short after a long flight in AF Business we had to stop at a McDonald before driving home.,nan,3,nan
nan,First Class,4,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,4,CDG-JNB-CDG on A380. One of the best parts was the first lounge in CDG. Welcome is perfect the lounge is not so big but modern and beautiful. The dinner in the lounge was excellent with fine wines. Transfer by limo for Boarding was perfect. Nice welcome by the crew - all the other seats in first were empty! I did not try the onboard dinner. IFE is good but need to be improved compared to other airlines the screen is small. Full flat bed was very comfortable before landing at JNB breakfast was ok. On the return flight to Paris I stayed at the business lounge before boarding there is no first class lounge in JNB. Nice welcome by crew again all the other seats in first were empty. Served a very good champagne before take off. I was disappointed by the catering in first class from JNB wines were very good but food is far from standards in first class. I think that the IFE and the food must be improved on flights especially the return flight to Paris. Another problem is the lack of privacy in fist class fortunately I was alone on these flights.,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,Flew CDG-JFK on A380. Heard many negative about AF from airport experience to poor flight crews and service well I think that is a thing of the past now. My experience from check-in immigration and security the lounges the flight itself was great. Everyone very friendly and helpful. The business class seats were comfortable the food was wonderful cabin crews did everything they could to make you feel welcomed and taken care of. As far as navigating the dreaded CDG I found the signage easy to follow as we made our way from the Ibis via train shuttle to terminal 2F and on to 2E for check-in.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,3,Flew on 29th 0ctober once again from CDG to JNB. Beside that by now we all know what a great design this A380 is and how much more peaceful it is inside this airplane when flying. The reason for my comment this time is the very noticeable improvement by AF crew and AF catering to put in an effort to take better care of passengers. AF crew are usually always very polite they seem to enjoy their jobs again. Catering has improved again and food quality is very close to what I remembered it was so many years ago and one of the reasons I became a regular customer of AF. Also noticeable is the new design of cutlery even if made from plastic using them makes it much easier to enjoy the food. Well done AF now just improve the snacks served between meals on this route and it will be perfect.,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,3,nan,3,nan,2,no,nan,1,"Flew Business Class from JFK-CDG-CAI-CDG-JFK. The Business Class seats were short in the reclining position so my 6' 2"" frame did not fit.

nan,Premium Economy,4,nan,5,nan,3,yes,nan,2,"NRT-CDG-FCO and return. On the outbound I flew premium economy and the return business class. I have enjoyed Air France for several reasons the past few years on these long-hauls and this flight was no different. They are on time reliable and the food is good. Their premium economy seat and benefits suits my space requirements though as many have said the seat bottoms are very hard and there is no recline. If you're awake the entire flight no problem but don't think of sleeping. I upgraded for an extra fee on the return. The seat is much more comfortable and softer but it is not a flat bed and doesn't allow for sleep. The food was even more creative and delicious up in business but the mid-flight ""buffet"" is paltry. Flight attendants are usually very polite and efficient and I've never had a problem with language. One small complaint I experienced this trip was that they tend to cater to and make over the French nationals while being slightly perfunctory with non-French passengers. This is a mixed review but really the flights are smooth food good connection easy at CDG and I am booked on two more premium economy flights from Japan to Europe this winter. One last comment the flights and seats on long haul flights in premium economy are unique. The intra-Europe flights are always a let down in terms of seats. They are the same exact seats as economy. The only benefit being that you get a nice meal/snack and are at the front of the plane.",nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,3,nan,3,no,nan,1,I was disappointed with the business class seats. Fairly uncomfortable! I don't understand the whole concept of sticking your feet into a cubby hole under the seat in front you. There is no real leg support and as the seat doesn't lay flat you are always sliding. The armrests are also hard and elbows are sore at the end of a long flight. Even the Air France lounge at JFK was disappointing. Run down and staff not very good at cleaning. The lounge at CDG was better but still not great. Overall I would probably reserve with a different airline for my next trip as the value simply wasn't there.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Paris-Johannesburg Economy. A380 upper deck. Comfortable seats excellent entertainment program and the best food in Economy I have had in years. Everything on time flight attendants were offering water several times through the flight. Real headphones not the 50 cent cheapos that sound like a tin can. Again very good breakfast. Absolutely no complaints almost perfect for economy long-distance.,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,4,I flew CDG to KUL (Kuala Lumpur) on B777-200. Overall a good trip with attentive cabin service very reasonable food and good wines. IFE very good with no system problems. Although I prefer the B777 over the A380 I find the seats in the latter too confining the seat does not go fully flat and its like sleeping on a gentle hill; you tend to slip down and have to regularly push yourself back up to the pillow does not make for a good nights sleep.,nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,1,The flight from JFK-CDG was delayed about an hour and Air France insisted that 50 minutes would be enough time to make my connecting flight to Helsinki (in a different terminal). I insisted right back that 50 minutes is nowhere near enough time at CDG knowing I would have to clear security twice ride a bus and a train and then go through passport screening and one more security check. The A380 was nothing special at all unless you were in first class. There is no economy comfort you just pay extra to sit in the exit row. The flight attendants bring drinks and food exactly twice and no more. The plane is gigantic but somehow they really squished all those seats in there. I don't normally fly this route usually I fly with KLM through Amsterdam and I am always pleased with their service. Air France continually leaves a lot to be desired in cabin service the entertainment offerings were pitiful the seats barely reclined and the service that was there was awful. The one thing they did well was fix my connecting flight with Finnair - and Finnair recognized my Platinum status on SkyTeam.,nan,2,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,5,nan,3,yes,nan,4,CAN-CDG leg of a SYD-CDG journey. The business seat (NEV4 so the latest version so far on AF) is OK in terms of comfort especially for taller people (shorter people may be frustrated in sitting position as they cannot reach the footrest). The main drawbacks are a lack of room for conveniently putting one's own belongings and lack of privacy (especially compared to the CZ business configuration which we had on the A380 from SYD to CAN which is great in terms of private space). Catering OK although no choice for the starters (this should be improved). Good choice in terms of drinks and possibility to access a bar at all time during the flight. Possibility to have a quick dinner service (without main course) thanks to a very efficient flight attendant; that was very appreciated on a night flight as we were keen on sleeping as soon as possible (and even more appreciated considering that the dinner service with AF is usually way too long). The IFE is a little bit poor and the user interface is not very friendly (the way of listing the movies for instance should be improved - it always takes a lot of time to go through the whole lot). The flight was perfectly on time both at departure and arrival. Globally a good experience.,nan,5,nan

nan,Premium Economy,4,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,I had SkyPriority Premium Economy seating on a flight from Toronto Canada to Malaga Spain with a stop in Paris and return via the same route. The premium economy includes a few select rows with seats that have extra leg room and a deeper recline position. In-seat electric outlets for charging your electronics - they require a standard European plug. The comfort pack they handed out included socks ear plugs mask toothbrush and toothpaste and ear phone covers (headsets are built in to the seat) and TV screen either in the armrest or on seat back in front. In the bathroom there were Clarins face products and cotton pads to freshen up. Menu selection and food was very good. Alcoholic beverages are standard. After the meal we were handed a plastic container with a great selection of bon bons. Premium economy seating also meant passengers were able to board the aircraft before the regular economy passengers. Staff were pleasant and accommodating. This was such a great experience I will always choose Air France over a competitor when given the option for my flight.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,2,nan,2,yes,nan,3,Manchester to St Maarten via Paris CDG. Apart from an hours delay in CDG on the outward leg all flights were on time. A340-300 for the long haul is adequate in Economy but seats are getting very hard with age and the IFE on both long haul aircraft was two or three generations out of date which is poor on a long flight. Food is barely adequate AF is no exception to a general low standard. Staff polite and efficient but only appeared at trolley service no intermediate drinks service offered available to collect from the galley only. KLM/AF have a monopoly on this route which explains why this 8 hour flight costs as much as a trip to Australia. I would try KLM next time and take my own cushion and packed lunch.,nan,3,nan

There's nothing premium about it except that you get the same food as business class - which isn't that special anyway.

nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,3,NRT-CDG-AMS-LCY/LHR-CDG-NRT in business for the long hauls and premium economy classes on the short hauls. This is my second Japan to Europe flight in a month with Air France and I was not disappointed. The staff are always accommodating and friendly the food good and plentiful the seats on the newer A380's comfortable (the older ones are a bit less so) and the connections easy in CDG. All flights were on time. My only complaint is that the seats in business are not lie flat but they are to be changing this on the newly renovated 777s in the coming year. The CDG lounge in the 2E M gates is truly spectacular as far as interior design goes though lacked any real food. Looking forward to yet another Air France trip in March.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,2,nan,5,no,nan,1,Flight from CDG to BKK economy seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Air France have gone for as many seats as possible even the cabin crew found it difficult to get the trolley through the very tight gangway. I will never fly Air France long haul economy again. Air France you need to revisit your seating plans.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,5,London to Madrid with connections in CDG. I only flew this route with AF because it was cheap. All the flights were on time. The seats were comfortable staff friendly and very professional. The connections at CDG were very easy to make. I was very impressed.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,3,GIG-CDG-LIS return flight in economy class. Intercontinental flights in B747 with seats that are only comfortable if the flight is not totally full. Service in economy good for a 11 hour flight with dinner served after departure and breakfast at arrival. Cabin crew speak several languages and are available at anytime. Flights from CDG to LIS in A320 with uneventful service ok for a 2h30 flight. Drinks served and a little snack (cream crackers). I chose AF for the fares and definitely recommend them for intercontinental flights.,nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,4,nan,4,nan,1,yes,nan,2,Berlin-CDG. Old A320. Looking tired and old. PE = 2 rows behind 3 rows of Business separated by curtain from Economy. Seating = 3x3. Business also 3x3 with middle seat blocked. Purser looked after BC and PE. Drinks/food service in PE identical to BC. Wouldn't bother paying the additional to travel Business on such a short flight when PE has the same service. Appeared that Economy was not offered an alcohol service. Drinks were acceptable (champagne offered ) and food was above expectations. Neatly packaged tasty and well presented. 2nd beverage service offered with tea/coffee. Nothing seemed rushed on a short flight of 1hr 25mins. Would travel short haul AF Premium Economy again. As others have said seats hard and there was no inflight entertainment however not required for such a short flight.,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,3,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Flew to Lisbon last minute so I was not able to get a non-stop flight. There were two legs to my trip JFK-CDG then CDG-LIS. Before I arrived at the airport Air France issued us one boarding pass that worked for both our flights. Flight scheduled to leave at 7.15. However the morning of the flight we received a notification that our flight had been delayed 2 hours. Upon arrival at JFK staff were very friendly and updated us. Lounge in JFK was the nicest I have seen excellent food spacious and comfortable. JFK-CDG was aboard an A380. Boarding took place through two gates so did not take as long as I thought made comfortable by the fact that Air France was sensitive to the boarding time and distributed drinks hot towels and an amenities kit while economy was boarding. Staff spoke excellent English and announcements were made in both French and English. Flight attendants were friendly the seats fully reclined and the pillow and blanket were comfortable. Plane was clean and bathrooms spacious. Individual TV's with plenty of choice. Passengers kept well informed throughout. Upon arrival in Paris immigration took about 5 seconds. A little disappointed with the lounge at CDG. Flight to Lisbon delayed 40 minutes. Flight aboard a B737. Service on this flight was surly. Overall I would definitely take the transatlantic flight again but would try to avoid the CDG-LIS flight.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,4,nan,4,no,nan,3,Booked seat Paris to Singapore months ago 2 seats together with my wife. 7 days before flight they change the seats my wife and I on separate sides of the plane. Contact Air France who refuse to change our seats. 4 days before our flight we find we have no seats allocated and are told we may get seats together when we check in. What a terrible way to treat customers. Their customer relations service is abysmal. Will not travel again with this company and hope that this information will make other people wary of travelling with this company.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,2,nan,3,yes,nan,4,Flew to St Martin from Paris. We paid extra for the 'Ocean' inflight meal (£12 each). For this we got a starter with 4 prawns and a small forkful of crunchy vegetables followed by small cubes of salmon and rice. The bread and cheese was the same as the ordinary meal. No glasses were provided for the standard quarter bottle of wine. I had to ask twice for a glass. No mineral water was provided as was with the standard meal. The dessert was a soggy tart pastry base with some lemon flavoured mush on it. Bearing in mind we had already paid for a standard meal in the ticket price and were paying extra for this tray Air France should be ashamed for ripping us off in this way. The standard meal looked better than ours and had a glass and mineral water. Do not upgrade your meal. French cuisine? No way!,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,4,AF 184 CDG-HKG with Boeing 777. Seat plus in Economy class on Emergency exit so plenty of space for the legs. Food was ok not gourmet-cuisine but a lot (snacks dinner sandwich ice cream snacks breakfast). Crew very nice. I was expecting a horrible long flight it actually turned out to be one my most enjoyable AF flights in Economy. On the other hand Flight back to Paris with KLM on the old 747 half cargo was a bad joke.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,1,"Flew CDG-BKK-CDG with the awful Boeing 777-300ER (77W) that Air France is using on the BKK route. Just two words: never again! The seat is very uncomfortable and is announced 32"" pitch but I cannot understand how this is measured as you feel confined in a tiny space and your knees keep being hurt with the magazine holder. Forget if you are taller than 5'6"". For drinking and although AF advertises about Champagne even in Economy it was not possible to obtain more than a reduced choice of beverages and of course no Champagne. As I had ordered a vegetarian meal there was no wine with my dinner and the food was bland. Staff very ineffective and chatting loudly all the time in the galley never cleaning the cabin (some rubbish have been staying on the floor for 9 hours). IFE screen is very poor. A pity for more than 900 euros comparing with other airlines for instance Thai Airways that also has a direct flight. Maybe Premium Economy or Business classes are more comfortable but Premium Eco is double price and I do not think it is worth it.",nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,4,no,nan,3,Ho Chi Minh to Paris seats in economy were good and the entertainment system was fine. We boarded on time and took off the cabin crew came round after an hour with first meal and it was ok. There was supposed to be a self service system on board but it apparently ran out of sandwiches and snacks. It was supposed to be haagen dazs ice cream but in fact it was a cheap type. The food running out is a disgrace and on such a long haul 12 hours it is the only flight I have been on with nothing to eat for 9 hours between meals. The crew could not be bothered.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,3,no,nan,1,Flew LHR to BKK via CDG (Economy) December 2013. Seats very narrow on Boeing 777 and less comfortable than seats on British Airways EVA and Thai Airways which I have used on flights to Bangkok previously. IFE was OK. Food outbound to BKK was good with good wine and cheese. On the return journey back from Bangkok the food was poor with some type of very fatty meat as a main course that I (and my wife) could not eat or even identify. Furthermore after the main meal it was a long long time until breakfast was served leaving myself and my fellow passengers hungry. I later established that snacks were available if you made your own way to the galley to collect them but this availability was not announced and by the time I realised (whilst visiting the toilet) all of the sandwiches and most of the ice creams had gone (NOT acceptable). Cabin crew were pleasant and polite but did not seem proactive in any way and (to me) this was evidenced by the fact that they did not bother to serve the snacks or make any announcement as to their availability. The interconnection at CDG was pretty seamless and posed no problem at all. Given the narrow and uncomfortable seats and the poor catering and associated service on the aircraft I would not recommend that you use this airline for this journey unless BA / EVA / Thai are all significantly more expensive for your chosen dates.,nan,3,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,3,LAX-CDG-LAX. A positive experience. On par with the best European carriers. A380 upper deck seats are not state-of-the-art but basically lie-flat and do the job. Big entertainment screen with great options. Service was excellent; lots of smiles and effort to make comfortable. Food was better out of Paris than LA. On return flight plane's engine broke before take-off and airline put all passengers up at hotel for the night; business class got The Holiday Inn. The airline tried their best during a chaotic situation. Would fly again for sure.,nan,3,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,3,Flew from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur changing at Paris CDG the outbound connecting flight was operated by flybe. We did not have seat details for this leg until check in and they seemed very perplexed at the check-in counter about what to do about onward flights in business class. The girl on the desk did not even know where KL was! After boarding the flight there was a problem with the plane and after a wait we were moved onto a different smaller plane and all allocated seat numbers then became obsolete and we ended up somewhere near the back. On the flight from Paris the choice of main course had run out before they got to us on row 7! The food was ok had better and had far worse maybe my expectations were rather high with it being a French airline. The cabin staff were very good. The seats were flat but slightly angled and as a result not quite as comfortable as could have been. I also found the fabric of the seat a bit on the scratchy side and ended up having to put a blanket between me and the seat to make it more comfortable for sleeping. Was surprised on the return leg to find the plane stopped away from the terminal and we had to be bussed in fortunately the plane was on time or this could have made catching our connection very tight. It was a very reasonable price and I would fly with them again if I could not get a good price from the likes of Emirates or Singapore airlines.,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Flew MAN-CDG-HAV return. The only problem was CDG see airport review. I will use this airline again but only for direct flights not via CDG.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,4,nan,2,no,nan,1,Flew CDG to PEK on new year's eve. Being a flying blue gold member I'd booked a seat by an exit for extra comfort (at no extra charge for gold and platinum members) but was reassigned to the back in the middle. When I protested and pointed out that I'd booked another seat I was told there was nothing they could do except buy an upgrade to premium economy. The staff was obviously not thrilled to be flying on December 31st and that reflected in their cold rather unfriendly demeanour but that attitude is nothing new to people who fly AF regularly. The worst part is the old outdated barely-hanging-on cabin interior. My IFE kept resetting and the screen kept shaking with 3 second gaps where it would go dark. The rest of the seat was threadbare and the magazine holder at the bottom of the front seat was broken so that a bit of metal kept biting into my knee. When I chose to stand for a while just because my neighbours were infringing on my personal space and because my knee was hurting I was told by a flight attendant to go stand at the back of the plane.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,4,Paris CDG to Shanghai in an A380 F-HPJH. Brand new A380 less than a year old. Very nice seat and entertainment program.

nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,DEL-CDG with connection within Europe return. The long distance flights were excellent especially the daytime return flight to Delhi. The lounge in CDG is excellent and the food on the flight was superb better than any other airline I have taken in years. Seat although not totally flat was comfortable and the entertainment system was good. Crew were professional. The European flights were without personality operated by Hop! with no real food or service. Long distance AF I found better than Lufthansa or Emirates business. But I find that economy is the acid test most first world airlines have good long distance business class it's economy short haul where they lose it.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,4,nan,1,yes,nan,4,Flight 1904 CDG (Paris) to FCO (Rome) January 16 2014. I was unable to select a seat on the Air France website or by phone. However during my short layover in Paris the ticket counter person gave me a nice seat (10A). The seat was above-average and I was able to sleep comfortably during most of the flight. The FAs were competent. The complimentary snack they provided was good: sandwich and small bottle of wine.,nan,4,nan

nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,Singapore-Paris on AF257. Plane was an old 777 not in great shape. Unpleasant smell and not very clean. Seats very cramped and awful for a long flight. Food terrible one of the worst experienced. Service from crew feels cold and distant. No service of drinks/water in between meals one has to go to the back galley for self service for water and snacks - which was also awful limited choice. Crew literally disappears for most of the flight a good 10 hours and appear only 2 hours prior to arrival for breakfast service. Inflight entertainment is a sad looking small screen with blurry images and poor sound system and even worse limited selection of shows. Really I wish there was more positive things I can say about this flight - but it was overall a great disappointment - you know it's not good when you feel like you just want the flight to end quickly and keep looking at the time wishing it will go faster so you can get out! This flight made me feel depressed very tired very hungry and I kept wishing I had taken Singapore Airline or even Emirates on this route.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,3,nan,3,no,nan,3,LAX-CDG on A380 and from CDG-CMN on A320. One of the worst routes I've had. I was shocked with their service cleanliness and seats although I bought a seat plus! I was very disappointed with what they call a seat plus and I don't recommend anybody pay for them as they are not worth it. The seats were very uncomfortable we were sitting in the first row the TV screen that comes out from the side of the seat was not aligned in a way where you can watch comfortably and there were no window as shown on the seat plan. The flight attendants were the rudest I've seen on a plane. Bathrooms were not clean food was ok. On the way back though it was different. The seats were good on the A380 the seat was in the upper deck and was not a seat plus it was much better then the seat plus. The flight attendants on both flights from CMN to CDG and from CDG to New York were very friendly and helpful. The food was better on the return flight as well.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,3,no,nan,1,"Atlanta to Paris twice in December 2013. On both the Atlanta-Paris flights the first immediate sensation upon boarding the plane was the strong stench of urine. Imagine suffering that for the first 2-3 hours of the flight. On the Air France flight from Paris to Bangalore at takeoff the door to one of the four toilets was already taped up and marked ""unusable"". 3 hours into the flight the one across from it got clogged up leaving only two operating toilets for the entire Economy section. The food was terrible not even properly heated up. There were no snacks brought out by staff. The seats have no cushioning left completely worn out. The quality of service has decreased a lot over the past 2 years.",nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,4,no,nan,1,BKK-CDG. This was my first flight with Air France (and last). What a big disappointment it was. On a 12.5-hour flight I thought we would be served plenty of food and drink. First serving was ok but after that the service was extremely poor. The cabin crew sat in the galley chatting with each other the whole trip. I bothered the staff by asking if i could get a glass of juice and some snacks. I could not believe what I heard when they said that they had run out juice snacks and sandwiches. Second serving came about two hours before landing or nine hours since we last ate so we were really hungry but the food was pitiful and inedible. The only positive thing on this flight was the IFE. I strongly advise against traveling with Air France but if you do it despite this warning don't forget to bring sandwiches with you.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,3,nan,4,yes,nan,3,CDG-PVG (Shanghai). I got a good deal probably as it was a China Eastern code share. On time in both directions. Upgraded to Premium Eco on their A380 on the way out. Spacious aircraft good service pretty good IFE good range of drinks including champagne (digestifs on the menu but they don't come around to offer it) but the food is rather bland. Breakfast not very nice and nasty coffee served with powdered creamer. I woke up 3/4 of the way through the flight due a sore bottom - disappointing that the Prem Eco seats on a new aircraft should be so uncomfortable. Return on an older B777 in economy was actually more pleasant - felt more airy well maintained if a bit worn but cosier somehow with more comfortable seats. Not well equipped for China despite now flying to four destinations and partnering with MU. Only one interpreter aboard no Chinese-speaking cabin attendants. Problematic for a few passengers. Also transferring in PVG is a pain - you need to clear immigration customs and then check-in again (you might have to wait for it to open if longer than 4 hours before departure). This took 2 hours on the way out. Day stopover on the way in but I had to put my bag in left luggage as they can't check it through. Decent product work to be done.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,4,no,nan,3,KIX-CDG. Flight departed on time and after the terrible and insufficient meal service attendants passed and lowered all window blinds I refused to close mine (the main reason I chose this flight though I know how mediocre AF is was exactly because I wanted to avoid a night flight) and 3 different attendants came to ask me (politely though) to close it since most passengers wanted to either sleep (it was 2 in the afternoon) or watch a film. Most windows shields were only opened upon landing this is 10 hours later! During the second meal service (even worse than the first one) a hostess dared wake up the passenger sleeping next to me in order to offer him a tray . I consider this a lack of respect. I read that they are trying to raise their standards in order to match the Gulf and other Asian airlines but they still have a very long way to go.,nan,2,nan
nan,First Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,A380 JFK-CDG-VRN and back. The service was very good on both flights. Flight attendants were very polite attentive and friendly. All requests were given promptly. The check-in escort experience at JFK was very good. The agent visited me in the lounge to make sure everything was ok engaged in small talk escorted me to the plane and introduced me to the FAs. The food on flight out of JFK was average for first class. The seat privacy may not be an enclosed suite but it is far enough from other seats to feel the privacy. I am not a privacy freak American anyway. IFE/TV may not be as good but it is not the thing I care since I rarely watch anything on the flights. Bed quality and size were very good. The lounge experiences in Paris is nothing to compare! Nothing comes close to Air France First Class Lounge experience. The design of the lounge is modern and tasteful. Everybody at Air France First Lounge was friendly attentive. They also leave you alone to give privacy but when you gave the sign that you need anything you get fast/polite/genuine responses. Every agents that will give me some service/escorts came to introduce themselves and engaged in small talks. The massages were very good. The food and wine were also the highlight. Food quality/presentation/taste and service were on par with top restaurants. The Limo escorts to the flights were very nice and made me feel like a king. The agent from the first visit remembered my return flight to JFK. While he couldn't be there that day he sent over another agent to come say goodbye and wished me a good flight while I was seated on the plane. CDG-JFK service was even better the FAs were very professional genuinely friendly and attentive. The food out of CDG was much better. Arrival escort at JFK was good. She walked with me all the way outside to send me off with Delta Agent for my connecting flights. All in all the best experience I ever got in first class.,nan,5,nan

nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,Flew from Toronto to Paris on Boeing 777 seats were small and uncomfortable. Checking in at Toronto airport at KLM/Air France counter was a disaster. Long line ups and poor customer service. I wasn't able to check in online or at the self service kiosk due to the infant. Flight attendants disappear after they quickly serve the meal. I requested a special meal which was very small and I was still hungry. Meal was about a half cup of rice with a finger size fish fillet. No flight attendants to be seen until a snack was served half hour before landing. A small muffin with juice. Coming back from Paris to Toronto was pretty much the same story - uncomfortable seats no service and small meal.,nan,1,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,5,"LIN-ORY-FDF return. Premium Economy is a great compromise between business and economy especially with AF B777s which squeeze 10 rows across in economy and is unbearably claustrophobic especially on the Caribbean routes when they cram in 468 passengers in a B777-300ER (more than a B747). Premium is great service excellent (same service and food as business). Premium seats very comfortable slide forward rather than recline pitch 36"" on their B777-300ER Caribbean routes (other routes it is 38"") but the width and armrests make a huge difference and the TV screens same as business. Entertainment system is old and needs modernising however. Having travelled in the past in AF business I wouldn't recommend it (slanting flat bed is rubbish!) but would definitely travel premium again. Well done AF great staff attitude improvement in the last few years too.",nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,AF256 CDG-SIN. The return flight was a bit better due to a more pleasant set of crew although I do feel the level of engagement with passengers is lacking and crew members just doing the minimal task of serving the 2 meals quickly and then disappearing in between meal service which makes up a good part of the long flight. The real problem with AF is their planes - just not comfortable for long haul - cramped seating 3-4-3 in a 777 aircraft in a full flight feels suffocating crowded very unpleasant and the inflight entertainment needs a major upgrading - small screen with blurry images that keeps hanging and limited selection. There is also no extras like an ice cream after main meal or selection of snacks and fruits in between meals. In fact the food served is terrible one of the worst ever experienced. I was left very tired and hungry. The scrambled eggs served for breakfast was so overcooked and heated it was like puddle of yellow mud with a small sausage looking awkward in the mess. I think it gives the impression of no care given. That about sums up my experience with AF. Until they improve on the service and product best to look for other options.,nan,2,nan

Long haul (A380 economy) was a short haul experience on a long haul flight. I found the seats were thinly padded and barely reclined food short-haul standard. Where the French no doubt find the cabin crew efficient and focused as a Brit I found them professional but stand-offish and unwelcoming. No > concept at check-in of spreading the passengers round the cabin to give everyone a bit more space. An uncomfortable and not particularly pleasant flight.,nan,2,nan

My biggest complaint for a very long haul flight is that the IFE is not good enough for the price the Business traveller pays for the entire package. It is lacking functionality and lacks any decent programming content.

Plane was full as previous flight cancelled due to strike. In flight service was good if a little hurried due to short flight time. Seat comfort was OK provided seat in front was not reclined. Obviously no IFE provided.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,3,no,nan,3,A horrible experience travelling from Toronto to Paris. Flight attendants didn't speak proper English and couldn't understand me. They just threw my food into my lap as I was trying to wake up and open my table and quickly walked away. They would walk around really fast and disappear for a long time probably hoping to avoid contact with passengers. I had to press the flight attendant button almost 6 times to get a glass of water. Food was okay but the fact that flight attendants were so bad just made the trip horrible. This was the first and last time I'll take Air France!,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,3,nan,3,yes,nan,4,I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Paris CDG on the 11th February. It was a very pleasant flight. Probably my best medium-haul flight with Air France.

nan,Economy Class,2,nan,1,nan,4,no,nan,2,We have just returned from our first long haul flight with Air France and it was not a pleasant experience. The new Airbus 380 have next to no leg room in economy I'm only 5' 9'' and yet was cramped. Luckily I had an aisle seat and could put my legs into the aisle so long as I didn't trip anyone. The inflight meals were cold yes even the hot ones. The steward serving my wife tried three separate servings all cold and gave up. We did the return leg with KLM and for it to be part of the same company was amazing as it was the opposite good staff good food and reasonable leg room all be it on a different type of aircraft.,nan,3,nan
nan,Business Class,2,nan,2,nan,3,no,nan,2,Business class CDG to IAD older 777 with a seat that when extended into the sleeping position pinched my feet because it was improperly aligned the food was unappetizing and the sauce spilt from the serving cup onto the entire plate. The service was haughty. In general a pedestrian airline that charges top dollar for its product. Cannot compare to Turkish business class which is generally 30 % or more less expensive.,nan,2,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,3,nan,4,yes,nan,5,Paris-Lagos on 2 Feb 2014. Very pleasant flight. Cabin crew were very friendly premium economy seats were comfortable with a lot of leg space.

nan,Economy Class,4,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,2,Despite all the bad reviews about Air-France it is still the only Airline in the world who offers French Champagne (not cheap bubbly) for aperitif and Cognac after your meal no other airline does this! Recently flew from CDG to Kuala Lumpur and both flights were great with a service minded and friendly crew. Glad both flights were not full and the cramped 10 across seats on the Boeing 772 didn't feel too bad.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,1,nan,3,no,nan,1,"BKK-CDG 6 March 2014 on a 777-300. After having years of good experiences flying on Air France this was a huge disappointment. The seat pitch is ridiculously tight 22"" at best. I'm 194 cm tall. It was excruciating for a 12 hour flight. When the person in front me reclined immediately upon boarding my knees were crushed. The catering service was also completely inadequate. The first meal was served within 45 minutes after departure no drinks service beforehand. Instead a tiny bottle of cheap red wine came included on the meal tray. (It appears that the days of receiving Champagne even in economy are long gone.) The food itself was okay but there wasn't much of it. There was no food or drinks service for another 9 hours until a small meal was served just before landing by which time I was extremely hungry. This was a daytime flight which made the lack of service especially hard to fathom. There are drinks and snacks in the galley during the flight but I could not get out of my seat as I was boxed in the window seat by two people who did not did leave their seats for the entire flight and there was no room to get out. Their 777-300 aircraft has a 3-4-3 layout so the odds of finding yourself boxed into one of these tiny seats are quite high. Given the premium that AF charges on this route I will be much more likely to fly one of their Asian or Middle Eastern competitors in the future if this is how cut-rate their service is going to be moving forward. When disembarking from the flight I noticed that their premium economy and business class sections also appeared to be very cramped on this aircraft. I'm very disappointed with Air France and I am probably unlikely to go out of my way to maintain Flying Blue Elite status in the future.",nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,5,nan,5,no,nan,5,TXL-CDG-LAX. Both flights on time CDG-LAX on A380 special meal request honored good IFE clean cabin that was maintained during the flight most staff courteous and helpful. Wheelchair assistance requested for both CDG and LAX upon arrival in CDG none was available so my accompanying passenger had to walk the long distance between CDG Terminals 2F and 2L by herself. Somewhat compensated by security staff letting us use the Priority line for passport control and boarding. CDG-LAX: Usually after the meal service the majority of the cabin staff would go to their rest area and the cabin would be darkened. Well not on Air France. Before disappearing the cabin crew left a few trolleys loaded with snacks and drinks in the aft galley so that area turned into the most popular spot on the plane. My seat was in row 45 immoderately after the galley bulkhead so I was pulled into the bar action. At one time I counted about 25 people crammed into the galley area. There were several groups of 3-4 people each who just hung out for what seemed hours kept drinking alcohol and were becoming louder and louder. As all the lights in the galley were left on and as the curtain was open all the time due to the high passenger traffic the entire aft cabin was brightly illuminated and rendered the otherwise great concept of mood lighting completely useless. The economy class purser arrived shortly thereafter and listened to my complaint and then explained that it was airline policy not to provide beverages and snack runs between the meals as most airlines do but to keep the galley fully opened to the passengers for self-service. The party went on for the next 5 hours until the FA's were back and the second meal/beverage service was started. All in all this was a very unpleasant experience showing the complete lack of effort from the FAs and the pursers to rectify a situation in which a passenger was being inconvenienced. My recommendation: if you want to sleep on the AF 380 stay clear of the aft main deck cabin (rows 45 and up).,nan,5,nan

Seated at the back of the plane which smelt of urine at least for the first few hours of the trip. Seats are probably around 30 years old and completely worn out. It's impossible to raise the arms between the seats and the TV screen embedded in the seat in front of you is about 3x3 inches in size and blurry and impossible to watch. Staff friendly and helpful.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,2,nan,5,yes,nan,2,CDG-JNB-CDG. A380s Y class is probably the showcase of AF in this class. AF tries hard to make it a sophisticated experience: excellent IFE with lots of films good headphones for Y sleeping mask nice lights and music small bar with drinks and ice creams… But I was most of all impressed by the crews on both flights: very experienced extremely attentive very polite but with a sense of humour. These FAs like to interact with passengers and do care about their job as opposed to the robotic FAs of some airlines! One the downside meals were very disappointing and limited not sophisticated at all they used to be much better. Seats were OK but legroom was bad not a good experience if you're tall plus AF makes you pay for exit seats.,nan,4,nan

We only have 2 companies flying directly to Europe one is Iberia (awful) and the other Air France. I choose Air France every time I can despite their prices have been rising over the past 2 years. Food was nice you can even buy a special menu if you want I ordered non diabetic food and it was even tasty! They also provided ice cream beverages and yoghurt during flight. Plus they were very helpful at CDG indicating ways to connect to our next flight. Entertainment was nice too a lot of good options. I tried to buy a ticket for a place with extra room leg for my father but it wasn't available. The only downside I had was that the flight at Heathrow was delayed about one hour so we had to rush (literally run) our way in CDG to not miss the flight home. Love the fact they provide a direct flight from Santiago to Paris.,nan,4,nan

nan,Economy Class,2,nan,1,nan,2,no,nan,1,CDG to Riyadh in Y class on the A330-200. This was one of the worst travel experiences I have had in recent years. I booked with Saudi who codeshare on this day of the week and went to check in at the Saudi desks in 2C. This was a mistake but Air France counter staff nearby were rude and unhelpful. Their customer service skills were so poor. Air France insists you use the automatic check in when travelling in this cabin but after queuing and following on screen instructions the machine then prints a notice telling you to go to the desk for traditional check in. Boarding was ridiculously slow and badly handled. Scanners failed to read every other card and just two agents on duty had to input details manually. The flight was scheduled for 1330 and was full but boarding did not begin until after 1300. The Y class seating configuration is grotesquely cramped. Seats are narrow with very little space. Should the passenger in front recline their seat the minuscule television screen will be almost touching your nose. Riyadh is not an especially lengthy sector but six hours in these tiny and packed rows was five hours too long. The seats cause real discomfort. The meal was only just hot and not pleasant and the red wine offered was very poor quality. Cheap plonk. Crews had barely enough space to move the trolley. Air France makes much of the glass of champagne it offers to all passengers but every other aspect of the service was very unpleasant indeed. Not to be repeated.,nan,2,nan

Positive points of Air France Premium Economy: Seat is very spacious provides enough space for the arms and you can comfortably stretch your legs. Food is nice with starter and dessert. Negative points: The seat's padding: it feels like not existing and it is like sitting on a hard chair. By sitting on the provided blanket it is bearable for a long haul flight. The reclined position: The headrest does not move and forces your head in a strange bend forward position - sleeping is not really possible.,nan,3,nan

The premium economy seating ""fixed shell"" AF claims to offer didn't exist on these aircraft's. The seats we were given were the same or worse than a standard economy seats. Flight AF1279 from Dublin to Paris was tighter than a standard economy seat. It was one of the most uncomfortable flying experiences I have had in more than 50 years of flying. Flight AF 1404 Paris to Rome was a larger jet but still had the standard six economy seats per row. We booked 4 premium economy seats. AF claims there is ""40% more room"". AF claims there is a ""fixed shell"" in premium economy. The claims about for premium economy are untrue. We feel let down.

In order to avoid charges AF agent proposed me to purchase a hand cabin luggage at the airport and carry it with me in cabin. So did I. Luggage went through general security check however at the boarding gate I was asked to check it in without explanation. Equipment was a grotty A330-200 very reduced pitch IFE was not working cabin crew were incredibly rude and Chef de Cabine was behaving like a jail keeper. Food was inedible with very small portions toilets were dirty and smelly with no soap available. Arrival at CDG: dirty airport rude police agents absent ground staff. CDG-BCN was delayed without explanation and to end the bad dream second piece of luggage (hand cabin bag) did not fly to BCN and was kept at GIG.

The AVOD on the B777-300 was quite outdated but the service was amazing and extremely nice. Everyone spoke Portuguese which was great for me. The food was very good. The seat comfort was worse than on KLM. The transfer in CDG was a breeze even though I had a 40 minute connection. The flight to TXL was uneventful and had the service was just professional.

Check-in agent in AMS wasn't able to put me on those seats. At CDG a very friendly and helpful agent did. Cabin half empty seats quite good for economy and service friendly and professional despite the late departure hour. BUE to CDG on 777. Seats cramped and seat configuration defies logic. Seats are so arranged that for window passengers there is nothing but the window itself to lean against and try to sleep. Easily one of the worst long haul economy propositions I've come across.

nan,Economy Class,4,nan,1,nan,5,yes,nan,4,As a Delta Platinum member who flies mostly on Air France I was astonished when Air France took away my wife's seat and put her on a waiting list when traffic kept us from arriving at the airport in Paris until 90 minutes before the flight. This was despite our being on the same reservation - with an 8 year old child with us! I was told that a Flying Blue Elite Plus member would have been treated the same way which is even worse than thinking it was an aberration. This is the second time that Air France's computer system tried to separate my family. Luckily a very nice agent managed to get this fixed although we then had to run to the gate. Then in the flight the food was truly the worst we have ever eaten on an international flight. My son and I ate almost nothing during an 11 hour flight. The deterioration in Air France's food over the last two years is dramatic. On the positive side the crew was very nice and the new 380 aircraft was unusually quiet and had decent leg room for economy seats. The entertainment program was also good.,nan,3,nan

Flight attendants were impeccable - attentive all smiles efficient present at all times - and more than happy to converse in a variety of languages other than French (including German). Food and drinks were plenty well presented and of high quality. For those who like in-flight entertainment there was an abundance to choose from including lots of music and screens of decent size. As a nice add-on AF Y+ gives you some extra services (""sky priority"" i.e. quicker check in customer services and boarding and fast lane access at security / immigration) which are particularly useful at CDG.

Worst thing was the IFE like something from the late 90's choice was minimal and screen quality awful.

As always: You see the (always polite) crew the first 1.5 hour of the flight and then again the very last hour. Be it day or night flight. For the first time with AF I saw the cabin-crew serving water from bottles between meals. Hot meal is fine the so called breakfast a joke for us who do not rely entirely on sugar. I have now learned how to go from terminal 2F/E to 2G with the ""on-tarmac shuttle-bus"" and it makes the connection very fast and easy. Recommend AF? Only if price is low.

The equipment was changed on the return flight and I was notified of seat changes which required a call. 1 month before the flight they cancelled the return flight and rebooked on a different day without notification although they had email text phone information. I discovered this accidentally 3 weeks before the flight and contacted Air France and spent 1.5 hours on the phone making new arrangements with a choice of my money back or a flight on a different day. The flight at this time had almost doubled so I stayed an additional day with additional costs. When I contacted Air France their complaint process is difficult and eventually unproductive. I fly only once a year international but was disappointed by this airline.,nan,2,nan

Business class was just poor and mean the 2-3-2 seating is unacceptable - had preselected aisle seat but when went to checkin online had been put in a middle seat. There was one available aisle left row 12 with toilets behind. Everything was just tacky lots of plastic and plastic wrapping on amenities - having disposable covers for the headphones is unpleasant - but probably necessary since the headphones appear fixed in the seat. Entertainment offerings were basic food exceedingly average. amenities pack basic blanket made of that rather nasty artificial velour-type material that feels like it will give you an electric shock. Seats uncomfortable headrest juts forwards armrests solid so can't use as arm rests. They may be upgrading their business class but should be discounting what they offer - I travel frequently and I've had better food entertainment systems and amenities in other airline's premium economy. This experience was by far the least of any business class I've flown in the last 5 years. Staff were fine doing their job politely.,nan,1,nan

The service was really good very friendly and professional having recently taken Singapore Airlines on the same route I had low expectations. Food was lovely - quality good presentation and flavoursome. The IFE was not the best; difficult to navigate around cumbersome - however had some interesting films.

nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,3,nan,4,yes,nan,4,AF Premium Economy is an upgrade to an already good Economy product at least on the Airbus A380. Noteworthy - and better than on BA - is that on short-haul flights to Pairs with Air France PE passengers are seated in Business and receive business class service. Only the middle seat is not free as in Business. On my flight from CDG to SFO the crew were very friendly the food was good and the PE seats provide a lot of private space. I could sleep for a few hours but people who complain that the shell seats are too hard will be pleased to hear that AF also replaces the cushions in the A380 seats (and improve the touchscreen). You get an amenity kit sky priority boarding and check in plus a slightly better main meal. No pre-flight cocktails and certainly not the enhanced catering as on Air New Zealand. However if you need to work and/or want to watch a few movies in a comfortable environment and cannot afford business class then AF PE is definitely worth checking out.,nan,4,nan

Long awaited vacations had to be cut short by this whole day as even though we were in their head quarters in Paris they had no airplanes to replace this. We had to wait in a bed and breakfast next to the hotel for the whole day and night and Air France offered no compensation terrible customer handling no one properly explains anything their personnel are rude entertainment screen for my husband did not work on the flight the staff are surprised by upset customers. We flew the next day wish we had never flown with them just a ruined start to a long awaited vacation and no customer service considering that we paid over 2000 euros for the flights.

If you are not French you don't count at AF even if you do your best to address the staff in French. Big difference with the friendliness shown by the staff a sister company KLM. Seats are OK but I don't understand that when AF overhauled their business class some years ago they didn't go for flat beds (even not on the brand new A380).

On the return flight two rows ahead of me were vacant so a few of us were moved into them to break up the row and give us more space. I chose the Italian dinner from the A La Carte menu.

From the minute we entered the international terminal in Atlanta GA to the minute we left Paris on an Air Austria flight bound for Vienna I have nothing but wonderful things to say about AF. The staff in Atlanta went beyond their job description to make our check in and transition to the jet as perfect as it could be. Yes the food isn't gourmet but it was hot tasty and filling. We had a decent Merlot and our stewardess served us each 2 little bottles of VSOP Cognac. The cabin was clean and comfortable. A great selection of movies. There was more leg room than on domestic flights. Service was kind and considerate. The cabin was darkened and it was quiet and easy to rest. We were served a basic fruit/coffee/muffin breakfast nothing fancy but it was OK. All in all the best thing about AF is the people.,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,4,NCL-CDG-BOG-CDG-NC.L Decent fare during Air France sale and added benefit of avoiding overnight stay in MAD or transit through PTY with KLM. A little apprehensive after reading a few past reviews. Air France treat you excellently in Affaires and it does feel a little like business class used to be - something special. Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).,nan,5,nan

We were refused entry to the lounge on return in Paris even though the premium economy tickets state that we are permitted to use the business class lounge. I would not fly Air France again.

The flight back departed with an hour or so delayed because the crew of the flight arrived late making me lose my connecting flight to Lisbon with more than 4 hours difference from what was schedule. I was offered a voucher for a sandwich + drink. I won't fly again with Air France because even though nothing serious happened it could have because they showed at various levels lack of reliability.

We checked in on time with two suit cases for our short journey to Paris (CDG). Flight was enjoyable however the breakfast was poor croissant stale service slow. There were no signs at CDG telling us where our next connection was. All it needed was a screen at the exit to show the flights desks and connecting details. It left us wondering around between L & D2 and the Duty Free. Fortunately the plane took off late so we did not miss our connection. However the reason why it was late some passengers did not check in so bags were unloaded (including ours as we later found out to our cost) and on arriving in Tunis one of our bags was missing. After a long wait in the baggage hall we  with several other passengers who had the Air France experience reported the loss but as no one there could speak English we left hoping that our bag would be sent on to us. Twenty four hours later it was not. We are still waiting for someone from the line to explain and return our luggage.

Like the experiences of other reviewers here after the first meal had been cleared away the crew appeared once with water and once with ice-cream then disappeared before serving breakfast. Meals were poor but a selection of snacks (hot soup sandwiches cookies and drinks) were available in the galley. The entertainment system was a disappointment after flying this route several times over the last years with other airlines. The personal screen was small and hard to see and movie choices very limited especially for children. My biggest complaint was the standards of cleanliness. The plane was obviously quite old (with ashtrays still on the doors at the back) and looked a little worse for wear (toilets looked particularly grubby) but there is no excuse for the lack of cleaning. When I unclipped my try for the first meal there was a used tissue stuck in there and the tray was covered in crumbs. Someone had either been sick over or spilled their lunch over the (very bulky) airline magazine in the seat pocket of my daughter leaving it sticky and smelly. Somehow staff were unable to regulate the temperature in the plane and it was quite cold (other passengers wrapping themselves up in whatever they had with them)- aside from 45 minutes or so in the middle of the night when the heating system had obviously been turned on full-blast and the cabin turned into an oven. The blankets looked very tatty and dirty and when released from their meaningless plastic bag proved to be covered in thick long black hairs. I opened all the bags of our party of four and they were all equally as filthy so went unused. In terms of value we booked the flight 9 months in advance and got a decent price but I hope I never have to use AirFrance again.,nan,4,nan

We were able to select seats by checking in on the Air France website which was easy to use. Check in at CDG was a nightmare - I don't think I've waited this long for economy check-in - the fact that this was business class (in the sky priority area) made it really bad. There seemed to be about 6 counters open for all of Air France business class at CDG (hundreds of people - huge line snaking on for ever). No priority pass for customs/security. Lounge was good (see separate review). 777-200ER plane full in business. Service was excellent - excellent staff polite and efficient. I quite like the seat - although its not horizontal quite comfy for lounging some minor acrobatics had to be performed if you are not on the aisle and need to get over someone who is fully stretched out. Food was acceptable for plane food although they did run out of my choice (sitting in 4K). Champagne was delicious (Ayala) and they set up a self service bar in the galley - very much preferred to constantly pressing the call button. No priority pass given for customs at SGN. Although this flight was not perfect the 11 hours went by in a flash and I had a great time and would not hesitate to recommend Air France.,nan,4,nan

Coming back slightly older 777 with no USB port which was annoying. Very uncomfortable seats couldn't really get into any sleeping position.

CDG is so big and the staff there so difficult so slow and we were asked for passports 4 times! The long haul flight was ok food was ok and the IFE was ok.

nan,Business Class,4,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,Flew from LAX-CDG on the A380. We were in the second Business Class cabin on the upper deck. We had a very handsome friendly all-male crew who provided a nice if not amazing service on the 11-hour flight. Seats are not lie flat but still very comfortable affording me a long sleep. The food was good if unmemorable. The IFE provided a decent selection but is not comprehensive enough to be competitive with the top airlines. Overall this was a nice flight. There was nothing too spectacular about it but I would fly in Business with them again (especially now that they are upgrading to lie-flat seats).,nan,4,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,Went to Oslo via Paris by Air France from Canada. Two Stops: Both had delays. One overnight due to maintenance issues. They managed to lose my luggage as well. The service was the worst I have had. Will never fly Air France again.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,5,My wife and I flew with our adult children and grandchildren (5 and 21 months old) on the 6th of June YYZ-CDG and 16th of June CDG-YYZ. On board service was impeccable crew were extremely helpful resourceful and friendly. Even the meals - especially on the CDG-YYZ flight - was above normal airline food. A further plus was the good air- quality on board. Best flights to and from Europe we have had!,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,3,Air France 254 CDG to SIN July 9. As a French national I like to fly with Air France when it's possible. The team on board was very efficient. They provided their new bed sheet and pillow which makes a difference and means you can have a better sleep. The food is always excellent.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,3,nan,1,yes,nan,3,Air France (Hop!) LIL-BOD. 1 hour short flight with the CRJ700 security and boarding was quick and efficient at the Lesquin airport (no priority for elite members) drinks and a very small snack served after takeoff followed by sweets before landing. Good service overall.,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,2,nan,3,nan,1,no,nan,3,Air France 006 or Delta 1020 on July 29 2014 Seat 61F Airbus 380. I paid 100% of a business class ticket on Air France airbus 380 and this is what I got: The entertainment system didn't work and the smell of urine coming from the toilet was unacceptable. Asked to have a seat changed but was told the flight was sold out. Next time Air France will not be my first choice.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,3,nan,2,yes,nan,3,Nice-Venice. A319. Packed. Delayed on departure. On time at arrival. Very cheap ticket (cheaper than Easyjet and with more luggage). Seats did not reclined. Service was ok.,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,4,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,JFK-CDG-NCE and FRA-CDG in Business. At JFK terminal 1 already looks old and decrepit compared to other new terminals. The AF lounge was closed due to renovation and we used JL lounge which was pretty disappointing. On board service was decent but agree with comments that for a country which prides itself on food AF food was disappointing. Seats were not the new ones but still decent and managed 3 hours of sleep. CDG-NCE and FRA-CDG was a total let down with just middle seat blocked ; no clue why European carriers do this yet seem to think this is a huge service- would be easier to have bigger seats like in US. Product still not close to EK or SQ but maybe with new seats it will come close.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,3,nan,1,no,nan,3,Flew from IAD to PRG via CDG. Delayed about 1 hour because of problems with cargo loading air-conditioning during that time not operational. Flight Entertainment had to be reset twice. In cabin about ten screaming infants. Not a pleasant flight.,nan,2,nan
nan,Business Class,2,nan,3,nan,2,no,nan,4,"ICN-CDG. Business Class. B777-300. No queue at check-in. No priority security lane (although there was only a short queue anyway). The KAL lounge near to the gate was adequate. Separate First/Business boarding lane. Initial impressions were of a cabin that is past its best. The seat arms were worn and my TV monitor had a crack in the screen. On time departure with lunch served at 10.45 local time! Immediately afterwards on this day time flight the window blinds were pulled down and the lights turned off. This situation continued until about 90 minutes from CDG. The in-flight entertainment was not very extensive particularly for non-French speakers. Most of the crew did what was necessary but no more. Lots of ""bonjour"" and ""au revoir"" but not much in between. Arrived 40 minutes early due to tail winds. Priority passport check with no delays. Did not get an opportunity to freshen up as no arrival lounge appears to be available in Terminal 2E. As no AF personnel were visible between the aircraft and exiting the baggage area I didn't have a chance to ask if one was available.",nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,4,nan,4,yes,nan,4,CAI-CDG return 2 adults and 2 children. Flight out was punctual and reasonably good service. Very good value ticket. Good selection of movies (including kids) but not as many as Singapore or Emirates. Cabin temperature was very cold on both outgoing and incoming flights. Got a premium economy upgrade on boarding on the return leg. This meant a very comfy seat and nicer food. The boarding started on time but the boarding went very slowly and the flight took off around 30 mins late with no explanation from staff. This led to a 30 min late arrival into CAI.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,1,"Flew from TLV to SFO by way of CDG. On the evening prior to our flight we were notified by way of a very simple email that our flight had been canceled. No phone numbers were provided of personnel who could assist us with rescheduling nor were we able to call the local customer service number as they close in TLV at 5pm and this was past 10. We Skype'd with customer service in the US and were told that we had been rebooked on El Al - which is great but someone could have told us! Anyway we flew out of TLV with El Al to connect in CDG to SFO and the flight was uneventful. Old ugly plane with seats that have no support or leg room (I'm 5'10"" long legs) and a horrible entertainment system. The stewardesses tried that has to be said but their service was perfunctory at best. I think the main problem is that it honestly feels as though AF doesn't care about their customers that they're a source of revenue and that their travel experience just simply doesn't matter to the company. I have other comments to make but they're about issues that I'm not allowed to discuss.",nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,3,nan,3,nan,2,no,nan,1,I have booked the flight from Australia - via Singapore Paris to Munich - besides the plane being old and the seats worn out the head set only worked on one side that the crew were not able to replace and the food below an expected standard the service extremely slow where I had to get up myself and asked several times to get a drink is not what you would expect when you pay the extra money to experience comfort to arrive on the other side of the world relaxed. I'm on my way back to Australia via Guangzhou and sitting in a so called Lounge with the present Lounge under construction and the offering is garden chairs with chips and noodle out of the packet with warm beer.,nan,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,4,no,nan,3,I flew Air France with six different legs of a European trip in August. Each time we flew into CDG. Fabulous employees. But not one departure left on time. Departures varied from 20 minutes delayed to over an hour. Missed one connection due to this and twice my daughter's wheelchair was lost and finally located again but we were always last leaving plane. Our luggage was lost for one and a half days on our first leg of trip (CDG to Manchester UK) because the flight left Boston so late we were connected to a smaller regional aircraft due to arriving late in CDG thus missing the scheduled Air France flight. In Boston we were told to get our boarding passes for the flight to UK in Paris. In Paris they asked for our boarding passes and it took over an hour to resolve that we were told to get them in Paris and that was the first leg of our disappointing trip. Again wonderful staff but it seems one airport location does not communicate well to another location which then uses up a lot of time at help desks at each airport trying to resolve the issues. The only time our delay was acknowledged was on our last leg of trip back to Boston - this left 20 minutes late which wasn't too bad but we sat on tarmac in Boston without much information for over an hour. The next day we got an e-mail from Air France apologizing for that. But the other five legs of the trip also were with problems. I would not fly Air France again unless I really had no other option unfortunately.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,5,nan,4,no,nan,4,I had a connecting flight from London to Bangkok via Paris CDG. I want to review my long-haul flight. First it was 2 hours delay and I missed my next flight to Denpasar. Passengers didn't receive any free food/drinks while waiting for the aircraft to be ready. Paris CDG terminal 2E had serious problems with their toilets. 2 or 3 male's toilets had been flooded. I was lucky enough to select a seat at the back and I had the whole row to my disposal. However all monitors in the row was dirty from a previous flight. Window glass was dirty. Flight attendants were attentive and smiling. However they provided service twice during 11 hour flight: dinner and breakfast. No drinks offered after dinner. Trays with soft drinks (no wine no beer) had been placed nearby kitchen and staff were lounging in their area. I'm always travelling between Asia and Europe and I booked combined ticket from Bangkok to London by KLM and London to Bangkok by Air France. What a difference! Fantastic KLM staff great food fair drinks and cold drinks served every hour during the night flight. Not on Air France flight. Would I choose them again for long-haul flight. I would avoid them.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,3,Originally a KLM flight however the flight was overbooked and I was re-routed through Paris with Air France (2 days prior to actual flight). Flying Bangkok-CDG-Prague and return. It was and is quite annoying that Air France offers online check in however has all seats (apart from some mid aisle) blocked and you are unable to choose or plan all AF is trying to push is seats with more legroom but many fail to realise that these are just by the lavatories and kitchens thus very uncomfortable (lights crowded and many just stand there to stretch). Actual check-in in Bangkok painless and quick the flight was operated by a brand new 777-300 quite tasty food and acceptable entertainment. The whole flight could have been a great one but there has been ZERO cabin crew presence for a 12 hrs flight. Food was delivered fast and it was collected even faster and then no one was to be found. Absolutely speechless when a crew actually refused to bring drinks for a family with kids commenting that there is a bar at the rear galley (the one they failed to announce so few people knew). Return flight uneventful (with much older plane with visibly less comfort and legroom and ancient useless entertainment) and surprised that the transit in CDG was all right except having 20+ passport control booths and only 1 serviced! Flights on time and baggage unharmed. All in all a very standard flight but if having a choice I would go with other airlines who offer a bit more value for money and attention.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,3,nan,2,yes,nan,4,I've travelled from Paris CDG to Berlin Tegel (TXL) (to go and return). I enjoyed my first flight very nice crew with a lot of choices of beverages. Even different types of wine were proposed. However my flight back was disappointing. Crew much less polite beverages were only hot chocolate and coffee. It was an early flight but they could have still offered orange or apple juice for example. Regarding the seat comfort nothing to say they were quite comfortable for a medium-haul flight.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,3,Air France flight JFK-CDG on 22nd Aug 2014 was excellent. Very good courteous and enthusiastic cabin crew and good food and wine.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,5,Flying from DUB (Dublin) to CDG (Paris) on an Air France service operated by Cityjet. A great service overall for this short flight with an onboard snack which consisted of a selection of sandwiches and drinks. Crew were very friendly and seats were comfortable with good legroom in the economy section. There was a 20 minute delay on the return flight caused by a problem with the airport buses however it was an early morning flight so the pilot said he was able to take 'shortcuts'. This worked and we landed in Dublin on time despite the delay. Overall for the service provided on such a short flight it is hard to rate the airline down. Flights arrived on time were comfortable and had friendly staff. I would easily fly with Air France again.,nan,5,nan

Quite honestly I am surprised that there are bad reviews with this airline. Food and French wine was superb. Service was excellent. Seats in business class extremely comfortable. I slept 6 hours straight from SFO to Paris. I would with Air France again and look forward to it.,nan,4,nan

nan,Premium Economy,2,nan,3,nan,3,no,nan,2,23 July - Jakarta - Singapore - Paris (AF) - Amsterdam (KLM) Premium Economy was fine. However the return journey AF 0254 5th August 2014 - Premium Economy Paris - Singapore - Jakarta was extremely disappointing frustrating and uncomfortable. Despite several attempts before leaving Jakarta to check-in online and select seats and again prior to our return flight this was not possible (yet online check-in from Jakarta - Paris was no problem). Seat allocation on check-in at Amsterdam Schiphol noted 'SBY' having been allocated by Air France. We presented to 'Customer Service' CDG to be told seats cannot be allocated until close of the boarding gate because 'standby' had been allocated - why? we booked our flights in May 2014! At the Gate we were told to wait until boarding was called that we would be on the flight and they were hoping to upgrade us. When we re-presented as advised we were told an upgrade wasn't possible but we 'could' be allocated separated premium economy seats - for a couple married 36 years on a 17 hour flight - this is unacceptable! No-one was able to do anything - the ground staff person was surprised we were unhappy and said an upgrade was not promised. The flight crew re-allocated us seats together but then an unhappy traveller arrived to find one of us in his seat - embarrassing for us and for him. This gentleman did agree to being re-seated. Anticipating a problem for the final leg of out journey (Singapore- Jakarta) we asked the cabin crew who shrugged and said yes there would be a problem; the ground staff in the Transfer area said the plane is full and no it was not possible for us to sit together. This is a short flight so no real issue - however my husband had an empty seat beside him so he asked and I was invited to move - but no- one actually considered this! In fact there were at least 3 empty seats in Premium Economy - it seems that neither the ground staff nor the flight attendants have any idea of the seating on board their flight. We have traveled to Europe Asia and Australia every year often more than once a year for the past 11 years. We will not travel with an airline that does not care about what is important to us!,nan,3,nan

I do not understand the criticisms of this airline. Both our experiences have been excellent. Yes the seats are not lie flat but they were particularly comfortable for sitting. The crew on both occasions were extremely friendly and attentive the food and wine was of a high standard and entertainment had plenty of choices. We think this is very good value for money and will continue to fly Air France when we can.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,4,nan,2,yes,nan,2,Aug 8th CGK-SIN-CDG on B777/300. Was flying home on an awards ticket in economy class. One set of crew from CGK- SIN and another set of crew from SIN-CDG. In spite of flying in economy class and on an awards ticket the chief flight attendant on the CGK-SIN sector personally greeted me. This was as a result of my elite plus Sky Team Alliance status. I enjoy Indian food and had ordered an Indian meal for both sectors knowing from past experience that I would get a very good Indian meal ex. SIN. I was not disappointed with the butter chicken. Leg room was minimal and seat comfort was barely adequate for the 13 hour flight. Cabin crew were professional. In-flight entertainment was adequate but poor when compared to other 4 star airlines. Flights departed and arrived on time throughout the journey.,nan,3,nan
nan,Economy Class,2,nan,1,nan,2,no,nan,2,"August 9th CDG-YUL on an older B747/400. This review is actually a continuation of my journey from CGK-SIN-CDG submitted in my earlier review. I am submitting this review separately due to the largely different journey experience. Once we boarded our flight we were told that our flight would be delayed due to a surprise inspection from the French Civil Aviation Authority. We were initially told the departure would be delayed by an hour. This was followed by an announcement that the inspection uncovered a technical problem and that we would have to deplane and change aircraft. We received meal vouchers to tide us over. We eventually departed 4 hours late for Montreal but were all glad to be finally on our way. Once on board I was approached by the flight attendant and asked to confirm that I had ordered a special meal. I was looking forward to my Indian meal especially since the meal from the previous flight from SIN had been so good. Instead I received a meal of ""Alaskan Pollack With A Leek Cream Sauce"" which had nothing to do with Indian food. When I mentioned this to the flight attendant her response was merely to say that she was also surprised to see this meal served as an Indian meal. After having eaten the presented meal the same flight attendant returned to me and asked me if I was satisfied with my meal. I politely answered that I wasn't satisfied because it wasn't what I ordered and expected. On the same flight I encountered a flight attendant with completely an opposite attitude who was very helpful in supplying me with ice packs to keep my insulin chilled since they were forbidden from storing my insulin in their on board chillers. This is probably why many passengers speak highly of Asian airline flight crews and often express positive comments about Asian service standards and service attitude. When was the last time a North American or European based airline won the Skytrax cabin crew of the year award?",nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,3,nan,3,no,nan,2,First and last flight I will take with them. Had flown London-Havana via Amsterdam with no problem with KLM. Return flight with AF - not so. Firstly flight to Paris was cancelled. Received a text about 16 hrs before flight despite them knowing 3 days in advance. Eventually another plane was chartered via Air Caraibes. We ended up leaving 3 hrs later and arriving in CDG after we were originally due to be in London. In Cuba we were told (rudely) we had been booked onto a flight with BA that was leaving at 9pm meaning we arrived in London 9 hrs after we were due to be there with a 7 hr wait in CDG. Told to get boarding pass from AF desk in Paris. Got there to find 4 staff going at snails pace (again rudely) whilst 300 irate and upset passengers waited to get their ongoing passes. We were almost at the front yet waited 70 mins to be told we had to go to the BA desk 2 terminals away. They didn't actually speak to me by the way preferring to speak to my husband. Got to the BA desk who after trying to get a pass for 2 hrs said AF needed to release the booking. My husband ran back and forth between terminals 2a and 2e 3 times before AF would listen to him and eventually conceded that it was their fault. Did we get any apology? No. I will never fly with them again.,nan,2,nan

nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,2,My family including my 3 year old daughter had a flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to Manchester which we had booked 8 months previous. We were unable to carry out an online check in before taking flight due to poor wifi signal at our holiday destination so arrived at check in 3 hours before our flight was due to leave to give us plenty of time. When we checked in we were told the flight was already full and we were placed on stand by. After waiting at gate for everyone else to board we were informed that only two seats were available and we could split up if we wanted or stay as a group of 3 on the next flight to Manchester. We decided to stay as a family - we went to the customer service desk only to be told that the next flight was completely full. After spending an hour at the desk with a very bored and upset young child we were informed that the only flight we could take that day was to Birmingham over 90 miles away from Manchester where our car was parked. After 11 hours in the airport we departed - on arrival to Birmingham we then had to organise transportation at considerable cost to ourselves to Manchester to collect our car. Safe to say I will never fly with Air France again and I will never recommend them to anyone else as there customer service was appalling.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,3,Flying on A380 from CDG to SFO on the upper deck in the smaller section with only 5 rows I again enjoyed the excellent food quality and wine selection.

nan,Economy Class,5,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,4,I travel frequently with Air France to Brazil and I am always impressed with the service I get and the friendly air crew.

It's always been a pleasure flying with them.,nan,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,1,My flight was from Atlanta to CDG-Paris on Saturday Oct 11th. I will avoid this airline in the future due to the following: 1) No special meal option-no gluten free vegetarian peanut allergy diabetic etc. meals available 2) Lazy unfriendly flight attendants. Every time there was a tiny bit of minor turbulence they flipped the seat belt light and plopped in the flight attendant seat strapped in and took a break. This happened frequently. I sat near the galley and saw them eating ice cream cake feet propped up. I don't think they ever offered water or any types of beverage during the flight. Completely awful staff. 3) Plane was ragged looking and my TV did not function properly. FA said there was nothing he could do. Did not give one care about it.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,5,yes,nan,5,For the very first time I flew from JFK to CDG in business class. The cabin had been newly remodelled and it was great. It was the first time that comfort was competing with the companies from the gulf area. It was a piece of luck for most 777 have not been remodeled yet. Staff food drinks entertainment everything was perfect. I just pity all those who pay the same amount but do not have the same comfort.,nan,5,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,5,I flew CDG-JFK on October 15th on AF008 and flew back on October 16th on AF009. The plane a B777-200ER had the new business class configuration (1-2-1). This new business class is comparable to the very best standards. The seat is comfortable in any position. The IFE is nice with a wide screen and a lot of selection. On these two flights the cabin crew was very professional and friendly too. The food was very good westbound so-so eastbound. Wine selection just OK for a French airline. Compare to the current (and very poor) business class what a change!,nan,5,nan
nan,Premium Economy,3,nan,3,nan,1,no,nan,1,"Not-so-premium: shabby equipment poor food uncomfortable seat. I flew Premium Economy from CDG to JFK on the return trip from France. I expected an upgraded level of service equal to or greater than Economy Comfort on Delta. The hard shell seat was extremely uncomfortable and the ""recline"" (more a sliding function) did not work. Entertainment options were limited and dated. The food was exactly the same as economy - a mush of potatoes and vegetables with a side of chicken in cheese sauce. The only difference was the addition of an unappetizing brown pate. The second meal service was a stale roll and some yoghurt. The price is outrageous for the level of service offered. I hope Air France will entirely rethink this class of service.",nan,1,nan

nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,4,nan,5,yes,nan,2,JFK-CDG-VIE. The AF Prem Econ seats are as described elsewhere uncomfortable. They weren't designed for sleep. Our return flight from CDG to JFK was on an Airbus 380. I moved us to the front 2 seats at the emergency exit and we had plenty of room. The toilet kit and 'coronet' were appreciated as well as the wine and cognac. The food was nothing great. I tried to purchase upgraded meals for our return flight but the AF website never seemed to get me there. Check-in was always expedited. All the AF personnel we encountered were friendly and professional.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,1,I was supposed to fly Air France from Frankfurt to Paris on September 20th 2014. However it was canceled due to a strike. I was re-booked on Luxair but I missed connection due the fact connections were too close. I was re- booked on a Lufthansa flight which left on time. On my return flight to Frankfurt Air France was operating once again but the service left a lot to the imagination. Most depressing thing about Air France was the fact they serve their customers instant coffee which they prepared in front of you. You would expect instant coffee from a non-coffee culture such Thailand. Air France can keep their cold croissant instant coffee and frigid staff.,nan,1,nan
nan,Business Class,3,nan,2,nan,2,no,nan,1,I have been travelling with this airline mainly for business purpose and many times in business class. Am I expecting too much when I compare with their magazines and the image they try to carry? All in all I have never been happily surprised by nice new features that modern airlines may offer. Rather it is always more or less the same and in term of seat comfort in business class it clearly lags behind most of its serious competitor. Food is generally good but it can also be sometimes frankly disgusting (when you fly to Paris from a foreign country). Service is fine but seemingly very disorganised between boarding and take-off (flight attendants running in all directions back and forth with no apparent co-ordination - when are going to actually optimize their movements inside the very narrow pathways?). A nice old lady with old worn furniture and faded recipe the actual image of this airline.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,nan,3,nan,4,no,nan,3,CDG-Miami (round trip). On CDG-MIA flight we had a lovely staff who seemed happy to serve passengers. In return the crew seemed so tired.

nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,4,no,nan,2,CDG-MIA. Cabin staff during almost an 10 hours flight appeared 2 times. Snacks during flight are boring and only available in 1 pantry in the economy class on a A380. Toilets looked horrible and we're not cleaned.

nan,Economy Class,1,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,2,AF1653 Kiev to Paris 23/11/2014 on Airbus A319. Check-in was efficient but that's all that I liked about the flight. I've never experienced before such an arrogant and frigid crew as on this flight. Crew did not do anything during the first two hours of the flight. They were chatting for two hours! After two hours of chatting with each other reading newspapers playing games on their phones and drinking coffee they decided to serve the passengers. Coffee or tea and a very small croissant were served. I expected a bit more on a flight of over three hours. After serving they were gone and I haven't seen them again. Seats were horrible in comparison to my outbound flight with KLM. The announcements were very difficult to understand. And of course they lost my baggage. After 5 days I could collect my baggage at the airport. I'll never ever in my life fly Air France again and I will never recommend them to anyone else!,nan,1,nan

Connection in CDG (late evening) a breeze - hardly any other passengers at passport control did not have to go through security again. CDG-HKG an A380. Upper deck economy seating feels much more private - and the boarding process is usually quicker as you get to join a separate line for upper deck (only 8 rows). Onboard service good nice meals for ecoonomy (and even a hot breakfast). bars are set up on both decks with drinks and snacks (ice cream is a nice touch). Seats on AF's A380 are quite spacious - more width than Emirates and ample pitch. Easily one of the best longhaul economy experiences. The IFE is usable but not top- notch (anymore) - the responsiveness of the screen is annoying. The selection of movies and TV shows is not very large but okay. All in all a nice experience at a very competitive price.,nan,5,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1,nan,3,nan,1,no,nan,1,"CDG-KL travelled long haul with Air France for the first time. Had heard that the Premium Economy seats were uncomfortable but that turned out to be an understatement. They were as hard as park benches. I had to resort to scrounging cushions from other seats to sit on - not worth the price premium. Leg room was OK and could extend my legs fully under seat in front (I'm 62""). The food was OK but the service appalling. No attempt was made to deliver an aperitif before the food but rather had to be requested at the same time. Took a good 45 minutes for them to come and clear away the plates with all the attendant issues of having it left there on the tray. No offers of digestif despite being listed on the menu. During the cabin darkness period was not approached a single time to be offered a drink hot flannel etc. The only time I saw crew during this time was when I got up to walk front to back of the plane and discovered a couple of them in the galley reading magazines. All in all doesn't come anywhere near Emirates or Singapore so would actively look to avoid in future for long haul.",nan,3,nan

Had to phone AF Heathrow who explained it was due to ""operational needs"" but he reserved us middle of the plane seats in both directions as no window seats available on reaching CDG I asked for an explanation and was told it was a problem with Delta (flight was codeshare). On the flight despite asking for the meat option meal all we could get was the vegetarian option which was just about edible-we were 25 rows from the back.

nan,Economy Class,4,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,4,London - Rio de Janeiro via Paris A330-200. Good flights overall. I paid £50 for an exit row seat one way at the time of booking which I think was good value on a £500 return flight and the configuration of 2-4-2 is good as it means only ever one person to climb over regardless of seat position. My baggage didn't make it to Rio although the connection was tight and they were punctual with delivery in Rio the day after. Food onboard was pretty good although IFE left a bit to be desired - not all that much choice available. Overall the experience was good and at around £490 at the cheaper end for Europe to Brazil - Paris CDG is a ridiculous airport to transfer through. It's a huge maze and you do security again despite having just done it in London 45 min before.,nan,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,4,nan,3,nan,4,yes,nan,2,Oct 23 AF SFO-CDG-NCE. Economy - reserved seats on SFO-CDG in advance. Chose seats on top level of A380 as there's less movement around the cabin compared to downstairs. FA's were friendly. Food average but was given champagne upon asking. Discovered the 'bar' upon going to the back of the plane to the toilets. Sweets ice cream soft drinks. They don't wait on people much outside of the organized mealtimes but it doesn't bother me to get up and fetch a drink as it's an opportunity to stretch my legs. Boarding at SFO was quick as there were several airbridges and we were boarded first. The problem came from the transfer at CDG. AF changed our flight to Nice because SFO-CDG was leaving later (due to delayed arrival) except they booked us on a flight out from Orly the other side of Paris. The check-in guy at SFO airport managed to change us to a flight out of CDG. However the flight SFO-CDG caught up on the delay and arrived on time in CDG so we then had to queue at the transfer desk to get back on our original flight CDG to Nice! We were dubious about our baggage making the transfer - but it did! AF doesn't match some other airlines but the ticket was cheaper so I'm not complaining. I liked the A380. The CDG-NCE was uneventful with a drink and a packet of biscuits - surely they could do better than that?,nan,3,nan

I received an email ahead of time from AF regarding online check in only to be informed I needed a visa or green card and could not check in except at the airport. We arrived 3 hours ahead of departure time went to obtain boarding passes and check in our one bag each only to find it was all done electronically. There were long lines in front of each machine with much confusion and unfamiliarity with the how to navigate the process. One in front of us took at least 10 minutes to complete the process. After 25 minutes we entered another long line to drop off our check in bags which took another 15-20 minutes. At no point were our carry-on bags weighed as they were with KLM. We then walked about 10 minutes to enter the longest line yet which was for passport control and after few minutes were “randomly” selected to go to another line for carry on weight and size control. We observed bags being shoved into a steel frame for sizing. Additionally they added purses and shoulder bags to the total weight calculation which easily put most over the limit of 12 kg. The handlers then slapped a large red AF tag on the bag marked up the boarding pass and sent us back to the baggage area. We returned to the baggage area and discovered the fee for each bag was 70 Euros about $100. When we explained this could have been avoided if our carry-ons were weighed at the same time as our check in as we could have redistributed some items. In the end we had to check in one additional bag. We arrived at our gate as the plane was boarding. While doing so we observed many passengers with 3 carryon bags. We learned many lessons not the least of which is we will not fly AF again.,nan,3,nan

However I arrived on time and I had plenty of legroom due to the seat (10J). But the onboard service was nearly non-existent no response whatsoever after ringing the attendant button. Entertainment system crashed every 5 minutes. No drinks offered only with the distribution of (mediocre) food. Orly airport staff were slow rude and unfriendly.,nan,3,nan

nan,Business Class,4,nan,5,nan,2,no,nan,2,Recently flew LHR to CCS (via CDG) on Air France - Business Class. Seat reservations made at time of booking had been changed when I checked in online 24 hours before the flights. No explanation offered. I found seat 2A on outbound leg much more comfortable than seat 4E on return leg. Although on a 10 hour flight with a leading European Airline one would expect a flat bed AF do not offer this on the Paris / Caracas route. On the way out my baggage missed the connection in Paris and it took more than 2 days for AF to get it to me. No apology no explanation no keeping me informed. On way back delay of over three hours. Air France Business Class lounge in Caracas is atrocious worst I have seen. IFE did not work for the first 90 minutes of the flight despite the valiant efforts of the Purser.,nan,2,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,nan,2,nan,1,no,nan,2,Took flight 83 from San Francisco to Paris. One of the worst 11 hour flights ever. Got to my seat to find all of the electronics did not work. Notified staff before takeoff. There seemed to be some power to the electronics yet nothing worked. No light no music no monitor not even the attendant call button. I was told they could somehow reboot the system associated with my seat shortly after takeoff. After a couple attempts to reboot and two hours trying to get the crew's focus on the matter I was finally told that they would not be able to get the electronics of my seat working. They offered me magazines which is completely useless considering they dim the cabin lights and I had no light of my own which worked. So I got to sit in the dark and 11 hours of flight going out of my mind with boredom. What makes it worse is knowing that this airline would not have known that my electrionoc were not functioning properly before the flight boarded. Not only did it limit me on my ability to view the safety video before the flight started but it also brings into question why the systems did not work in the first place. The plane seemed fairly new and if the problems associated my electronics was not a simple rebooting of my system according to the crew then what was it that cause all of the systems around my seat to fail?,nan,2,nan
nan,Premium Economy,4,nan,4,nan,3,yes,nan,3,LHR-CDG-LYS. Got assigned seat 3A in Premium Eco on LHR-CDG leg which is always nice and seems to happen to me quite often on this route. It doesn't make much of a difference on such a short flight - even though you do get better food - but sitting at the front of the aircraft makes the boarding/ disembarking process a breeze. Transfer between to 2E and 2F at CDG can be a bit of a hassle but both terminals are new and relatively easy to navigate. Nothing exceptional on CDG-LYS leg but an overall pleasant experience.,nan,4,nan
nan,Business Class,5,nan,5,nan,4,yes,nan,4,HKG-CDG Flight 185. FA's were particularly friendly and helpful. Food and drinks were high standard as usual. Main issues: seat was comfortable enough but lacks the essential for a business class seat: horizontal lie-flat. More privacy would be appreciated as well and there is not enough personal storage room. The cabin was brand new and features the new 2-2-2 seats plan far more pleasant than the 777 2-3-2 configuration. Use of the inflight entertainment system is not really easy and it takes time to navigate through categories and pick a movie. Options are nonetheless plentiful with a good selection of English and French-speaking blockbusters. The Qantas lounge in HKG is definitely not up to the usual AF service in the company lounges around the world. AF should definitely find another partner to accommodate its priority passengers. Overall a very smooth flight which got AF back into my favorite airlines list.,nan,5,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5,nan,3,nan,4,yes,nan,4,LAX-CDG. After reading so many bad reviews for the AF Premium Economy product I was eager to try it out for myself. If you are like me the thing you hate most about economy is having the person in front of you recline all the way in your lap for the duration of an 11 hour flight. So with that said having shell style seats is very exciting even if they don't recline in the traditional sense. Upon entering the A380 PE economy cabin I could tell right away I would enjoy the experience. The dedicated cabin is small and cozy and the seat itself has tons of room compared to any economy seat. Do not listen to the reviews on here that say the seats are cramped because it's just not true. I have long gangley legs and I could stretch them all the way out to the foot rest under the seat in front of me. It's basically a mini business class seat and compared to other premium economy products out there that cost twice as much (Virgin Atlantic) it is well worth the price of admission. I feel like a lot of the negativity comes from people who expect business class for the extra money they are paying even though it's a quarter of the price. The food is nothing special and I agree that the bottom portion of the seat could use some extra padding. Service was great and the stewards came immediately after pushing the call button. As for the non traditional recline of the seat I found it more comfortable then the normal seat back legs sitting position of economy. The trick is to make sure you extend the calf rest and foot rest so your body is being supported in the diagonal position. Again I feel like other fliers are either use to their economy habitat and or expect lay flat seats that they didn't pay for. As I said before not having the person in front of you laying in your lap the entire flight is heaven on earth which is still a problem on many PE products. Please take it from me a rational realistic aviation aficionado. I speak the truth in all my reviews and would not hesitate to let you know my dissatisfaction if there were any.,nan,5,nan

However seat assignment was not permitted as long as the passenger makes the check in online 30 hours prior the departure. I definitely can't say that I agree with such procedure but it's a way to force passengers to do their own check in. Online check-in went fine but I was previously informed by the AF reservation agent that all seats would be available once the system was charged but definitely this was untrue. Anyhow I got seats together for myself and my parents. Once onboard the aircraft was with an issue with the air-conditioning system. So the plane was hot just like a sauna. Only when the main door was closed and the engines started working fortunately we got fresh air. Flight was completely full. As soon as we took off crew started the inflight service. Eyeshade and earphones were personally distributed which was a nice touch. Right after welcome drink which included champagne and a small bag of salty snacks were offered. My vegetarian option was delivered but the main dish was cold. During the flight drinks ice cream and small sandwiches were available in both galleys. Prior to our arrival hot breakfast was served.

KLM which flew me on the final leg delivered my luggage a day later though the efficiency in its tracking was high. The Charles de Gaulle Terminal 2F lounge was overcrowded.

nan,Business Class,2,nan,1,nan,1,no,nan,2,YUL-CDG-BKK/CDG-YUL: I have never before encountered service as consistently poor and an inflight experience as negative as I did on my recent AF Flights. Nor did I think that a major airline in Europe could make US carriers look good in comparison. All of the AF equipment was distinguished by its tattiness uncomfortable seats dirt and an unpleasant cabin ambience. Positively the worst IFE I have experienced in the past 20+ years. The fact that Air France serves instant coffee sums up the quality of food service. I made the mistake of thinking that if cappuccino was on offer that it would be real. Instead I was treated to chunks of undissolved mix. Decent wine selection but that was it. One meal consisted of a sort of lamb dish. It was so overcooked it had gone to mush with what I presumed had once been vegetables. The dominant ingredient was salt. That was typical of the AF meal service. Checkin for flights at AF staffed desks was an unpleasant experience. The one dominant characteristic of most AF personnel encountered was rudeness and a disdain for the customer despite my speaking to personnel in French. On my last flight I was sent between 2 different terminals twice wasting 90 minutes on the shuttle bus doing the circuit of CDG. One clerk at the lounge in 2E-M sent me back to 2L while another sent me back to 2E-M with the monitors showing a different gate and then not showing anything. Finally once at the correct gate at 2E-M passengers were packed on to a crowded shuttle bus and brought back to 2L. Something isn't right at Air France. If one flies some of the better airlines like EVA Cathay or even Air Canada one quickly sees the differences. Air France does not give one the same confidence as they do and I felt that there was a lack of professionalism. I strongly recommend against using this airline until it sorts itself which I expect will take some time.,nan,2,nan

Unfortunately the IFE system was not working (purser informed passengers before boarding) but was therefor forced to sleep and arrived fresh. My only critic is the worn out impression of the cabin.

We waited on the tarmac with most of the doors open in the 3' C weather for about 45 mins. The food was atrocious. First of all is it too much of a luxury for AF to provide actual milk instead of powdered milk with their tea and coffee? The meal was a little sugary cheese something bun which was barely edible. The configuration of the plane was a little odd with small narrow and pretty uncomfortable seating with a very wide aisle. The staff were friendly enough but the IFE was non-existent. For a full service airline I thought that this flight was pretty poor.

Despite having heard negative reviews in the past about flying via CDG and not speaking French it turned out to be relatively easy. The Cabin Crew on all sectors were very pleasant and attentive. Inflight catering was to a high standard. The only issue was on the return sector when one of our three bags did not arrive at our final destination. In fairness our connection was booked by myself and was just over one hour. I received a text immediately on arrival at EDI informing me of the missing bag and also various updates during the day with regard to it's delivery status. It was delivered to our home 8 hours after our arrival. I was impressed with this level of communication. In summary we found Air France to be very good and certainly value for money.

I paid 800 euros to have my wife upgraded to Premium Economy and would not advise anyone to commit such foolishness. This old 777-200 was to torn down with the space between the wall covers in the toilets filled up with filth. The seats were so hard that I decided to check what was going on and found out that the only separation between my“derriere and the seat metal structure was a 3 mm thin foam. Finally do not believe AF fancy adds about the food served in Premium Economy. We were served exactly the same meagre and unsavory portions as in Economy. When my wife got hungry about 6 hours after the meal she was informed that she had to wait for another two hours before to get anything. I can't say much about the crew because we seldom saw them. When I introduced a complaint in the AF system I was informed that due to an unusual number of complaints I should not expect anything form them before 3 weeks. No surprise here.,nan,1,nan

In general no problem because automatic email was sent beforehand to inform passengers. But two issues: 1) They changed my ongoing flight from Paris to Berlin to a later one without telling me about it there was no communication. 2) The LAX-CDG flight caught up with the schedule so I could have made the original connecting flight but they wouldn't change my ticket back in Paris. Watched other passengers board the plane that I booked but had to wait 4 hrs at CDG for the next flight. Ground personnel refused to hand out anything not even a voucher for a drink or snack at the airport. I have been flying with AirFrance/KLM for many years now but I have to say that AF is loosing it's charm. Flight attendants on LAX-CDG didn't pay a lot of attention even though I have to say that there were always plenty of drinks and snacks.,nan,3,nan
nan,Business Class,2,nan,3,nan,2,no,nan,3,The usual underwhelming AF business class experience (I fly once a month on this route). AF has the nerve to advertise their new business class seat on billboards in Dakar knowing full well that they are not available on its DKR-CDG service and won't be for the foreseeable future. That's just the start. The boarding is a shambles but that's more the fault of the airport than AF probably (a quick congratulations to Dakar airport authorities on the overall organisation. Great idea to have most of the customs counters unmanned at peak time loved the chance to ponder the beauty of the building during the 30 minute wait). Once in the plane you realise that AF apparently cannot manage to get someone to vacuum clean the cabin before passengers are corralled in. Dirty and it's like that regularly! Sheer neglect and laziness. Still the crumbs and detritus on the floor are in-keeping with the ageing and shabby cabin which for reasons I'm yet to understand is invariably full. Service is haphazard and characterised mainly by its slow pace. Can't a meal be served within the first hour of a 5-hour flight? Apparently not. I was asked 3 times by three different cabin staff to endure the 'breakfast' service an hour out of Paris a 'no' each time finally got the message across. One male steward was helpful the others behaved like it was all too much trouble. Main meal mediocre wine OK. Overall glad it's not me paying the tickets.,nan,2,nan

Have to say the premium economy seats are roomy allowing me to work during the outward bound flight to USA but they are very hard and do not recline properly so was not able to sleep much during the return night flight. Food was disappointing I think Lufthansa offer the better choice of meals. Also the choice of drinks was poor and the attendants were not too helpful. On the return journey they didn't distribute the kit with toothpaste face mask etc. Choice of inflight films was quite good although the picture quality of the monitor was poor. Priority channel for boarding and check in is OK but CDG transfers and lounges are a nightmare bursting to the seams with passengers not enough seating and not enough toilets.,nan,3,nan

The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque ""go away and leave me alone"" from me. This stunned her into saying ""you can't speak to me like that"" to which I responded ""I have now go away"". When did it become company policy for AF to treat customers like 6 year olds?

It is only through desperation I use the airline now and I would willingly pay over their price to avoid it. As a frequent flyer from Saudi Arabia I find AF charter Saudi Air flights and pass them off as their own. For me this is unacceptable. If I wanted Saudi Air I would book Saudi Air. The toilets are always dirty and smelly the flight crew generally miserable and there are always extremely badly behaved kids crawling over the seats. What I've also found is the passengers here cannot wait for the plane to stop before they're out of their seats and there is no admonishment from the staff. The food is always bland and as cheap as possible they can't even be bothered buttering the sandwiches and the excuse for dinner is laughable. There is zero inflight entertainment. I've also had occasion to speak to the staff at CDG airport possibly the most frustrating airport in the world and they are the rudest I have ever come across. I really dislike both Saudi Air and Air France for these reasons. I would definitely not recommend.,nan,1,nan

Every time I have attempted to check in online I have had an error message and then when trying to check in electronically at the airport I've had the same error message and had to go queue and check in manually. On top of the inconvenience this causes it also limits your seat choosing options. On 2 occasions I've ended up in the 'middle' seat. Be warned the arm rests are actually on this seat (as opposed to equally split between the two seats). That means that the seat is incredibly tight - I'm a 34"" waist and it was uncomfortable - I imagine for anyone larger it would become physically impossible. Overall an incredibly arrogant airline.

It was the last flight of a day when a flight had been cancelled earlier and seating was overbooked. I was assigned a middle seat. One of the flaws of their intra-Europe flights is that you cannot ever book your seat in advance and I paid for my ticket 8 months in advance! Previously I was served a meal on this short flight but not this one. We were only given a small dry sandwich and a cup of water (no second drinks service). The flight attendant in charge seemed to care less about anyone in the ""premium cabin"". Air France make no effort to distinguish the intra-Europe premium economy experience apart from you being seated near the front. The late night flight to HND on a newly refurbished 777-200 was actually quite nice. The crew were very accommodating and the toilets were clean throughout. The premium economy seat was OK but you cannot get any sleep in them as many have said. The entertainment system is updated with touch screens though I couldn't find much to watch. I ordered a special Lentore meal in advance and it was delicious. The standard pre-arrival breakfast was dreadful. No food offered between meal times during the 11+ hour flight.

I'll never understand airline pricing policies: this flight was cheaper than flying from Paris to Glasgow! The flight was not crowded so I had a whole row of seats to myself and was thus able to put my feet up which was an unexpected luxury when flying in economy (hence the five stars for seat comfort and value for money). I fly very frequently and hadn't flown with Air France on a long-haul flight for many years and was very pleasantly surprised by the food. It was delicious and a real cut above all the meals I've eaten aboard Emirates Qatar Aeroflot Singapore China Eastern etc. over the past few years. The cabin crew were charming friendly (mostly fairly mature men which as a woman I find a pleasant change from the often surly and very young women aboard many of the other airlines) and efficient.

The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque ""go away and leave me alone"" from me.

Nothing to notice but the fact that I should not have been flying that day. I had to do it because AF canceled my flight of March 20 and I had to make new arrangements. My wife had three flights canceled on Feb 11 Feb 23 and April 9. Two of these flights were supposed to connect with AF long haul flights. As this is a single daily flight no other non-stop option is available and passengers need to take connecting flights that triple the trip length.

We were booked onto the 6.25am flight for which we arrived at BHX two hours prior to departure only to find that our flight was actually being handled by FlyBe. After over an hour in the check-in queue we heard a message that there was a computer error we were devastated when our flight was instructed to take off without us and approximately 60 other passengers as we couldn't be checked in at this time. We were travelling with two young children and a baby and were disgusted at the lack of organisation by the airline in the hours that followed. We were not spoken to by any members of staff about what to do next but told to go and have breakfast with our £5 food vouchers what can £ £5 buy you in an airport? I refused to leave the check-in desk until I had details about our re-booked flights and after five hours of sitting on the airport floor complaining I finally managed to get a member of staff to book us on to the next flight to Lyon where there would be a connecting flight to Paris. By the time we landed at Paris CDG we had been travelling for fourteen hours and the children were distressed hungry and tired.

The chief purser on the flight assured me that the new menu was popular but a quick unscientific survey of my fellow passengers seemed to show the opposite. For the record first course was a tiny block of Foie Gras with overlooked mixed vegetables. Followed by shrimps in a brown tasteless sauce and mashed potatoes (difficult to identify). The desert was a stale pastry. The guest chef (unknown outside of France) who prepared this offering clearly needs extra training on the impact of altitude on the taste of food come on Air France bring back the much loved classic menu.

At Osaka Kansai Airport Air France operates at the southern part of the terminal which means a short train ride from the main hall. I arrived about one hour earlier than I really needed to so I had lot of time to spend in the deserted South terminal which really doesn't have many shops or dining areas. This hasn't anything to do with the airline though. But anyway - boarding went smoothly and fast maybe because most of the PAX were Japanese but more likely because very few PAX. The seats of Air France's old cabin at first look looks quite comfortable and nice but really they isn't. They're too hard and worn for a 12 hour flight. TV-screens were also quite worn and the IFE system even worse. Luckily Air France provides a generous amenity kit even in their economy class with noise- cancelling ear plugs low quality headphones sleeping mask and a wet-wipe which they are handing out shortly after takeoff. Food quality is average. We got a choice of two dinners a Japanese (a sesame beef I believe) or a Western as well as breakfast. Catering was extremely poor during the 12 hour long flight they only came serving us beverage two times. And by the way cabin crew wasn't really nice either. They seemed stressed and tired. The captain on the other hand made an announcement every time arriving over new areas which was nice. Second leg was an average short haul-flight with beverage and a sandwich.

I will say that the Air France personnel kept us informed about the cancelled flight and offered glasses of water during the long wait. Returned flight 338 on April 27 from Paris to Boston also cancelled due to mechanical difficulties. Cancellation in Paris was very poorly handled. From moving our group to a more isolated area where many of us could sit on the floor to not providing an escort or transportation to the Ibis hotel which was close to a 2 mile walk because of poor directions and location of hotel to the limited staff at the hotel and restaurant which stopped serving early for both dinner and breakfast to being charged 385 euros for an oversized box which cost $100 on Aer Lingus to get it to Paris desk employees did not know English or refused to speak it etc. Food on flights was awful beverages were fine TV did not work for my son and on both trips we were sitting near screaming infants.

nan,Business Class,1,nan,4,nan,5,no,nan,5,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,nan,3,nan

There was a change in aircraft on the outbound flight and I did not experience the new cabin but staff were excellent and I was alone in the first class cabin. The first class lounge in Paris was fabulous with an exclusive ambience. I was disappointed that I could not enjoy the complimentary massage as the therapist was ill but the rest of the service was excellent. Escorted through security and immigration control with no stress and driven to the aircraft in a limousine from the lounge. Return flight from Singapore was in the new first class cabin a really luxurious cabin with only four seats. Again was greeted as soon as I arrived at the Jet quay terminal in Changi airport and all details taken care off without any hassle. I was driven to the departure gate in a buggy a lovely gesture indeed. Overall Air France certainly knows how to define first class service. I have flown first class long haul with three other airlines before and not one could match the service of La Premiere with Air France. If I wanted to be critical there are some minor details. Firstly the cost is much higher than most other airlines. Secondly there is no complimentary limousine service to and from the airport. Thirdly they may need to provide a more extensive menu to cater for people who are originally from the region in South East Asia.,nan,3,nan

I found a member of the crew in one of the galleys much later and managed to het a beer for my husband and some water for myself. The return journey was as bad if not worse.

As the aircraft was not fitted out with the most recent business class seats, the seats still were angled and would not get fully flat but were comfortable enough. One negative point: there was no screen to provide privacy in case you sit next to a stranger. After manageing to escape the labyrith of CDG we boarded the short flight to Berlin where the economy service was just basic.

Then they made an announcement saying that the flight was canceled and told us to go to the main departure check-in desk, in broken English that not very clear.

No-one knew where the connector flight left from although I had found that information by myself. We were told by a steward on the plane that you could walk to the next flight. You cannot - you have to take a train, clear border control then security again. We were told this would all take place in Nice - wrong again.  The next flight to Nice was joyfully cancelled - no reason given. The third flight was one hour late so in all we spent seven hours in a sweltering CDG trying to make a one hour journey to Nice,  after a nine-hour flight from Vancouver. Our daughter was exhausted after the flight and felt faint. We called the first aid medics in CDG who were great.  The only response we got from Air France was when I took to Twitter to express my frustration.

The online check-in was very straightforward (I appreciated the e-mail confirming that check in had opened) and there were no issues there. The outward leg from BHX to CDG was fine, didn't expect to be served a snack but the croissant was practically inedible and thrown straight in the bin. The organisation at CDG was lacking. There was a delay of 45 minutes on the ground with no explanation from the staff, then the gate of departure was changed to a gate that was already boarding a separate flight to Dubai, with the new gate's screen not being updated to reflect this. This caused a large rush of people and a lot of anger and confusion, and although the staff did make an announcement confirming the Chicago-bound passengers were to board first, this didn't feel like enough as a lot of people remained confused and unsure of what was happening. We were then delayed for a further hour on the tarmac, although we were kept updated by the captain regarding this. Seats were okay, food was okay, a good selection of entertainment but the quality of the screens is poor and the sets only designed for the headsets handed out so sound quality was abysmal on normal headphones. There's a good selection of drinks (including complementary alcohol) and the flight staff were friendly and attentive. Not the best trans-atlantic flight I've ever had, but far from the worst.

And I had called 3 times to confirm that had reserved seats together. Our record was separated and we were seated apart. By good fortune, the woman who had the seat that I was supposed to have was right behind me at the airport. She had booked her ticket 5 months after I did, through a travel agent. Further conversation revealed that she had AF Flying Blue status, although she's a US citizen. It appears from our chat, that AF allows its own customers to reserve seats in business class up to a few hours before departure and thus bump passengers like me and my husband, paying passengers, at will. This leaves the check-in staff at Dulles to flounder for explantions as to why we are separated.

They refused to find a flight for me even though I had explained the situation. They said I must organise it through my travel agent, bear in mind I did have a return flight booked with them already (business class). My travel agent did his best, but said that the only way I could get back early was to forgo my existing return flight, and purchase another ticket.

The seat I was assigned to was the aisle seat in the last row of the first economy seat section. This seat was near the galley and near the toilets. Because it is in the last row, the seat did not recline fully. It was very narrow and could have used additional padding. The aisles on a B777 are very narrow with barely enough room for the drink/meal cart to manoeuvre. During the boarding process, I got hit by backpacks and carry-on luggage as passengers walked by.

Two meals were served, one after departing SF, this was dinner. The food was adequate (came with apple sauce). Breakfast was served before arrival in Paris.

Service generally good, except for one minor complaint-you have to ask for water. Made up some time in air and arrived CDG 10 mins late. Luckily our connection to IST was in in the next terminal and we could fast track security, so our already short connection was comfortably made. CDG-IST about an hour late, but no reason given.

For the connection from CDG to LIS I had just booked standard economy seats. Seeing this was an anniversary trip, I decided to upgrade my economy tickets to BC. This was a little over $600 per ticket. As we boarded the plane, I knew instantly this was not going to be a good experience, as I turned to look at my business class seat that I spent over $600 upgrading to, I realized that the only difference between my seat and an ecomomy seat, is that they don't seat anyone in the center seat. Other than that, same size, same leg room. Same everything except they have a bright red tag that hangs off the seat that says business class. The cabin was filthy. The seats looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. My arm rest was broken, the seat was on permanent recline. The FA came over twice to tell me to put my seat up and both times, once we got the seat into position, it reclined again on its own. Frustrated, I asked the FA, what comes with Business Class to make it worth the extra money I paid to upgrade and the response was ""a free meal"". I have dined at some of the finest restaurants in the world so I am well aware of how amazing a $600 meal can be. This was clearly not a $600 meal. The ""beef pinwheel"" was raw.

A380,First Class,5,August 2015,4,5,3,yes,MAN to SFO via CDG,5,"I flew Air France from Manchester to San Francisco via Paris CDG on a business trip to the US. Their first class fares were pretty reasonable - at just over £3500 for a return journey which while some will think is excessive - others will know that business class fares can easily exceed this for trips across the Atlantic. Air France use Flybe for some flights from MAN - this part of the flight experience was shocking - with a 2hr delay out of MAN, so bad that I had 20 minutes to make my connecting flight with AF. This is where things most definitely picked up - I was greeted at the door of the aircraft by my personal Air France assistant who drove me to the CDG-SFO aircraft. From leaving the MAN-CDG flight I was onboard the CDG-SFO flight in under 10 minutes. However if I'd not been in First with Air France, I'd probably have not made the connection so my experience here is for a La Premier experience. Air France A380's are very spacious with 9 first seats, which give the design there's an abundance of personal space. They seem to have 3 versions of their first product, with the A380 having the older 2 of these. They are both flat bed but offer less privacy than their new product which I believe is only on certain Boeing 777 routes. The newer of the A380 first suites is okay with a larger privacy screen - I got this on my CDG-SFO flight. However their older product, which I had on my return journey, has a very minimal privacy screen. This made me slightly uncomfortable as I didn't want my fellow PAX to see me mouth open snoring away during the night flight back. Seat comfort on both is very good. The seat has recline and leg support both electronically activated. Plenty of storage space with a large drawer under the ottoman. I had (according to my sleep tracker watch app) 6 hours of sleep with a 2 hours of deep sleep. Which is pretty good for an airline ""bed"". They do have a liner which gives some additional mattress style comfort and easily one of the best duvet/pillow combinations I've had in the air - apparently courtesy of Sofitel. The IFE is at best fairly basic with the generic slow to respond touch screen, but it's functional. Some of the functions didn't work (camera views) but overall it provided the service. Interestingly the screens in Business are significantly bigger on the A380 than in first. However where Air France are excelling is the service you receive as their La Premier customer. This really is simply the best end-to-end flight experience I've had from any airline (when flying AF not Flybe). I was contacted a few days prior to my flight to ask if I needed anything specific. My Air France assistant also personally ensured that both West and East bound my bags made the flights - coming back on board to confirm this to me despite the ridiculously short connection times. On my return flight the fist class cabin was completely full - yet the service remained consistent and personal throughout, I fly very regularly and this experience with Air France have just made them my preferred choice for my long-haul travel.",Business,4,1

The cabin crew were good, nothing special but efficient and personable. They were visible during the night and kept passing thru the cabin with water or whatever you wanted.

The inflight entertainment was excellent with a large selection of movies and music. The interactive moving flight tracking map was fun to use.

In Johannesburg the first thing Air France do as you approach check in, is to weigh your bag(s). We had two suitcases to check in to the hold. One was 1kg overweight and the other was 2kg overweight. We were told we had to repack or pay a charge. The woman on the scales (we were still not at check in) could not tell us how much the charge was, but sent us to the Air France ticket desk. Surely if your sole job is weighing bags you may have this information to hand! We queued at the ticket desk and eventualy were told that the overcharge was US$100 per bag. A total of $200 for being 3kg over their modest limit. I accept that we were over and although it would be nice for an airline to show some degree of tolerance, I would have accepted a reasonable charge - but $200 for 3kg is just a rip off. Consequently I repacked and threw away some items including 2 bottles of wine (that were not worth $100 each!). If Air France thinks that $200 is a reasonable charge then there is an issue. If Air France thinks that forcing their customer to scrabble around on the floor unpacking suitcases is a good customer experience then that too is an issue.

We checked in, and the ladies there actually told us to take luggage out of our checked bags because our checked baggage was over 23kg. Why would you tell us that if we cannot have over 12kg on a carryon? We were forced to check another bag for $80USD - without warning ahead of time, and there was no way they would let us onto the flight. This is unfair we had to pay for a 3rd bag we were not given advance notice on - which was a nice Tumi suitcase we never check because how nice it is. Of course the bag came out of the trip with many scratches - which was not planned. On top of this, the entire ordeal was rudely handled - the agents were too busy talking with each other and gave very little direction of what to do.

We get to Paris, they tell us the flight is full, we have to seat at random. Well at random, and even though we booked the flights together, meant that we had to sit in the middle row, on separate rows. To top it all of, my husband had an overweight passenger next to him that occupied part of his seat. If two people book a flight together can't you simply put them together? In general the flight attendants couldn't care less about trying to get us to seat together, I mean, not even tried or looked like they cared. Not even ""we apologize"" no, the attitude was more like ""I couldn't care less"". It was a terrible experience. I won't select Air France anytime soon.",Couple Leisure,3,nan

In flight meal service was impeccable, the meal (described as snack) was actually a ""duck confit"" and was offered choices of sauces, one of which was a really surprising French hot pepper sauce but one of the best ever tasted.

A330 / A380 Boeing 777,Premium Economy,3,November 2015,3,2,3,yes,YVR to JNB via CDG,4,"We chose premium economy because it was only Can$500 more than the already very low Air France economy fare. The fare allowed us a free stop-over in Paris, double the luggage allowance and about 4 times more miles compared to the lowest economy fare. Check in at Vancouver Airport was a breeze - there was no line-up at the Sky Priority counter and boarding the A330 was as quick as we used the Sky Priority line. The premium economy cabin was cozy due to its small size, and quite luxurious, reminiscent of business class in the 1980s. Seating was 2-3-2, spread across a few rows, with more than ample legroom and considerably wider seats than economy class. The bucket seats offered 40% more space than economy and they reclined within a fixed area to ensure that personal space could not be encroached upon from the front or back seats. The backseat TV screens were 12 inches and there were plenty of relatively recent movies to while away the time if you can’t sleep. Food was standard economy fare although Air France claims the starter is ‘inspired by the Business Class menu’. Wine was from good French stock and plentiful, if one so desired. One problem was that premium economy passengers did not quite know which toilets to use, as curtains were used to cordon off the business toilet on the left, but not the right, and vice versa. Another set of curtains cordoned off the access to the economy cabin. This happened intermittently on all four legs of this journey, including the A380 to Johannesburg and the flight back to Vancouver. After checking in at Paris CDG Terminal 2E, we were allowed as premier economy passengers, to purchase access to the business class lounge for Euro30. It was worthwhile as we had a six hour wait and it is one of the best business class lounges – outstanding showers, good food and a wide selection of wines and spirits. The flight on the A380 to Johannesburg was smooth and it remains my favourite aircraft due to its size, spaciousness and because it is so quiet. The premium economy cabin is located on the upstairs deck. The layout was 2-3-2 and we had the two seats on the side, with lots of storage and head space above the window. Food and service were good, in line with expectations. On our return from Cape Town, the first leg to Johannesburg was on South African Airways on an Air France ticket in economy class, but we managed to check our luggage all the way to Vancouver. As we had another 5 hours to wait in Johannesburg, we wanted to use the business lounge paying with miles, which was within the rules governing lounge access to premium economy passengers, but were not allowed, contrary to Air France’s website rules. The A380 flight back to Paris and the B777 to Vancouver were fine, but the movie selection did not change much between Sep to November on this routing. All in all, apart from the irritations concerning lounge access, Air France still delivered a prime product on this route and in this class. The planes were in great condition, service onboard was above average and the value for money unbeatable. The flight between Vancouver and Paris was only introduced in the Spring of 2015 and provides Vancouver with a welcome link to France.",Couple Leisure,5,nan

The seat is quite comfortable for economy class and with some nice leg room. Again, I'm short so don't need so much space. In CDG staff was quite atentive and informative, as I hadn't done a connection to the UK before with Air France. Everything went quite smoothly (except Police in CDG, which is always a nightmare). I can sleep for about 90% of the 14 hour flight, so I can hardly talk about the entertainment system, but I saw they have a good selection of movies. On the return flight from Paris to SCL I ordered the a la carte menu which was awesome, and it was delivered to me before anyone else. I have to say their Twitter service is awesome, that's how social networks should work! I booked the menu, changed seats and asked lots of things using Twitter and the response was in a couple of hours. Before this trip, I had an awful experience in 2014, with a cancelled flight and a nightmare of route given instead.

A321 is the one used for domestic (La Navette) flights. Paris (Orly West) Airport arrival was smooth. Deplaning was fast and luggage arrived 15 minutes after our arrival. I like Orly Airport as it feels more functional and boarding-deplanning is usually smooth. Also, its closer to Paris center than CDG.

The first optical impression of the premium class cabin was good, big IFE-screen, fine noise cancelling airphones, reading lamp, space for water etc. The service was fine and better than in standard Economy, the Duck and goose foie gras terrine was like in business, the Salmon fagottini pasta not. I did not taste much of the salmon. I had a long day-flight and for this purpose the Premium Class is a good choice. But I cannot recommend it for sleeping. You have a fixed seat without a real inclination. You just can glide some 10cm more in front of you and thats it. But you have enough legroom.

Unlike Garuda and Singapore Airlines, there is no hot meal served, just a quick sandwich with the usual round of drinks. While more than appropriate for the quick 1.5 hour flight, it's not as good as what is offered by Singapore Air and Garuda. The one thing I can't get over is the 10 seat across economy in Air France with a 3-4-3 seat config in their B777 - I'm  glad that many airlines in Asia still maintain the 9 across setup.

Although with the oddity that during the long haul flight from Paris to Bangkok, the cabin crew vanish and just leave the drinks area open with a few cups, which means that everytime you want a drink you have to wake up everyone next to you. What happened to a trolley coming down every hour or so to avoid this? The flight back was a different experience, the plane from BKK to Paris was clearly older with old IFE (and less than half the films of the outgoing flight) with no USB charger, the seats were uncomfortable and heavily compressed and the staff were quite simply rude, ignoring all requests for assistance from any passenger than attempted to get hold of someone. Basically astonishingly poor service. Also the food on the way back was sub par, seemingly because they don't control the food supply from Bangkok and rely on Thai Airways. (Given the Thai Airways stickers all over the packaging). We had a transfer at CDG to Heathrow, the plane was departing at approx 9pm but it not only left late, but Air France didn't prep the plane and therefore we had to spend 30 minutes in total to head to a de-icing zone. The staff however were at least pleasant on this flight. However the journey wasn't over, Air France then managed to lose one of our bags in the transfer from CDG to Heathrow.

The past few years I've flown from Europe to Chile, Air France has offered the best value tickets, at about 500 GBP return these were significantly less than all other options, and when I first flew in 2009 the service was far from bad. However as of my last journey in 2015, the quality has gone down. 10 Abreast in a 777 has never been a good thing, and the seats are not particularly comfortable either. The cushions are hard, the headrest is quite awkward, and the majority of the seats have the entertainment boxes underneath them, leaving little room for people with longer legs. Even though I am not tall I notice it. The interiors of the 777s are quite old, the IFE screen is pretty awful and there are no services such as in seat AC or USB chargers. There is not too terrible a selection of entertainment, but I don't really find myself spending all too much time on it due to the screen being too bright in the night and being so small. The crew often seem to forget to check the tissues and paper towels in the lavatories.  Meal quality is mediocre, particularly bad is the bread which is dry and tough. They serve decent wine and during the night there are serve yourself carts to get ice cream, drinks, and sandwiches. The cabin crew are generally quite friendly, and although they are not out looking to make you feel comfortable, when you ask they will serve you attentively. Unfortunately 2016 has brought higher prices, generally around the same range as the other carriers that offer this route. Most of these involve a stop in Brazil and a 4 hour leg on LAN or TAM to get to Chile, which is a bit irritating, but I'd take the hit if it means better aircraft and better service at the same price.",Business,2,nan

The flight was delayed from 02:20 to 03:45am. It was a rather old A330 and the IFE was dysfunctional, as was the headphone, could not hear anything. The steward looked at it but said that it could not be repaired but since it was a night flight that was not a big deal. After departure and reaching cruising altitude there was no service since everybody in this cabin went to sleep. It was quite turbulent but otherwise had I had a decent sleep. But then the lights went on rather early, slightly less than three hours before expected landing. Lights going on usually suggests the start of breakfast service. Still sleepy, a stewardess approached me en said something in French which I could not really understand because I also had my earplugs still in. I thought that she wanted to know what I would like for breakfast so I answered ""omelette au fromage"" from the choices in the menu. She started to laugh out loud, as did the French speaking lady next to me. I took my ear plugs out, she could not stop laughing and said to the lady ""quel idiot"". The lady responded ""un coup d'œil suffit pour que voir"" and both laughed even louder. Well you don't need to know much of French to understand that! It appeared that she had informed me, in French, that the plane was diverted to Frankfurt because of bad weather in Paris and we would land earlier so breakfast would be served earlier too. I told the stewardess that I think it is not appropriate to call somebody ""idiot"" because somebody does not understand the French right after being waked up with earplugs still in. She replied ""excusez-moi"" and left. I should not have said anything because they ""forgot"" to serve the breakfast (I went to the toilet). When I asked for it, they told me we would land soon and they could not serve anymore, although there was still (according to scheduled arrival) two hours to fly and they actually still serving others! I asked for at least a cup of coffee, she brought it and accidently the cup flipped and I had the hot coffee over me! No excuse, she just walked away, so I went again to the toilet to wash the (not so hot) coffee off. Actually, we did not land in Frankfurt but could still land in Paris after all.

Minus point: Cabin service: Perfunctory, offhand, going through the motions (just about). This was a daytime flight but the shutters were battened down for more than 9 hours of a 12 hour flight. Patronisingly, like I was a 7 year old, I was told that ""passengers like to sleep monsieur"". So I checked the cabin and less than 20% were. - Lazy, inattentive cabin crew, they could do less work less if they kept the punters bedded down for as long as possible. Food: Dreadful. Just about OK for economy class, unacceptable for a business class. But at least the champagne was warm. A lamb dish that couldn't have been more overcooked. The rest was completely uninspiring. A self service ""buffet"" that any self-respecting airline should have been embarrassed to offer, even in economy. Narrow seat, but just about OK for sitting up in, but uncomfortable as a bed , angled rather than lie-flat. Verdict: The worst business class flight I've ever had. I'll never fly Air France by choice again. I would have had better value in Premium Economy with a proper airline. The quality of the cabin crew has a lot to do with whether you have a good flight or not. This lot would have been better working on a bus.

We could also get newspapers of the day before boarding. Flight was slightly delayed on return because of windy conditions and we got plenty of excuses. However booking and online check-in is silly: we bought our tickets at the same time on AF website, but as my wife had a cheaper ticket (without luggage), we were given two different reservation numbers. When we checked in online (as soon as it was open), I could choose my seat but not her and there was no way to seat together as all passengers had been automatically given seats. At the check in counter, as the plane was full there was also no way to change even though ground staff tried : he said this was a problem with this new system. Hopefully in the plane FAs helped couples to seat together. On return, the seat next to my wife was free and I could change for it during online check-in.

The breakfast was slightly more edible but the yoghurt with the texture of cottage cheese was not. The inflight entertainment is old and low resolution with a below average selection of tv and films. The general approach from cabin crew was absolutely fine although there was no effort to check on or provide any service between meals. Most competitors these days will come through the cabin during the night with cold drinks and many also offers snacks like ice creams etc. The seats felt old and while were fine on first sitting down, became very uncomfortable as the 10hr flight went on. Considering it was quite an expensive flight I felt very let down and wish I had gone for the slightly worse flight times with Emirates as I know I would have had a far better flight.",Solo Leisure,2,nan

No boarding announcements, so 1 missed the single bus to the aircraft on the apron and had to wait 20 minutes for the same bus to offload and circle back to the gate to collect remaining passengers. At a major hub airport this is absolutely shambolic flight services management. Further apron delay. Cabin service was standard, with poor food. Typical AF experience.",Business,2,nan

On this Air France flight, they only served one real meal for lunch and that was it. The Salmon was OK, and half way through everybody is served a snack / small meal, they ran out of one of the 2 meals they had, and the other choice was poor quality but I was so hungry that I didn't care.

Obliquely orientated, with a removable panel in the middle seats. Completely flat bed (and comfortable, without uncomfortable divisions on the seat). Plenty of space with private locker.

The meals are good and different but are still served with the trolley and dishes are not served directly to yourtable like a restaurant. Missing the feeling of personal service. The seat is comfortable and reclines to become a bed. The amenity kit provided is not very elegant. The entertainment system is rather good and very large and bright screen.

The catering on this flight, unlike the catering flying the opposite direction on June 7, was amazing: delicious, fresh, well cooked, perfectly presented. What a difference a week and a different point of origin makes! For flight AF55, I called the catering an embarrassment to French baking; the catering on this Air France flight was perfect! A tiny amuse bouche included a nice bit of caviar with a mother of pearl spoon to scoop it up. My fish main dish was hot, well cooked and delicious. Same for the veal selected by my friend. The tomato soup also wonderful and served hot. And the mixed salad served after the main courses, and made to order, was fresh and delicious. Desserts were varied and beautiful, especially the strawberries, sweet and intense in flavor. The crew was very attentive, professional, and the on ground service was heroic; after we landed, the tarmac at Dulles was shut for two hours while a lightning storm hit DC and our luggage arrived after this agonizing delay, but the ground staff kept cool and tried to keep the passengers informed but of course, everyone, including the flight crew simply had to wait for the lightning to end before the baggage handlers were allowed by Dulles to complete their work : unloading the incoming aircraft, our Air France 380 and others.

The seats are great, the 'turn down' service (making the seat into a bed) was wonderful, flight crew and Purser were very professional and friendly, the 380 aircraft is a wonder of quiet and power. The ground staff and escort service for FC passengers at IAD and at CDG are excellent if a bit embarrassing, I am not accustomed to such level of service. The on board catering however was not good at all. No caviar service, the pea soup was barely warm, the texture was thick and really unappetizing, the chicken was barely OK, accompanied by mixed overcooked veggies and a thick and gooey green 'sauce?', we did not try the crab cakes. Dessert was a chocolate concoction with fresh fruit nearby. They offered ice cream too but then told us it was still too frozen to serve. A mixed salad described on the menu to follow the entree never was offered, perhaps it was still frozen? The butter served with bread is a tiny packet you unwrap. The cheese service was three small pieces, no choice from a cart, each cold, served with a slice of bread and one dried apricot. Yikes. Breakfast was a disappointment: fruit crepes with a tiny ""croissant"" and blueberry 'muffin' that were an embarrassment to French baking. Honestly, we have excellent croissants in the DC region; please AF, find them and serve them. And serve two or three jams with the breads instead of only the packets of butter? A Youtube reviewer said he loved the AF breakfast crepes, and could still taste them after his trip, I can still taste them too, but I hope the taste fades quickly.

Bad side: Food. One meal and one snack is not enough for a 12hr flight, you need two meals and one snack.

A380,Premium Economy,2,May 2016,3,3,1,no,LAX to CDG,1," |  On our flight to Paris from Los Angeles, neither movie monitor worked. Not only did they not work, both were stuck ""on"" so you had bright monitor lights shining in your faces while trying to sleep. It could not be shut off. Then seat 85K would not recline at all, it was broken. So, once the plane's cabin lights were dimmed and everyone around us was asleep, we were left with monitor lights in our eyes and one seat would not recline. I have a bad back so this only made it worse. The plane was full so there were no available seats for us to move. At one point, a flight attendant tried to tape a magazine over the monitors.... only to have them fall off into our laps 20-30 minutes later. These premium economy seats were $2700 more than coach seats, yet they were horrible and an unpleasant start to our vacation. The folks in economy watched movies and their seats reclined. I filed a complain when we got back home with Air France, only to find that Delta Airlines handles the complaints for Air France. They were sorry, and offered some free mileage for the inconvenience. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, this might be a good thing to a frequent flyer, but in our lifetime, we will never have enough mileage, with or without their offering, to earn anything. So the mileage offering was nothing to us. This was a once in a lifetime vacation so we paid the extra money for the upgraded seats, only to have these indicated issues. There is no skin off Delta's nose to handling the complaint. I got the usual ""this is the best we can do"" response. Despite my repeated emails to Delta about this poor offering, they will do no more. The flight back home, two weeks later was great. Monitors worked and the seats reclined, but needless to say, we started off horrible on Air France and it took 3-4 days for the aggravated back issues to subside. If this is how Air France feels, then I'd opt for another airline. And, if Delta is handling the complaints for them, I suspect they would be just as bad.

Check-In counter repeated the exercise, before actually reading the booking information. Not sure whether they are hiring high-school kids to staff the counters at YYZ. Boarding uneventful. Flight delayed 40 minutes due to unknown reasons. Business class cabin was full. In the air, if Air France actually tried, their Business Class product could not be poorer. Jaded cabin-crew and indifferent service combined with atrocious food came together in perfect harmony to make this, without a doubt, one of the worst flight experiences I have had.

A very empty part of the cabin meant we had as much attention as we wanted (which is never that much). Food was very good, wine selection was superb, cheese tray and deserts (especially the Lychee and Cointreau ice cream) were spectacular. Air France still uses the bucket seats that almost lie flat. They work awesome for me on night flights and are just as awesome for day flights. 8 hour flight flew by with plenty of food and drink. A couple of bottles of individual shots of a liquer to go ( Chartreuse Verte) was a nice surprise as well. This airline never disappoints me.

Concerned, professional crews (though probably helps if you speak French). Far better service than anyone else with food, drink, entertainment (long flights). I actually had something on one AF flight last year that I thought was worthy of a restaurant. Their longhaul premium economy product is a godsend for those whose workplaces that won't pay for business class. Roughly equivalent seat-wise to what you'd find in a North American first-class seat (not lie-flat, but decent space for legs and shoulders). If you have enough time, CDG is a good change of plane space. Lots of places to stretch out, relax, restaurants, etc. Good AF clubs. CDG can be good or bad, depending on where you're going. If you have to connect from a regional affiliate (HOP), it's a trek to any of the mainline departures halls.  Ground staff are a bit harried, although not rude.

To this respect it must be underlined the coherent seat class policy of AF; other airlines charge a Premium Economy fare for a seat in Economy class first row (or Emergency Exits seats) while Air France has a dedicated cabin space for Premium Economy customers and charges a reasonable surcharge to let one seat at front economy row.

Firstly, I was most impressed that unlike the US carriers, empty seats in business class were not filled to capacity at the gate, while I understand that I only buy one seat, the sense of exclusivity that should be part of spending many thousands of dollars on a premium seat is considerably degraded by upgrading all and sundry until the cabin is full. The cabin was pleasant, the seats a touch elderly but comfortable and the space quite adequate. The flight attendants were delightful, the food and drink selections very good and all in all, a very comfortable and most agreeable journey. I am fortunate to fly in business class long-haul several times each year, and find that the offerings in this cabin are becoming clearer all the time. Air France does have it right, and even though this was operated with an older aircraft, and the old seating, it was very good indeed.

We travelled as a family with 2 babies, one 6 months and 1 and a half. Before boarding, the staff began by calling the families with children and made us stand in a queue for half an hour with the kids (we remained standing as they told us to queue in the priority line). Then they made us get on the plane before the other passengers, but the other passengers arrived immediately behind us, so no time to settle properly. The seats that were chosen for us were in the middle (booked by the company I work for, 1 week before), so there was no way to put the baby in the cradle provided. We asked for the seats to be changed and the staff told us to wait until all the other passengers are onboard. Once everyone was seated, the staff did not get back to us and avoided our gaze. So we stood up and went to look to see if we could change seats. The staff replied that the front seats are normally more expensive and it will be difficult to change. Finally, a friendly passenger who was sitting in the front row gave his seat to my wife and our 6 month old baby. I was forced to repeatedly disturb the person next to me to stand up and help my wife. My 1 and half year old should have a got a children's meal, despite my reminders, he never received anything. My wife who was busy with giving the bottle to our baby while meals were served, never received her meal. For breakfast, the staff failed to serve me the hot meal that was offered with the rest of the breakfast.

As I only had a very short layover time, I asked the purser how this will be handled. He told me not to worry, all will be handled at CDG. However, nothing happened at CDG. No ground staff to take care. I had 30 min only, but no assitance. As most Euro flights are outsourced to HOP which uses terminal G at CDG, you can only get there by bus. Even at the bus-gate Air France people said 'no problem'. Again, no one cared about my situation. We arrived at Terminal G at departure time, but could not get out of the bus. So four hours delay.

Outbound flight on A380 in Premium Economy. It's almost a dedicated cabin, except the restrooms are at the rear of the aircraft in economy. Crew and service good; dinner was tasty, but didn't really notice that Premium Economy was upgraded as advertised. Mid flight an ice cream bar was served which was a nice touch. Breakfast was abysmal - basically nothing but sugar and nothing even vaguely nutritious. But the biggest downfall of Premium Economy are the shell seats. They are simply tortuous to sit in for any period of time, and sleeping was just about impossible. Even though the seat reclines within the shell, you still feel like you are sitting up. And even when using an inflatable back pillow I was extremely uncomfortable. The return flight from CDG to LAX was on a Boeing 777-300ER; this time the Premium Economy cabin had two dedicated restrooms, but the crew did nothing to stop biz or economy passengers from using them. Unlike the outbound flight the crew could not have been more disinterested. After serving dinner they disappeared for 8 hours. They did not even come around with water once during the flight. And barely a smile from anybody. Supposedly there was a mid-flight snack, but it was never announced or offered. The 777 has the same shell seats, and this time they seemed to have even less recline the A380. They also have a legrest which provides a little support for your upper legs, but unless you are 4 feet tall is completely ineffective. By the end of the flight both my partner and I had back pains.

AF offered an upgrade on the return (this flight) for a bargain $339. It proved to be less comfortable than Premium Economy. Boarding was efficient, but entering the cabin, it was warm and stuffy. That did not change for 12 hours. I was sweating throughout the flight. My seat, 66E, was in the second row. The seat seemed to be an older model from the newer pod seats I have seen AF offer. It was conventional in shape, six across. The seat itself was fairly comfortable, but you could not reach some of the small storage spots built into the seat if you were sitting. It came with a small bottle of Evian. Sweating as I did, I needed it replaced, but they only would refill the plastic bottle. Fine, but not classy. The AV unit offered a large and diverse amount of programming. It also broke down 4 times during the flight. Finally, 8 hours in, they gave up. This was only my seat. There were a few other seats unoccupied, but no offer was made to move me. Even though in the second row, each time food service was offered, they were out of everything ""except the fish."" The fish was cold, bland, inedible. Things can go wrong, that happens. But while the rest of the crew was accommodating, the Chief Purser was a nightmare. I watched him work, he never completed anything regarding guest service without forgetting to complete it. When I told him about what was happening, he seemed uninterested. The seat belt jammed, he never came back to deal with it. He never apologized for the food. During beverage service, I asked for some sparkling water. ""We're out."" How can an Air France plane run out of Perrier (probably because everyone else was drinking buckets of water). One of the Flight Attendants went back to Premium Economy to score some Perrier.

Very attentive lavatory service, in one case FA checked status before let me enter. again, appreciated. Good IFE, did not use a lot since I had some job to do. Just noted not very high contrast of the screen, but not a problem.

This time I chose Premium Economy, not being sure whether the plane had the ""old"" seats in Business class (reclining 2-3-2, not very comfortable), or the better new ""lie-flat"" arrangement. The Economy plus seats are definitely better than economy (I am 1.85m tall ~6 ft) and adding the advantages of priority check-in, security and boarding, extra luggage allowance, this is probably a solution of good value. Onboard, service is just barely OK, but the food is definitely inferior: a poor quality foie gras, an insipid chicken, and a cheese wedge which did not resemble much to Camembert.

On the first time we called, they said the bags would be delivered on the next flight from Marseille so we said that was fine. That evening, no bags were delivered so we rang again.

The stewards looked as if they felt too good to be serving other people, and for any food or drinks you would have to walk to the back of the plane. They were not helpful until personally approached with a question. During the flight they were just talking with each other in the back of the plane (they were not too busy to help).

I purchased the ticket via Delta.com as their price was cheaper for this route. I fly enough on SkyTeam to know that inter carrier arrangements can cause some issues, but have not had an experience like this. I checked in at BHM and had all my bags checked all the way through to DXB. When I arrived at DXB, no bags showed up. So after a few mins at the baggage office (who were superb in locating and providing info) we found out that all 3 bags were left behind in ATL. 2 were subsequently routed via CDG & 1 via AMS. I know that logistics are often out of the hands of the airline, but was surprised that 20 hours had elapsed between taking off at ATL and arriving at DXB, so was really surprised that I hadn't been informed via any kind of automated or manual message. Eventually after 36 hours all 3 made it to my destination and all was good. A little about the service. The ATL-CDG 777-200 was OK, nothing bad, but 2x2x2, so not a huge amount of privacy, CDG-DXB on the new 700-300 configuration and seats are great! Plenty of room, giant screen, much better food and service than a couple of years ago. Even the connection in CDG wasn't that bad. Overall a very nice experience. DXB-CDG, again AF metal 777-300 and CDG-ATL an old configuration 767-400 and noticeable less foot room on DLs BC seat than the new AF. Service still good however. I think between AF & DL there isn't much difference in service, so it's all down to personal comfort which I did find better on AF. Arriving at ATL had another baggage nightmare, none of my 3 bags made it again. They were on my flight, but got held in customs. Unfortunately there are some communication problems at Delta as one person said they were on carousel (which clearly they weren't), one person said they were held up in customs (as per the delta.com app update) and one said they were already transferred to my BHM connection. So if they could clean up their internal communication issues and give out reliable info this would help reassure PAX.

The seats were very uncomfortable with little space for your feet. I was sitting in a middle seat between two others and the whole trip was like hell. My boyfriend is 1,80 and he couldn't move.

Problem are drinks between meals, cabin crew brought drinks only with meals, but not in between. You can go to gallery and pour yourself a drink, but when you have a window seat two people need to stand up and they might be sleeping, it wouldn't kill the cabin crew to walk around with couple drinks. Also boarding was done bit chaotic. At least the leg room was good on all aircraft including A320 and really good on A321 (same as at 777).

The FA ensured we got the privacy we required by drawing the curtains (what a concept!) part way. The food service was outstanding, I opted to forgo the caviar (I don't like the stuff) and went for the lentil and coriander soup which was delicious. I then had the filet - this was perfectly served rare in the middle and very moist.  The Saint Honore dessert listed in the menu wasn't available so I was offered an apple tart, this too was superb. While I changed into my pyjamas the FA made up my bed. The curtains were fully closed and I dozed off quickly. I woke up after 3 hours feeling rather hot - the pyjamas were extremely efficient. If I have a complaint - it's that I think the cabin is a bit airless with the curtains closed. I'd like the ability to create some air movement, but that's a nitpick. I don't do breakfast so I just had a pot of coffee. On arrival at Haneda I was handed over to my personal airport escort. All in all - I believe this is the finest 1st class service out there.

From check in through to arrival, two (out and return) of the worst flying experiences I've had. Check in at Orly is a farce. Staff are rude to everyone. Boarding was chaos with staff making no attempt to assist. Service on board is shocking. Staff are rude and arrogant. Aircraft is visibly dirty. No excuse for filthy aircraft. Inflight entertainment failed. Staff made no attempt to fix. Everything about AF is shabby and worn out. The aircraft, the staff and the facilities. Rude and arrogant. Unhelpful. First time with them and for sure the last. Air Caraibes or Corsair next time. Can't possibly be worse. Additionally we had a problem with my daughter's ticket. We tried contacting customer services but got no reply to email. No reply at all. I am an experienced traveller (1K flyer with UK, Silver with LHR, gold with Emirates).

As I waited by the gate for an expected boarding time of 2.25 pm and got into line, we are told there will be a delay boarding until 3.10 pm. At 3.10pm we are updated that the flight is delayed until 5.30pm and that first class, business class and premium can go to the Air France executive lounge. I walk for a good 10 minutes to the lounge which is quite far from the gate I was at. When I get to the counter to check into the lounge the attendant tells me that there was a mistake and premium does not get in free (I am flying premium) but tells me that I can pay 45 euros for access. I had to talk to my colleague to check that this would be acceptable. When I get an OK from my colleague to pay for access I go back to the counter and ask to pay for access. This time a different attendant tells me that I cannot pay for access. I explain what happened and showed her the attendant that said I could pay to access and after conversing in French they tell me no sorry you cannot access. I felt these people have no courtesy for their customer. This was my first experience with Air France. Unfortunately it will be my last. ",Business,1,3

Unfortunately things were getting worse. I got my tray with some cold chicken, jam, butter and drink. Then nothing more happened, both staff were very busy in Economy (I was the only Business Class guest). After 10 minutes or so I was asking about bread to start eating. She told me I should have a look in the menu which kind of bread I like. I said that a roll (on the menu) or wholewheat bread (on the menu as well) would be fine.

We boarded the plane prior to economy class (Sky priority benefit), and they received us with wine and some peanuts. About an hour after we took off we had dinner and was pretty fine, and drinks were according with the food. The service was good, but some flight attendants were not very friendly. About the seat, well, Premium Economy seats aren't so comfy, at least in my case. In fact, I arrived in Paris with a terrible back hurt.

First Class cabin on A380 is on lower level of plane by entrance of plane so draughty and passengers from other classes passing through cabin. Seats are OK but the pop up screen for in-flight entertainment was small and totally archaic. Food really nothing special (should be one area where AF could excel - cheese selection was pathetic) and no first class treats like caviar. Good wines but white wine arrived as I was finishing my starter - only 4 people in cabin. Cabin crew not very professional - seemed to spend a lot of time just talking to each other. Air France needs a wake up call as it is surpassed in cabin quality, food, service by virtually every other airline flying between Asia and Europe. So far behind Emirates, Qatar etc - it is almost embarrassing.",Business,1,nan
nan,Economy Class,3,January 2017,3,1,3,no,Madrid to Washington via Paris,1," |  Air France was a terrible experience. We have a Madrid to Washington DC flight with stopover at Paris CDG, the worst organized in Europe. When we are checking in we are told that one of the hand luggage, typical Samsonite that meets all the measurements to take it on the plane, we cannot take it with us and we have to check it. So we ended up charging the 2 big suitcases and a small one. We landed in Paris about 12:20. At that same moment the passengers of the flight that has to take us to Washington DC begin to embark, since the flight leaves at 13:15. To catch the flight we have to: Exit the plane, pass the passport control where we find a queue of about 200 people that we have to jump, change terminal with a bus and then arrive at the boarding gate. We ended up catching the flight only because it was delayed for almost an hour, that saves us. We arrived in Washington DC and the PA calls me and my wife. We are informed that our suitcases have stayed in Paris and that they will come the next day at 20:00. What seems to me most outrageous about this issue is that they offer you a flight with a connection where you have about 50 minutes to do all the running around possible to catch it and they take for granted that they do not have time to change the plane bags. The next day we stayed home to pick up the bags at the indicated time, 20:00 -  the bags do not arrive and we decided to call Air France. An agent tells us that only 2 suitcases come and that the other is still in Paris, and tells us that the suitcases arrived at 6 in the morning instead of the promised time. We go to bed and at 2 in the morning they call us, we do not know the number and it turns out that there is a van out of the house with a suspicious look, we imagine they are the suitcases. I change in a hurry to go and meet them and at that moment the van starts, my wife yells at the window and we get the guy to stop.  We have not yet received any apology from Air France, which has offered us a truly regrettable service. Take great care with Air France!  Air France, terrible experiencia!! Llegamos al aeropuerto mi mujer y yo. Tenemos un vuelo Madrid – Washington DC con escala en el aeropuerto de Charles de Gaulle de París, el peor organizado de Europa. Cuando estamos facturando nos dicen que una de las maletas de mano, típica Samsonite que cumple con todas las medidas para llevarla en el avión, no la podemos llevar con nosotros y la tenemos que facturar. Por tanto acabamos facturando las 2 maletas grandes y una pequeña. Aterrizamos en París sobre las 12:20. En ese mismo instante los pasajeros del vuelo que nos tiene que llevar a Washington DC empiezan a embarcar, ya que el vuelo sale a la 13:15. Para coger el vuelo tenemos que: Salir del avión, pasar el control de pasaportes donde nos encontramos con una cola de unas 200 personas que nos tenemos que saltar, cambiar de terminal con un autobús y luego llegar a la puerta de embarque. Acabamos cogiendo el vuelo de milagro y porque éste se retrasará casi una hora, eso nos salva. Llegamos a Washington DC y por la megafonía nos llaman a mi mujer y a mí. Nos comunican que nuestras maletas se han quedado en París y que vienen al día siguiente a las 20:00. Lo que me parece más indignante de este asunto es que ellos te ofrecen un vuelo con una conexión donde realmente tienes unos 50 minutos para hacer todas las virguerías posibles para cogerlo y ellos dan por hecho que no tienen tiempo de cambiar las maletas de avión, que es una gestión mucho mas rapida y directa que la que tiene que hacer un pasajero. Al día siguiente nos quedamos en casa para recoger las maletas a la hora indicada, las 20:00. Pasa una hora, dos, las maletas no llegan y decidimos llamar a AirFrance. Un agente nos indica que de las 3 maletas sólo vienen 2 y que la otra sigue en París, además nos dice que las maletas llegaran a las 6 de la mañana en lugar de la hora prometida. Por si fuera poco la información que nos da sobre las maletas no se corresponde con la que ofrecen en la web. Nos vamos a acostar y a las 2 de la mañana nos llaman, no conocemos el número y resulta que hay una furgoneta fuera de casa con una pinta sospechosa, nos imaginamos que son las maletas. Me cambio a toda prisa para bajar y en ese momento la furgoneta arranca, mi mujer le grita desde la ventana y conseguimos que el tipo se detenga no se pire con las maletas. La tercera en cuestión la recibimos dos días después. Todavía no hemos recibido ninguna disculpa por parte de la compañía, que nos ha ofrecido un servicio realmente lamentable.

Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,1,January 2017,2,2,2,no,BKK to CDG,1," |  Bangkok to Paris CDG. Flight was delayed nearly one hour on outward leg and 30 mins on return. I am tall and had no space for my legs, very tiny if compared with other airlines. Flight attendants do the minimum job, not even giving water during the flight - when you seat on window seat its always hard to ask the others to move just to go and catch a glass of water. No choice for food, its either chicken or chicken, very basic but that's fine, this is economy. I took Air France for the price and direct flight but service is very basic, boarding is chaotic in Paris airport. I won't fly Air France again.

She muttered a quick 'pardon' under her breath, without even looking me in the eye. I didn't even get a proper apology! The food was terrible.

On New Years Eve going back home on a connecting flight, first flight from Tehran to Paris was delayed and about 30 passengers missed the second flight because we had to wait for a whole hour at the airport for a bus to pick up the passengers. Air France representative rudely told us that it is not their reaponsibility and didn't even offer an apology. They agreed to get us tickets to go back home but said all direct flights were full for the next 2days. We trusted their word and agreed to sleep at the airport for the night and arrive into Toronto 30hrs later than planned. Next morning we find out that half of the passengers who had missed the same flight were going to Toronto on a direct flight. None of them had children or any disabilities. Although we were the first ones to get to customer service they didn't give us the tickets and made us wait for more 26 hours before our next flight. Again, there was no apology. I guess they cheap out on taking responsibility and apologizing as well. This was my first time flying Air France and I promised them it would be my last.

Boeing 777-300ER (Caribbean Layout),Premium Economy,4,November 2016,3,4,4,no,CDG to CUN,4," |  Paris CDG to Cancun. Due to our delayed incoming flight from DUS we needed to run to our gate. After we arrived at the gate, we've been able to pass this long row of waiting passengers with SkyPriority status. Friendly staff welcomed us onboard. The small cabin for he Premium Economy is offering enough space and with 32 places it’s quite and relaxed. Cleaning was very bad and I found a used knife and fork in my seat shelf. My remote controller was broke so I wasn’t able to control the volume of my headphones. Screen size is okay and the selection of films is surprisingly good. The seat itself is comfortable and equipped with a footrest. Nice pillow and a warm blanket on each seat. The amenity-kit is above basic and well presented in a small colorful bag. Soon after takeoff the aperitif service started with a glass of Champagne or juice and some very tasty crackers. My husband pre-ordered me a meal (with additional fee) which was good, but from my point of view it’s not worth for this price. The regular meal looks not like Premium Economy and is only offering a starter in addition to standard meal. Air France is offering an open bar in the galley with soft drinks, beer and sandwiches during the flight. Prior to landing our friendly flight attendant served a kind of warm pizza snack with another bar service. As far as I can remember we had 2 times a meal service and 3 times a bar coming though including the aperitif service. It’s a little poor for a premium economy. After arrival our bags came quiet fast and without any interception.",Couple Leisure,3,nan
A319 / A318,Economy Class,4,December 2016,5,3,nan,yes,LHR to WAW via CDG,3," |  London Heathrow to Warsaw via Paris VDG. Booked outbound flights with Air France via their partner KLM's website. This meant we couldn't choose our seats at the time of boarding. However, online check-in opened 30 hours before departure and we could change our allocated seats at that point. We were happy with the allocated seats on this occasion. Air France website was easy to use, and the check in process was very simple and quick. Printed our boarding passes to minimise queuing at Heathrow (outbound travel was with hand luggage only despite paying the extra for checked baggage). Stepping onboard our flight to CDG we were met by two smiling cabin crew and directed to follow the queue down the single aisle. The onboard team were friendly and courteous. During the 1 hr flight, a full bar service was offered, plus we were given a small chocolate muffin. Given the short flight time, the captain announced we were beginning our descent before half the passengers had been served. It can sometimes appear that in order to offer a ""full service"" to passengers on short haul flights, things seem so rushed. In no time at all, we were back on the ground and taxiing to the gate at CDG. Flight no 2, to Warsaw was slightly different. As we boarded, there was only one flight attendant, and she was talking on the phone so the passengers just walked passed without the usual greeting. This was the first time I have experienced this - there are usually two attendants at the door so even if one has to take a call, the other performs the customary welcome. I noticed that with both flights, the pre-departure safety announcement did not feature instructions on use of the life jackets.  This flight was longer, so the bar service and sandwich (choice of salmon or cheese) was more relaxed and enjoyable - so much so, I requested a second bottle of wine. There were only two lavatories onboard meaning a queue formed at times. If there was anything to improve these two flights it would be a few small screens to show the flight route. It gives passengers some kind of reference while we're cruising above the clouds. All things considered, I enjoyed my first experience of travelling with Air France. I have read various reviews, but the product they offered ( two short haul flights at a reasonable price) was pretty good in this instance, our flights got us to Warsaw slightly ahead of time which was our key concern. My main reason for choosing particular airlines is a combination of cost, service and flight times. For us, flight times are the main factor - we can usually trade off a higher cost against better flight times, and for short flights, the service doesn't to be anything special. I would certainly consider flying Air France again if their schedule meets our needs in the future.",Couple Leisure,4,nan

Boeing 777,Economy Class,5,January 2017,4,3,5,yes,Birmingham to Singapore via Paris,4,"Flew Air France from Birmingham - Paris CDG - Singapore and back during the year-end holidays. Until now I had not flown long-haul on European airlines, as I had an unfavourable impression of them compared to Asian/Mid Eastern ones. I reluctantly chose AF as it was really cheap (less than SGD 1,000 return) even during high season, and also because I could avoid Heathrow. It was also less disruptive to my sleep because the transit point was just an hour away, rather than mid-journey as is the case for Emirates/Qatar. But, reading mixed reviews about AF, I did not expect much especially for the price I was paying. I am glad that AF proved me wrong. The planes are well-maintained, the in-flight service is actually pretty good and the amenities are great. The CDG-SIN long-haul flight and its return leg had decent seats, newly-installed IFE with a wide range of movie options, and more than sufficient food - I really appreciated the mini snack-bars in the galleys. Only pity was that the meals on the return leg were not as tasty - maybe because they were prepared by SATS in SIN. The short-haul flights between BHX and CDG were basic but got its job done. The transit in CDG was smooth and the airport was pretty decent, it even had a newish-looking free transit lounge that provided power points and plush chairs. A small hiccup though was the poor attitude shown by the baggage agent at Birmingham airport. She was quite combative. Thankfully another agent eventually resolved my issue satisfactorily. Perhaps I'm not a very picky person but I felt that AF was at least on-par or even better than the Asian airlines, this is especially in contrast to SQ, which in early 2016 were still using the same IFE system on their 777s after more than a decade. I will definitely take AF again.

Starting in November 2016, I repeatedly applied for this refund, adding proof of confirmation and payments. Until today, these proofs have been ignored and a refund denied stating that no booking or can be found and the payments were correct. In addition, my connecting flight from Toronto to London was cancelled due to bad weather and, unless I wanted to spend the night in Toronto at my own expense, I joined with 2 other stranded passengers to rent a car to get to London. Although I booked and paid the flight with Air France, it referred me to Air Canada which denied my request for compensation and a refund of that leg of the flight.

Korean Air attendant handling Air France flights was very strict about not checking in passengers who do not travel in the particular class the counter is destined for. She explained that it has something to do with not having the proper luggage stickers but when I told her I didn't have check in luggage, she still asked me to rejoin the Skypriority queue. Immigration and Security checks in Incheon rivals that of Beijing - long, slow and very inefficient. Air France uses the Korean Air lounge in the satellite and it is just a waiting area with worn seats, dirty tables and bare minimum of stale refreshment. The whole Incheon Airport feels like a wet market with airport staff of different airlines screaming out loudly 'last call for this destination and final call for that destination' on top of nonstop announcements from the loudspeakers. The Air France flight was delayed for 40 minutes but boarding was orderly. A surprise to see Air France's upgraded business class. The new seat is the same as those used by Cathay Pacific or China Airlines but there are several slight differences - the entertainment system is newer although movie and TV selection still pales comparing to its Asian competitors, the seat does not have a step at the base which is more comfortable, the earphone compartment is bigger which is more convenient for storing personal items. However, the amenities Air France provides is few - toilets not cleaned, AF still give out flimsy blankets and the so called sleep bag has little content other than a tooth brush, earplugs and eye shades. Crew are efficient and attentive. Both meals were of good quality and quantity. Although the flight arrived 20 minutes late in Paris, connection to the Birmingham flight was easy as it departed from the same satellite of Terminal 2E. The short Paris - Birmingham flight turned out to be a Flybe flight and it was uneventful.

The senior cabin crew manager was charming and helpful in the extreme, moving me to a vacant seat that had much more legroom, and also offered me his personal gadget that enabled me to charge my iPad. The seat was just ok, however, as other reviewers have mentioned. The people who introduced this new seat should get James Dyson, the British vacuum designer, to have a look as it, as it is not comfortable. Plenty of pillows did help though.

I was very disappointed by the food served during my Singapore to Paris flight last night (worst one I've ever had for both meals) and by the discomfort of the seats (which appeared to be relatively new though). In comparison, the Phuket to Singapore 2-hours journey was pleasant, with decent food and very comfortable seats (operated by Silkair). I was also very confused by the inflight safety video which is, I assume, meant to be funny and to show typical French clichés (fashion, style) but it was barely understandable for my partner (a non-French speaker) because of the strong accent of the presenter. It's not the first time I see it, but this time I realized how bad it was as some people around me simply didn't understand what the hostess was saying. I used to have the Gold status, but despite the 30+ flights I took with them in 2016, I lost it. I understand they have financial issues, but treating their loyal customer like this, by lowering the level of service so much, won't make them earn more money. On national flights, I've been positively surprised by the service provided by low-cost companies lately. Air France has gone so far that I will pay less and flight with these companies for short journeys, instead of flying with them and not getting any value for money.",Couple Leisure,2,nan
A320,Economy Class,5,April 2017,5,4,nan,yes,Stockholm to Paris,4," |  Short-haul trips in Europe tend to be pretty drab, but I was pleasantly surprised by Air France after quite a few years I hadn't flown with them. In a moment where all airlines seem to be cutting back on passenger space and service, especially in economy, it is nice to see an airline going the other way. Flew from Stockholm to Paris. At check-in there was a manned desk for checking in and bag drop (while airlines such as Norwegian or SAS in Stockholm force you to use the self-check in kiosks and bag drops). The plane had been recently refurbished. A wet tissue was offered upon entering and a warm meal with dessert, choice of alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink and tea/coffee was served. A second pass of drinks was then offered. The service was carried out efficiently but without rushing the meal. Overall one of the best european short-haul flights I have taken in recent years.",Business,3,nan
A320,Economy Class,2,March 2017,1,1,nan,no,Florence to St Petersburgh via Paris,1," |  Florence to St Petersburg via Paris. They denied me my Elite status in Skyteam but this probably is the less. OnLine check in is as the low cost companies, because everything is by an additional payment, but the fare is classic and not light. Do you want a ""comfort seat"" in front of the airplane, pay! For two time, in flight between FLR to CDG and in the second CDG to LED I found the food horriblee, but not as bad as KLM in return flight. ",Couple Leisure,1,nan
A320,Economy Class,3,March 2017,2,4,nan,no,Paris to Tel Aviv,2," |  Paris to Tel Aviv. Seat comfort not the best due to limited space between seats. Since flight time is over four hours it is not so pleasant to have limited space. I had ordered a gluten free meal well in advance, but a member of staff came and told me that there only was one gluten free meal available, and two persons had ordered it. I was asked if I could eat an ordinary meal, but was also told that they also would ask the other person. After a while I was told that the other person accepted to take a kosher meal instead. When I got my meal I saw that it wasn't gluten free, but kosher. I told the staff, and they apologised for giving me the wrong meal. When I received the correct one, I had to wait 30 minutes before I got something to drink. Wine was good however. Even though they made some mistakes, the staff seemed to enjoy their work and seemed pleasant.",Couple Leisure,3,nan

The plane not being full added to the comfort, because the middle seat was free. Attentive crew pointed passengers to empty rows for more comfort. Apart from that we got a drink and a tasty snack. On time boarding but despite that we landed 10 mins late in DUS. Paid 58 euros. All in all a very good choice.",Solo Leisure,5,nan

The company's website did not work, I had requested particular seats because as a family we wanted to be next to each other but they were unable to allocate them because there is no option to book a seat before the last 24 hours. The flight was 1 hour 30 minutes late (vs a 2 hour flight). AF staff did not help us one bit and did not look happy to have children onboard. At the end of the flight, 2 stewardesses stared at us crossing arms while we were packing our things up and dressing our twin babies and three year old son without offering any help. Low cost carriers far better value and services, adieu Air France.",Family Leisure,1,nan

It’s kind of awkward sleeping next to a stranger and climbing over to get up. Still, the set up is quite roomy. If you travel with all sorts of small carry-ons, as I do, get a window seat which has it’s own storage bin next to it. The food was almost uniformly very good. Foie gras, salmon tartare… Unfortunately, the duck was grossly overcooked and swam, very unattractively, in a sea of orange something (it actually tasted good, but was about as appetizing as baby food). The service was extraordinary!",Solo Leisure,5,nan

The safety talk at the beginning did not seem to be done properly (didn't seem to be enough staff to do both sides of the plane). Food was okay. Luggage was transitted no problem. In flight entertainment was dated and didnt work, old fashioned screens in economy.",Couple Leisure,3,nan
Boeing 777-300ER,First Class,5,June 2017,5,5,4,yes,Singapore to Toulouse via Paris,5," |  Singapore to Toulouse via Paris. We booked our yearly flight to France through Air France this requiring Singapore Airlines to take us on the first leg from Perth to Singapore. As we left the Singapore flight we were met at the aircraft door and taken in a motorised vehicle from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1 to board the Air France flight. We were taken to the First Class Lounge and when boarding was to take place we were again driven to the gate lounge where we were escorted to the front of the security queue. We quickly cleared security and were escorted to our seats 1E/F. The service we received on board was better than we have ever received with any other airline. The seat transformed into a wide and long full flat very comfortable bed. On reaching Paris (DG we left the plane and were guided via a secured doorway to a waiting limousine whereupon we passed through ""private"" security and immigration. We were the only people there - this process taking about 3 minutes. After being escorted to the First Class lounge where we waited we were picked up by limousine just before take-off of the Toulouse flight and driven to the waiting aircraft - again bypassing all the queues. What we appreciated more than anything else was being expertly guided through all the airports and at each stage being advised that our checked in bags had been located and were confirmed as being on the flight with us (a relief because we have previously lost bags on other airlines). We don't particularly like Airports and flying but if you have to do it, this Air France experience well exceeded our expectations - absolutely superb!",Couple Leisure,5,nan
A380,Economy Class,4,April 2017,5,4,3,yes,Newcastle to San Francisco via Paris,4," |  Newcastle to San Francisco via Paris. Really impressed. The A380 is a great aircraft and we really enjoyed our flight. The cabin was not ultra modern and maybe in need of a refresh soon but it was clean and comfortable. We loved our seats in row 93 and no one behind us so we could recline. Service was punctual we were offered an aperitif with a snack and you could have champagne, the meal service was good with plenty of food. There was snacks and soft drinks in the galley where you could help yourself. Another meal was served before landing. Entertainment was a little outdated but it served a purpose. Loved the big storage boxes on the side of our seat as we were on the upper deck. Very comfortable flight. The crew were helpful and friendly.",Couple Leisure,4,nan

Flight according to schedule, and very helpful personell while boarding as many passangers travelled with large handluggage. Overall a nice experience!",Couple Leisure,5,nan
Boeing 777-300ER,Economy Class,4,May 2017,4,4,4,yes,Paris CDG to Atlanta,3," |  Paris CDG to Atlanta in first row of Economy on aisle. This seat is a little narrower with the tray table and entertainment console stowed in armrest area. The flight crew were friendly and attentive which always makes the flight more enjoyable. The seat cushion was firm which for a longer flight requires the addition of a few layers of blankets to make bearable. I'm 6'2"" and enjoyed the extra couple inches of space this seat offered. Took advantage of the Air France Press app on phone to download some magazines and newspapers to read. The Entertainment system offered a wide selection of movies to enjoy. Champagne and Wine is included for economy customers also. I had the included meal on the way to CDG and it was good overall. Decided to try the A La Carte Traditional Meal on the CDG to ATL flight which was slightly better than regular meal served. But the chocolate soufflé was outstanding in the A la carte meal. Any advice would be for the other economy seats on this long haul flight have a seat pitch too small for most average sized passengers these days. The airlines need to understand their passengers are human and effected by psychological factors such as Proxemics when crammed in area where we feel others are invading our personal space but just reclining.",Solo Leisure,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,May 2017,1,1,2,no,Los Angeles to Amman via Paris,1," |  Los Angeles to Amman via Paris. They changed our departure flight without informing us, causing us to lose our seats that I upgraded. The plane was awful. I have never sat in such a crammed seat. The seat plus chairs that cost 75$ extra we're only mildly better, giving maybe two more inches of foot space. They told me to purchase additional checked in baggage online so I could receive a discount but the website and app both don't allow any baggage options to be purchased online-what? Then why tell me to purchase online. I opened a flying Blue card with them because I was supposed to get an additional discount on my extra checked in baggage, but I can't even use that, as you can online get that discount when you buy online - then maybe they should change their online service and allow those purchases online. I've have the worst experience​ on the phone with the customer service reps. Ive had the worst experience online with their website. I don't have issues with technology, but their app is the glitchiest I've seen. Not user friendly. Can't imagine someone like my mother or grandmother trying to use it. I will never fly with them again.",Solo Leisure,1,nan

I upgraded at check in for an additional fee after a particularly poor Premium Economy outbound experience. This couldn't have been better! The cabin and seat were so comfortable, service was of a very high standard with a lovely crew, plenty to eat and drink and all of a really high quality. Lie flat seat was amazingly comfortable, with a nice duvet and pillow and the amenity kit was stuffed with Clarins products. Lounge in Osaka was very nice, in CDG was a bit worn but was needed with a long layover.",Couple Leisure,2,nan

Staff were pleasant, always polite and efficient which did surprise me as Air France had issues with this before. Food was above average but again the quality could have been better. Good selection of drinks. Overall very satisfied but seat space is a real issue in economy. Disappointed with check in process though",Business,3,nan
Boeing 777-300 / A340,Economy Class,3,July 2017,3,4,4,yes,Tokyo to Freetown via Paris,3," | I had quite low expectations for my first trip with Air France, and wasn't really looking forward to the experience, especially for such a long trip. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Ground service in Tokyo was great, with delightful ground staff. The overnight flight from Tokyo to Paris was great; the crew were all very cheerful, polite and friendly and the service was good. The food was enjoyable, and I loved the fact that they serve a glass of Champagne as an aperitif in Economy Class. The IFE was excellent - a huge selection of art-house and independent films. Seat configuration a bit cramped with a 3-4-3 layout, but it was bearable. For my next leg, from Paris to Freetown, I got upgraded to Premium Economy and was thankful for this; the economy class on the dated A340 looked very cramped and was filthy by the end of the 6 hour flight. The plane was 1.5 hours late departing CDG. There was dinner after take-off and ice-cream before landing and the food was good. The IFE was limited and the picture quality was poor; in economy class the screens were tiny. Staff were more perfunctory than the pervious flight, but pleasant enough. I think the main thing to improve on both flights would be the service of drinks; having pre-dinner drinks would be nice, or just providing more regular drinks services throughout the flight; the drinks trolley only came through with the meals and I was not aware of any other drink services. Overall, two good flights.",Solo Leisure,4,nan

Boeing 777-200,Economy Class,1,June 2017,1,2,2,no,Paris CDG to Cancun,3," |  Flew Air France from Paris CDG - Cancun. Departure lunch time. Lunch was served with no choice offered and no announcement of the dish being served. No drink service for the whole flight. You need to self-serve for a glass of water which is outrageous on a long flight. The IFE had a very limited choice of movies. The meal being served upon landing was a breakfast, which did not correspond to the European time zone nor the Mexican one. It seems like the airline was dumping its excess breakfast served on the previous flight. Flight attendants, nowhere to be seen and barely doing their job. No trash collection during the whole flight. All in all, Air France's offering has been moving downward year after year and nothing is being done about it. Food is of poor quality and the inflight service is at an all time low. KLM is now way above Air France. A very dissapointing flight given the price paid.",Family Leisure,2,nan

We had no issues, they made this long travel time a breeze. The food was great, seats were comfortable. Moreover, when anxiety got the best of me due to an airport issue in Paris, the Air France ladies took me in and took care of me until I was able to calm down. It helped my panic attack immensely and at that point they did not even known that we were flying with them. Offered us seats and water etc. Cannot thank them enough.",Couple Leisure,5,nan
Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,5,May 2017,5,5,5,yes,Hong Kong to Kiev via Paris CDG,4," | This was my first time flying Air France long haul. Everything (absolutely everything) went above my expectations for my flight from Hong Kong to Kiev via Paris CDG. I'm a very frequent traveler, so I know what to expect, but again, they pleasantly surprised me at every stage of travel. I don't review the booking process as I booked at klm.com where everything worked fine. The small issue was when buying online a la carte meal option (didn't work in Safari browser) I had to make in Chrome. Then I had trouble with paid seat option: seat of my choice disappeared from my booking. Contacted them via Facebook and got it done in 30 minutes. Perfect! In town check in in Hong Kong worked fine. At the airport boarding was done in perfect order. On the plane, I found seating quite satisfactory despite it being 10 in row (I booked Duo set at the back). Padding was comfortable, and recline was enough to seat in relaxed position (I'm 186 cm tall). Entertainment options were amazing with lots of documentary and arthouse. Dining was fine. My a la carte order was delivered without noticing. All the crew were nice and very effective despite full flight and lots of Chinese customers who required lot of translation services. Toilets kept clean and stocked. Cabin had fresh look and didn't feel claustrophobic even with such a tight layout. Breakfast served was good. Departure and arrival on time. My bag made the connection. No problem with transfer within CDG 2E from gates L to gates K by train via fast security search. My next flight to Kiev was bang on time. European flight seating comfort is only good when you purchase exit row seat. Otherwise it is not good even in business cabin. Food was good again with full bar service. I do recommend them highly for long haul travel. For short flights I recommend allow at least 3 hrs for smooth transfer at CDG and exit row seating only.",Solo Leisure,5,nan

No food or water was offered to any passengers. No info was briefed on why the delay. The worst flight I have ever been on, unfriendly staff, leading to almost missing connecting flight in France. Managed to get connecting flight but baggage never made it. Got back to UK and told air France that I needed my baggage the next day as I was due to fly again 2 days after landing. I had a text from them saying they would only deliver baggage a day after I am due to fly. Called up to challenge delivery time and the staff member in the baggage department was the most unhelpful, rude person. All in all. I would recommend staying as far away from Air France. Still don't have my bags or an answer on when I'm getting them.",Business,1,1

This is quite a contrast with regard to business class seating which on the A320 has the same pitch as economy class with the middle seat in a row of three left unoccupied. Seating felt cramped despite the supposed 32"" seat pitch - it felt tighter than that. Seat width was fine. While being less roomy, the Air France business class in Europe does provide a much nicer food service than typically provided on flights in the United States. On United on a two hour flight I received coffee and a muffin. On American on a two hour flight I received some warm nuts and a cookie. Air France, on a one hour, twenty minute flight, provided a full meal - shrimp appetizer, mini burger, grilled vegetables, hazelnut cake, panna cotta and beverages. Quite a different experience. Service was pleasant and professional. I would have preferred a bit more space but the experience with Air France was fine.",Couple Leisure,4,nan

What I was served was rice + chick peas, rice bread, some combination of black & brown beans - no salad, vegetables cheese or meat. The stewardess on told me that I could complain to the airline company but did not offer me something else.

Only one person at the counter and no announcement is made and not even in English. The queue to board the aircraft is long too. Flight attendant is friendly. For a short haul flight went around with light snacks and beverages. Leather seat is comfortable with sufficient leg room. No USB charging port on both sectors. However, its bilingual (English and French) inflight magazine, Magazine, is thick enough to keep passengers occupied/entertained. Flight from Lyon to Florence is on an ATR-72.

On my recent flight from Paris to Rome I was offered complimentary newspaper in the terminal waiting area, a wet serviette upon boarding and a sandwich, wine and tea/coffee during the flight.

Boeing 777,First Class,5,July 2017,4,4,5,yes,Dublin to Singapore via Paris CDG,5, | Dublin to Singapore via CDG return with Air France. Great service on the business class leg from Dublin to Paris. The La Première (first class) leg from Paris CDG to Singapore was impeccable. Greeted as I left the plane in CDG and taken by limousine to the First class lounge. The hostess was very attentive and friendly. Great food and quiet place to wait for the flight. Taken by limousine again to board the first class cabin. Service on board top notch. The stewardess could anticipate what I needed and I never needed to ask for anything. Excellent seat and a curtain to give more privacy if needed. Greeted on arrival in Singapore my luggage was already waiting when I cleared immigration. Return flight equally top class. Access into the exclusive Jetquay lounge in the CIP terminal in Changi Airport. All details taken care off and able to clear immigration at this terminal before taken on a buggy to board the plane. Again service on board was perfect. Only small things need some improvement. Service on the ground in Dublin was nowhere near the La Première expérience in CDG and Changi. Lounge in Dublin quite poor. Not even greeted with eye contact when I got into the lounge in Dublin. Poor choice of food. On the return leg it took nearly an hour for my luggage to be delivered in Dublin. The jetquay lounge in Changi was impressive but the food selection not that great. In summary La Première with Air France is the best first class experience I have ever had. Air France is certainly able to deliver a truly amazing First class experience. If I wanted to be critical the only thing I can say is the menu could include local Singaporean dishes such as satay and nasi lemak. WiFi was available on the CDG to Singapore leg but not on the return flight.,Solo Leisure,4,4

It ended up with extreme frustration, missed flights, delays and huge economic inconvenience for our family. On the day of flight, there was an earlier AF flight that suffered mechanical problems and was delayed at 7:45. We should have been notified then (as they have our email from night before to issue boarding passes) but instead they had all passengers check in for a subsequent flight at 10:00 and wait for a bus to Bologna to transport both groups. The problem became compounded when the buses were delayed by an hour and made worse by the airport security who wasted 45 min sitting in front of an electronic gate that no one seemed able to operated so all buses could leave airport. While the planes to take us sat awaiting for 4 hours, the passengers went through security again before boarding a flight scheduled to leave Bologna at 12:00. Our flight from Paris to Los Angeles still could have been made but were were again delayed at Bologna for more than two hours. Ultimately we arrived in Paris 5 hours after our anticipated arrival and missed our connecting flight home. That flight was not Air France so it was not their issue to resolve. We struggled to find nearby hotel for night and an alternate flight home. We had paid tickets home on June 29th but were forced to purchase new flights home on Air Tahiti in addition to hotel lodging.",Family Leisure,1,nan

The airline got us from point A to point B but not without some trouble. The lines at Washington were very long. It took about 30 minutes to drop off our bags even though we checked in online and were at Washington nearly 3 hours before departure. The flight to Paris CDG was late and made us miss our connection to Saint Petersburg. That made us miss our train to the final point (the last one that night) and required us to purchase hotel stay and overall extended the trip by over 12 hours.

In our case, we were a party of two, and were assigned separated seats at the very end of cabin. We did not succeed in changing them, as aircraft looked full. We called Air France (extra charge for phone calls); they argued they could not either change them because flight was empty and AF concern was aircraft balance. This did not justify couple separation. Very unuseful stress, that we could avoid on a LC paying a fee. We were compelled to arrive earlier at Airport, we queued at ticket counter, and they assigned seats on row #1.",Couple Leisure,5,nan
nan,Economy Class,1,August 2017,2,2,1,no,Toronto to Frankfurt via Paris,2," |  Toronto to Frankfurt via Paris. The experience was like going back in time, the plane clearly hadn't been renovated for a long time. The seat fabric was worn, my seat pocket was torn, and for in-flight entertainment there was only one of those primitive systems that runs a dozen or so movies in a loop, each on a separate channel. In-flight service was poor, with flight attendants consistently ignoring my call button. The food was considerably below average.",Business,2,nan
A318,Economy Class,5,August 2017,2,4,nan,yes,Paris CDG to Figari ,3," |  Flew Air France from Paris CDG to Figari. A very pleasant flight indeed. 100% automatic checkin/tagging. No frills on board of course. We faced strong and long lasting turbulence and wind shear when landing, and were constantly informed by cockpit. Crew were very helpful to comfort nervous pax.",Couple Leisure,5,nan
CRJ 1000 / A319,Economy Class,3,July 2017,3,2,nan,yes,Amsterdam to Nantes,4," |  Today's trip was a one-day return without any checked-in luggage flying from Amsterdam to Nantes. This trip was booked on the Air France website, however the outbound flight from Amsterdam to Nantes was operated by HOP!, a regional subsidiary from Air France. Since HOP! offers a basic, no frills service, neither in Amsterdam nor in Nantes I could use the Skypriority facilities, even though I have Flying Blue Elite Plus status. In fact this was not a big deal, Nantes Maritime Airport is very compact with virtually no lines for security and immigration. On both flights I could book myself on the Emergency exit rows with excellent leg space at no charge. Check in was done via the Air France App which is very user friendly. Both flights were the typical Air France short haul service, in the HOP! flight it was a coffee and a cookie (and a great smile!) and on the return AF Flight the service consisted of a pre-packed sandwich and a coffee, all totally fine for a 70min. flight. On both flights, which left and arrived in time and the service was friendly and personal. The only minus this day was that upon arrival in Nantes we had to wait about 15 minutes before a bus arrived to bring us from the remote stand to the terminalbuilding.",Solo Leisure,3,nan
Boeing 777-200,Business Class,5,August 2017,5,4,4,yes,Paris CDG to Sao Paulo,4," |  Paris CDG to Sao Paulo. Checked in 1 night before and had the luggage already checked in too, a service that Air France offers from 16:30 to 20:30 h the day before the flight. Next morning went straight to X ray and to boarding gate. Boarding was a little confused, had to take a bus to where the aircraft was, bus the bus was full. But let me explain, this is a service of Airport de Paris, nothing related to Air France. Departure was 20 minutes delayed. The Boeing 777-200 aircraft configuration is two classes, no first class, 16 seats in business class.  Nice food, really nice beverages, the service is attentive but not insistent. The seat reclines 180°, nice pillow and blankets. Configuration of cabin is 2x3x2. Arrival 10 minutes late. Would definitely fly Air France again.",Solo Leisure,4,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,August 2017,nan,nan,nan,no,Manchester to Barcelona via Paris CDG,nan," |  Manchester to Barcelona via Paris CDG. We are travelling on 12th August 2017. In trying to get a 'golf buggy' organised to help transfer my visually impaired husband from an arrival to a departure is worse than pulling teeth. Air France say it is the responsibility of the airport, and the airport say it is the responsibility of Air France. We just keep getting batted from one to the other. We have one hour to make this connection - not our decision. It is the times we were given when the flights were booked. All they can offer is a wheelchair. This is the worse thing to offer to a visually impaired person. People need to understand the difficulties faced by visually impaired people. I suggest that they do some training in order to understand their needs. Why won't someone just help us out? I just hope that people don't get in the way as we try to reach our connecting flight. We experienced the same two years ago at Frankfurt Airport as the first flight arrived late and we struggled to get through customs in time for our connecting flight. Mind you the compensation they paid out came in useful! But it shouldn't be necessary if someone would just give us some basic help.",Family Leisure,1,nan
Boeing 777-300,First Class,5,July 2017,4,4,5,yes,Los Angeles to Barcelona via Paris,5," |  Los Angeles to Paris CDG in First Class, connecting to Barcelona in Business class. It lived up to expectations and the service was overall excellent. Arrived at LAX and was escorted through security which took about 3 minutes by a member of the dedicated La Premiere staff. AF uses Qantas first class lounge at LAX which was very nice though totally empty at the time departure- food selection was overall very good with great choice of spirits. I was escorted to the aircraft and onboard the service was excellent. The seat is enormous, 4 windows long with a beautiful screen fabric. There were two staff for 4 pax which mean service was very personal with the crew stating they would take excellent care of you. The food out of LAX was very good (dessert the most delicious tart I have ever tasted!) but entrees could have used a bit more imagination and breakfast was a bit weak. Service was superb and the bed was wonderful (slept 6 hours straight) with Krug champagne. On arrival at CDG was personally met and driven to first class lounge. To say the service was good here would be an understatement. The food was spectacular and on par with a Michelin star restaurant. Was then driven to connecting flight where the crew greeted me by name. Return flight was equally as good with food better out of Paris the foie gras risotto was unbelieveable. I was met on arrival and taken through border control and to my onward flight in terminal 7. Overall this was an outstanding product. Only negative I would say is that the service out of Barcelona was weak and luggage took forever in BCN. Would definitely fly them again.",Business,5,nan

We told that flight attendant about a poor cheesecake dish while she was picking up the trays, and she just showed us a surprised face.",Couple Leisure,3,nan

They are among the best European airlines in terms of service and comfort.",Business,5,nan
ERJ-190,Economy Class,4,August 2017,3,4,nan,yes,Ljubliana to Paris,2, |  It's Air France flight operated by HOP (But you can't buy it as a HOP flight). So it's not a low cost flight at rather expensive ticket price. Service was good with some snack and beverages free of charge. The leg room is tight but it's just about 2 hour flight. It arrives at Terminal G CDG airport and you have to take a free shuttle bus to the main terminal complex.,Solo Leisure,3,nan

After four days in Italy I have not received my lost baggage. I have spoken to seven different customer service representatives all of whom have either lied to me, (your baggage will arrive by tomorrow night the latest) or hung up the phone on me mid-sentence. I've requested to speak to managers and to speak to the baggage courier service. I was denied both requests. I discourage anyone from booking with Air France. The absolute worst.",Couple Leisure,1,nan
A380,Premium Economy,5,September 2017,5,5,5,yes,Brussels to Johannesburg via Paris,4," |  Brussels to Johannesburg via Paris. Last time I flew with Air France was probably 10 years ago. It's usually not in my preferred list because of reputation and pricing. It has changed since this journey! First of all, we left Brussels by train to reach Paris CDG, that was a first for me and I got two nice surprises. First of all, you check your luggage directly at the train station and it follows you until the final destination (which it did), secondly, despite our Premium Economy ticket and the fact that the train ticket were supposed to be Economy class, we got first class seats in the TGV. That was a nice start. No trouble from the station to the airport, boarding was just fine, crew members very nice and friendly, I was pretty impressed as my expectations were way lower than that. The cabin was neat, plane was clean, and  the food was probably one of the best food I ate on a plane, despite being only Premium Economy, it was better than my last Business class trip.  Then comes the time to check the entertainment system, once again, I was surprised. The usual list of movies, few games and info, pretty classic but efficient, and, the nice touch is the music selection. I found a real selection of my favourite genre, and, I mean real like latest albums, various renown artists but not mainstream. Well, I sticked to the movies anyway, but that was a nice touch, I appreciated it. The way there and return were both equally nice, Boeing 777 and Airbus A380, everything was really nice and for once, I'd recommend Air France despite my initials feelings.",Business,5,4
A319,Economy Class,5,September 2017,5,5,nan,yes,Munich to Paris CDG,3," |  Munich to Paris CDG. As I have mostly heard negative reviews about Air France, I was prepared for the worst. I was wrong. Check In in both Munich and Paris was a breeze. We were on Sky Priority which meant that we could board the plane first and our luggage was delivered first as well. The cabin was neat, very tidy and an excellent inflight magazine is available. Only downside is the seat pitch. The crew on both flights was absolutely amazing. Very professional and attentive, a warm smile and everyone spoke great english, some flight attendands also spoke german too. Another surprise was the delicious snack we received and the great variety of beverages offered. It was a flight of one hour and Air France and its crew did an outstandig job. I'm looking forward to fly with them again.",Couple Leisure,5,nan
A330,Economy Class,5,September 2017,3,1,3,no,Paris CDG to Seattle,3," |  I booked the flight 4-5 months before and I was able to confirm the seats and have my family (2 small kids, my wife and myself) together on J and H seats. No issues on the flight from Seattle to Paris. On the flight back I attempted to make the online check-in 30 hrs before the flight as recommended by Air France. The seats that I had confirmed initially when I bought the tickets were available, but now I wasn't able to book those seats without paying $59/seat. I attempted to talk with the Air France agent when we checked-in explaining that now I have the family in different places, not at least 2 seats together. The agent said from the beginning that he won't be able to help because the plane was full but pretended for 10 minutes to look and ""help"". I told him that before heading to the airport I checked the website and there are empty seats on the economy side but same issue: $59/seat. He said that now there were no empty seats and he was struggling to accommodate us somehow, but there were no empty spots. Long story short, by the time we embarked there were many empty seats including those that the booked initially.",Family Leisure,1,nan
Boeing 777-300,Business Class,1,July 2017,3,3,3,no,Paris to Santiago de Chile,2," |  Paris to Santiago de Chile. Air France old Business Class is a joke. A 7-across cabin (2-3-2) is the worst : this means you either climb over another passenger to access the aisle or someone else does it to you. The seat is ridiculously narrow and does not recline to a fully-horizontal position, which means that during the flight you slowly slide towards the lower side of the seat, being unable to sleep properly (especially in a 15 hours flight like CGD-SCL). The pitch is reduced as AF uses all the space available and - when flat - a good portion of your legs goes below the seat in front of you, reducing your chances to move. Food nothing special - which is a shame given France's tradition of good food, wine good and champagne really good. IFE not bad but with a reduced selection of international movies and a gigantic amount of French movies; amenities kit normal (although the look and feel of it is a bit cheap). And then we have to talk about the crew: after the first interactions with FAs it was clear that I did not speak French, well all FAs kept referring to me in French and changed to English only when I - again and again - advised them that I did not. This is something that has always happened in AF and I really fail to understand why, looks rude and actually is a rude attitude. I have been told the new business class is a long way ahead of the old, my advice is to avoid at all costs the old one (easily detectable in the aircraft map with a 2-3-2 configuration).",Business,2,nan
A380,Premium Economy,5,August 2017,5,1,5,no,Paris to New York,3," |  The flight was delayed due to some issue with the luggage. All in all the flight was very good. It's when we arrived in New York to find out that our luggage was not on the plane. We found out after waiting for about 30 min watching the conveyor go round and round. Then we find out that there is a Air France person with a list of people whose luggage was not on the plane. First of all if they knew this, why didn't they call us out instead of making us wait. They tell us it is still in Paris and it will be on the next flight and delivered to our house the next day.  After several calls and agents that don't seem to know what is going on, all they could say is Sorry for this convenience. 2 days later we find the luggage was routed to Atlanta, then Albany NY. This is the 3rd day and still waiting to hear when it will be delivered. Air France failed big time with the handling and the communication with our luggage. ",Couple Leisure,2,nan

Outbound flight on-time, in Embraer 170 operated by subsidiary HOP. Comfortable seat with enough legroom, I like the 2x2 configuration. Usual offer of croissant and hot drinks. Inbound trip in a CityJet Avro RJ85. On the ground cabin incredibly hot and stuffy, fortunately it improved once in the air. Uncomfortable seat due to cramped legroom and minimal seat width. CityJet has a 3x3 configuration versus 2x3 on most airlines. Soft drinks and a tasty wrap were served. Cabin crew efficient and friendly, flight on-time. I like travelling through CDG Terminal 2G, as walking distance is minimal and luggage delivery very quick.",Solo Leisure,4,nan
