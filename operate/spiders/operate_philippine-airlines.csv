The flight crew from AKL to MNL were friendly, introduced themselves, knew our names, and was on top of service. There wasn't a lot of us in the section so it was pretty quiet. The food was good too. The domestic leg's food wasn't commendable. The fish looked dry and old but service was still great. The return flight to AKL was less noteworthy. Being in business class means faster boarding but the girl at the gate seemed confuse. Economy was quicker. Business class this time had more people and the crew wasn't as warm. Had a bit of the tired attitude. They didn't personally introduce themselves nor as warm, and service was average. The A330 triclass is great though. Plane left on time and it was mostly a smooth ride. I've recommended PAL to my partner for our next trip to MNL.",Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0

PAL has an annual 50% off sale for miles redemption and i was lucky enough to secure enough points prior to the sale. The drawback is that I needed to go to a PAL ticketing office just to process the ticket which is a little bit inconvenient. However, the service that I had experienced on board is really amazing and that compensates to the drawbacks. PAL flies from NAIA Terminal 2. The airport is a little bit congested, very few shops are available and there is nothing to do in the airport while waiting. The Mabuhay Miles Lounge offers a very limited variety of food and drinks. The check-in experience is fast as there was a counter which was intended for all business class passengers. The queue on the immigration on the other hand is a little bit chaotic as there were only few immigration officers intended for a lot of passengers. There was no priority lane intended for business class as well. PAL's new business class utilized Vantage XL seats which are very spacious and comfortable. it has a direct aisle access and can be converted into a full flat bed. The seat was amazing but not so private. The meals were great, so were the champagne and the wines. FAs were caring and sensitive to needs of passengers.",Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0

I was left disappointed mainly with the food offering on this short regional flight (2.5 hours). The meal looked more akin to budget airline food. There was no salad, no bread, just chicken patty with some vegetables and potatoes (or rice, I don't recall). Service was great, however, in fairness to the flight attendants serving on this flight. They greeted passengers warmly with a big smile on their faces. That is probably the thing that was 4-star on this flight. The IFE using their PAL in-air flight app worked well. Good that I was able to download the app prior to flight departure. They should announce this well ahead of time (perhaps at check-in) otherwise, passengers wouldn't be able to access the app during the flight. Legroom on this A321 is rather limited on the 3x3 configuration). I noticed that there is a Premium Economy also with a 3x3 configuration.

Seat was an old style recliner seat with a pitch comparable to economy class of other carriers. Seat reclines for about 2 inches and does not have any leg rest making it the most uncomfortable during a 7.5-hour journey. Entertainment is very poor no noise cancellation headphones and no amenity kits were given despite being advertised in the website. Service was attentive but food was very standard.

Was a newer Boeing 777-300ER with a fair bit of room. (Pro tip: Sit on one of the sides not the middle section.) The warm cloths towards the end of the trip are a nice touch as I usually only get those when I fly in Business Class. Only complaint was not enforcing carry-on restrictions which can get out of hand. Ample baggage allowances. Terminal 2 is better than Terminal 1 but not as good as Terminal 3 IMHO but it's good enough and certainly not the fault of the airline. Immigration and Baggage was probably about an hour but again not the fault of the airline.

Not one had any vegetarian food. Then we boarded our flight. The business class stewardess asked us for meal choices and when we said we had requested vegan meals she looked surprised. The Catering manager and his assistant came on board to speak to us to tell us to take the next day flight and the airline would have a meal for us.

Purser explains PAL is not allowed to restock anywhere other than at home base in Manila. Since Feb 1st they are allowed to load only 2 bottles for Business class for 2 sectors. This A340 had 24 Business class seats 13pax. Outbound had 19 pax and all Champagne was consumed. Purser visibly frustrated by this policy but powerless. Same policy applies even to long-haul flights. Equally Economy is now limited to 120 cans of beer. Running out of Premium Class service items even before departure is ridiculous. This is regrettable because food was good and portions adequate and PAL Cabins Staff in Business is very friendly courteous and attentive.

I did a web check in with no frills. When I got to the airport (LHR T4) the longest queue of passengers waiting to check in got my attention: all PAL passengers on the same flight I was about to be in. Luckily I checked in online so I did not have to wait for hours. PAL does not have its own ground staff hence was outsourced with DNATA which Emirates owns. When I got onboard very friendly FAs assisted me and changed my mood. Service really is great may be the same as Singapore Airlines' service. Food is average had 3 services all throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment is good though as not extensive as Emirates' ICE. No complimentary toiletries in flight unlike Asiana. Seats are wider and comfortable unlike seats on Singapore Air's A380s. On my way back to London I am impressed with the service at Centennial Terminal that PAL exclusively uses compared to Terminal 1 which is stressful. The flight was the longest flight i have ever been into - 15 hours. The service was great. In total PAL LHR flight is good value for money and will fly again with them.

I eventually left the Bacolod departure lounge and spoke to the very charming apologetic and unimpressive station manager to suggest they at least update the flight departure time with their best estimate and employ someone who spoke clearly on the communication system. Again in common with my recent experience the international flights were punctual. Along with many other passengers we were so cold on the flights we asked for blankets - on both flights they ran out!!

The seats were angled downwards so you are continuously sliding down your seat. Very uncomfortable to sleep. Seats are very close together (old airplane) so if you are seated next to a stranger be prepared to climb over someone or have them climb over you. Food options ran out (and we were seated in the front section) so we could not get the food we wanted. The inflight entertainment was outdated no new movies! Also one of our screens (we were a family of 4 traveling) was not working. 3 out of our 4 reading lights were not working. The business class lounge of Philippine Airlines is a joke. Not a lot of food options and insufficient quantities. The lounge in San Francisco looks worse than an outdated dentist office and the hot food was placed out on the counter (no cover at all). Of course it was cold within minutes. Anything that ran out was just that: finished. Nothing was replenished. So once people got that the food ran out even faster. Same for the few cans of juice in the fridge. But the worst part really was the business class cabin. It is like going back in time 20 years. The arm rest of my seat was completely ripped. On the way from Manila to SFO they did not have the business class packs (with the socks etc) so we received the economy class bags. Not a good look at all! On both trips the food ran out according to the staff they simply do not get enough to stock their kitchens with. For breakfast it was oriental fare only - no Western choices at all. The staff are continuously apologizing and they seem genuinely uncomfortable. The reading lights for instance were reported by them countless times. And then nothing happens.

On arrival to Vancouver my wife and I were moved to business class for the remainder of the trip to Manila free of charge. All in all a really good travel experience. My one complaint if I could think of any would be the food although that would be very nit picking of me. I'm not a big fan of Filipino foods though the ones they served I'm sure were prepared well. My wife enjoyed what they served as well as I'm sure 99% of the other people on board. My opinion on food should not be important here perhaps because most who fly this airline will love the food.

First the flights were rescheduled to nearly 4 hours earlier than originally planned and we were not notified no email no call nothing. I only found out because I checked the airport flight times to see what gate we would have to board from. My boyfriend and I were both travelling on connecting flights which meant we would not make our new flight times. We had to rearrange our connecting flights and fork out a lot of money to change these. Secondly online states that everyone will have ipads to watch TV/movies on. No this was not the case either. There were 3 TV's in our section of they plane and I'm not talking out 3 TV's per row I'm talking about 3 TV's for the entire section. Also these TV's were not made in the 2000's they were at least 20+ years old. I felt like I was watching a video rather than a DVD or anything of quality.

I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience.

Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade. Philippine Airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business.

Staff were good no complaints. I was a bit wary before I travelled as I had read some poor reviews of the PAL flight from London and I had always used Emirates / Cathay / Singapore / Thai before.

Most often I fly Tokyo - Manila and Manila - General Santos City but have also flown on PAL from Manila - London and Manila - Bali. Sometimes I fly Economy and sometimes Business. Yesterday (October 12) I flew Business in PR432 Manila - Tokyo NRT. The plane is an A330-300 with 3-3-3 seating in Economy and Premium Economy and 2-2-2 seating in Business. The IFE is wireless and video choices are very limited (Ice Age and Avatar). You would not want to be in either Economy or Premium Economy if the flight was full. The seats are very narrow and if you are of average body width you will be pressing shoulders hard with the person sitting next to you. Business Class uses PAL's new herringbone seating which is the worst Business Class seating I have experienced in recent times. The seats are narrow the herringbone layout means you are angled towards the person next to you and so is he/she angled towards you. You will not want to work on anything confidential because he/she can easily read your notebook screen. The layout would be great for romantic couples who want to be close to each during the flight but for business-people? The flight attendants do an excellent job and both food and wine are very good but 2-2-2 seating in a modern A340 is unacceptable compared to the 1-2-1 many airlines use in A330s and A340s. PAL used to fly 777s on the Manila - Tokyo route and that was a very enjoyable experience both in Business and in Economy which again indicates that PAL's fleet modernization has everything to do with reducing fuel costs but nothing to do with passenger comfort. I am dreading being in a PAL A340 to London next month.,nan,2.0,nan

Staff explained the issue and possible solution airport utilized was the new T3 terminal and it was well marked. Boarding was a breeze though we were bussed to the aircraft- boarding was organized. The aircraft itself was small the seats were a 2-2 configuration but very comfortable and had wide legroom take off was slightly delayed due to congestion but it was smooth. Snacks served were adequate for an hours flight minimal cockpit info and the attendants were efficient landing was a but bumpy due to slightly windy weather. Bags were out in less than 10 minutes.

Food is dreadful - poor quality tasteless lack of variety and on my flights to BKK SGN and BKK over the past 3 months they always run out of food choices.

Employees were prompt to try to expedite my connection. However the flight was so delayed that I missed my connection and was forced to spend a night in Manila. The employees were able to arrange a hotel within an hour and to put me on a flight very early the next morning. However the hotel they arranged (Palm Plaza) was located approximately 1 hour away from the airport! Why would they choose this hotel when there are multiple hotels right across the street from the airport. Other points of note. When I arrived in Manila they forgot to put the connecting passengers checked-in baggage on the baggage claim which significantly delayed us.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,3.0,MNL-KIX-MNL. I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first trip on them and I would fly them again. For starters my ticket was very inexpensive so that is always a plus. It was actually less expensive on Philippine Air than some of the other local budget carries and I got to check a bag for free. Departed Manila on time and arrived in Osaka about 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Meal was Japanese Curry Beef which was tasty and the mango jelly that came with it was delicious. The one disappointing thing is only one drink service but they did give me the entire can of soda so can't complain about that. During my stay in Osaka I got the news of typhoon heading towards the Philippines so I decided to change the ticket last minute to get back earlier and the change fee was only 100 USD which in this day and age is amazing. There was also no increase in fare. The crew on the flight home did a really commendable job as the circumstances they were dealing with could have been trying. I have never been on a flight where the seat belt sign was on almost the entire time it was 4 hours of bumps turbulence and grabbing the seat handles but the crew despite being interrupted 3 times and having to return to their seats were able to complete their meal service clean up and duty free. I had the pork dish which wasn't bad and the fruit platter was refreshing and quite good. I am a big fan of their inflight entertainment concept - they don't have the usual movie screens (at least not on the A330) but instead you can stream from their library right into your tablet laptop or MAC however their library left a lot to be desired. I really think their system is the new way to go but they need to improve the selection of films. They also offer in flight WiFi but I did not use. I'm not sure what their selection is like on their long haul flights but they could upgrade to some more modern movies on the short international routes. They're not the best airline in Asia I've flown but they're not that far behind either. The food was good service good and planes clean. The inflight entertainment concept is cool but needs improvement. I would definitely fly them again.,nan,5.0,nan

Since I pack my iPad with movies it really wasn't an issue for me. Seats were a bit cramped. FAs were friendly and helpful especially in trying to sort out the streaming issue. Food was good considering. Delayed out of the gate because of an interlock issue with the doors but arrived BKK on time. Inbound MNL in J class. Same if not friendlier service from FAs. Seat was a recliner with a personal video screen with an OK selection of entertainment options. Food was pretty good and the drinks were always refilled. Haagen Dazs ice cream for dessert was a nice touch. While I loathe taking domestic PAL flights they more than make up for it in their international ones.

Prior to leaving on our holiday we had our flight rescheduled 3 times. The final two times were not confirmed with us until after we contacted the airline staff several times asking for a confirmation email 1 day before departure. The final flight scheduled meant we left 1 day earlier and had to spend a night in a hotel in Manila not ideal. Our return journey had our flight from Tagbilaran to Manila cancelled after the departure time of 4.40pm (while we were sitting at the gate) because another airline had not yet taken off from the runway so the PAL flight we were meant to get didn't land and returned to Manila. Philippine airlines considers this ""Force Meajure"" (an act of god) and takes no responsibility informs it's customers the next flight would be at 7.05am the next day and that they would not pay for accommodation until then. We found cheap accommodation nearby for the night returned for our 7.05 am flight the next day which was delayed and departed at 7.30. We arrived in Manila and were expecting to be put on another flight (the original connection was missed because PAL failed to arrange for a flight to pick us up from Tagbilaran in time). Instead we were put on standby for a flight that morning that was overbooked then in the afternoon that was overbooked. All flights were full and no seats were available to myself and my partner. PAL staff continued to claim due to the ""act of god"" (not their poor quality service) they weren't responsible for paying for us to be transferred to another airline. The next non fully booked flight with PAL was not for 2 days and they also would not pay for accommodation or often compensation. Ultimately we took a taxi to another terminal (a much nicer terminal) and bought new tickets with Cebu-Pacific who were very helpful and got us home on time. Never fly Philippine Airlines.

The flying experience is a great improvement the check-in counter and flight crew were professional. My only suggestion for PAL is to make seats more comfortable and to place personal built-in IFE on every seats at least on international flights if they want to compete with other international carriers. The iPad IFE doesn't look like a good idea especially at long haul ergonomically. Traditional seat-installed IFE is still the best way to go.

On the flight (late) my seat was broken and would not recline I was moved to another seat but the media unit didn't work so they gave me a Ipad. The seat headrest abutted the toilet and the constant flushing made sleep almost impossible. We were very glad to get to our hotel in Manila and get some sleep.

The aircraft does not have IFE built in on their seats they provide ipad mini's though but they have a very poor choice of entertainment system. The upholstery is totally worn out stained and the aircraft itself looks so dirty. PAL should do something about these problems as it is a shame to flying customers especially foreigners who wants to visit the Philippines.

I asked instead for two extra pillows to cushion my back since the seat was faulty (plane pillows are incredibly small so I asked for two extras) - no extra pillows.

(1) A321 Flights MNL-SIN- MNL: I usually go for the ""Choice Seats"" for these flights which cover two or three rows right behind Business Class. This section is lumped together with Business Class so you get extra privacy and are on the ""front"" of the cabin. This also means you get to share the lavatories in the Business Class section so no crowding whatsoever. No IFE in Regular Economy but if you stay in the Choice Seats section the FAs offer an iPad Mini provided there are spare units (it's standard issue to Business flyers) IFE is up to date and had nice choices of Hollywood films and TV shows; Food is fantastic usually the main reason I like flying PAL. (2) A340 Flights MNL-HNL-MNL: Economy seats are pretty standard these are the Iberia planes under lease so you even notice the markings/labels in Spanish. No AVOD which is a pity for an 11 hour flight; Food again is fantastic and service is quite nice. I flew Business on the HNL-MNL leg and seats were pretty good not a full recline but almost and it had a massage function which was excellent. AVOD was available but they also offered iPads - IFE content on the iPads were far better FA service was excellent the food tasted lovely and was a mix of Japanese/Filipino/Western options. Lounge access in HNL was via Delta SkyLounge - this was so-so. (3) A320 Flights SIN-MNL-SINL: this one's pretty standard; No AVOD but the IFE was tolerable with common monitors/screens IFE content was also fine and they played one full-length movie followed by two 20-minute TV shows; food again is pretty good and usually involves Chicken Fish or Beef; some A320 planes have a similar setup with the A321 for Choice Seats where they are located within the front section of the plane and separated from the rest of the Economy Class service is pretty good as well.

Yes the A340 is somewhat on the old side yes it is a bit worn in places but the seat was comfortable there was ample legroom it turned into a flat bed there was power and whilst I have had better inflight entertainment on other airlines there was enough choice and it was AVOD. But where PAL really excelled was in three areas. 1) Value for money 2) Inflight service 3) Meals. All in my opinion were better than you receive in Club World. At LHR you have access to the Etihad lounge we left on time PAL now flies over Russia and China so we arrived in MNL in 12.15 hours rather than the previous 14. On the return leg we left on time and with a journey time of 14 hours. Nothing was too much trouble for the crew. Would I fly with PAL again? Absolutely. Any grumbles?

Three TV screens for the cabin no power outlets old interior. The engine broke when we were on the runway they jiggled the cables and rebooted the computers for 5 hours and then decided that the engine really was broken and let us off the plane. They started taking people to hotels and not re-routing / ticketing to other airlines.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,I traveled from GUM-MNL stayed one night in MNL then traveled domestically from MNL-DVO then later a return flight from DVO-MNL. The flight experience was so-so no different from any other airline (and I've had my fair share of airlines). The plane was clean enough for its age. Space was adequate (I'm short though 5'2). My only pet peeve is the hidden charges and policies when it comes to excess baggage. Even if you pre-purchase excess baggage they find a way to charge you a bit for the extra weight. For example I bought two extra 30 kg (total 60 kg) excess baggage for MNL-DVO flight since I was in my home base of Guam. When I got to the check-in counter in MNL going to DVO they honored the first 30 kg pre-paid excess but not the second 30 kg excess. Why? Because apparently as per the PAL staff checking me in only one pre-paid excess baggage per person allowed. So why did the PAL in my home base allow me to purchase two prepaid excess baggage while PAL in MNL would not honor this purchase? I ended up paying for the excess baggage and no refunds for the 2ND prepaid baggage. The same happened for DVO-MNL. Got charged $100+ even though I had my prepaid baggage. This airline is very inconsistent. Their main goal really is to make money. You can see it from the start. They don't care about their guests. I recommend using local airlines instead of PAL if travelling domestically. I recommend using any other available airline but PAL if travelling internationally or domestically. The charges aren't as harsh for pretty much the same flight experience.,nan,1.0,nan

They even arranged a vegetarian meal for me at the last minute. I always think the test for a company is when things go wrong and Philippine Air passed this test with flying colours.

Also, the decision to give passengers iPad minis in lieu of seat back TV screens is a step backward in my opinion. I would prefer to have my hands free while relaxing on a flight.  The inflight entertainment selections were also limited. I didn't think I got my money's worth on these seats, other airlines offer better seats at comparable prices.

Since Philippine Airlines never answers the telephone in Thailand and rarely answers it in the Philippines it is not something simple to do. The flight check in is done by airport staff not Philippine Airline staff but this was smooth and trouble free.

The agent was friendly and soon gave us our boarding passes with the Economy Class name crossed out and Business Class written by hand - nice. Flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft - not an unusual occurrence with Royal Nepal - most people are just thankful the flight's not cancelled. Flight departed an hour and a half late though we arrived just 20 minutes past our scheduled arrival time. On board there were 2 FA for the 9 people sitting up front (including 2 relief pilots). Meals were fine and service was friendly. No inflight entertainment - only international news magazines and newspapers were available. FAs came around frequently to check if everything was ok. Overall an ok experience - the staff usually try their best but are let down by shoddy management ageing planes and poor infrastructure at the airport.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Granted this airlines has lot of problems I disagree with the comment that airline crew speak little to no English. Their English is quite good actually. In fact better than lot of airlines in South East Asia.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I would agree with everyone in terms of Royal Nepal Airlines and its timings and delays. However those are not the only problems this airline faces. It has only two aircrafts (the 757-200 and the 757-200C) which have no form of entertainment onboard the cabin crew only speak Nepali Hindi and very little or no English. And they know no other language which is quite important considering most tourists are from Japan and France who will definitely have a lot to complain about. Being Nepali I have had to fly this airline thrice and all the flights turned out to be as bad as the last one. The airline personnel in Delhi for RNAC is the worst I've ever come across as well. All these problems are probably due to corruption.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Royal Nepal Airlines - you cannot depend upon its timing and the airline should take care of time.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I think Royal Nepal Airlines is one of the most unreliable airlines in the South Asian region in terms of timing. I have had to travel on Royal Nepal (not out of choice!) on Kathmandu-Delhi sector a number of times and it is never on time. The delays are of the order of six to eight hours for a flight of one and a half hours.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I have flown both Royal Nepal and Thai Airways on the route between Bangkok and Kathmandu and I prefer Thai. Royal Nepal is very inefficient in making any changes to your itinerary (going to their office is in fact dealing with a government bureaucracy and it feels like it) and they are chaotic in the airport. Thai is more organized and easier to deal with -- up to major airlines' standards. Royal Nepal was just fine once in the air but the plane was a little older than I would have liked.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,The airline from a small kingdom in the Himalayas - I had a really good impression on the short flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. Although there is no entertainment system at all apart from its inflight magazine the crews were very friendly and attentive. The food was gorgeous! In just one hour flight full meal was served including 2 choices in econ which include hot meal bread cheese dessert salad coffee....and it was very delicious. Frankly I think that Royal Nepal Airlines meal is the best inflight meal - it's catered from the Crown Plaza Hotel. Drinks were served regularly and seats were not bad. I would give RNA at least 4 star for its excellent service.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,TPE-LAX via MNL in business. All flights on time cabin clean food good and staff professional. Bathrooms kept clean. Only letdowns were the inflight entertainment system and the lounge in Manila (it looks more like a dormitory lounge than what should be the airline's flagship lounge). Very good value for money.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Philippines Airlines Business Class - there is space which you'd expect but the cabin was horrible and in my return Manila-Honolulu flight I changed seats 4 times to find a seat that worked correctly or a TV screen that would hold itself up. The plane was very old and to be honest a bit scary. I hope they maintain the engines better than they do the cabin. I fly business class on flights over 7 hours and this was the worst experience I have ever had. This airline is brutal with excess luggage - even 1Kg is charged (on this sector) US$150 -this is what they tried to charge me for my surfboard coming back from Honolulu. The confusing part for me is they didn't charge me to go over with it so I was shocked when they tried to charge me at Honolulu. I talked my way out of it and I could see the person had heard it all before as she tired of saying the same thing.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,MNL-Kalibo-MNL and MNL-HKG. Domestic service usual PAL service. Noticed that some ground staff and cabin crew members tend to be friendlier to Caucasian travellers than Pinoy people. Check- in quick and baggage delivery on both legs alright. MNL-HKG: PAL has cut on the meal as no longer any bread on the tray. Service efficient in the PAL manner. One thing PAL has to address is their ground staff. They make you feel they do you a favour by checking you in. Although travelling on two tickets (party of 3 people) as I only needed a one way ticket we checked in together. She managed to sit us apart. We had to return to the check in counter to get seats assigned next to each other. All in all a 3 star airline that could be more if they would take more attention to details. An upgrade of NAIA2 facilities would do well as well i.e. domestic terminal flights are allocated to check in counters in a way no one understands and they are written down on a paper printout. Noticed that number of FAs onboard international flights is very high though one does not notice it service wise.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,LAX-MNL/MNL-LAX. Philippine Airlines new Business Class product which I was quite pleased with. The cabin was clean modern and fully staffed. They have the new angled lie flat seats which are quite nice. Entertainment system pretty good. The dinner service was excellent. The only glitch is the wine list - only two choices. The service in general was warm friendly and sincere. The over all in flight product is good and a great value for your money. However reservations and check in can be touched up a bit.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,YVR-SIN-YVR in Business Class. Older A340's non stop Vancouver- Manila and new A320's on the Manila - Singapore. A340 is showing its age and business class seating is old style (their 747's have been refurbished to the new biz style but not the A340) the service on board was attentive and professional. The food was very good and well presented. A few drink runs would have been appreciated without having to press the call button. Very good lounges (shared) were provided in both Vancouver and Singapore while the Philippine Airlines Mabuhay Lounge in Manila was available during the transit stop. The Manila lounge does let the product down as it is nowhere as nice as the others. Service and food on the regional flight between Manila and Singapore was as good as long haul. Luggage both ways was handled in priority manner. Overall a very satisfactory product especially for the price PAL charge for their business when compared to some alternatives.,nan,4.0,nan

B757 is pretty old but clean inside. The staff provided a good service with a hot meal and passengers are provided with the Thai immigration papers. The inflight entertainment is outside the window as you see lots of the Himalayas for the first 40 mins after departure.,nan,nan,nan

Very friendly and serviceminded cabin staff in traditional local dresses. Good language skills and plenty of information from the captain and FA. Good local food. Arrival on time despite delay from BKK. No baggage problems and high level of service in KTM intl airport. An overall positive experience in spite of lack of IFE. I would definitely choose Royal Nepal Airlines again and have recommended others to fly them.,nan,nan,nan

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I am a Nepalese and well used to the awful standards of Nepal Airlines formerly Royal Nepal Airlines. If you are thinking of flying by Nepal Airlines don't ! Pay the extra and find another carrier. They have been operating their international services with two ancient Boeing 757s and both were grounded in early May resulting in the cancellation of all their international flights. These long delays and cancellations have happened to me several times in the past and I now pay the extra money and fly by Thai Airways on the same route. If you are lucky enough to take off the meals and wines are good and the crews are efficient enough and do speak English regardless of any previous comments on this site. I want to be proud of my national carrier but at the moment it is a complete shambles and I advise everybody not to fly on this airline.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I had the misfortune of making a booking on Royal Nepal Airlines from Kathmandu to Delhi. Little did I know that this was the worst airline I had ever encountered. I had a connecting flight at Delhi. On the morning of my departure I arrived at the airport only to discover that the flight had been cancelled. I was told to return to Kathmandu as the offices opened at 10am. Only after we myself and a few other passengers refused to go away did the ground staff make a plan to get us on an alternative flight with Sahara Airlines. On arriving at Delhi there was absolutely no Royal Nepal Airlines staff to meet us to try and arrange alternative flights or even provide support in any way. It cost me about $700 to make alternative arrangements as I had missed my connecting flight. Never use Royal Nepal Airlines they are absolutely useless.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,BKK-MNL. Flight crew was lacking. Whilst some were making an effort one was completely unprofessional and was rude.

nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Business Class from Manila to Cebu and back. Philippine Airlines utilizes its A330 for the Cebu route making the flight quick and relaxing. Disappointing were the meals in-flight - not as good as it used to be. Good thing they serve their trusty old Arroz Caldo in all their Mabuhay lounges. A well stocked bar free WiFi and reading materials made the wait at these lounges pleasant. Flight attendants remain young for the domestic routes and service was still friendly. PTV's in the A330 need to be replaced as they were all not functioning properly and did not have enough channels to choose from. Lavatories were clean. Arriving at both airports was smooth and Mabuhay Class passengers get their luggage before everyone else.,nan,4.0,nan

Older FA was rude but younger ones were polite. They seem to be in a rush serving dinne as soon as take off. An hour after dinner I needed water but no FA in sight - waited for 10 mins then pressed call button. FA didn't come until 15 mins later and was rude - seems like I bothered them. An hour later I walked down the aisle to the business class area and took a peak. There was no passenger in there all I saw was FAs sitting and some were sleeping. Now the lack of service started to make sense.,nan,1.0,nan

The announcements are simple and not detailed compared to the other local airlines. MNL-NRT by Philippine airlines and that was another a worst experience.

On the ground check-in staff are strict on weight - expect to pay if you have in excess of 15kg hold baggage for domestic flights. Also have local currency to pay the 200 peso departure tax at all airports. Overall the flight experience compared very favourably with domestic and regional flying in UK and Europe.,nan,4.0,nan

From MNL check-in was quick and easy until we get to the waiting area of Terminal 2 which was packed with people early in the morning which was understandable considering it was peak season. We were delayed about 20-30 mins. On boarding the A330-300 the seat was fairly comfortable although I think the legroom was a little small. The cabin crew were alright the cabin temperature good enough. On the return check- in was quick and easy delayed again for 30 mins. Before boarding one of PAL's newest B777-300ER the cabin ambience was good and everything felt good the seats were new and comfortable legroom roomy good IFE system this plane is more comfortable than the older A330. Cabin crew were nice and accommodating the second flight was the real value for our money.,nan,1.0,nan

In the past 3 months I have flown twice a month on PAL and over 70% of the time they are late. It's only when you're checked in and sitting in the lounge that the inevitable delays are announced.

Food is good but for a westerner would like to see more choices other than traditional plates. Even special meals are geared toward Asian cultures. Went to PAL office in Manilla to complain about being sold a ticket under false advertisement when website shows updated planes. Staff called me after visit to office to tell me the plane on the return would be an updated plane. On the return the seats were electric lie flats great pillows and blankets and the same FA's were on both legs.

The flight left LAX late and arrived HNL late but the delay was made up for on the HNL-MNL leg. Boarding was the usual LAX chaos. The mabuhay (business) class seating on the LAX-MNL 744 flight was the airline's new seat which is a sloped 170 degree recliner. The seat was a bit firm due to the newness but comfortable and I was able to get a bit of sleep. The IFE was on par with Delta and United i.e. nothing special. The food was very mediocre but the cabin service was outstanding. The MNL-SIN leg was operated by a 320 with standard short haul business class product. The seats were adequate for a 3.5 hr flight. The food was marginally better than the LAX-MNL leg but cabin service was again outstanding. Overall PR offers very good value considering that their business class fares were significantly cheaper than the competition on the LAX-SIN route.,nan,4.0,nan

SIN to MNL on A320 - 5 hours no personal IFE (only drop-down overhead LCD TV) only breads and drinks were available FA's were hiding for majority of the time. Seat was okay nothing special about this flight. MNL to LAX: it was the old un-refurbished 747-400. Ground staff were helpful but the security check line took forever. Even though I had to wait for about 10 hrs in the airport they only gave us two food vouchers. In the 744 no personal IFE they only put the map on the big LCD projector seat was okay meal was not attractive but it was delicious however they served it a bit late.

Flight was supposed to be non-stop but stopped in Hawaii for over 1 hour to off load and receive passengers. Checked my ticket and printed itinerary it all said non-stop. Good thing for me I had no connecting flight I had to meet in limited time. On the return reserved window seat that reclined however seems they changed the plane from a 747-400 to something that looked like it could only hop from island to island. I had 2 choices and chose the lesser of two evils that still required me to get out of my seat no less than 12 times to allow people to go to and from the rest room and visit friends.

Crew would pass on blankets headphones and even meal boxes on top of people's heads and sometimes a row away from the recipient. Food is awful and is not served in paper boxes. Coffee is now served in styrofoam which is environmentally unfriendly. PAL has downgraded its meal service.

Although there was enough leg room the space is still so limited that you cannot go to the washroom without disturbing other passengers. My return flight to Cotabato was a little bit better.

Boarding this non-AVOD A330 (filthy inside and out) and departing 30 minutes behind schedule. No blankets or pillows offered. No service except for some peanuts/crackers and coffee/tea/water. Safety video not played and a live manual demo was done. Overhead screens not functioning not even the airshow. Inflight magazine missing from all Economy Class seats. Seats fairly comfortable legroom much better than Cebu Pacific but lesser than Korean Air. Carpets and footrest are filthy. Cebu airport is in a bad state though check-in was not a hassle. Return flight on A330 equipment change from a 747.

Commendation however should be given to the in-flight crew who did a superb job with their pleasant service attitude. Food was ample and delicious but where it lacked was in presentation. Midnight snacks offered after dinner which helped quell my hunger due to the long flight (flight skipped the Guam technical stop and so it became a long 14 hour non-stop flight LAX-MNL). Since I flew on a similar aircraft MNL-LAX 19 days earlier I was disappointed however that the legroom on this 747-400 was shorter than the aircraft I flew on earlier.

It had been held an entire hour waiting for those last 9 passengers - with all other passengers on board and apparently no AC. Plane felt like a sauna when we boarded. From here it all goes down hill. This was the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. Very little legroom and the seats were unusually narrow so no elbow room.

The 777 is not as new as I expected but much better than the tired old 340s. Seats are a bit complicated to figure out with all the controls. Pitch is excellent with lots of room and I had nobody beside me on both legs. This was good as there are no seat pockets to store books or any items. The 777 is better configured and has a nice AVOD system although the choices were somewhat limited in music and TV shows. On the return leg the system crashed at the half way point and never came back on. The 777 is about one hour faster than the 340 and makes the trip a bit faster which is a bonus. Food was okay and service very good and attentive. My last 340 flight last year the cabin crew disappeared after dinner service but on this flight they were always around.

Fortunately flight was fairly empty and an early morning flight and check in meant that the airport was not as crowded as usual. Painless going through check in with a full compliment of baggage from the family (wife and 3 kids). Immigration and security was a breeze. Because of the few number of passengers on this 6am flight boarding was easy. In fact the plane was fully loaded a good 20 mins before scheduled push back from the terminal. The good part of the flight ended there. I knew beforehand that there was no personal entertainment on PAL's A330 so I loaded the kids' gadgets with entertainment to keep them occupied for the 3 plus hour flight (an eternity in kids' clocks). What ruined the flight for me was the FAs attitudes of just going through the motions of completing the cabin service. It was rushed and no effort was made to accommodate passengers' requests. My wife's aisle cart ran out of the beef option but mine was stocked with it. When she requested for the beef she was merely told they ran out. I had to point out to the FA in her aisle to get the selection from the other cart. The food was pretty tasty for airline food though. Twice requested for coffee and it never came. No after meal drink run and the FAs were just in the galley chatting away. I recall the time when the saving grace of Philippine Airlines was the friendly and efficient service of the staff. Now they seem to even be losing that. I never thought I'd live long enough to see the day when I had better service from American FAs (was on Delta a few months ago) than from Philippine Airlines' FAs.,nan,3.0,nan

The Mabuhay Lounge at SFO offered a superb light dinner. Business class was only half full. I had no one sitting next to me. Flight attendants addressed me formally by name and went out of their way to provide my requested food and beverages. Although the seat did not fully recline the seat plus the superb leg rest gave me enough room to curl up and sleep well. On the return which I had to make ahead of my schedule for personal reasons there was only one Mabuhay class seat available on the main deck of the 747 and the check-in agent obtained permission from the supervisor to assign it to me. The food in the Manila Mabuhay Lounge was superb-enough variety for a delicious complete dinner. My seat was in the first row of the plane which meant that I could place my carry-on in a closet in front of my seat rather than in an inconvenient overhead bin. I had the aisle seat but the person in the window seat had enough room to walk around the front of my seat and I was not disturbed during my sleep. Once again I was addressed by the crew by my title and surname and the food and beverage selection and service were superb.

The business class lounge at the international PAL terminal has been totally refurbished compared to the one I saw in November 2012. Its modern clean comfortable the food and drinks selection is good. En route to Bangkok by coincidence we have been embarked into an A321 maiden flight. Being a 3.5 hrs trip and a day flight comfort is not as important as for the long haul ones. However the seating was narrow without any leg rest no power sockets and no inflight entertainment which is awkward for a brand new plane of latest generation. After we took off we have been given iPads which did the job with a wide selection of movies and inflight electronic entertainment. On the way back I have been boarded into an A340 former Iberia but the experience in this case was excellent compared to the outbound route. Lie flatbed powered seats inflight entertainment (although the selection was limited to just one movie) and good service onboard. Must throw a huge commend for the attendants fantastic attentive professional all of them. Concluding for mid-short flight the experience its ok. Considering that the airline came out from tough times in the recent past it is fair to say that they did a good recovery job but from a passenger point of view there is certainly room for improvement except for the cabin crew which clearly stand out compared to most other competitors even if big names.,nan,3.0,nan

Why on earth would Philippine Airlines downgrade a plane that is travelling from Manila to SFO knowing that there are hundreds of passengers on this long-haul flight? The supposed reason from the supervisor was that the 747 was under maintenance and there wasn't a back-up plane for them to use. That is ridiculous that Philippine Airlines doesn't have a back-up 747 for a long-haul flight. Because of this we spent 2 hours waiting at the check-in counter until 3 seats became available for my party (and this was accomplished by compensating passengers willing to give up their seat). Once we were on our flight the flight attendants did not clean the bathrooms at all. When you have 260+ passengers on a plane using 6 bathrooms they need to get cleaned regularly. Additionally this downgraded plane did not provide personal entertainment systems. Having personal entertainment systems should be a requirement for a long haul international flight. The only good thing about this experience was how patient the check-in associate was with us and the fact that she was able to get 3 seats open for us.,nan,1.0,nan

The outgoing flight went well although with the usual delay (2 hours) but on my return I decided to get an earlier flight from another airline because a day before the return trip I have been monitoring the airline's reliability and they were way off their declared schedules. Fearing I'd miss my international flight later that night I took the noon flight on another airline placing my afternoon flight with Air Philippines as backup.

In Vancouver I lined up in the web check in line only to be told to go to the long regular line. The A340 long haul aircraft needs to be outfitted with an entertainment system for every seat like most world class airlines.

There were two options of either Chicken or Fish I decided to have the fish and the portion size was ridiculous for a business class meal. I am no way a big eater but for a business class flight this should be looked at. The 2 pieces of fish were smaller than a matchbox with only 2 string beans and 2 roast potato balls. I have flown with Singapore Airlines and their business class meal portion size is worthwhile. The solution was - I had mentioned this to the inflight crew and they had offered me another meal which was nice of them to do so and they said they would report this to the catering department. Bottom Line: The overall service for PHP Airlines business class is good and staff are friendly. I enjoyed the experience and would fly with them again but I strongly suggest that the portion size for the business class meals are looked at and adjusted to a suitable size that's worth the fare paid. The overall experience was very good and the service was above average.,nan,4.0,nan

After the 2 hour check in process the check in woman handed us boarding passes with different seats. Told that we needed to go upstairs to their airline office and find out about the payment status. We had less than 45 minutes to clear immigration and security before boarding so we ran up. They then informed us that Philippine airlines does not take credit cards over the phone so we could not have prepaid we had to run down to a money exchange to exchange Thai Baht and then go back to the check in counter. I have never encountered a more disorganized and unfriendly airline. We arrived into Manila and it only got worse. We were ushered into a dirty holding area after presenting our boarding passes at the transit desk and then us and a small group of people traveling to SFO were walked into our terminal where our next flight would depart in 4 hours. We then realized that we were completely trapped for 4 hours between 6-10.30pm in a terminal with no food other than a disgusting hot dog stand that only accepted Philippine quezos. It was awful and so dirty. I was told that a request for a vegetarian meal on the flight could only be done in person 4 hours prior to the flight. As soon as I realized the situation I walked up to make my request. They then told me that could only be done 72 hours before! But it cannot be done online because nothing can with this airline. The plane had very narrow seats and was an old 747. I asked the flight attendant about the meal situation. She said she would check and left me with an empty tray with a roll and cup and never returned with anything or an explanation.

Comfort: Very narrow and uncomfortable seats which is more suitable for domestic 2-3 hour flights and not for a longhaul London to Manila straight flight. Old domestic flight plane and seat backing was peeling off, leg room terrible. Staff: Flight staff young and unprofessional on inbound journey, did not even offer the supposed Ipads on board for entertainment to anyone on the flight. Staff on flight back to the UK were better experienced, courteous and professional, gave out the iPads on board during the flight and collected before embarking. Food: Terrible and barely any choice at all. I was served a burnt beef dish and they had run out of replacements. The food was not up to international standards, packaged poorly with loose foil covers that looked like it had been opened to check inside, no way near the quality of food served on other international airlines with the same price. Entertainment: The plane is old with very primitive TV screen that comes down from the ceiling with no choice at all, you're stuck with whatever is shown. No way near the entertainment provided in other airlines around the same price, with separate screens each passenger and wide choice of movies, shows, music and games. As a Filipino family (5) based in the UK, we had used 7 other airlines before and we were excited to fly our flag carrier for the first time and promote it to others but we were disappointed. The only benefit was the straight flight with no transfers but for us it was not worth sitting uncomfortably for around 13 hrs with barely any entertainment and poor food choices. It might suit solo travellers who just want to get to their destination quickly. As my son would put it, the only good thing was that we got to our destination.

When asked if our flight from Sydney would be the same with the connecting flight (from Manila to London) also taken care of we were told 'Yes, relax, and enjoy Sydney for one more day... You're details will be on the system. Just get to check-in for 9 and you'll be good to go.' When I asked for more details about the connecting flight and a confirmation email I was told it really wasn't necessary as everything would be ok. Brilliant, what a great company I thought... We arrived at the airport at 9, went to check-in and nobody knew who we were. We weren't on the system. After a very worrying 5 minutes or so, the lady at the counter told us she could get us on the flight, but once we were in Manila there wouldn't be a connecting flight for another two nights. Brilliant. The lady who had called had essentially told us the opposite. Not knowing a thing about Manila, and not being prepared with this knowledge beforehand, we really weren't in any position to stay there two nights. This was a lot to spring on us. When we told the lady at the counter that this wasn't feasible and that we weren't told this before, we were given little customer service. Just a shrug and a look which said I don't care. I understand we missed our flight, and of course that was very much our fault and nobody else's, but to give us false information was what really caused us more trouble than necessary. Because they decided to lie to us (or withhold information) we were forced to book a different, extortionate flight from the airport's flight centre. Had we known the flight was going to be that way, we could have prepared ourselves for a couple of nights in Manila or taken our time to find a cheaper alternate flight. We maybe could have even saved on the extra accommodation we ended up booking in Sydney. Of course we've had even more of a rigmarole trying to tell this to Philippine Airlines. They don't return emails, when you ring they tell us to go through our 3rd party booker, Skiddoo, who are just as bad and tell us they won't complain on our behalf as the ticket in non-refundable. For me, that's besides the point. We were misinformed and nobody is willing to take responsibility for that.

I have mixed feelings about this flight based on the fact that it seems that Philippine Airlines is trying to become a discount airline at the same time that they want to appear to be a full service airline. Online booking is confusing at times because you cannot choose your special meal in anyway so forget it if you are a vegetarian (even when I telephoned the airline requesting this in Bangkok they told me I could not do it so had to bring my own sandwich on the flight). You cannot pay the extra fee online to get a premium economy seat or one of the forward seats but you can pay for them on the flight and upgrade which is very strange. It would make so much more sense to do this online. Check-in in Bangkok was done by contact employees with PAL staff observing. I was told that I did not need to pick up my bags in Manila but having done this route before I knew I needed to clear customs with the bags so it is a good thing I remembered. That needs to be corrected or some people will not get there luggage. The flight was delayed 45 minutes which was unfortunate and every time I have flown this flight it is delayed. The crew on the flight are very polite and highly trained. They do everything they can to try and make passengers comfortable including getting everyone to close the window screens after takeoff to cut down on the glare. This would make sense if they had in-seat TV but they do not. On any over 3 hour flight it is almost criminal to not have in-seat TV. I did talk to a staff on the flight who said she was from management and promised to check into some things and email me back for after 11 days I have not received anything.

Flew from Manila to Hong Kong. To get the bad out of the way, the penny-pinching of the company can be seen in the half baked lie flat seats. There is the absence of IFE, which they try to compensate for by giving pre-loaded iPads. The entertainment selection is good, but the lack of a space to place it means you watch on your tray table, which is impossible at mealtime. There is also the absence of the side console to place the welcome drinks. The 2-2-2 configuration is such that if you prefer a window seat, you have no direct aisle access and the modified herringbone means that at the lie flat position, spaces between adjacent seats overlap. PAL dropped the ball here. Check in was passable and the lounge is a good way to escape the chaos that is the transit area of T2. Wifi is onboard to stream their entertainment, but was spotty the few times I used the service to browse/email. Now the good - the Philippines is strong in the service sector and this can be seen in the warm, friendly and sincere service of the flight crew. They can be chatty without being intrusive and seem to have a good gauge on when you need to be left alone. The highlight of the flight is the food. CX only serves pathetic pastries on their MNL-HKG-MNL hops. PR serves full meal service and on J class, it is the saving grace along with the flight crew.

I paid A$780 (US$600/GBP 420) for a return flight from Sydney to London, so it would be churlish to complain about anything: at that price I was surprised they didn't make me work as an FA. It was around half what I'd expect to pay on most airlines, and 30-40% less than the cheapest alternative. Service on the LHR-MNL leg on April 21 was outstanding and food was better than expected. There were no seat-back inflight entertainment on any of the flights, it was possible to stream films from a central server to your phone or tablet using the MyPAL Player app, which had to be downloaded in advance. This worked very well, and contained maps as well as entertainment. However, it did not contain anything like the range of films shown on the Philippine Airlines website : there were no movies less than a year old, and there were only about 20-30 movies in total. iPads with more films were available on request on the MNL-LHR vv legs, but not on the Sydney legs, and they'd run out of iPads on the MNL-LHR leg. Transfers at Manila quick and easy. NAIA Terminal 2 isn't pretty, but security screening and processing were fast and efficient. Check-in at all three airports was fast and efficient. The A330 (SYD-MNL) was pretty new. Seating was 3-3-3. The A340s were all ex-Iberia, and were very old. Seating was 2-4-2, and was generous. On the A340s the drop down TV screens were all broken, one way or another. On the MNL-SYD, the screen towards the front of economy had completely lost vertical hold, so there was a spinning black-and-white-ish screen flashing for most of the flight. On all A340 flights, the music played on landing appeared to be from a tape player. While I am sure that some people enjoy piano covers of Nu-Metal hits from the early 2000s (a low-budget Richard Clayderman clone playing Linkin Park), the music was played on an old, stretched, twisted tape, and sounded so bad that people were openly laughing at it. Playing music on a broken cassette player and showing films on a broken TV don't inspire confidence in the plane. ",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

Ended up spending 5 hours at the JFK airport and departing at 5am - with no notice or explanations whatsoever. On the way back from Vancouver to JFK, our flight ended up getting delayed for more than 2 hours - again with no notice or explanations. PAL knew the flight would be delayed but did not inform customers until they were at the airport.  We did not find out that our flight was going to be delayed until we arrived at the airport. There was no email or notification. We were using the same plane as a flight from Vancouver to JFK. This Vancouver flight was delayed for 3 hours, with that in mind, there was no way that our flight could take off in time if the previous flight was delayed. The worst part was that PAL knew about this delay 10 hours ahead of time and did not notify customers. They also did not update flight status. When we got to the airport, all the PAL employees seemed to know about the delay because there was no one working at the counters.  PAL told us that the flight would be delayed for 2 hrs so instead of a midnight departure, we would be having a 2am departure. By the time 2am rolled by, we still did not see the plane and there was no explanation from PAL as to when we were supposed to depart and why we were being delayed. From 2am - 5am, we were requested to switch gates and were told 2x that they were experiencing delays.  On the way back from Vancouver, we were told the plane was being delayed for 1 hour; however, we ended being delayed for more than 2 hours -- with no explanation. Philippine Airlines seems to not care about it's passengers at all. After some research, we saw that this JFK to Vancouver flight had been on time for about 40% of the time for the past few months or so. With that statistic, redo your schedule or tell your customers about it.  PAL would rather post unrealistic departure times than to change their schedules. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0

Stepping on board, you immediately feel like you're back in the 90s. No proper IFE, outdated lighting, sound system, cheap seat fabric and minimal legroom.

I am a Mabuhay Miles Premier Elite member and would like to forewarn other Mabuhay Miles members that it is not worth the effort to qualify for the Premier Elite level as the benefits over those of Elite level are valueless unless you travel with a companion who is not an Elite member. There is no difference in the Elite and Premier Elite bonus miles (both earn a flat 25% bonus on top of the service class miles), and airport treatment (free baggage allowance, priority check-in and boarding) are identical. There is one difference in that Premier Elites can take a guest into the Mabuhay Lounge whereas Elites can only enter the Lounges alone. The main perceived benefit of achieving Premier Elite is possibly the two free service class upgrade certificates, but in practice upgrading using the certificates is very difficult (you must buy an overpriced Economy Q-class fare that is only 15% less expensive than a guaranteed Business class fare and mot available through Philippine airlines' website) and upgrade availability is very limited. In reality its much less effort, and only marginally more expensive, to buy a Business class ticket in the first place.

Flight Attendants were wonderfully friendly and polite, and immaculately dressed, and addressed me by name, but for some reason the pre-takeoff drink does not include alcohol, unlike other carriers. Meals were mostly very good, but are not served with salt or pepper, which must be requested from the flight crew, and even then you are given sachets, not china salt and pepper shakers as with other airlines. Meal service was somewhat hit and miss, and rather disorganised. The breakfast menu included yoghurt and cereal, which we were never offered. Breakfast on one flight did not include tea or coffee, and on the flights when I requested tea with breakfast, my cup was filled with hot, (not boiling) water, and I had to wait for a teabag, which usually arrived when the water was lukewarm. Milk was never offered with tea or coffee, unless you asked for it, so I just gave up and drank my lukewarm tea black, which is not really acceptable for Business Class. The IFE was not real reliable, and movie and music channels were intermittent and jerky. At one stage my IFE refused to function, and I was offered an I-Pad instead. Alcohol service was willingly offered and call bells were answered promptly. The A340 was a much better plane, with heaps of leg room and lie flat seats, but the A320 was uncomfortable.

When the food was served, Japanese passengers were only offered bento box while Filipinos or any other nationalities were fitted to chicken and pork steaks.

A340,Business Class,3.0,November 2016,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,SYD to MNL,2.0," |  I travelled Philippine Airlines Business Class return Sydney to Manila on an A340. I took a connecting flight to Boracay Island by Cebu Pacific. I thought I got a fairly good deal Business Class ticket for US$1250. Unfortunately, on the day of my return flight, there was a typhoon in Boracay Island. All flight services from Caticlan airport were cancelled for 2 days. There was no boat service to reach Caticlan from Boracay for 24 hours. So I had no option but to miss the night PAL flight to Sydney and try to reschedule it. The misery started when I tried to contact PAL customer service to reschedule my flight. It took me around 8 phone calls and 7 hours of effort to get my flight rescheduled. I kept on trying to convince them that it was not my fault, that I was missing the flight due to the typhoon, but they refused to accept this. I was dumbfounded when the lady on the other line stated the total cost of rebooking is approximately US$5620 as I got a promo offer previously.  They kept on hold for over 45 minutes and the line got disconnected. I tried to call then again at least 6-8 times and each time they kept me on hold for at least 45 minutes, repeatedly getting disconnected. They never even attempted to call me back for the first 6 hours. After 7 hours of struggling, I finally settled rescheduling the ticket for a penalty of US$819. The only redeeming feature of this airline is that the service in Business class was above average with reasonable food. This review is a warning other travellers – even if you get good prices on ticket offers it is not worth using PAL due to its appalling customer service.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
A330,Business Class,3.0,February 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Tokyo Narita to Manila,1.0," |  Business Class in the A330 that Philippine Airlines flies to/from Manila and Tokyo Narita is not a competitive service. Food choices are limited and often many passengers have no choice other than the Japanese set because PAL never seems to have sufficient Western sets on-board to meet demand. There is no seatback IFE, although the flight-attendants offer an iPad that connects to PAL's WiFi IFE. The problem with trying to hold an iPad for a 120 minute movie are obvious, especially during the meal service. The seats provide the opposite (literally, as they are arranged 2-2-2 in a reverse herringbone configuration) of the privacy expected in modern Business Class, with the adjacent passenger having a wonderful across your laptop screen. Worse, PAL has developed a habit, maybe because Filipinos are not accustomed to true airline quality and thus don't complain, of selling tickets and then changing the schedule or aircraft type weeks before the flight. Accordingly, I was just informed that my Business Class return to Tokyo on March 15 is now downgraded to Economy because PAL decided to replace the 2-class A330 with a single-class version! Worse, PAL has no intention of making any reparation to me because Philippines law apparently doesn't require them to! ",Business,1.0,1.0

In the end, he called the taxi company, found the camera, and is now arranging to send it to their office in Vancouver. I'm blown away as this was not his problem, he just saw an opportunity to help.

Check-in at airport was fast and efficient. However, airport facilities need to be upgraded as the terminal seemed to be in it's full capacity leaving very little sitting room for transit time and few eating and shopping choices at the departure area. Flight is generally good. Staff seems to be better trained and more efficient now without sacrificing their warmth in service. Biggest improvement is the food they served; taste and portioning has vastly improved compared to the last time I took a short-haul PR economy flight last year. Seat comfort is average mainly due to quite a tight legroom compared to other airlines. I had no issues with the seat itself considering it being just a short flight. Flight was on-time in both cases and baggage claim was prompt and efficient. The extra 30-50USD you pay compared to local budget airline competitors and the 30-50USD you save compared to other regional Asian carriers is worth it. Philippine Airlines is a good choice for short to medium haul flights and I would not hesitate booking with this airline again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Whilst the airline provided their statutory obligations by providing overnight accommodation etc, as you can imagine the problems this caused with serious trouble and inconvenience for me and my fellow passengers. The UK agents for PAL are AVIAREPS PLC. Despite writing to them and following up with 2 emails, neither company has had the courtesy to respond to my request for out of pocket compensation. Apart from this and the fact that this route only provides entertainment from small iPads, try balancing these whilst sitting in very cramped seating arrangements. There is also no way to recharge your laptop for this 14.5 hour flight so trying to use their alternative inflight WiFi entertainment this service is only available for the life of your laptop batteries. Do not expect to get the standard of service offered by the likes of Etihad and Emirates who I will be returning to forthwith for future flights. I used to fly between 12 to 16 sectors a year with PAL but not again Not a recommended airline if you like those little extras like good customer service, responses to complaints or even an occasional drink during the flight. My Australian colleagues tell me that routes to Australia are better, so why not the UK route?

Booked with Philippine Airlines as they flew direct and I didn't want to waste time with a stop anywhere.  I got an email the day I was due to fly saying my flight was cancelled, no next steps or anything. Tried to phone the UK contact centre that I booked my flight through (PAL direct not an agent, stupidly I thought that was safer), they aren't open weekends! This was a Saturday and I was due to leave for the airport in a matter of hours when I got the cancellation email (mere hours after the flight reminder email). I paid a fortune to sit on hold on the phone to their Manila office, only to be told it was cancelled repeatedly with no suggestions other than for me to go to the airport and see if there was a Philippine Airline customer service team there (they couldn't confirm whether there was or not) and see if there was anything they could do to get me on another flight. Given this didn't sound promising I phoned back to speak to someone else. Eventually managed to get to speak to someone else, and booked on the next flight which wasn't for over another 24 hours. At no point did anyone acknowledge the cost to me of this cancellation (I had hotels, transfers and tours booked to follow on from the flight) or the fact that I lost over 24 hours in the Philippines and didn't get to do the tours I'd booked at all in the end because of this cancelation. Communication was really poor the whole way through and when I asked any questions I just got 'it's cancelled ma'am' or 'hello?' as the answer, it was hard work arranging a new flight. The reason for cancellation was something about 'airport scheduling' which seems poor when it's cancelled on the day. The flight I then got over 24 hours later left London late and arrived in Manila late. My return flight also departed Manila late and arrived in London significantly late - people were complaining they had missed transfers when we landed. Just a hugely stressful, disappointing and frustrating experience. I'll take a longer journey with a stop next time just to use a more reliable airline. As long as I get there safely and preferably on time I don't really fuss over the in flight experience but for those that do, it's the most basic long flight I've ever been on. No back of seat screens (on a 16 hr flight) for in flight video, yes they do give out iPad minis with a few films on, but this happens quite some time after take off and the battery obviously doesn't last the flight! Bring your own and a good power pack. I'd avoid using this airline again and wish I hadn't at all.

The cabin staff are not sufficient to serve a large number of passenger. The service is acceptable to me only when it is around 60% of occupancy. The meal service is too slow; the food carts are not evenly spread in each section to serve, so some get it early enough but others are left without being served too long; drinks that are available in the less crowded flights are out of stock in the crowded flights. The meal tray is roughly put in the table; forget the drink order and no any word for apology, etc. It is not one time thing that I experience things above, but it happens whenever I take the flight that are crowded. I have taken PAL flight more than 10 times in past, but it never satisfies me even in certain level. One thing that I noticed it was improved is that now the small dessert spoon is available for sure (before that, I had to eat it by chopstick).

Flew Philippine Airlines from Manila to San Francisco, CA. The seats were small and cramped. The aisles were very narrow. They had placed 3 seats on next to window and 4 seats in the middle. There was a disorganized delay of loading the plane due to the number of elderly people requiring wheelchairs. In addition the ground crew insisted on loading passengers from just one side of their podium (even though they had enough employees to allow loading from both sides). Once on board there was a lack of overhead bins to accomodate everyone's carry on luggage. The food was awful. The breakfast that was served appeared to have powdered eggs and were very watery. The Longanisa was not cooked. Both dinner and breakfast were so awful that I only ate the bread and jam and also the dried Mangos from Cebu. The bathrooms always seemed to have a line of waiting passengers. The bathroom closest to our seats had a sink that would not drain. There was no razors, combs, or toothbrush and toothpaste as we had received on previous flights. The take-off was delayed as they had to offload 2 passengers who apparently felt ill after having boarded the plane and needed to be deplaned. The entertainment system had a very limited selection. In fact many of the same movies from the flight over (4 weeks prior) had the same selections. The music that was available was very limited (it seemed that they were encouraging you to use your own cellphone and headphones for the music portion. Upon arrival, the customs procedure went very smoothly but we were very disappointed when it took more than 1 hour to collect our luggage from the carousel.

A340,Economy Class,1.0,December 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Sydney to Manila,1.0," |  I have flown Philippine Airlines since the mid 80's till the mid 90,s and had weathered the Marcos era and the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, when the airline had stopped flying to Australia. Back then the Philippines was known as the smile of Asia, so your holiday should start when you get on the plane not when you get off. This was my first time to fly this airline in twenty years. The nightmare began at the check-in at Sydney, the max luggage for economy was 30kg and 7kg carry on, it was obvious that 95% of the passengers were Filipinos or expat Filipinos and part of their culture is to bring back as much as goods as they can to their loved ones back in their homeland. I was shocked to see amount of excess luggage that was being loaded both at the check in and online check in queues. So much that they needed a large cage that resembled something from a zoo, I would estimate somewhere between twenty to thirty kilos for at least half of the passengers, not to mention the excess carry on baggage. Twenty years ago the airline would serve you a snack and 2 hot meals an abundance of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, two movies, toothpaste & brush and padded eye shield for sleep on an eight hour flight. Today all you will get is a very small almost inedible hot meal, very little to drink, a cheese and ham toasted sandwich for a snack, no inflight entertainment. They do have free WiFi but that takes away the experience you should look forward to when travelling. So if you don't have your own tablet or smartphone, tough. The aircraft advertised was an A340 but I later found out it may have been a A330, standard 70 rows, somehow they managed to get 78 rows, Virtually no leg room, seats were small and cramped, the aisle way was very narrow, toilets very small, could not contact stewardesses as seat controls didn't seem to work. This aircraft should only be used for short flights only one to three hours max and not for an eight hour flight. When I disembarked I felt tired, exhausted, dehydrated with muscular soreness.

To be in PAL's A330, with its 3-3-3 economy class configuration feels like being in a crowded bus. There is no elbow room, shoulders and arms spill over to the aisles because the seats are for size 0 body types. The queue for immigration and the wait to get our bags were shambolic and frustrating, respectively. PAL is the sole airline tenant in MNL T2 so they should look after their passengers post-flight.

All I got was a meal and an upgraded seat. There was no PAL desk at the departure area to make any enquiries, I had to spend 30 minutes on the phone at the terminal to discover that PAL had no lounge, even though they told me in the booking confirmation email to ""relax in their lounge"". What a joke! I even had to stand up in a bus going out from the terminal to the plane parked up far away from the terminal. All the benefits promised to my by PAL did not exist, and they did not care at all. There was no in-flight entertainment either. If you book business class you expect better standards and higher priority however PAL obviously don't care about their business class customers at all.  How can PAL sell me a business class ticket, take my money, promise me lounge access, and then not even have a lounge for me to access? After 30 minutes on the phone I was advised to ""relax in a cafe"" in the terminal. ",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

You can download the ""myPAL player"" from the App store or Google Play store before your flight. The app cannot be used during take offs and landing and can be used once the airplane is on the top of the clouds. There are a few movie selection, a few TV shows, audio, and electronic magazines, there is also a map where you can see the current position of the aircraft. There was an inflight magazine where you can see something interesting.  The food is very delicious and very presentable. My meal was assorted and healthy Japanese food. ",Family Leisure,4.0,4.0

After taking both flights I would not hesitate to fly with the airline again on the same route. Ground service was good and check in was smooth. At YVR, PAL uses the plaza premium lounge and at JFK the Alitalia lounge. Both provided ample space, food, and amenities. As for the flights, each departed slightly behind schedule (30 minutes), however, the time was made up in the air and both arrived ahead of schedule. The captains kept the passengers well informed of delays and the flight status. The cabin crew were exceptional and attentive, addressing us by last name and checking on us. The meals served on both flights was very good (for both I chose the Filipino option). I would say the service and food is on par with CX, and much better than AC. On the flight to JFK, I got a newly configured Boeing 777 with lie flat seats, and on the return flight an old configuration 777 with angle flat seats (both in a 2-3-2 configuration). These seats were good for the 5 hour flight, however, they are not as good as the pods offered by CX and AC. PAL offered WIFI on the routes which was relatively fast for aircraft WIFI and worked with my device. Overall, my flights with PAL were of a good quality. Their soft product for the two flights was on par with CX and better than AC's on the route. Meanwhile, the hard product was not the best of the three, however, compared to United and Delta which operate the route in the summer season it is much better. Given the price point round trip which is considerably less than the competition, and that on a 5 hour flight hard product is not the most essential aspect, for me they are the best option for flying from YVR-JFK based on these two flights.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

First time flying Philippine Airlines I didn't know what to expect though I've heard that the airline is currently going through a massive overhaul to become a 5-star airline by 2020. Check-in was fast and easy ground crew was very good. The boarding process was easy and the flight attendants were very welcoming and approachable. The seats were leather and decently comfortable though I found the seat a little too firm. Waited on the tarmac for 45 minutes just to take off though I don't blame airline rather on the aging and congested Manila airport. They served chicken buns and a simple drink service after takeoff. No WiFi or any other form of entertainment other than magazines which is fine given a 55-minute island hop. The cabin crew was very attentive, gave eye contact and smiled.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

The baggage allowance was only 15kg per person. So we had to pay extra due to it being a bombardier aircraft they limit everybody to that weight. However later it transpired that the aircraft had been changed for an A320, so that was annoying. But they were ok. Good ground level service. On flight was ok.

The ticket was purchased by the company via a travel agent in Y but upgraded to business at their main office. Still, I was not able to check in online nor change my seat. Upon reaching the terminal pretty early in the morning, I was pleased to find no queues in the business class check in lane and got my seat and boarding pass quickly. Boarding was quick and friendly on both legs and both flights were on time. Flight crew do not address business passengers by name on such a short flight but they were friendly and courteous. Seats were old, but comfortable. Toilets were clean enough. Food was surprisingly good and adequate for a short 50 minute flight.

The biggest gripe I have with this airline is the lack of inflight entertainment. My other problem was the service, the FAs had an aura of being rude.

I am a regular traveller on this airline and no surprise that the flight was delayed by one hour with no explanation. The meals were OK on this flight and the flight attendants professional and attentive, which seemed an improvement on my last flight. I believe this airline does not run to schedule. I am still seeking my claim against them for a delay in December 2016, which they made an offer for, but are yet to pay.  From my dealing with them they are very slow to reply to complaints if they do. I cannot recommend them and their customers deserve better, its time they started to listen to them.

The plane personnel promised passengers they would arrange for new connecting flights when they arrived in Manila. But when she went to the Philippine Airlines ticket counter, the employees refused any kind of help. I spent 5 hours on the phone trying to resolve this with PAL and got nothing but frustration from their customer service department. Cebu Pacific was just as uncooperative and charged my wife full fare for another connecting flight, so she paid twice for one flight. Philippine Airlines has refused to compensate my wife for the connecting flight or give her a partial refund of her ""non-stop"" flight ticket. She could have made her connecting flight if the plane wasn't late to SFO to begin with. Bottom line, the employees lie through their teeth to appease you, and once you are at the final destination, they refuse any help. To add insult to injury, they also charged my wife an additional $150 because her carry on suitcase was over 15 pounds. The suitcase weighed half of that, and the candy she brought for kids made up more than the rest of the ""allowance"". $150 because she was slightly over 15 pounds. The flight she took from SLC to SFO did not charge her any extra. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

We missed our flight and tried to contact this company through their office in Bali which is where we were, and to make things worse the only office was in our hotel Kuta Paradiso which was never open. Eventually after hours of attempting to call we finally got a response. The price initially for the return business class flights was £3000 that we paid, we somehow missed the return flight and after contacting them at a cost of at least £100 extra as it's a premium number they use, they said we will charge you a cancellation fee and ask you to pay the difference for a return flight which they stated would be after deduction $7000. We then asked what it would be to fly economy and that was $6000.  We have now booked return business flights by Cathay Pacific and British Airways at a cost of €1347 each.

Flight was originally scheduled at 1110 am and was delayed by an hour. Notification was sent via email at 0930. Strangely nothing was said during check-in (0900), and we only knew it by chance because I opened my email using the airport's free wifi at 1000. There was no announcement or update on the tv screen. On-board, we were told that our pre-requested halal meals were unavailable. I have called the airlines' office in KL twice two weeks before departure from KUL to confirm. Airline crews did their best trying to appease us. Two fish-based meals, maybe extras from the business class, were given to us.  Will we fly with them again? Yes, but only if Philippine Airlines can get their act together. ",Family Leisure,4.0,4.0

It was my first time I had travelled alone on a long haul flight, so naturally I was nervous about my journey. I researched my flight and read some distressing reviews about this flight! However, after being very sceptical about the flight I was pleasantly surprised and don't think the airline deserves the reviews it was getting! Yes, there was no inflight entertainment but they did give out iPads with charging packs. This meant we could watch films and TV series on there. The food was not always to my liking, but it was perfectly acceptable and there was plenty of it. The seats were okay, any long haul flight is going to have its discomforts and for the money spent on these flights it wasn't bad. The staff were all very accommodating and friendly. Don't get me wrong, it's not the best airline I have ever flown with but for the money I paid compared to other airlines I was pretty impressed.

The first leg of my journey was 4 hours (Darwin to Manila) and I was upgraded to business class (a very pleasant surprise). There were seats and inflight entertainment on this leg, though the food was still very average. I asked for a glass of wine at dinner and it never came, but otherwise a very acceptable journey. The second leg Manila to London was much much worse. It was a 14 hour journey, made even longer by the 2 hours we sat on the tarmac in Manila not moving. I received one meal during the flight, a dinner, which was almost entirely inedible. There was supposed to be another meal but I did not get it (not sure why, I saw that trolley go past but perhaps they had run out of food). I was seated in the last row of the plane, the light was on behind me the entire journey. When we got to Heathrow we taxied and parked and then we lost power to the plane.  There was no in-flight entertainment. There was an app that you could download before boarding the aircraft which was not advertised at all - the first I knew about it was when I got to the seat (and it was obviously too late to download). They handed out some ipads throughout the journey. Without the app or ipad, there was not a screen showing the progress of the plane or the time. I also flew back from Heathrow to Manila, then Manila to Darwin. On the Heathrow to Manila flight there was again no in-flight entertainment, but I had downloaded the app and it worked tolerably well (stuck in a few places due to the wifi speed). I was fed two meals on this flight but for both meals the meat portion was intolerable. They had also run out of the most popular choice of chicken (I was seated half way down in economy), so there was no choice of meal. The real kicker was the 4 hour delay in Manila between the hours of 11.30pm and 3.30am. They were an hour later than the re-scheduled flight. They provided us at around 1am with some deep fried chicken from Jolli Bees.  To top it off, it was not actually a cheap flight - the price was around a number of other airlines, but I went with them because the flight times were the best.",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

This was preceded by a 7 hour stopover in Manila after flight from Denpasar which was expected - however this turned into a 9.5hr stopover due to the delayed boarding time of the London flight. Neither planes had tvs and the cabin crew gave out ipads, half of which were out of battery already and they also didn't have enough for the plane. Luckily I had a couple film on my phone to watch.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,October 2017,3.0,2.0,1.0,no,Manila to Auckland via Cairns,1.0," | This was by far the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. Initially our seat was changed from row 54 to row 34. After boarding I checked where row 54 would have been but the rows stopped before that, so that means that the plane was changed to accomodate a smaller customer count. This would be fine but he seats that we were assigned to did not recline as it would have blocked the emergency exit. Again, this is understandable. However what isn’t understandable is that the legroom for this seat was significantly smaller than I have ever seen, I am not extremely tall and I could not move my knees in this seat. I have taken images of this. Especially for such a long flight- 6+ hours to Cairns and then another 6 hours to Auckland. There should be a minimum limit on legroom for such long flights.

Both aircraft were comfortable and were equipped with decent IFE, better headphones than some airlines supply in business class and a good range of movies. Crew were polite, efficient and professional. A simple and tasty rice meal was served and the wine was fine. I needed to change my flight booking on the return flight and went to the Philippine Airlines Office in Manila near Harrison Plaza. Service was great and I was able to change my ticket, in a few minutes for a very fair change fee. Philippine Airlines are working hard in recent years to improve their product in terms of quality, reliability and price, and I have to say they're succeeding at least on the routes I fly.

Though lounge personnel must always see to it that there are utensils for the guests at all times. Check in was fast with dedicated check in counters for business passengers. Airplane was clean. The food onboard also tasted good. I must say that the airline has gone the extra mile offering full course meal on a domestic flight just one hour long. No IFE onboard.

Next issue was that I had no follow on ticket from Manila. I told her that I didn't know the exact date I was leaving and so had not bought a follow on ticket. I also told her that on a previous visit to the Philippines and on my recent trips to the US and Canada, I had no follow on ticket and never had a problem with customs. As I understood it, follow on ticket is an issue for customs not the airline. I checked my luggage, received my boarding pass and headed to the boarding gate. Not long before we were due to board, there was an announcement over the PA system asking me to come to the counter. Same girl is there saying she's talked with her supervisor and that I can't board the flight without a follow on ticket. I'm trying to reason with her and asking why not and she's telling me it's to protect the airline! She offers to sell me a follow on ticket there and then from Manila to Hong Kong for $450, almost the same price as LA to Manila! No Wifi there at the boarding gate so i'm not able to buy a cheap ticket using my smartphone. They ordered by bags off the plane.

Premium Economy section was moved back a bit to give way to the new Business Class section in the front, introduced in the Riyadh route last August. Except for one downside, the economy passengers on the next cabin are using the Premium Economy lavatory which is very inconvenient for our section. Economy passengers has 4 lavatories in their section and too lazy to go there. If only the airline can close the side of the galley so that economy passengers are discouraged to use the Premium Economy lavatory - it will be much more quieter and not withstanding the queue at the back of row 24 E/F/G.

The airline changed our flight for the 4th time since booking, and 3 days before we are due to depart (I understand that these things happen) but they cancelled our connection without letting us know therefore potentially leaving us stranded in Manila. We have now had to change our flight to the 25th, losing money on transportation to and from the airport, messing around family and causing major issues for us in Auckland. Upon our request for compensation / upgrade, they passed us around to various different departments. This took us 4 hours without a result. We are bitterly unhappy with the lack of communication, consideration and organisation. This has been an awful experience, one I wish to never repeat.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Had to book accommodation in Manila, and also in Auckland as now could not get home same day, plus needed new flights from Auckland. Check in both at London and Manila abysmally slow, not enough staff. PAL terminal at Manila very badly signed, and gate waiting area had no water or toilets so had to go out and back through security. Plane from Manila freezing cold, airline staff could, or would, not remedy. No entertainment on this plane, on two 4-5 hour flights. Took us 5 days to get home, completely exhausted.

On the seat map it gave no indication that this seat was unable to recline due to being against the lavatory wall, and in fact gave no indication that it was near the lavatory at all. The legroom was terrible and the seat cushion had almost no padding left. It’s safe to say it was a very uncomfortable 13+ hour flight. I remember my lower back hurting for days afterwards.

One of the ground crew told us that it's fine since it's a few hours before our departure.  The flight had two gate changes which weren't announced properly, ensuing confusion. Once boarded, however, the experience is almost perfect. Pleasant background music is played during the boarding process. The seats are nice, even if some of them show signs of wear even if they're evidently less than a year old. My seat won't recline, though it was made up by the travel-pillow like headrest and ample legroom. I couldn't use the in-flight entertainment because I didn't have the phone app. Seat screens are still superior. The food (grilled chicken with rice) is fantastic and I have no complaints with the professional cabin crew. Things that I notice are the priority giving of food to children and explaining that they're pausing service during turbulence. The pilots are top-notch: the landing one of the smoothest I experienced for a while. Would recommend.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan
A340 & Boeing 777,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,3.0,4.0,1.0,no,Auckland to London via Manila,2.0," | To sum up my review: Different routes and different planes result in a very different experience. Let me start by saying that I have been taking flights between London and Auckland (return) for the past 9 years. I always try to take different routes so I can experience different stopovers and different airlines. The first leg from Auckland to Manila was on the A340 and was a terrible experience. I have never been on a long haul flight which didnt have an entertainment system (TV screens in the seat in front) until I flew on this aeroplane! The plane appeared to be very old and run down, very old style seats which were uncomfortable. There was no legroom at all for me (I am 6' or 1.80m tall) my knees were jammed into the seat in front. They handed out iPads for passengers to use to view movies on the 10 hour flight, however they didn't hand these out until we were 3 hours into the flight and then collected them back about 1 hour before landing. The service on the flight was very average with little or no effort made by the cabin crew, we were required to keep walking down to the kitchen to ask for water which was handed out 1 cup at a time. The staff gave the impression that they were constantly annoyed at being asked for anything. Conversely on the second leg from Manila to London we were on a new B777. This flight was much better, entertainment system, quieter, more comfortable, acceptable leg room, however the service from the cabin crew was still very poor. Overall if Philipine Airlines improved their crew service and plane fleet they would be an acceptable option in the future. Until this happens - I will be avoiding it.",Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0

Maybe due to the early morning schedule of the flight the inflight meals seem worse than normal. In flight crew were excellent but the ground crew at check-in were slow to get the passengers processed. As a matter of comparison there were other flights that morning by other airlines operating much larger aircraft and yet our queue was more than twice as long as the other airlines.

In flight snacks is good. Free baggage allowance is also a big add on. The only thing lacking is the absence of Inflight entertainment system.

I wasn't too sure what to expect as I hadn't heard too much about them and the price was so low. I was impressed - friendly staff, clean interior, good food, a great selection of in- flight entertainment, and their connecting times in Manila were perfect, less than 3 hours.

I found the seats to be very comfortable and the flight, although an hour late taking off from Manila, landed only slightly late at Heathrow. Our luggage arrived very quickly, just as we arrived to collect it off the belt. The only negatives were the food, which was ok, but nothing to write home about, and the cabin temperature, which alternated between either too cold or too warm. For the price I paid though, and the fact that it was a direct flight, I was pleased with my choice of airline and would fly Philippine Airlines again",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

Called their hotline from Jeddah, which is an overseas call, to avail the low fare. I am an Overseas Filipino Worker therefore, I am exempted from paying the Terminal Fee and PH Travel Tax which can be removed out through their website. But since I was booking through the hotline, I was informed by the agent that they cannot remove these fees once I book through them. I had to undergo the process of refunding these taxes. Moreover, PAL and Travel Tax office are pin pointing to each other as to where will I get the refund, and until now I am still waiting for their responses. Bookings made thru agents/hotline cannot be accessed to their website, not until 24 hours before your departure. So there's no way to confirm your booking online before that. There is no IFE, you have to download their MyPAL Player app to access their IFE.  No amenity kit provided on this leg. The service is okay, though there is not much initiative from the crew (e.g. walk around to offer drinks). Served one full hot meal in an 11-hour flight, the rest are light meals such as crackers and sandwiches. JED-MNL leg delayed by almost 4 hours. Good for me because I am checking the flight status the night before my departure in the morning. The departure time changed 3 times. from 6:40 to 10:00. Flight changes are announced via email only.

It started off weird at the Manila when the check in person told me that I needed to pay a terminal fee in exchange for my boarding pass. It was cheap so I was fine with it. But I couldn’t figure out where to pay the fee and there was no sign to say where to pay it. I asked a few ground staff and they told me that I don’t need to pay because I’m holding an Australian Passport. But nonetheless they were very friendly and approachable. And one of the ground staff finally helped me out and even walked me to the place where I needed to pay. He waited with me at the line and we had a nice chat. Once it was my turn, he left and wished me good luck to my travels. When I returned to the check in, he gave me my boarding pass. He then asked if I had any glass or breakable objects. I told him I have some souvenirs that might break. And just with that, he placed a fragile sticker on the bag with no hesitation. I was pretty happy and very relieved and confident that my bag’s contents wouldn’t break. Then at immigration, the line was short and there was no wait at all, despite the hundreds, even thousands of people in the airport. The departure hall was small and there was a lot of people. But enough seats and charging ports for everyone and a good wifi connectivity. The plane was new and quiet. No TV but had a streaming service which had a great selection of TV and Movies. Would love to have a tv though but it was a short three hour flight. Would recommend reading the Mabuhay Magazine which includes some very interesting topics and articles. The food was super delicious and big. The staff was very friendly on requests. Overall I loved the experience with PAL.

It took at least another 25 minutes beyond the initial delay before they airline began to board the aircraft. To top things off, while the passengers at the departure area could see in full view the aircraft standing by at the gate a few minutes after the original time, the Pilot makes an announcement of his ""apologies"" for a slight delay due to aircraft turnaround.

They have to improve their Middle East flights especially the leg room and IFE on Premium Economy and Economy Class. I hope they will also give importance to all OFW’s working in the Middle East by providing a better and excellent service.

I was a bit hesitant to book it especially the two airlines were not codeshare partners and that I thought my bags wouldn’t be transferred all the way to Manila, but the staff in Perth was very comforting that my bags would be transferred and that I just needed to get my boarding pass in Manila. I also called Philippine Airlines by phone before my flight and they also assured that my bags will be transferred. My Philippine Airlines flight was sleepy as the flight departed midnight. When entering the cabin, the plane was obviously new but the seats were made out off synthetic leather and some of the covers were peeling off. But the seats colour was very tranquil and it looks very different which I loved. The blues and the browns were just great colour schemes. The big thing was that there was no inflight entertainment tvs but they had a streaming service which had great shows. It was easy to connect in my laptop but if you’re using your phone, you need to download the app before flight. It would be nice if they gave out iPads and have a holder for it on the back of the seats so it was like a tv, because it was an inconvenience having my laptop and my food on a tiny table. But it’s okay because it was a midnight flight and I didn’t use the IFE much. Food was great, big meal for a 3 hr flight and had ice cream as well. We got given free SIM card vouchers.

From evening departure from RUH to early arrival in MNL, which means one can conveniently catch a connection to any point in the Philippines, especially some local airports have daylight restrictions. As to food, we were served 1 full meal and 2 light snacks with all of them acceptable enough. The only let down for me is the seat configuration and entertainment. The Hi-density config on A330 is not suitable for 10 hrs flight. We're crammed light sardines and the absence of individual tv is a bit of a disappointment.

It has been a few months since I last flew Philippine Airlines. Big improvements were noticed upon boarding. The cabin may be old but seats were clean and there was bottled water on every seat now. This is far different from the old PAL that I had experienced. However the TAG to CRK flight was a big let down. My seat was dirty, there were left over chewing gum wrapper, contents of the seat pocket incomplete, no bottled water and service was inconsistent. For example, the lady two rows ahead of me was provided with a blanket however when I asked for one, the stewardess said they only provided blankets for international flights. Instead they would lower the cabin temp so that we don't feel cold. The temperature was never adjusted and when I approached a different crew, he gave me a blanket without hesitation. PAL has recently also recently been aggressive advertising the following amenities (food, free luggage allowance, blankets on flights, new seats retrofits, and warm service). Food although present is inconsistent, For example, my CRK to TAG flight say would serve water but return flight did not have this and would instead serve you a small cup of water around 100ml. This far from the food service of other airlines I have flown regionally (eg. SQ). Blankets not available on all flights. Official social media accounts cannot even confirm if they have amenities on specific flights. No listing which routes are served with reconfigured seats. My brother's flight did not have luggage allowance while mine had. Most specific, service and cabin crews are inconsistent on different routes.

Upon arrival, I went to the ticketing/cashier of PAL in SFO (because this is where they directed us to ask abt my baggage) and the attendant told us to return the next day and will inform us when the baggage arrive and the earliest would be @ 10pm. She also gave us a number of PAL to check if my bags have already arrived the next day. We waited for the message or call from PAL about my baggage but received none. So I tried calling the number of PAL that was given to me from 10-11pm. Around 11pm, a man from PAL talked to me through phone telling me that the baggage was on the same plane as I am and was blaming me that I didn’t picked it up. No one informed me from the airlines about it. Different info was relied to me from the connecting flight. So we went to the airport to pick up my bags. Saw the same woman who told us that she’ll inform us as soon as the bags have arrived and found but received neither a single call or message. She was shocked and apologized because she forgot about it. So she got my stub and passport to get my bags. When I saw my bags, one was in good condition and the other was slightly damaged.  I could have gotten my bags only if I knew that it is already there when I arrived but no one informed me and got the wrong info. PAL should be responsible enough to inform their customers the information that they need and deserve.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,2.0,2.0,3.0,no,Vancouver to Manila,1.0, |  Vancouver to Manila. Washroom was dirty. One of the flight attendants didn't bring the midnight snacks for us.  They do come around with water which I appreciated so much but they try to not glance your way giving me the impression that they don't want to give you any. We waited for 6 hours before they collected the garbage. It ruined the experience for me. I realize that it was a full flight but the service shouldn't change. ,Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0
A330-300,Business Class,4.0,January 2018,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes,Manila to Tokyo,5.0," |  Manila to Tokyo. A330 reconfigured business class seat with 1-2-1 seating fits the 4 star category. Manila to Tokyo flight is a short 4 hrs. Seat was comfy with massage function, spacious legroom, adjustable firmness function, storage space, full flat bed position, fine dining style, very responsive touch HD IFE screen, attentive cabin crew. However it lacks cabin mode lighting, 1 toilet shared by 18 pax. No amenity kit for business class on this short flight. IFE has no inflight cameras and not interactive 3D map. No pre-landing snack. Wifi cannot connect to the internet in my flight. Overall this business class is way better than business class on Boeing 777 in terms of privacy. I hope that PAL reconfigure all their A330s to this triclass version specially the bi-class they're using for Middle East flights which I normally take 6 legs a year. ",Family Leisure,4.0,1.0

On the way back, they used the A340 which I think needs some refurbishing; seats look old, tired and not ergonomic. Both flight have inflight entertainment streaming which has limited choices.  Food service is very slow, the quality is okay for a short haul flight. PAL loves to overload their passengers with carbohydrates: imagine a meal of rice, pasta salad, bread and cake.

Luckily, Philippine Airlines allows early check-in so I was able to drop my bag quickly and got my boarding pass. There was no delay and boarding was efficient. An old A320-200 with wider seats and small monitors. I was seated at the exit row with extra legroom. When one of the flight attendants was explaining the exit row manual, I looked at my phone because of a text message and she told me “Sir, your attention please”. The same attendant got my bag and put it on the overhead compartment for me. Coffee, tea, water and a carrot cake were served. After eating my snack, I went to get my laptop and I pressed the attendant’s button to call for help. The chief pursuer came to me and I told her that I can’t find my bag, she then called the same flight attendant who carried my bag a while ago and got my bag from the over-head cabin. She told me it was just covered, not missing. Pal is known for the warmth of its flight attendants but in this flight not. ",Business,5.0,nan

There is a very big improvement on the check-in in NAIA Terminal 2 Domestic, the ground staff were very warm-welcoming even though I checked-in at 5 am and there was no line at all! It only took me few seconds to drop my bag and get my boarding pass. I used the Mabuhay Lounge and there was nothing really special about it as compared to Singapore Airlines or Cathay but it also improved a lot the last time I used it. It still has a wide selection of drinks, cakes and other food enough for breakfast. PAL uses the newly reconfigured A330 or A340 to General Santos and luckily we used the newly reconfigured tri-class A330! I was actually disappointed that I didn't upgrade my ticket to business class. The seat in economy was a bit hard but comfortable, leg room was really good, the IFE worked well and has updated movie list (I watched Call Me by Your Name, they also have Coco and other new movies)! Landing and baggage collection in General Santos also went well. No delays, snacks were served (tea, coffee, water and bread). Will definitely recommend Philippine Airlines.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Boarding a mess, gate got changed 2 times. Some  remained in my seat pocket, tray table not cleaned. Seating space just enough, if you over 6 foot its not comfortable. Take off was delayed for more than 2 hours, seems common for my resent trips. PAL is the only operator for this destination, sadly no other choice. Crew was friendly but distant. ",Business,2.0,nan

Legroom was great, food is not that tasty up in the air, but it’s okay, FA’s were distributing snacks. Inflight entertainment is very responsive, The aircraft is only about a year old.

A330,Business Class,5.0,March 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Manila to Dammam,3.0," | Manila to Dammam on 17th March 2018. Philippine Airlines is known for its crew hospitality and on this flight, the entire business class crew were very professional and willingly ensured that passenger satisfaction is met. The business section was half full so there was no traffic to the single toilet/lavatory unlike my DMM-MNL flight of 1st March. If there is a room for improvement, I hope PAL will address this by adding one more toilet for the business class section in this sector. Food (2 sets of meals) and amenities (L'Occitane and PAL slippers) were very good. Inflight entertainment (i.e. movies) is quite dated and needs a fresh and newer set of films. Aircraft is an older A330 and the seats could do some upgrading. Overall, I am still satisfied and recommend this airline to my friends and work colleagues. I have already noticed an increase in their internet published fares for business class to which I am hoping that visible improvements commensurate to that projected price hike will take place.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

The crew politely replied that just wait until the passengers will finish boarding since there are still passengers not yet in the aircraft. So I waited but the crew forgot my request and the plane already took off. When I arrived at my destination airport I found out that there is still a lot of empty window seats in the flight. I hope next time the crew should be aware of the little request of the passengers/customers. Overall the flight was pleasant and smooth boarding.,Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

We booked flights for Thursday 7th June. 3 weeks before our flight date we have been told that the flight is cancelled and we either have to fly a day later and miss the wedding or a day earlier and have to take unpaid leave and deal with work complications because of it. If we had known before we would have chosen a different airline, however 3 weeks before the flight date flights have sky rocketed in price and suitable flights not available so is not an option.

I noticed that in-flight meals have deteriorated. They used to serve ice cream in the Bangkok route but nowadays the desserts are poor. In flight entertainment is mediocre, movie selections have not changed in the past 6 months. As usual, one has to use the mobile phone or tablet to stream movies.

A330-300,Economy Class,3.0,April 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,no,Bangkok to Manila,3.0," |  Bangkok to Manila. I have flown this flight numerous times to get to Cebu City via Manila as there are not many other options. Pal now have a direct flight from BKK to Cebu City but it leaves in the middle of the night so it is not an option. Booking online with PAL is not easy. My final destination is Cebu City and it is almost impossible to get a good connection in Manila as PAL gets the time of the flight from BKK to Manila wrong. They list it as a 4.30 hour flight and it is a 3.30 hour flight.  I paid for a better seat choice near the front of economy but it turned out the flight was almost full so people that did not pay were sitting net to me which is unfair but that is how it goes. The major upgrade to this flight is now after years of complaining they do have in-seat tv's on the flight. This is nice and the selection was not too bad. The internet on board was slow. They do not offer a fish choice, only chicken and pork.  They have a good selection of drinks to choose from. Flight attendants were polite and professional and efficient. At Terminal 2 MNL the baggage took over 30 minutes to arrive. ",Business,2.0,1.0
nan,Business Class,3.0,April 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Cebu to Bangkok,3.0," |  I wanted to try the new direct flight from Cebu to Bangkok that started recently and choose business class to see what services were offered. When I arrived to check into the flight there was no line for business class. When I mentioned this to the man checking me he laughed and yelled over to his colleague who said she forgot to light up the sign (she was playing on her phone at the time). I was given a pass to the business class lounge and a special line pass for BKK Immigration. The lounges is not a PAL lounge but an independent that all airlines use. It was OK but in no way special. The food was disgusting. They had a wine selection and only one brand of beer. Internet speed was slow but usable. Upon boarding the flight there was no special line for business class so I waited with other passengers. It turned out I was the only person in business class. There are 12 seats in this class, 4 per row, which are wider than economy and fairly comfortable but the seats barely recline so there was no way I could sleep on the flight. The tv screen is about the size of a small tablet and the selection was terrible. I was offered a menu with drink and meal selections. The food and wine were poor.  Service was good in the beginning but after about 45 minutes the flight attendants seemed to be eating and chatting and then 4 of them including the flight purser went to sleep in the business class section!  I understood that it was a turnaround flight for them from Bangkok so I guess they needed to rest but I kept thinking what would happen in the event of an Emergency? Hold on passengers we need to wake up the flight attendants and flight Purser! So the bottom line is it was not really worth the extra money for business class on a small plane with PAL. Save it for the larger jets where you can get a seat that reclines more. My luggage arrived in the middle of all other passengers luggage which was disappointing as it should arrive before. Clearly PAL have not worked that out with the baggage handlers at BKK airport. I would put them at 3 star only at this time.",Business,2.0,nan

Flight arrived an hour early, once cleared immigration, bags were already lined up beside the carousel.

I use United domestically in the US and Cathay Pacific for trips to Asia. I recently scheduled a trip with Philippine Airlines direct to Manila from San Francisco and have never experienced a poor level of customer service. I repeatedly advising the sales representative at purchase that I would arrive in San Francisco airport 12 hours in advance of the flight to Manila. As such, access to the lounge for business class travelers would be essential for me. I was repeatedly assured that the business class lounge would in fact be available. Upon arrival in San Francisco airport, I was advised that the lounge was not open and that the personnel of the airline would not arrive until three hours before departure. Upon calling customer service, I was put on hold for approximately 2 hours waiting for assistance only to be told that my earlier call to purchase the tickets was reviewed and that the representative confirmed access to the lounge as I requested. Nothing further could be done. I complained to the business manager upon check-in and received no response. I was, however, told that a complaint would be forwarded to customer care which in fact was never done. Upon departure from Manila back to San Francisco in business class many of the seats simply did not work to adjust position. Passengers in business class were left to scramble to find seats that actually adjusted. Those who did not find a workable seat were left to request the staff to manually adjust the seats in business class. I have attached photos of the attendants manually adjusting seats that otherwise did not work at all.
