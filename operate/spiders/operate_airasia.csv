Online check-in had errors and glitches which did not allow me to checkin early, charged 40,000 yen at airport. Showed pictures of website glitches and errors, airline does not care or understand. Then I was accidentally tripled charged on my return flight baggage. Had 5 transactions for baggage totaling over $800 USD! My two tickets cost only around $700. Was refunded for some of the excess charges, however such a hassle and online help and calling is very time consuming and stressful and not user friendly. I figured if I provided pictures and explained my problems the airline would understand the online checkin and website had experienced problems and was not working properly. Poor customer service using live chat and submitting cases on issues, just replied back with automated answers. Like talking to a computer. Nobody should have to get charged over $800 USD and worry about 5 charges for 2 small check-in bags, especially unauthorized charges. Very disappointed and will never fly again because of airlines poor recognition of the problem, poor customer service and failure to refund a small cost that should never of happened.

Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor.

As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted.

The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look.

Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'. Service recover for whom? Formerly loyal Air Asia customers. No longer.,nan,4.0,nan

Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage.

There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor.

Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia.

Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used it's bye bye to Air Asia for me.

If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin.

Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.,nan,4.0,nan

I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.,nan,4.0,nan

Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing.

So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport.

AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats.

The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate.

These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment.

Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security).

The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia.

They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline.

The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times.

Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,nan,1.0,nan

The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.,nan,2.0,nan

I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations.

We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters.

While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English.  Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean. AirAsia X flight from KUL to MEL was a widebody jet. There was no entertainment system. Seats were tight for me (6 feet) but my wife (5/6) was alright.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",nan,1.0,nan

Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets.

My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure.

On arrival at CNX they had 3 flights departing at approximately the same time and only 3 check-in desks open. There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG. All the planes I have flown are exceptionally clean and look and feel new however I regret that Air Asia is loosing its credibility and its novelty is wearing mighty thin.,nan,4.0,nan

Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine.

Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight.

FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg.

I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him.

I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this.

The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food.

On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,nan,2.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,nan,3.0,nan

No food or entertainment this was expected so was not a problem. Travelled with our 4 kids ensured they had colouring in books iPods etc. Flight was fine at the end of 9 hrs flying they were ready to get off but behaved well without normal flight gadgets. Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all. Overnight flight home tried for Premium upgrade was not successful very difficult to sleep although the flight did seem quicker at night.

On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.,nan,3.0,nan

LCCT needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The signboards and facilities are in dire need of improvement. Toilets are wet and slippery.

The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle.

Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.,nan,5.0,nan

That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours.

Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline.

The trip took too long overall with waiting time in airports but the worst part was that on the return the flight was supposed to leave Phuket at 7.30pm and was delayed until 9.30pm. Staff kept assuring us the flight to Australia would wait for us. This did not happen and the plane left before we arrived were put up in sub standard hotel for the night.

Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience.

Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money.

The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint.

I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped.

Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one.

I've taken many of the budget airlines in Southeast Asia, but Air Asia remains my favorite. In fact, I think Air Asia may even be better than some of the full carriers in the area. I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times. I never had any problems with any of my flights. None of my flights were ever delayed, which definitely can't be said for the other airlines I've taken around Southeast Asia. Their app also works well, but it's only available for use at certain airports. The ground staff is can sometimes seem a bit course, but they are efficient and get the job done. Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead.

Based on my observation, the crew had communication problems in assisting and handling the requests from passengers from the moment of boarding to arriving at our destination. I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation.

The difference is a 30.000IDR taxi drive that can take up to 30 minutes. This can make the difference between making it in time or being late. Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient. All the check in desks could be used for all Air Asia flights. Boarding was done by a bus that brought us to an aerobridge which seems an odd thing to do but ok, it works.

It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays. With competitors now offering better options and coming up with new promotions, I think AirAsia may start losing its grip.

Unless you have no money on you and no water, you are in trouble. Everything here has a price ticket, which was absolutely ridiculous on a 13 hour flight: since when do we have to pay for a human right (water). The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. We were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadn't even left the plane! Secondly, because of the lack of legspace, it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.

At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us.

I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money. On the pass they only give you useless 'credits' which you will never use in the limited time period.",Business,1.0,1.0

I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care.

AirAsia has terrible customer service and tries to overcharge passengers at every turn. I purchased 2 25 kg checked bags, but at check in, they claimed I had only purchased one, which resulted in by baggage being 11 kg over the weight allowance that I purchased. They then offered to check the remainder of my luggage for 42,000 won per kg, or 1.5 times the cost of my original ticket. They wanted 640,000 won for my 11 kg of checked luggage which they falsely claimed that I had not purchased. I am never flying AirAsia again.",Business,1.0,nan

My flight was smooth, check-in for domestic flights is also possible at self check-in kiosks, so it saved a lot of time.

I have to say this was the worst travel experience I have had. We bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. On the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur then connecting flight to Ho Chi Minh City and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. When arriving at Sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the Kuala Lumpur flight and also the Ho Chi Minh City flight at the same time. On the way back different story. They said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. So in KL we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. Many times I have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and I don't drink caffeine. I usually just ask them if I can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and I add my own decaf coffee.  I got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk (powdered) for free and that if I asked on another flight for this that I might be told to pay for a drink. There is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a low-cost airline. When you  pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in Malaysian currency or credit card. Then if you don't have credit card you can't purchase anything. Fortunately I had some US dollars in cash and they made a quick conversion and I paid in that for my items. ,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

With this flight we had 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur to catch the other flight. After a month I a got a message of a reschedule for about two hours later. It still should be enough for the transfer in Kuala Lumpur. On the day of departure when we arrived at the ariport a next reschedule of the flight. This means about two hours for transer. This is very tight for a transer in Kuala Lumpur, due to the two different terminals. We informed the AirAsia staff, they arranged a Priority luggage handling. The man took a picture of our passport and ticket and send it to Kuala Lumpur to inform the office there and probably inform the Oman Air counter, our connecting carrier. Finally, at the gate we waited for three hours to found out that the flight was delayd for almost an hour! The plane had a fast and smooth trip to Kuala Lumpur. At arrival we ran to the luggage band, picked up our luggage as first and run to the next terminal. At the second terminal we found out that the connecting flight of Oman-Air has left already.  The result was that I had to buy 4 new tickets to Amsterdam. Back home filling in the e-form and ask for help or compensation. But the only response of Air Asia, sorry we are not responsible. We can not be charged for costs due to delay or rescheduling. This means that you cannot trust AirAsia if you have a connecting flight. If you cannot trust the schedule you better don't fly with AirAsia.  Im sorry because the flight and onboard service is okay. The lesson is that a cheap ticket can turn to be very expensive.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I only had a cabin size suitcase, and a drawstring backpack with me. I have been travelling with AirAsia many times in the past, due to the it's competitive price, even though the seats are uncomfortable, but I don't mind it for short hauls. I have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. So size wise, I know my suitcase is definitely fine. For my drawstring backpack, anyone who has one knows you can't really put much in it. I only had my personal documents in the bag, plus a jacket to use while on the flight. After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time! He said I had to check in my suitcase. So I had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again! After all this messing around, my suitcase was finally ready for checking it, and I was charged IDR 800k for that! My flight was only IDR 1,380,400! I could have pay a little bit more, and flew with Cathay, which comes with 20kg check-in luggage, a much comfier journey with entertainment, plus direct flight. What really annoyed me was that after I went to the other side at the boarding gate, I saw so many people with over-sized luggage. I spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint, but they ignored me. As soon as I landed, I sent an email to AirAsia to make this complaint, there were a lot of emails back and forth, but they were not willing to do anything about it. I'm fine if they want to follow their rules strictly, but please make sure it's consistent. ",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined.

I think it's deliberate, to trick you into buying extras you don't want and to gain revenue from inadvertent double bookings of flights. Customer service - there is none of this at AirAsia. None. Ziltch. I asked for help and they arrogantly didn't listen, instead just threw 'policy' or 'rules' at me. There is no compassion, no fairness, nothing. Just everything their way. They won't even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. Unfair and unjust. Small seating - the seats are too small for taller people. I hate that.

There was no line at check-in counter and people were literally crowding at the counters to get their check-in done. flight departed 15 mins late but arrived on schedule.

We paid double the fare to board ourselves to a later flight in the day due to arriving late at airport. The check-in staff assured us to board us onto the next flight. The price difference is nothing short of predatory pricing. AirAsia insists on an all-in tix plus luggage overweight charges, airport taxes and everything else. Fine, we did as per their recommendation and waited 2 hours to the ""next flight"". But the airline delays an extra 2 hours (this is only a 2 hours flight) and our first day of the vacation is almost over. Do yourself a favor and book Tiger/Scoot next time.

It is absurd that they do not offer Fly Thru service for International flight connections. It is absurd how small the pitch is between seats. It is absurd they will fill up an A320, with no one in the exit rows because that costs extra, and kick a passenger who relocated there during the flight, how many advertisements are in the plane and that after collecting our baggage and passing through customs, simply to catch a connecting flight, the Checkin Agent insisted I pay cash for an outrageous overweight bag fee because he didn't feel like entering my credit card information into the computer. This is 2017, I can pay anyone for lunch with Venmo, but paying a major airline for a fee is difficult? Are you kidding me? It is absurd they woke me up to hand me a meal which I did not order, only to realize that the meal was for someone else, so they took the meal away.  Wifi on plane? Advertised but doesn't work.

Beautiful flight attendants were there greeting me. The plane took off as scheduled. The meal plan I pre-booked is served at a comfortable pace. They were using 2 flight attendants, one is to do everything and another is just to stand there and hand out the food. I have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but I see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. They refused my Chinese money once I ordered a can of coke. I have given them 14RMB, the flight attendant returned me with 2RMB and said it is too old. As a passenger I can't the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket, can I?

A320-200,Premium Economy,3.0,October 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,Bangkok (DMK) to Male,3.0," |  My wife and I just returned from a trip to the Maldives on flights FD 177 and FD 178 (Bangkok – Male) on 26 Oct and 31 Oct and I must say they were the worst flights we have ever experienced. We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldn’t a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for “express handling”. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1 ½ hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority – everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal. So I ask you, would you put up with this type of service when paying premium fares for so-called better service? ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

On the return leg from KUL to SGN, whilst boarding I was pulled out of line, both the old and new passports taken off me (which I eventually demanded back). The staff checking boarding passes was suspicious of anyone handing her a smartphone boarding pass. What's the point of using the AirAsia App if we get dirty looks when using it for storing boarding passes? Anyway, her supervisor contacted his supervisor using WhatsApp then after sending pictures of my passports to him, I was finally allowed to board.  After boarding, the flight attendants serving food want to see your boarding pass, which means if you have it on your phone (and you are sat at a window seat) you have to pass it to be inspected.

At check in my wife was questioned as she was traveling on a Russian passport and even though we live in Singapore and provided evidence the staff still had a long discussion in Malay about whether to check her in. Eventually they did and they gave us our boarding passes. I  asked if we were all sat together and the check in agent clearly said yes. It wasn't until we got to immigration and i was asked to show our boarding passes when i saw they had my 2 year old daughter sat in a different row to my wife and I. This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the  check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels. The staff were not helpful at all in Singapore, it was only when i got onto the plane and spoke to the cabin crew did we find staff who were helpful and then helped us sort out seats together. On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together. I dont understand why Air Asia cause families problems at check in when they can clearly accommodate seats together. Why add extra anxiety and why cause cabin crew or gate staff more problems because the check in staff cant be bothered to help customers? Low cost airlines splitting up families so they can earn extra revenue is being investigated in the UK and the US Senate has stopped airlines splitting families. ",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

On the first occasion I have been lucky enough to get a glass of hot water, on the second attempt I have been asked to buy a bottle, but unless you have MYR with you or a credit card you won't be able to get any water. PA s never stop, On one flight i have counted 25 that drive you crazy, trying to get you to buy any sort of things. You can just notice how they save and make money looking at the aircraft: one of them on the inside was covered with advertisements even on the table and the hand luggage compartment. Emergency doors they have two rows of seats on the immediate left and right of them, the so called 'vip seats' where for an extra 20 dollars you have extra leg space. If you are unlucky to seat on row 11 in front of them, your seat will not recline and if you are tall 1.90m like my husband and someone reclines the seat in front of you, you have no space for your legs.

Multiple calls to support went unanswered. No response after two days to email ticket created through their support website. No response on Twitter. Service desk at CGK was vacant. Let the ads on the carry-on overhead bins be a signal: this is a bus with wings, so expect all the qualities of a bus company, not an airline.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Bali to Mumbai via Kaula Lumpur,1.0," | Bali to Mumbai. My flight supposed to depart at 03.10pm, on 31 March. They allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didn't inform them about the delay. Once the immigration process was completed, then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. Now passengers don't have any option other than waiting. There wasn't any AirAsia executive present at the gate. We also didn't get any vegetarian food at Bali Airport. The airline provided food as it was delayed, but they ordered Non-Vegetarian food only. They should have some common sense that Non-Vegetarian people can eat Vegetarian food, but Vegetarian people cannot eat Non-Vegetarian food. Most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR. That was so pathetic. I wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. The Customer support misguided me. They told me there wasn't any twin seats available in flight so I ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. And actually twin seats were there. This airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 Centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. I will not travel via Air Asia again even if they provide me free tickets. I will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. We should not expect more from it. It is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it. It take off from source and lands at destination. That's all. I hope this review will be valuable for all future travelers.",Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0

My flight supposed to arrive at 23:45, on 31 march they changed it to 12:55am on 1 April and offer a chance to change my flight time within the same date. So I called the customer support and moved it to 10:45am, which took me almost 45 minutes to finish the phone call. It wouldn't bother me until they told me my flight would delay to 14:35 on 30 March. I called to confirm and they told my flight was still the same time. As soon as I arrived KUL airport, I found my flight delayed to 14:35, then I asked them to move my flight to the 12:00 one, they refused my ask cause I didn't change it 48 hours ago according their policy. They changed my flight within 48 hours and ask me to make a change before 48 hours?! The woman in the counter was unwilling to face the sentences stated in the email that If the new flight is inconvenient to you, please contact our Customer Support for either one of the following options: 1. Change your flight to another time/date within 14 calendar days from the original departure date or rquest for a credit account of the value of your booking which is to be redeemed within 90 calendar days from the issuance date for your future travel with us or equest for a full refund of the value of your booking. She said she can call her supervisor but the answer would still be the same. After the call, she said although my supervisor still not agree, I can change your flight. So booking airasia can save a little money but waste time. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Vietnam to Sydney via Malaysia,2.0," | Not even a greeting getting on the plane? First time reviewer. The plethora of reviews surrounding this airline do not lie. To save time, let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. Positives: No delays. Flight arrivals were timely. Unloading was fast. Wifi was available for free. Problems: No staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. Did not have Malaysian currency (coming from Vietnam) and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that I could have a bottle of water! Cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. Decor is most budget I have seen, carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stains/tears in the leather seating is obvious. Staff (not all) lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. The rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight, uncomfortable seating, no in-flight entertainment, no complimentary food/beverages, complimentary wifi was limited, no power supply, etc. This is a classic point A to point B service, which was delivered. However, there is budget flying and then there is Air Asia budget flying. Do not recommend.",Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0

I try to contact AirAsia for a solution, there is no Singapore contact number. I have to use the e-form to contact them. The response from the Customer Service cannot solve my problem because I cannot accept the new flight schedule. I have requested AirAsia customer service to compensate me for cancelling my tour and my outbound flight because I have to cancel my trip to Luang Pabrang due to Air Asia re-scheduling my in-bound flight. The Customer Service Officer told me she cannot assist me because there is no such policy. I ask to speak to her supervisor and she told me she cannot transfer the call. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I was given the option for a full refund if the timing is not right. However I contacted them for the full refund and they never got back to me. I have been frantically trying to contact them via calls, emails, live chat, twitter, facebook since March 1. None of these methods work. There was no reply whatsoever from their customer service. I've tried calling every one of their physical office but none of the numbers work. There is no way to contact them at all.   Seat and aircraft dirty and magazine is never complete.

We caught 4 different flights with air Asia and only 1 ran on time. Delay after delay, said were boarding was at 10.20pm to still not being boarded at 11.15. Booked all my travel with my partner, requested to be seated together. When checking in not sitting together so I had to fork out $100 to choose new seats to sit together, after doing that on our last flight back to Sydney we find out AirAsia have moved our seats again and we are not sitting together.

As what I am expected from AirAsia low-cost airlines, decent service and flight are always present in the whole experience. The time of flight departure is quite accurate. One of the hassle is the flight is getting strict with their 7kg cabin baggage rule. The seat is quite comfy, in comparison with other low-cost airlines. The interior is more vibrant compare to the others. I experienced no turbulence, as what I remember during the flight. Overall, would love to fly with AirAsia again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,February 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Hong Kong to Phuket,1.0," |  Hong Kong to Phuket. I booked the premium flex ticket to get good leg room. I was advised that this type of ticket allowed me to change my flight date at an extra charge.  I needed to change my flight date more than a month before flight date. I tried for days to access my booking on Airasia homepage and when the page finally allowed me to login (I had correct login credentials, the page just didnt work for days) it said I had no booking. Finally I had to call their customer service to have the flight changed instead. At customer support I explained that I needed to change my flight and was told that I had to sit on a standard seat. I asked if it could be solved. They didnt even try to have it sold but just said no. I end up with normal seat instead. I then asked for a refund since I was no longer getting what I paid for. Instead I was asked to pay 1500HKD extra for the change of the flight. I had known about this rule before, but I still asked for compensation due to not getting what I paid for. Also I later found out that if I had booked a new ticket instead of using my return ticket the cost of the new ticket would have been 1700HKD. That is 200HKD more than the fee I had to pay for changing my return ticket, but still several hundred HKD less than what I paid in upgrade for the premium flex ticket I had originally purchased.

I checked in for my flight online and did not see any information about baggage.  I assumed since I was flying international maybe they would not charge for baggage. I am very aware that they are a budget airline but I did not see a place to purchase baggage while checking in or I would have. I think you must have to pay for baggage when you purchase your ticket. Their staff at the Siem Reap International Airport was unprofessional and very unaccommodating, “we are a budget airline” is what they kept telling me when I asked why I was being charged for my check-in luggage.

The service on this airline was fine, I really had no complaints, the flight left on time, the seats were fine for the short flight that it was and the employees at check in and in the airplane were very nice. My only complaint is that due to my age and bad legs, boarding was done having to go down steps from the terminal to the tarmac and then up the stairs to the airplane. Similar situation upon arriving in Denpasar. Not the end of the world, just that those behind me had to suffer with my lack of speed down and up the stairs.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
