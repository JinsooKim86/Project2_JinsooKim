       "'   san francisco to guangzhou return via wuhan. none of the cabin crew spoke or understood english very well. ordering beverages were often accomplished with pointing and hand gestures as asking did not work. i was often handed the wrong item if i attempted to verbally ask. on our long 16 hour flight with a connection in wuhan there appeared to be no relief for the cabin crew. due to the flight times i tried to stay up the entire flight and saw the same faces the entire time. there was no crew change even with the stop in wuh. this lack of relief and long work hours may have explained the curt service provided. i truly felt sorry for the crew. announcements were often made in mandarin with a very brief broken english version afterwards. this often left us english speakers confused as to what was happening. after my friends knee was rammed with the service cart there was no immediate recognition by crew that something had occurred. until we called her attention did she stop and look back realizing the minor injury then apologized. no snack service in between meals. there were no nuts chips cookies fruits or sandwiches available in the galley in between meal service. we finally had a snack on the short leg between wuhan to guangzhou. the seats in economy were fairly tight and uncomfortable. the aircraft wasnt that old but the seats were well worn. i could feel the padding had worn out leaving me sitting on what felt like metal bars underneath. the aisles were very narrow often leading to bumped arms and legs from either crew or passengers walking by. the meals for the most part were edible and served warm . unlike other airlines they do not offer a printed menu so i had no idea what some of the items were even after eating it. the passenger next to me was vegetarian but either didnt preorder the meal or it wasnt available to him. he didnt eat the entire 16 hour flight as no alternatives were offered to him. dealing with staff on ticketing issues is very difficult. the agents answering phones often had thick accents and had a hard time understanding me. the emails received were also fairly broken and hard to understand. when one calls during daylight hours in the us calls are forwarded to china where they have an overnight crew. once business hours end in the us you have to call long distance to china. however they have more staff to assist you then. if it wasnt for the low airfare offered i would fly with cathay pacific or singapore for similar routes. after this flight i dont think i can recommend this to anyone or fly with them again. even legacy us carriers offer something better than what i experienced here.    osaka to shanghai pudong. i had been looking forward to this my first flight on china southern. the aircraft was clean and the flight departed on time and arrived only a few minutes behind schedule. the food was ok but the beverage service was a little disappointing with no beer wine or soft drinks being provided on this midday twohour international flight only bottled water and tea were offered. also the flight attendants were not particularly welcoming or friendly. i was a little disappointed with this flight but i would not rule out flying china southern again if the opportunity arises.    melbourne to guangzhou return. seat pitch was amazing. flight to guangzhou i got a front row seat. so spacious loved it. flight back to melbourne was on aisle seat with empty seat next to me great legroom. aircraft were clean great lighting. seat headrest of the seats not comfy enough. food was the highlight  dinner back to mel had fish rice and lotus. one of the best airplane meals ever. cabin service the let down. english still not up to standard spoke way too fast and unclear on the intercom.  prearrival procedures always were done too early suspending bathroom usage electronics usage was annoying. seatbelt signs frequently flicked onoff. turbulence were too frequent.     paris to phnom penh via guangzhou.  if you are tall 1.9m and above forget to sit confortably you will touch the rear of the front seat which for a flight of 12 hours is unacceptable. service is basic. they come with an initial drink after takeoff and distribute meal right away. within 30 they come and remove the food. after that one cabin crew member is only available at the kitchen at the back of the plane. if you want water or a sandwich you need to go and get it. beware the water you have in your glass may be warm and not cold. the hostesses are friendly but do shy. the entertainment system is basic with few movies in english or french. most movies are in mandarin.    yesterday i experienced an awful flight from singapore to guangzhou with china southern airlines. the flight attendant attitude in economy class was badï¼without smile and patience for our requests. i didnt eat anything due to the food and i asked one of the flight attendant to give me some bags of peanuts. she replied that they dont have any. my personal feeling is that her attitude is bad. i gave her a bottle of protain power and told her to put some hot water just little cool water and then mix it. several minutes later she gave back the bottle to me which the water is not hot so that the powder was stuck not mixed.     checked in at rome and consigned bags thru to auckland. just before arriving in wuhan the cabin staff informed us we were to leave the plane in wuhan as we werent booked any further. came as a shock as we had our tickets through to guangzhou and onto  auckland and there hadnt been anything mentioned when we checked in at rome. we were taken thru immigration and yelled at because we didnt have a visa not surprising as we didnt intend to enter china as only transit. we then had to collect our luggage which we were rather surprised to see as it was consigned thru to auckland from rome. then had to run following a staff member who didnt speak english from building to building at the airport dragging our cases  no mean feat when you are seniors with heart problems. we then spent 11 hours in wuhan before being put on a flight to guangzhou with another airline. when i got home i contacted china southern and after three weeks i got a phone call with no apology blaming everyone but china southern.     auckland to amsterdam via guangzhou. great start to the trip. auckland to guangzhou the service and food were excellent. spent 7.5 hours sitting in lounge in guangzhou then boarded for amsterdam. it was as though we had boarded a different airline. service was inferior. we gave our dinner order and requested they woke us if we dozed off before it arrived. must have dozed off as it never arrived the only food we received was very rubbery inedible eggs and toast we couldnt cut with the knife. very disappointing for first class. little did we know the return trip rome to auckland via wuhan and guangzhou was going to be oo much more stressful travelled twice in 4 months with family of 4 from sydlhr return due to sick relatives. chose china southern purely on cost. terrible both times never again staff surly and unhelpful. very poor english spoken in economy class service. inflight entertainment sydguangzhou  no individual screens. very poor choice of non asian movies on chinauk legs. food inedible practically thrown at passengers often no choice available. service very brusque collected trays a few minutes after giving them out. even beverages were awful  soft drinks from large bottles warm and no ice available. very little alcohol tiny glass of wine. flight from syd guangzhou arrives very early morning in china around 6 am. terminal very cold with rats running around under the seats toilets very dirty and smelt. very difficult to find out how much in advance for additional bag. we travelled from vancouver canada to hanoi vietnam and back from phnom penh cambodia to vancouver in januaryfebruary 2013 both in transit through guangzhou. the portions to and from vietnamcambodia from guangzhou werent too bad but the flights from guangzhou fromto vancouver bc were terrible just like the previous poster mary martin said to and from syd. the attitude of the air hostesses on these routes have to be improved they practically threw the food tray at passengers. round trip melbourne  guangzhou  melbourne. leg room is good. however service is bad. the airplane equipped with some big screen tv not individual lcd like other airlines with no sound and you have no choice but to watch their chosen programs. however on my trips the tv was not working. when we complained to stewardess she acknowledged the problem but did nothing to fix it. not even an apology. no music channels provided. on the food front if you are asian then you will get either rice or noodle automatically unless you complain and request western food. it also the only airline serves beverages that are not chilled. even beer is warm. i dont think ill fly with them again. guangzhou to chengdu. plane delayed 7 hours and cabin crew did not do anything about it. no apologies we only got a bottle of water and some biscuits. communication was very bad. cabin crew only spoke chinese and we therefore did not know what was going on and after asking them they could not help us. plane was very old and there was very little leg space. zhengzhou to bangkok via guangzhou on 28052013. no whiskey only red and white wine. no food. chicken mentioned in the menu but no chicken. first i was told that there is no fish also but it suddenly appeared after i made a noise. i asked for a complaint form. nothing happened for some time. then the captain arrives and sits next to me with a sheet of paper saying that i could mention the problem and he would translate into chinese. i said no and that i would fill it in myself. after some time a red coloured printed sheet was brought out. cannot understand a word of what is said in english. travelled in economy class from delhi to los angeles on 24th. may2013 by cz3028cz328. indian vegetarian meals provided did not include bread and one had to ask for it though butter was part of meal. there was no choice of alcohol. further though i had booked seats 2 months in advance i was not given a choice of seats. there should be some consideration for senior citizens. i had asked for a wheelchair for my wife but was not provided for transfer at guangzhou airport. further there was no elevator for passengers arriving by cz3028 from delhi to climb to 1st floor. flew last month from dubai to manila via guangzhou return. amongst all other airlines flying from dubai to manila china southern airlines offered the cheapest ticket at that time. flight attendants were like robots. its as if they were not interested or happy with what they were doing. some were a bit rude. they were always in a hurry to serve food. the blanket offered to us on our flight from dubai to guangzhou was not sealed in plastic i felt it was the same blanket that was used by the passengers from the previous flight. overall you get what you pay for. cheap ticket equals cheap and substandard service. i will never fly with this airline again unless i really have no choice. sydney to amsterdam via guangzhou. almost 800 dollars cheaper than the nearest competitor so cant complain on price. new ptvs were a nice surprise as i had been told there were going to be none. food ok. seat on the a330300 had plenty of leg room so good for me as im 65. a330200 leg room not as good but the same as most other airlines. two biggest takeaways were poor english language skills from flight attendants and being served a glass of black tea with no milk. strange. but they were on time got me there safely and werent all that bad for the price. would go again if was significantly cheaper but not my preferred airline. my husband and i flew perth to shanghai in march 2013. trip up was fine but coming home the flight was delayed from shanghai for 2 hours. when we finally boarded we sat on the tarmac and when they brought the food carts out we realised we were not going anywhere in a hurry. we finally took off only to arrive in guangzhou 5 minutes before our connecting flight to perth was due to depart. china southern sent us to a hotel for 2 days. when we finally left for perth we were on a flight that had 45 empty seats in front of us and they would not let us move to be able to have more room. beware they may be cheap but you get what you pay for 28 jun 13 guangzhou to jinan. supposed to board 2 hours after my touchdown from sin flight. nightmare began during my transit where the takeoff from guangzhou to jinan was delayed for an indefinite time. this occurred after i boarded the aircraft when the pilot announced over the pa system of the delay. there was no confirmation of the next flight except that they said it should depart at least 3 hrs later. not only was our flight was affected all china southern airlines outbound were delayed with their explanation as airspace congestion. fortunately we departed 1.5hrs later. i think my return flight from jinan to guangzhou will also be delayed. first and last time taking china southern airlines. cz 322 melbourne to guangzhou  london 23613. never again. on boarding only chinese morning newspaper available. asked for whiskey or other spirit. told there were no spirits. they gave me a beer finally. it was a warm beer with a glass of ice to accompany. wife asked for coffee. it was colder than the beer. when she asked for sugar they did not have any on the carry tray. entertainment was about 6 movies and 6 tv shows. no music channel. the cabin crew could not speak english despite leaving from melbourne. very disappointed. af 1089 bucharest to paris 26062013 at 7.20am. cz 0348 paris to guangzhou 26062013 at 12.25pm cz 0301 guangzhou to sydney 27062013 at 8.20am. i am traveling from australia to europe at least 3 times a year. i am due to fly back to oz next week. my feedback so far guangzhou airport is worse than some local airports in small cities in europe. must be improved fast if you want to make it an international hub. inflight entertainment is very poor. needs improvement immediately. improve customer service onboard. flight attendants must learn english the food is substandard. we waited for one hour on the plane on the tarmac for some paper work without the air con on i will give them one more chance. boeing 737700 ashgabat to urumqi seats are dirty no inflight entertainment staff speak poor english and dont want to reply when you asked something. urumqi to beijing was boeing 777200 same story about staff who does not want to speak english and same poor quality food and dirty seats. premium economy return to paris transferred at guangzhou. this is not premium economy compared to other airlines. other than priority check in and boarding the seats food service entertainment was identical to economy. as soon as the seat belt lights went off a number of passengers walked into premium and sat down not to be moved. the food was almost inedible and wine undrinkable. personal entertainment systems were ok but only present for 34 legs. the other leg had a shared screen which played half an english language film then two chinese films whose subtitles could not be read. seats barely reclined and loud passenger announcements came frequently and spuriously such that sleeping was near impossible. there was very little english spoken and a general reluctance of staff to assist or provide any service above the mandatory meal services. this was my first and last trip on csa. the costs saving were outweighed by the dreadful experience. have just returned from aucklandlondonauckland trip with this airline. first and definitely last time. seated beside toilet on all 4 long long legs of the two trips. constantly knocked by passing staff and queuing passengers. disgusting food and how could they run out of choice by only row 41 staff have a lot to learn about customer service. seats have adequate leg room but are hard and very narrow with no space for long arms and broad shoulders. sitting next to a large fellow passenger is intolerably uncomfortable. delays poor information unintelligible cabin announcements. guangzhou airport badly needs to sharpen up its act  it is dingy with filthy carpets and equally unpleasant toilets. ludicrously expensive coffee in the only cafe open in the early hours of the morning. never never again  ill stick to going through hong kong. sydney to amsterdam stopping in guangzhou. every stage of our trip resulted in issues  from booking they changed our itinerary prior to departure. once flying food quality and choice dreadful staff cannot speak english and dont want to answer your questions. we missed 4 connections in total none our fault and trust me on the ground in china with unexpected flight delays is the last place you want to be. disorganised unprofessional unpleasant. never again. flew between vancouver and guangzhou and was very disappointed at the quality of the food provided. the food on the flight to guangzhou was the worst i have had on an airline. in addition very little entertainment was provided to help me kill time over this 12 hour flight. there were only 6 channels of videos. most were chinese films with subtitles but the screens were too small for the subtitles to be readable. on the return flight we were delayed several hours leaving guangzhou but staff didnt explain why. they simply said bad weather although we could see many other planes leaving the airport for north america. i fly a lot and dont expect to be pampered when i fly economy class but this was way below par. 4 flights in total to sydney and back. the food was poor quality. of the 8 meals we were offered there was no choice with 4 of them. we were no offered water through the return 2 flights from sydney. cabin entertainment and information was very limited. back seat screens were not working on 2 of the flights. not recommended as there was a 6hour delay with my flight from guangzhou to singapore and there was no official announcements from the airline even at the last minute. just kept waiting at the airport without any food or drink provided without any further information. the food on board tasted poor and airline staff onboard spoke very poor english. the inflight screen showing films during the trip was extremely small and there were no headphones provided. i could not hear the audio of the film and the subtitles are too small and cannot be seen. my worst flying experience. flew from sgncanxiy and all flights were disappointing at best. poor service terrible food old and uncomfortable aircraft. i had to constantly remind staff and argue to get my skyteam elite plus privileges their lounges are terrible with instant noodles and the like on offer. no inflight entertainment to speak of  even their inflight magazine is exclusively in chinese. i would never chose to fly china southern again. awful. i was booked to fly sydney to amsterdam last month via guangzhou and beijing with admittedly tight connections but travel.com who i booked through assured me they would be ok so imagine my concerns when i arrived at sydney airport to find the first leg was already delayed by one hour which in turn resulted in my missing the guangzhou to beijing beijing to amsterdam and amsterdam to birmingham connections the latter id booked through klm. the most frustrating part of this whole saga was finding someone at guangzhou and beijing airports who could speak proper english and explain to me what was happening they put me and a few others up in a hotel in beijing and collected us at 6am the following morning. then had to hang about for a few hours to see if i could be transferred to a klm flight leaving later that morning what a relief when i got a seat on that plane and all the flight attendants spoke english and with a smile i missed my connection to birmingham and had to pay again and eventually arrived in birmingham some 12 hours late. the biggest problem i found was the lack of english spoken which surprised me but the service generally on all china southern flights was poor with hardly a smile from anyone plus the food was very ordinary beer and white wine came warm the entertainment unit was not working on the first leg and although available on the next leg was nearly all chinese. flight information was non existent and we were never told what the local time was as we arrived at each airport. arrive from london into melbourne on 17th first leg from london to china ok 787 seats ok but nothing great. flight from china to melbourne male staff members were rude wouldnt give choice on food just put it on your table when asked what choices there were were told that is it. the female attendants took over and supplied the different choices. the toilets were a disgrace soap had run out and not kept clean. we have travelled on different chinese airlines many times but this last leg of the china southern flight to melbourne was the worst. vancouver to guangzhou was unacceptable. no entertainment on a 12 hour flight. the food was horrible. the staff had poor english skills and they woke me up during drinks. the value for money was a waste. the seats were uncomfortable. i will never fly china southern again. we recently returned from the long haul flight from australia to london on china southern. overall i would recommend china southern to others but it would not go without a warning about the customer service. at times it may just be a message lost in translation but i got the impression the staff did not enjoy serving patrons and were quite unfriendly especially to english speaking persons. often felt that i was putting the staff out if i asked for a drink or something. we flew vancouver to guangzhou and then to kathmandu. the first leg was an old plane. our overhead lights wouldnt turn off. the video on the seat in front had only one english language film and the picture quality was poor. service was nothing to write home about nor was the food. we left 2.5 hours late which meant a rushed transfer in guangzhou. the second flight to kathmandu was better on time and a newer plane. however several passengers including us had to wait a nervous day for our luggage to arrive on the next flight. luckily it did but could have been a real hassle as we had travel plans in nepal the day after the luggage arrived. yes the fares are cheap but i dont think i would use this airline again. i forgot to mention the lack of legroom for anyone taller than 4 feet. guangzhouamsterdam schipol. when it came time for aperitifs to be served i asked for a tonic gin as usual which was refused as they do not offer this. nothing was served with the drink. i asked then for red wine as aperitif. it was served half a cup of wine. about 50 minutes later the meal was miserably served. about 30 minutes after the food the dinner drinks came. breakfast before arrival at amsterdam composed of again chicken noodles. later some kind of bread but nothing to put in it not even a small packet of cheap butter. during the night service nothing but water no coffee available. it has been the worst flight i had with a disgusting service. pvgtpe route. plane was an a321 and looked pretty old. ive never taken a long haul flight with them but the short routes are always the same  not a lot of room between seats poor meal crew dont smile very often and the worst thing  my flight was delayed in 1.5 hours and no announcement was given. the only reason i use this airline is their membership in skyteam. china southern airlines are a joke left us waiting for 12 hours with no explanation at paris cdg airport. when we asked what was happening at the departure lounge counter the excuses changed by the hour. first it was the fog then 5 hours later it was that the flight crew couldnt work past the original shift time then the plane had to be cleaned then hours and hours later when we were sitting on the plane ready for take off we were told we were waiting on documents. we got to cdg at 8am ready for our midday flight and didnt lift off till after 11pm. not one announcement to us as to what was happening. we could have has a day in paris instead of being held hostage in the most remote airport lounge starved of information. meal voucher received one. the most appalling treatment at guangzhou stop over  told we were on another delayed flight. only because i made a fuss and refused to have my flight changed did we get on the connecting flight that had. already been delayed not to mention the original connecting flight that as missed. unprofessional rude and treated like cattle. china southern airlines are not an international airline by any stretch of the imagination kllax thru guangzhou last week. i should have listened to the review i read. hands down the worst airline i travelled so far  worse than low cost airlines. the cabin staff cannot speak english food like other reviewer described is terrible and the seat cramped and very hard. we travelled on an organized tour from vancouver to guangzhou and on to saigon. the tour had an all inclusive price hence we dont know how much the actual airfare would have been. the incoming flight into vancouver was 2 hours delayed which resulted in a 3 hours late departure to guangzhou. we had a stopover of 5 hours in guangzhou before our flight to saigon. however with the 3 hour delayed departure ex vancouver the stopover was cut to 2 hours. as it turned out it was a blessing in disguise since one cup of coffee at the guangzhou airport was an astonishing us 13. as to our flight we can only say never ever again will we be flying china southern. asking for red wine with our meal we were given the equivalent of a thimble full when asking for a refill we were told that no more wine was available. the crew were outright rude. the food was edible but thats about it. as i said never ever again will we be traveling on china southern. guangzhou  paris booked as part of air france return from canman. awful service terrible food served wrong food twice plus breakfast inedible. lots of cabin crew milling around they then all disappeared for about 9 hours. only saving grace was flatbed was fairly comfortable. it has to be said that the cz lounge at guangzhou is bad  either showers are working and there are no towels or there are towels but showers are not working i do this route a couple of times a year for work will ensure in future that i only fly on af operated flights  the cz and flybe codeshare partners are horrific smallest airline seats horrible food impossible to contact or get any satisfaction from. flew to vancouver from sydney 29 hours. had to upgrade on one flight as i simply could not fit my legs into the small space without jamming them into the seat in front. dreading the return journey to sydney and trying to get a seat with more leg room but most unsatisfactory. where is the customer service comfort and pleasant experience  a thing of the past im afraid. recently flew amscan and canlhr in economy. the flight on an a330 from ams to can was reasonably comfortable but trying to get an allocated seat in advance was impossible. china southerns office in holland couldnt help either the return to london on a new 787 was not as good. the seats were more cramped and i ended up sitting close to the toilets which have a new type of door design which means the doors actually slam shut 12 hours of listening to all that noise was not enjoyable. the food was also poor and they ran out of choices and offered a vegetarian meal which was awful drinks were also a joke with no diet coke and only a poor selection of wine and only half a glass ever offered new delhi to qiqihar china via guangzhou. the service was horrible and staff appeared to be impatient and hostile at times. on the first leg of the journey the request for a coffee from a copassenger was met with a cold stare from the air hostess. no inflight entertainment whatsoever the food was just bearable. the second leg of the journey from guangzhou to qiqihar was unimaginable. throughout the journey the flight attendants kept a stern face no smile at all and appeared to be either bored or uninterested in serving passengers. blankets were provided only to a few probably on firstcomefirstserve basis. when the food was being served they gave me a chicken meal and i asked whether they could replace it with a vegetarian meal instead. the attendant said they could give me a veg meal and asked me to wait. finally when all the passengers finished their meals the attendant brought me my veg meal and halfheartedly apologized for keeping me waiting since he was very busy i had to return my meal uneaten. simply terrible from checkin at melbourne airport through to paris and return. the onboard crew displayed very little customer service and the food was terrible. it seemed to be quite a task to find two seats together for a couple who booked the flight together we did get adjoining seats but they did make it seem like a big deal. for the guangzhou to paris leg i contacted china southern to try to ensure we could get seats together however even in their head office i wasnt able to speak to anyone in english  being an international airline i stupidly thought they may have someone around that could speak english. on the return leg from paris they couldnt find our booking. they saw our tickets and verified that our tickets were showing the correct details of the flight however they could not find them. we made the flight with but some difficulty. on the return flight we took our own food to eat due to our previous experience. business class on a330 to paris and this was truly quite poor. i heard that air china is to be dropped to 3 star airline and guess china southern may be following them soon meals poorly served wine choice a joke and the product is now really poor. its like they have no money to look after biz customers any more. staff languages were poor unless you speak mandarin i flew with cz 3018 in late nov the service was very poor cabin crew never smiled no patience shown to passengers. the tone they spoke to passengers whom were a tour group was amazingly rude. compared to the service i experienced 3 years ago from singapore to guangzhou. there is a significant drop. travelled from london to china then china to auckland on 261213 both flights were on the dreamliner. we were traveling with our children 1 and 3 yrs old we booked these flights 4 months ago and seats. when we boarded the plane we were given seats in the middle of the plane  rows 34 we were meant to be in row 31 as thats where families with babies go as you can put bassinet onto wall there. instead there were two men sitting in those seats i asked stewardess why we werent in those seats and she said she would look into it. my partner had to hold our 1 yr old all the way to nz cheap but will never fly with them again. new planes however none of the staff speak english they only serve warm beer or cold red wine. they dont serve diet coke coke zero or mineral water. they left us on the tarmac for 2.5 hours without any explanation of the delay or what was happening. going via china from australia to la added an extra 8 hours to the trip and the cost of a coffee at the chinese international airport was 23aud. flew from vancouver to singapore with stopover in guangzhou and return. i will never fly this airline again. maybe it was a language barrier but i certainly felt my family and i as well as nonchinese passengers did not received the same pleasant service as chinese passengers. food and drink service seemed very random and disorganized. they often skipped passengers when offering beverages and the flight attendants seemed to be bumping into one another while serving. food wasnt the best but i cant complain as its economy airline food. plane was old and outdated. tv screen was grainy and the complimentary headsets did not work. i wasnt aware that airplane mode on a cell phone was prohibited i complied however they should have enforced all other passengers with this rule as i had counted 5 other passengers breaking this rule in plain sight of the flight attendants. we only had an hour stopover in guangzhou to reach our connecting flight however missed it as the flight was delayed and as we disembarked from the plane onto the tarmac and had to wait 10 minutes for a shuttle to take us to a different terminal. there wasnt any priority for those that were connecting the three things that were positive was that we arrived at out destination they did not lose our luggage and i was pleased with the airline with the hotel arrangement during our missed flight in guangzhou. im a gold member for the china southern airline sky pearl club and i always thought that it was one of the most highly rate airlines in china especially in the last couple of years. unfortunately my recent experience on flight cz3460 from yunnan to shenzhen on november 30 2013 has completely changed my perception. there was a 6hour flight delay due to undesirable weather conditions in kunming yunnan. the flight was able to take off later that afternoon but were astounded by the incident that happened after the flight landed at 7.05pm at the new shenzhen airport. as passengers were disembarking the plane to board an airport bus transfer back to the main terminal we were asked to board a bus that had no driver. flight crews boarded their own coach and left all other passengers standing beside the plane for 20 minutes we were left waiting. we do understand that the new shenzhen airport only days after its official opening were not functioning in perfect order. thus explained the missing driver furthermore its irresponsible for the china southern crews to just leave all passengers unattended on the ground. cdg air france  canbkkcanlhr. by jointly selling their flights with air france china southern has fully demonstrated just how below average their service actually is. cz seriously needs to reconsider their service on their shorter sectors canbkkcan. the language skill for their cabin staff on these sectors were laughable. food is virtually inedible. drinks served warm only red or white wine and on the return flight  a male flight attendant simply handed out meals without asking what the passenger would like despite there being choices of chicken or fish. transit in guangzhou is efficient however the quality of ground staff seriously needs addressing. i had a slight issue with my booking when checking in at cdg and was strongly advised to check with customer service once landed in can. at the counter the staff simply wrote down the phone number of the call centre and was told to go away. the long flight 787 was comfortable and food marginally better than shorter flights. however still relatively poor in quality compared with other asian or european airlines flying a comparable route. the command of english was also marginally better but still not great. no communication whatsoever from the flight crew for any of the flights despite delays stacking and turbulent flights. just returned from new zealand via guangzhou. aircraft great service very poor. not enough supplies ie drinks food etc. ran out of soft drinks wine beer half way through first service on all four legs. left with only choice of water or orange juice. china southern changed my flights twice. travellers lose peace of mind when this happens too often. onboard the touch function on the entertainment screen did not work so no music or tv. airline staff customer care skills major weak point. cabin crew show a very low level of courtesy and customer care skills. new aircraft with thirdworld service. female cabin crew rush past calling out arrival cards they dont look at passengers so i had to call her back. some flight options are cheap if the low service is acceptable make your choice. i will pay more for basic service in future. eat the cooked meal at your own risk  fruit and salad were good. my husband and i flew from london to ho chi minh city via guangzhou and hanoi to london via guangzhou. flight from london to guangzhou was on the new dreamliner which was very nice and inflight entertainment was good food was good and we slept most of the way as it was a night flight. then had a 2 hour stopover in guangzhou as it was new years eve decided to have a few beers in the airport this cost around 5 each but there was limited options to do anything else. flight from guangzhou to ho chi minh city was ok food was not good and the drink selection poor. our return flight from hanoi to guangzhou was nice it was a smallish plane with 2x2 seats on each side and the food was good. when we arrived in guangzhou we had a 19 hour stopover and hoped to explore guangzhou however the transit hotel we were given was a 40 minute drive from the airport. dropped back at baiyun airport 2.5 hours before our flight so were hanging around for a long time and the airport is very expensive. the flight back from guangzhou to london left at 9.30am and i would say this was the worst of all the china southern flights we had. an hour into the flight the stewards came round with drinks however the selection is limited my husband is a diabetic so cannot drink coca cola or other sugary fizzy drinks they had no diet drinks so the only options were tea or water. they did not have any alcoholic drinks. we were given a meal after the drinks were served and it was a choice of chicken or beef i had chicken with rice the chicken tasted awful. after the meal we were left to relax and watch movies there wasnt a great selection but enough to keep you going for 11 hours. the second meal was actually quite nice although i would have eaten anything at that point. i feel it is unacceptable to feed people twice on an 11.5 hour day flight on other airlines they usually provide a small sandwich or something in the middle and offer more drinks. overall my experience just proves you get what you pay for and i have decided i am only flying direct from now onwards. melcanmadcdgcanmel december 2013january 2014. decided to give it another go however no major changes. on the positive side departed and arrived on time entertainment system good and it was the cheapest fare available at the time. on the negative side no online checkin food very plain and with strange combinations drinks are always hot and have to request ice the english language is lacking. if it was not for the cheap fare we would not fly with them. we feel sorry for the passengers that pay for air france service and instead get china southern service due to the code sharing. the english version of their website is complicated. somewhat a lottery. then when it comes to a form where i have to specify whether to book as a member or nonmember if i select nonmember i will have to enter my mobile number. however it seems that the entry is programmed only for chinese mobile numbers. i tried various formats all failed. the entries arent flexible for international use. i couldnt get through just by filling in the form. due to the locations in china i have been traveling to i have no other choice than csa. during those bookings online payment failure has frequently occurred. i can try ten times in a row and fail ten times. getting through until successful payment with csa online in the english version is like winning a lottery. although serving an international flight the crews on board barely speak a word of english. the english announcement heard through the loudspeaker on board requires high intelligence to understand. i saw fellow passengers playing with their mobile phones and crew saw them but said nothing. but when i did the same i was required to turn off mine. it wasnt during take off or landing. i tried to explain that i have set my mobile phone to airplane mode on. however no matter how hard i tried to explain the stewardess didnt accept it. would i recommend csa yes but only if you dont have any other option for your destination. just returned from a trip oz  guangzhou plus an internal flight. the planes a380 and a320 were very satisfactory being modern and adequately comfortable albeit with minimal seat and aisle sizes. every flight seemed full. i would strongly recommend a homepacked picnic basket for self catering on board including a screw top bottle of wine from the duty free shop airside. i considered the food served minimalist unpalatable and easily bypassed. the cabin attendants are well below international standard. could even learn from lufthansa and klm if csa were the most convenient and best value option i would travel again with them but follow my own advice above. on 31213 we checked in at lhr for flight cz304 and were kept waiting 1.5 hrs for someone to bring a wheelchair  it never arrived so my partner had to push me through to the aircraft. on arrival at guangzhou the plane off loaded via steps to the tarmac. however as there was no lift available and only two small framed men who thought they were going carry me i had no choice but to negotiate the steps and i then i had to climb very steep steps onto the waiting bus. the return journey on 16114 from melbourne flight cz322 to guangzhou. this time the aircraft went to the terminal and a young lady waited for me with a wheelchair only to push me around the corner to yet another flight of stairs after much ado a young man came and pushed about 2 miles and then onto a bus to passport control this had taken approximately 1.5 hours. moscow to sanya and back. flight to sanya with one change and stop was ok though food and inflight service is quite poor. return to moscow was horrible. flight from sanya to guangzhou was delayed 2 hrs so we missed our plane to moscow from guangzhou. ground service of the airline was very bad. they were slow and spoke poor english. we spent almost 3 hrs after arrival to rebook our tickets collect luggage and wait for the hotel transfer. flight cz6001 was very difficult. after checkin the whole flight was taken for a security check 20 min before boarding you go for the check wait get a card in addition to a boarding pass wait in another zone then go downstairs to a bus collect the card then almost 30 minutes on a bus to the plane. stop in urumqi for passport control you leave the plane wait in line for passport control go to wait for the boarding back then take off. they feed you just twice  once between canurc and then once between urcmow. cgkcanyvrcancgk christmas 2013. best price by far. if you dont care about inflight entertainment food drinks or service  but love saving that 1000 then just be ready. my partner and i prepared our fullyloaded and poweredup tablets two foot long subs each plus copious snacks a bottle of wine and a six pack all bought inside the secure zone. china southern does provide you a hotel  we had two 23hour layovers  but you are way out of the city. we splurged and spent one night at a hotel closer to the uberurban city center and it was worth it. the plane was safe we were on schedule  efficient checkin. a sturdy airline i would fly again if time and comfort are again not the issue. travelled london to bangkok and back from manila both via guangzhou. out of the 4 flights the staff on 3 of them were very poor and in cases extremely rude. on one flight a stewards jacket was over the back of my seat i took it off so not to lay back and crease it asked a member of staff to take it who with a slight grumble literally snatched it out of my hand. as i was sat at the very back of one flight on take off i turned round to notice one staff member slumped in her take off seat asleep. these new dreamliners they use have terribly uncomfortable seats i didnt want to sit in them for 2 hours never mind 13hrs. i found i got a lot more space and nicer seating on the 2 short haul connection flights which used older aircraft. they were the cheapest though and had the route we wanted so would use them again but only if the price and route was right though. flew from vancouver to delhi bumped in guangzhou. no explanation. return trip 3 weeks later. food was poor special diets were not observed hindu given beef celiac given wheat noodles staff indifferent and were not visible for hours at a time. bathrooms smelt no inflight entertainment paid or otherwise asked to upgrade not possible small seats with only slight recline booked months ago but were seated apart staff had poor english skills. the longest stretch was 13.5 hours. enroute to delhi from vancouver a six hour delay in canton. crew had no english to answer passenger questions deal with customs paperwork etc. no entertainment on 13 hr flight. headed home stranded overnight in delhi with 12hr delay expected to share room at hotel with stranger or pay 50 of cost. our flight to china from vancouver was far below an acceptable level. the televisions didnt work staff were less than helpful and not once did they come around to collect trash. passengers were congregating in the back of the plane asking for water and other beverages while staff sat eating their lunch and snacks. we understand that they are entitled to breaks but they were hardly visible in the cabin other than to deliver meals. although our flight home was on a new plane and staff were much more accommodating we were unable to do online check in and were told that our seats were preselected for us. my husband and i were seated at least six rows apart. the flight from vancouver to guangzhou was terrible tight cramped seats in a less than clean plane. washrooms were smelly and poorly maintained. service was minimal had to go to the back of the plane where staff were socializing to request a beverage. the return flight was on their new dreamliner which was clean however seating was small and very cramped. we had booked these flights months in advance but there was no option to book seats and were forced to sit apart outbound flight 0304 on 23314 and return flight 0303 on 3514. the flight was on time and was safely completed. thats the basics after all. service was minimal and the cabin crew spent most of the flight chatting amongst themselves at the back of the plane. they came round twice each with drinks and food in the course of a thirteen hour flight. the food was right on the line as regards quality and quantity with very limited choice. the seat seemed to be the minimum size and was quite hard. the secondworst seat i have experienced as regards comfort. the charge for any excess baggage was 100 which i ended up paying on the return flight. not impressed and will try to fly some other airline in future  maybe fly to hong kong and take a train into china. flew auckland to guangzhou and return in the past week. the inflight service was terrible on the way back to new zealand and services were carried out without a single smile from any of the cabin crew. all the cabin crew had minimal english and were abrupt and inclined to give passengers any meal or drink irrespective of what was requested. they made assumptions that just because we spoke english we would therefore have an english meal. a smile would go a long way. snacks were seen down in the kitchen area of the plane but we did not once have any of this offered. hygiene standards questionable. when i went down to the back of the plane for a stretch and to ask for a glass of water i was ignored. another hostess on her return trip back to that area answered my request once i caught her eye but all done without any eye contact or smile or any verbal exchange. would not fly this airline again. for an international airline one would expect a better level of english language. at the end of the flight only one cabin crew in sight at the aircraft door and she was busy doing things so even if one wished to say thank you there was no one to say it to. flew sydney  guangzhou  bangkok  guangzhou  sydney in junejuly 2014. the aircraft on sydney  guangzhou  sydney was almost brand new with excellent inflight entertainment. the food though was not just terrible it was offensive. on return leg to sydney i ended up with munching on cupanoodle soup and chocolates purchased in bkk following my experience with inflight meal on my leg to guangzhou. there are no snacks on the plane. when asked for a snack the stewardess offered me a bread roll from someone elses meal. the staff are extremely rude and ineffective with very basic english skills. they gather at the galley to have a cosy chitchat and if interrupted you are offered an evil look and then they pretend not to understand your request. the beverages you are lucky if you get flat coke and a quarter of a cup of wine which i believe is limited to a bottle per flight or so i was told by the crew. i certainly wouldnt rate this airline as fool service airline. its a budget carrier with an urgent need for staff training. my trip canbkkcan was even worse because the airplane looked and felt like a first generation of jets with the added benefits of meals literally offensive to both look and smell and served by rude staff. of course a note on online check in. if someone has any success to solve this constantly crushing puzzle please provide instructions in your review for others to use. to be honest the tickets were very cheap though. yet its not the case of you get what you pay for. flew dlcpek and then pekams both in business. this was a mistake. the aircraft are dirty. both not picked up or even vacuumed. everything trays seat backs needs to be washed. the food particularly on the long haul was a bowl of rice dumped upside down onto a plate a few steamed vegetables and fried little bits of something i was told was fish. the ife was minimalist. amazing that new releases and hollywoodeurope were the same 8 movies. the seats are ok. lie flat but i felt like i was on a park bench. with little padding. i am writing this review in the terminal for a flight from guangzhou to shanghai. initially the flight was delayed for an hour without any reason given. we boarded the plane and then disembarked back into the terminal 20 minutes later. still no reason was given. so now all the passengers of flight cz3547 china southern airlines are sitting in the terminal with no idea if this flight will ever leave. for my first flight with this company it has been appalling and i would definitely not recommend it to anyone. cz348 july 19th. cz347 july 27th. i flew guangzhouparis and back in july 2014 economy class. on both flights the ife havent been working to half of the passengers the food was horrible with the exception of one steward nobody spoke english and nobody was able to help with the broken ife. i apologize to lufthansa and air france for all my previous criticisms. kixcan with airbus 320 and canakl with b787 dreamliner both on economy class. there was no individual entertainment screen for the first leg from osaka to guangzhou. i was so bored during the 4 hour flight. the food was incredibly bad. the second leg on a b787 was a little better. b787 is a wonderful aircraft. the plane was clean and new but the seat and legroom was very cramped. the entertainment programs were very poor the sound system sometimes didnt work. meals were small and still awful. the crew were friendly enough but their english ability was pretty limited. i will avoid this socalled 4 star airlines in the future if i can. i travelled with my quadriplegic nephew to kunming china and our experience on the ground at the airports kunming and guangzhou were the worst in all of my travels. my nephew is just under 2 meters tall in kunming the wheelchair china southern provided to get my nephew from the check in desk to the aircraft was too small for him to fit in so he was allowed to use his chair to the door of the aircraft we had to carry him onboard and as he is so tall this was extremely difficult. when we got him onto the aircraft the airline staff said they could not check his wheelchair all the way to sydney we would have to claim the chair in our transit airport guangzhou and then re check it in to sydney. after trying to argue the point for 1 hour and delaying the flight we had to agree as i feared they would not allow us to fly. in guangzhou we had one of the staff help us again we had to carry my nephew off the aircraft put him into a wheelchair that he didnt fit in. the airport was so hot and we had to rush so much to find the chair at baggage collection go and check the chair in to sydney and instead of the chair being taken by staff and put on the aircraft we had to wheel the chair with us all the way on to the aircraft and then the staff there put it into the luggage area. the flight was delayed because of us again. i would never travel with them again. we flew the new jfkcan route then transferred to a beijing flight. it was the worst airline ive experienced. incompetent and unprofessional ground crew who have zero problem solving skills. sourfaced service from the flight attendants their english skills were inexcusably bad. the food was awful it wasnt served frequently enough they were stingy with drinks. the transit experience in can baiyun is long and uncomfortable. on the return trip it was late at night. we had to walk for 20 minutes. the free shuttle wasnt running. there was no one around to help. i strongly suggest that the elderly and disabled avoid this airline. once you make it through all the immigration and security checks you are stuck in a tacky area with limited food and drinks and extortionate prices which are completely out of line with what other international transit terminals charge. the only positives decent inflight entertainment the plane was new the landings for the international segments were very smooth. cz336 cz307 cz308 cz335. 1920 may 2014 and 17 19 june 2014. the most disappointing and awful flights ever experienced in all my travelling years flew return from mid may  mid june 2014 from auckland via guangzhou to amsterdam. leg room was for midgets am only 5ft 7 and felt my knees were under my chin. the flight staff were very unfriendly always cross looking never saw a smile their english is almost nonexistent. when kindly asked what the 2 food types were for dinner  the stewardess shoved a tray at me saying western food. the canadian man next to me was equally appalled wine was not offered and when asked for a hint was poured in a small glass. sadly one would like to have it with a meal which only arrived half an hour later. the tvmovies did not work on 2 of the 4 flights  12hrs each guangzhou airport is very disappointing old dilapidated with unfriendly staff everywhere. shops seating dirty no wifi. impression gained that furniture etc was obtained from other old airports that had been updated. sadly this is a case of you get what you pay for. i did my homework before i bought the ticket and read that china southern wanted to break into the western market. i felt confident that it would be good sadly it was terrible. have since spoken with 3 other people whom will never fly with it again for the same reasons. it helps to pay extra and fly via decent airports. interesting enough  auckland airport has chinese instructions everywhere and on nz flights etc. no english instructions on china southern airlines or at guangzhou airport. only one positive  great price i flew from lax to guangzhou oct 2014 in economy. i chose china southern because it was the least expensive for a last minute flight. luckily the flight was not full and the middle seat next to me was vacant. the plane was an a380 so it was a new bird but to me the appearance was old and dirty. the lavatories were disgusting. this is just a small reflection of the terrible service. this is a 15 hour flight. there were only 2 meal services during this whole time. about 2 hours after take off and 2 hours before landing. be prepared to go hungry. during the 11 hour interval between meals there was not a single time when the beverage cart appeared. i had to find a flight attendant and ask for a cup of water. after i finished the cup sat at my seat for as long as i could stand it. pay the extra  it is well worth the comfort and service from any other airline. flew premium economy and would have been better off sitting with the luggage underneath. uncomfortable seats. crew rude and very unhelpful. screaming baby onboard and staff gave no assistance. my advice pay the extra and you will not come off the plane feeling like you have just been hit by a truck. i have to fly china southern since several routes have cz as the only operator. the last flight i took was on an e190 small jet. for a trip of less than 2 hours its not always good value for money. the flight was almost full in premium economy and economy class. there was no ifemonitor in the aircraft even in the business class. the ground service and inflight service is poor. for a full service airline the meal is served by a paper box and contains one bread and a chinese herbal pudding which i found very below par. i never heard any kind of communications or announcement to passengers from the cockpit on any flights even in chinese language. after many flights with cz only a few of the flight attendants that were really good and friendly. overall compared to many other asian airlines china southern is still far from industry standard with regards to many passenger service aspects. nrtcansyd return. generally i was disappointed with customer service on the ground at every turn. inflight service however was generally rather good. i was told i had to phone china to get a seat assignment. what kind of airline has no phone number or no working website to take care of such basic matters i did call china and they assigned a nonexistent seat number the seat i did get eventually on the flight from nrt to can did not work properly and i couldnt even use the tray table to eat my dinner. due to an unannounced change in aircraft the plane arrived at can more than 90 minutes late and we missed our onward connection to sydney. this can happen with any airline. the test of good service is what happens next. what happened next was a massive problem on the ground. the cz staff seemed to be completely unprepared for and totally unequipped to deal with the problem of a planeload of people unable to travel onward. and yet if you read other reviews this is clearly something that happens frequently and something the staff should have a great deal of experience with. none of the promised services for business class passengers were provided  in either direction  during the guangzhou stopover. the ground staff seemed amazed and offended that i would expect them to provide the services promised in their own printed brochures. the flights themselves were generally good but the incredible hassles on the ground particularly at guangzhou make this an airline best avoided. i flew from manilla to amsterdam on 28 january 2015 until the 29th. the flight from beijing to amsterdam was good. nothing bad nothing good. the toilets were clean i liked that. also the hotel between the flight was really nice. but the crew from the first flight manilla to beijing cz378 were not very nice. a question was almost too much to answer and if you got an answer they were really short. the crew spoke horrible english. i couldnt understand a word they said. i dont think this is a good service and hopefully china southern can do something about this. ive taken 4 flights with china southern in the past month and its been awful. the price is good but only if you want to pay for it with your sanity. every single flight was late to arrive and the routes seemed to be set up in a hurry. i was flying from moscow to sydney which is supposed to be a 1 stop trip on guangzhou. what they dont tell you is they cram you on a tiny plane and send you off to urumqi or wuhan first. you actually have to enter china. thats a whole other story. the service on board is satisfactory the food is below average compared to other airlines. i got sick off one of the meals i had on board. by the last flight with them i was bringing my own water and food on board. i really wouldnt be recommending them pay the extra few hundred dollars and getting a more decent airline is recommended. cz3878 on january 15 2015. second flight was cz399 on january 16 2015. i recently took two flights with china southern. both flights were delayed. the first flight was delayed for an hour with no reason given. the second flight can to jfk was delayed for two hours because a passengers claimed her baby had a fever and that a doctor should enter the plane and examine her baby before the flight could depart. the staff obviously had no training or idea as to what to do in this minor situation. we sat in the plane for two hours as various passengers quietly and politely tried to explain to the woman as to why she and her baby should just leave the plane if she did not want to travel. the woman had moved herself and her baby to the first class section while refusing to leave the plane. the woman eventually left the plane. food was average or below the seat was ok but it is more than obvious that this airline is illequipped to deal with unusual situations no matter how minor. during the first meal service the flight attendant did not give me a choice. she just looked at me and then tossed a foilwrapped hamburger at me. nothing served with the hamburger just meat and bread in a foil wrapper. we arrived at jfk two hours late and of course there were no announcements or staff made available to those of us who were late to our connecting flights. aucklandguangzhounew delhi return in economy. the positives the aucklandguangzhou part of journey in the air was good. food beverage and inflight entertainment was acceptable for the price you pay. the airplane is modern and the seats have a little leg rest in economy. the negatives 1. on my aklcandel journey my flight to delhi was cancelled due to bad weather. from here the airline ground staff could have been courteous and helped us through the process of passing immigration and customs so we can take bus to hotel. but no they werent. they treated us with disdain and were very rude. a guy with very little english told us to follow him as we navigated the airport from gate to bus via customs and immigration. the food they served was awful. the airline kept all passengers uninformed as to when the next flight was. once i got to the airport the airline gave us boarding passes for 7am flight. once i arrived at gate i was told that it was actually for the 11am flight. during the 5 hour wait we were lucky to get water and food from the airline. flight delays occurs for many reasons its how the staff handle them from then on that makes the difference. 2. the planes from canton  delhi  canton were old and had no inflight entertainment. in summary i would not fly with them again. generally i take thai airways but this time unfortunately had to take china southern cz362 on june 10. plane was almost two hours delayed and no information or apologies at the boarding gate. even worse was that the crew didnt care they were yawning around passengers in a very impolite way. our son and daughter in law flew with them from new zealand to visit us in uk and wanted to take an additional bag back to new zealand and asked us to find out the cost. in february i phoned china southern at heathrow and carefully checked the cost and was given a break down of charge depending on whether booked at airport or on line and made it very clear the flight was london to auckland. the day before they were due to fly i again phoned to check the figures and got the same charge to book in additional case at the airport. on arrival they were told the fee was double as it was two flights and would not budge. she felt she was being treated very badly and the attitude of the staff was absolutely dreadful. they were not that impressed with the flight to the uk and said food was nothing special and somewhat greasy and the staff not that bothered. they were not particularly looking forward to the return flight. overall outcome is they will not use china southern again nor would we try them when we next visit new zealand. near riot in economy class when wine ran out. this was as air france share flight and was full of french people returning home. only the first few passengers in economy got any wine with their food because it turns out only eight bottles of wine were allocated to the whole economy section. well done china southern about a hundred pasangers who will never fly with you again all for the sake of a few bottle of cheap wine give the penny pinching manager a star. my flight was cancelled in guangzhou after a delay one night. i had a 12 hour layover that turned into a 26 hour layover. i was not given my suitcase but taken to a hotel far away that was very disturbing. i was not even allowed my own room and had to pay for my own room  even though they cancelled due to weather.  recently took several flights with china southern. first melbourne to xian via guangzhou then chongquin to guilin guilin to melbourne via guangzhou. all flights were on time. i found them not quite as good as cathay but still adequate. the entertainment personal was quite limited for english but still had a variety of tv sitcomsdramas and movies. coming back a bonus was that even for domesticinternational if you have more than 6 hours wait we had 12 hours they put you up in a hotel room for free including transfers even during the day. you go to international check in find g17 which is opposite the gs for check in and they check your details and then escort you onto a bus for your transit hotel. bonus. however the seats we had 51a 51c coming back from guangzhou to melbourne mine didnt recline and my husband had no tray table. it was removed some time some how. we mentioned this to the flight attendant who said they would be willing to let him sit somewhere else to eat. me well too bad. not the greatest help. so instead of the hassle he just balanced his meal on his lap. not really acceptable. shame as we would have rated this airline much higher if they had done the right thing by us and let us sit in seats that had all their bits working like a table and a recline it was an overnight flight. the seats were hard. without our issues i would recommend but they could do so much better at no extra big cost. china southern airlines is a step above others based out of china but not by much. the a380 i flew was very nice but the remainder of their fleet is very subpar. the staff are generally rude and apathetic to requests. the website is useless. forget collecting miles their program is terrible especially if you want to collect flying with another sky team member. the food is lousy at best. the benefit is that they are the only airline flying from guangzhou directly to the us. the fares are generally quite low for a direct but i think i would now prefer to just take a layover. i flew from hongqiao to guangzhou and the from guangzhou to auckland. the checkin service at hongqiao was fine but the service in lounge was extremely poor. limited food available for international traveller in lounge. staff were uncommunicative did not speak english to converse with international passengers and even though there were at least 6 staff at the desk all were unhelpful. more interested in playing on their phones plane was delayed in hongqiao for 4 hours. staff did not know what was happening and had no idea when the plane would fly. when the plane did take off they did not have my special meal so i had very little to eat. got to guangzhou and only had 45 minutes to catch next flight. got driven from domestic to international terminal and then had to run to customsimmigration  about 800 metres and then run to the plane about 800m again. no passenger carts provided. on the flight they also did not have my special meal available. i had booked and confirmed this 1 month in advance for all legs of my journey. so i had to pick what little i could eat and since i had missed my special meal on 2 flights i was pretty hungry and slept most of the time. staff did not make any special effort to get me anything extra. on arrival into auckland we found our luggage was left behind in guangzhou. it took 2 days even though there are daily flights from guangzhou. i was extremely disappointed with the service and the flights. they have good planes poorly fitted out though and main issue is staff training and service delivery. a lot of work needs to be done in this area.  just arrived home today flight out of qingdao delayed but thats unavoidable sometimes. from brisbane to guangzhou i was offered a choice of room temperature orange juice soft drink or water. nothing cold but i guess ice fixes that. no i will have a cold beer i thought wrong we only have warm beer. settled for a red wine thinking it was an oversight one of those things. its not it seems china southern airlines dont serve cold beer only warm beer. on the way home 35 degree heat outside i was looking forward to a cold beer but no we dont have cold you want ice i thought this was an international airline next time i fly with you and i will it would be nice to see this situation rectified. everything else was fine. terrible delay and customer service i went to beijing airport 3 hours early and wanted to change to an early flight to guangzhou. however i was told to go different places and finally i gave it up. the plane was delayed for an hour. my flight change over time was 2 hours. then when the plane arrived in guangzhou it was one hour and half delayed. no ground crew helped me although i asked the plane staff for assistance. when i got to the boarding gate for dubai this flight was delayed one hour and half. when it was landed in dubai it was two hours and half delayed. i planned three hours change over time. unfortunately i missed my connection. i had to stay at the airport for 5 hours for one morning flight.  my seat had a loose jack for the headphone and i asked the crew if possible to change the seat but she started blaming me.  after an hour in the air i started to listen to turn on my iphone for music since the jack was not working and staff told me i could not use this because of chinese regulations. i pointed out that people are using laptop. she said laptop is ok but not the cell phone. i started using the laptop but of course the battery ran out quickly. food was not good. after arriving guangzhou i was up for a surprise. i was supposed to transfer to the san francisco flight instead they asked me to go thru immigration and customs.  i asked why and the answer is you have to take a domestic flight to go to another city then catch the sfo flight from there  i did all that. then after an hour i passed thru the immigration and security for the domestic terminal.  i went outside the terminal and came back 1.5 hours later again going thru immigrationsecurity. after landing at the domestic terminal i had to go thru immigrationcustoms and immigrationsecurity for the international. altogether i had to go thru 4 immigration and 6 customssecurity. at the airport there are no starbucks or any place that take credit card unless you order at least 10 usd i think thats the amount. people at the airport were not helpful at all.  china southern airways is a pretty terrible airline. being vegetarian there was no food option available unless previous specified and even then just rice and crackers. there was no inflight entertainment the cabin staff are just going through the motions rather than concerned with health and safety. the planes we flew on domestic routes werree old and in need of replacement. the last flight i went on the seat i was allocated didnt even recline and being 6ft this was pretty disappointing and made for a long uncomfortable flight. the only upside is they are cheap so if you can deal with these things youre in for a bargain. unlike our international flight with china southern airlines this domestic xian to guangzhou flight was disappointing with staff seemingly not interested. the flight was late and the food very ordinary. if china southern airlines wants more western passengers it needs to lift its standards on these domestic flights. the china southern airlines ground service needs improvement on the customer service. the a330 aircraft is average. i was expecting toys for our children but nothing. the food was below average the good thing about the airline is the ife. then transfer at guangzhou to jinan to an a320 the aircraft was quite dirty and the food was not good. returning to melbourne both the aircraft an a330300 and a321 are fairly new and clean but still the food wasnt great. i was scheduled to fly with china southern airlines on 28th august from dunhuang to urumqi on flight cz6896. the flight was cancelled and no explanation or apology was forthcoming. there was no china southern airlines representative at dunhuang airport. this was totally unacceptable. the china southern airlines flight from shanghai pudong to incheon to icn takes 1.5 hours. first they changed schedule and made the flight departure 2 hours later. came to the airport intime to find out that it is delayed for an hour more. no announcements and no information. finally the delay was more than 3 hours without any excuses or reasons. onboard the seats are uncomfortable the cabin staff speaks almost no english and the food was terrible.  china southern airlines from vancouver to bali and got delayed in guangzhou for 36 hours for unknown reasons. missed our connecting flight to bali because of this as well as two days of our vacation and two nights paid hotel and were not given any help or guidance whatsoever on how or when we would be put on a new flight to denpasar from guangzhou. experienced the rudest staff ever  from staff laughing at our distress to just looking at us and walking away when we asked for help. we had to use our mobile data plans to find alternative flights online because they told us there were no flights out for three days and then were forced to wait in line for three hours to demand they put us on one of the several flight paths available. then had to fly through guangzhou again on the way back from bali and our flight was delayed hours yet again for unknown reasons. any time we ask about compensation for our time and money wasted we get blank stares or told to talk to someone else. paris to brisbane via guangzhou and as a first time flyer with china southern airlines  i will not waste my money again. the flight was not comfortable seats were hard and with the added issues of young children and new born babies in business class due to allowable upgrades via some means of points or seat awards  not sure how their upgrades to business class work. i would not recommend this airline. i took the china southern airlines flight cz8129 from beijing to chongqing on october 2nd 2015 and was not satisfied with this flight. the cabin crew in the first class made the wrong order for my food and drink. even the worse during the turbulence a passenger from economy class came to squat down and chat with the guy in first class. this is dangerous and disburb my rest. but nobody stopped it even the head attendant. san francisco to kuala lumpur via guangzhou with china southern airlines. delicious inflight food and a free hotel stay for long layovers in guangzhou. cabin crew yelled at my mother just to ask her to switch off her phone. staff turned off my call button without asking me if i needed anything when i did. small seats and im petite. misleading flight information  they did not inform passengers in emails or etickets that the flight from sfo to can will stop at wuhan for customs i had to ask to get that information and it was a hassle because we had to take our carryon bags with us to enter the airport and then bring everything back up the same aircraft again. poor aircraft facilities limited entertainment poor menu choice quality of food poor crown lounge not open. having travelled outward with air france to beijing the comparison with china southern for the return leg was stark. to start things off the faulty entertainment socket was bad enough. but then to inconvenience the poor unfortunate passengers next to me through the comings and goings of various cs staff trying to fix the socket was both distracting and embarrassing for me. then to compound matters they get a passenger to swap seats with me and low and behold the tray table will not go back into the seat and i forced to sit for some of the journey with this as well. overall very poor business class service. ive flown china southern internationally and domestic the latest was a domestic trip xian to beijing. while they were okay longhaul from lax domestic standards are terrible. done 5 different internal flights in china so far and this was the worst. delay of 75mins at airport not a word of apology from airport personnel or onboard the flight. the captain was silent from start to finish  truly my neighboring fellow passengers were coughing up phlegm most of the flight all very unpleasant. served some type of filled bun but the smell deterred me and passed on this. asked for coffee the female fa shook her head snarled something in chinese and walked off. it is like 2 different airlines and standards night and day when you compare international with domestic. if you have a little longer try the train for domestic routes or choose one of the smaller airlines here. reading all the positive reviews here seems to forget how terrible their domestic flights can be. flew beijing to guangzhou in october and the trip was awful. check was worse than a zoo the staff were quite rude and couldnt understand english at all. boarding was delayed for 1 hour no proper information given apart from someone screaming in chinese very loudly. when it finally started ground staff had no control at all fellow passengers were pushing and shoving like a stampede. delayed again onboard the aircraft the captain decided it would be okay to say nothing and the cabin crew gave 1 message in chinese only. safety systems and checks were something of a joke but i guess related to the fact many customers think this is a train and they can get up and walk about at will and any time. inflight meal service was truly chinese but i mean chinese 2 star trough food that other customers left untouched. staff on my aisle section couldnt understand any of my requests even asking a coke sprite or milk for coffee so i gave up on that. lots of fellow passengers shouting across me some quite disgusting throat clearing and sneezing all around and the whole trip was very unpleasant in the end suffered a 2.5 hour delay and not one word of apology awful airline and would avoid in the future. china southern airlines from amsterdam to hong kong via beijing returning taipei to paris via guangzhou a380 outbound and boeing 777 on return. i agree with other reviews here in that the quality of the product is a mixedbag. on the outward flight amsterdam to beijing i was impressed with the a380 however the standard of the interior wasnt inviting or comfortable. the seat bottom on the a380 was extremely hard more so than on their other aircraft and my legs were aching even before takeoff. while some of the stewardesses were helpful as much as they could be with their limited english language skills some were very rude. for example when asking people to turn off their phones before takeoff asking passengers to reset their seat back eg. just pressing the reset button while making their request a stewardess snatching a bottle of water from me when she mistakenly thought i was taking the whole bottle. i can commend the professionalism of most staff and the friendliness and helpfulness of ground staff in taipei. a staff member went out of her way to double check visa requirements which was appreciated. the food was below average. i wouldnt choose again but id recommend it for budgetconscious travellers. the price was good and i didnt really have any expectations. perth to vancouver via guangzhou. we chose china southern business class due to the price and because we could fly into vancouver and out of la. also the flight times were more attractive than flying from perth through sydney or brisbane. we took advantage of the free night in guangzhou because of a longer than 8 hour transit time on the way out. this was all handled very efficiently after a pretty good flight. the business class seats on the boeing 787 were comfortable and food and wine acceptable. not up to same standards of qatar or singapore airlines but had paid much less for the tickets cheap headphones but okay inflight entertainment. we were met at guangzhou airport names on a board and escorted through immigration to the pullman hotel which offered a very comfortable room good breakfast the next day. we paid for our dinner. we checked our bags direct from perth to vancouver and had a change of clothes etc in hand luggage. so it was easy checking in at the transit lounge for the onward flight to vancouver  also a boeing 787 but we were not offered pyjamas for 12 hour overnight flight. food and wine acceptable. flight from la on the a380 we found the flight attendants in need of training. we had to ask them to hang our coats  only apple or orange juice offered prior to takeoff the foodbeverage choices limited. the seats were configured 1x2x1 and we opted for a two in the middle. the design meant that there was a very small space through which to leave our seats.  the seats seemed narrower and very hard. we were given a very thin undercover as well as a duvet when settling to sleep but it made little difference. the armrests covered in very hard plastic  i used an extra pillow as it was so uncomfortable  digging into my arm when eating reading etc. good noisecancelling headphones. entertainment and amenities ok. food was mediocre as were the wines. no other drinks offered after dinner. the toilet was not kept replenished i had to ask them to clean and renew towels  toilet paper. a selection of snacks put out but was not replenished once many of the offerings had been consumed. guangzhou to perth overnight again on a boeing 787. we headed for the business class lounge to have dinner so we could sleep as long as possible. terrible lounge offered 1 white and 2 red wines beers and soft drinks but not much western food and most seats taken. wifi was slow. food served downstairs. sitting area upstairs. didnt take dinner on the plane but ordered breakfast which was inedible eggs benedictine brought before the fruit had to ask for coffee. would we use china southern again  yes because of price but without expectation of it being the same as some airline offerings. london to auckland via guangzhou and brisbane return. a380 was good on one leg but others on boeing 787 which was cramped uncomfortable seats. inflight entertainment with a reasonabe choice but poor compared to emirates. cabin crew ranged from pleasant to unhelpful  some spoke or understood very little english even words like water so making enquiries or requests was frustrating. pretty poor quality food and little choice. we couldnt choose meals in advance on the way back so we got the standard meals most of which seemed to involve meat. my wife is vegetarian but they had no spare vegetarian meals. before we left london the manage my booking section didnt work so i had to reserve seats and meals on the phone very difficult. from auckland nothing about the website worked and phone was impossible. nobody in nz london or china answered my phone calls and was no provision to leave a message. i went to their office in auckland but staff couldnt answer my question. i have been trying to contact their lost property department 45 mins holding to customer relations no answer. guangzhou airport is a ferociously expensive and depressing airport. about 12usd for a cup of coffee and 15usd for a bowl of noodles.   shanghai to zhuhai with china southern and the flight was on time. seat 35 as i like aisle side. the stewardess spilt coffee on the floor just close to me and spread hot coffee on my shoes and my trousers. she did not react instantly and i had to ask her to give me something to wash myself. well it can happen but i want to highlight the reaction of the flight attendant. they even did not check if i was okay. guangzhou to sfo. the best part was the boeing 787. the lieflat seats were the next best thing. they are wider than delta one but are configured the old way so you have to jump over the person by the aisle if you have a window seat. the rest of my experience was less impressive. food was mediocre and they ran out of my first choice of meals because i was in the last row seat 14a. ife had older movies. my seatmate was this father traveling with his family. he talked loudly to his family in the row ahead of us when he was awake and snored when sleeping. they also had visitors from economy come in and sit with them. flight attendants spoke english but i still had difficulty making myself understood. they completely disappeared between the first and second meals. consistent with my experience living in hong kong it was hard to impress upon the flight attendants that i wanted a lot of ice with my soda. not the airline to fly if you are expecting superior service. i flew this airline only because it was a partner airline of deltas and i used my delta miles for this flight. delhi to sydney via guangzhou in january 2016. our first flight was delayed and we had to stay at guangzhou on transit visa. they sent us to the hotel till next flight schedule. hotel manager could not speak english and it took 2 hours for him to understand why we were at the hotel. tried doing online checkin multiple times but no success. their customer care do not understand english. their refund and reschedule charges are almost equal to the flight fare.    phnom penh to amsterdam via beijing. really disappointing. my sick mother had to stay at the airport about 12 hours she was exhausted had pain in her legs and was freezing so she asked one of the airport ladies for help. she showed her disabled id card and asked for a place to lay down for a while. the ladies denied any help instead ignored her totally. first there is an aiport hotel very close also china southern airlines offer a free hotel stay for a long waiting period  which is really nice but why did anyone not tell her the airline should be more supportive. additionally her luggage got lost during the flight. she still doesnt know where it is.    fuzhou to guangzhou with china southern airlines seat 1a. check in by xiamen air staff was smooth and with smiles. lounge experience rather mediocre. the aircraft was embraer 90 which offers very comfy seats in business class. overall impression was spoiled by poor onboard service from a female purser cold and unfriendly welcome despite on time boarding no pre flight drinks not addressing passengers by names rushed service etc. meals orders collected beef noodles or snacks  looks like it is a standard now on this route regardless of time of day. it is mandatory for fas on china southern flights to ask passengers whether they would like to be woken up for meals in case of falling asleep but it was not the case on this flight. i fell asleep indeed and woke up on landing announcements. requested the meal the purser reluctantly served it saying you have to be quick. noodles turned out to be dried out on top and very greasy under so i just stayed hungry after finishing nuts yoghurt and fruit. not a great flight however promotional ticket was a bargain.    sydney to seoul via guangzhou return. staff were not professional or with good english. food and seat comfort poor. we had a delayed flight due to bad weather conditions in guangzhou and missed our connecting flight to sydney. these kind of thing can happen but it was the way it had been handled such an inefficient service. no explanations no english announcement and no assistance to smooth the transfer.     auckland to guangzhou in june this year and was disappointed with the service. staff were pleasant but not overly attentive i found i could not understand what was being said over the intercom. the seats were narrow and i could hardly get in and out of my seat space wise during flight. the food was alright but not very filling and often there was no choice as they ran out. on an 11 hr flight two meals were offered was water offered between meals no snacks were offered. the inflight entertainment was located on the inside of the armrest and the system was difficult to use. facilities at guangzhou airport were minimal and after paying nearly 70 for two hours in a premium lounge in a 7hr stopover i decided to decline this on the return flight. instead i asked at the information desk if i had enough airmiles to upgrade on the last leg. the assistant assured me that i did and she tapped into the computer and said it was done and my seat had been upgraded. when i boarded the plane i was told that this wasnt the case and she couldnt do it at the desk rather embarrassing. i did not find my experience enjoyable.   brisbane to los angeles lax via guangzhou with china southern. i just completed the return trip. overall you get what you pay for the planes are new the tech crew are very good ie a very smooth flight inflight entertainment is average but the food needs a major update. i was under no illusions getting on board this flight but as mentioned it was value for money.    short domestic china southern airlines flight from guangzhou to changsha. i was a bit concerned about the checkin as my ticket was purchased by my chinese girlfriend with a mobile app but the website one of the least user friendly i have seen did not recognize my ticket number. in the end registration was a breeze and no issues at all. flight was okay ontime and comfortable but with no drinkfood service  maybe because i was seated in the last row. all in all a smooth flight and very nicely priced.    we booked a round trip vancouver to delhi via guangzhou. the service at guangzhou was so bad. no one speaks english and everywhere they had chinese language so there is no way you can know where you going.  on the way back the flight from guangzhou got cancelled and the staff had no clue what was going on. it took almost 4 hours struggle to get out to the hotel and then there is a struggle for buses for hotel. there is not enough buses and everyone is standing in the cold and staff has no clue what to say to passengers.     paris to melbourne via guangzhou. the crew try their best to be helpful but their grasp of english was poor for a company providing international flights. there was no diet coke or coke zero on either of the flights i took. the choice of food was quite poor and i dont think that fish is not a good choice for such a tight space.    rome to manila via wuhan & guangzhou. the 787 was a little tatty and the seats uncomfortable for a long haul flight. the food was quite tasteless and the entertainment system average. the staff were friendly. within an hour of arriving at wuhan the plane diverted and about 10mins later we were told that we couldnt land at wuhan due to bad weather so we were diverting to\\xa0zhengzhou. we landed and sat on the plane just outside the terminal for more than 5 hours. the staff seemed underprepared and spent some time out of sight at the front of the plane. when we got to wuhan we were told that the plane would leave again for guangzhou in an hour. after passing through security and into a waiting area nobody including airport staff were sure what we were doing there or what to do next. we then had to wait more than 3 hours more to reboard the plane and more than an hour on the plane while they waited for additional passengers. by the time we got to guangzhou we should have been in manila so had to spend the night there at the airlines expense. the last decent meal we had was 3 hours before reaching zhengzhou in the next 12 hours we were only given a couple of bread rolls and a packet of peanuts there was no opportunity to buy and food during that time. we already had boarding passes for the next available flight and the rest of the journey was ok. not once was there any apology for any inconvenience caused.    phuket to vancouver via guangzhou. they changed our flight canceled our previous one giving us notice midway thru our trip that they changed the flight to 4 hours earlier causing us to miss a night at the hotel we paid to stay at. we get here today with our new tickets they sent us. when we go to get our boarding pass thats when it all goes sideways they say they can see on the computer we paid for the tickets there are empty seats and they see our names but because theres a computer glitch and our ticket id is not matching with whats on the computer they wont let us board. our travel agent talked to them confirming these are valid tickets there is no getting thru to the china southern airline staff.  we tried being very friendly but we got firm and to the point because we werent getting anywhere  we were just pushed aside and literally ignored when we were being nice. the manager then put her hand up at us and then blatantly ignore us previously she would pretend to hear our concerns as she would not make eye contact smirk and just repeat buy a new ticket. we are now stuck in the thai airport.     i flew from auckland to guangzhou on 29 november with china southern airlines.  the cabin staff made me really disappointed and did not answer questions. they forgot my requests  i asked for one more blanket but the cabin crew said no and went away.  during the flight i felt no smiling or communication.  also the lavatories were dirty. disgusting smell. i have experienced this airlines so many times and this was the worst time in cabin service. other than the service the food was okay. inflight entertainment was good. i recommend china southern airlines for value for money.    i took the flight cz327 from guangzhou to los angeles on january 28th. my seat number is 16c. this is the worst experience in my flight with china southern airlines. the cabin crew informed me the dinner would be served half an hour after took off and i was shocked. in my previous experience the dinner would be served two hours after took off.  so i asked the cabin crew to serve my dinner after two hours. when they served the dinner no nut first dish is cold dish. 20 mins past no one asked me when to serve the main course after 23 mins one cabin crew came to collect the dish and serve the fruit. i asked why fruit goes first without main course and rice then they serve the main course with not enough temperature and collected dishes in a hurry. no one ask me when the cheese and dessert would be served of course i had nothing after main course. in the cruise period beverage and fruit served on the bar but no cup or knife displays. how could we drink without cup and have fruit without knife other passengers joked the things on the bar is just for display. the most ridiculous thing is no one to replace the toilet paper in time this brought many trouble to us. for the second dinner the main course with at the correct temperature. the service of china southern airlines is not as good as before it seems that the cabin crew wanted the passengers to eat in a hurry then they could finished their service quickly.    amsterdam to hanoi via guangzhou a terrible experience. the flight attendants barely spoke english when asked what does the omelet contain they said omelet and did not give more information like is it with meat or something. when dinner was served by the time they reached me and my friends they only had one choice of meal and it was beef which could not be changed. when we finally received something else after calling the main flight attendee the taste was awful. the quality of food was extremely poor. when it came to beverages after around 2 hours of an 11 hour flight they ran out of beer and wine not to say that there was no other alcohol available. the only good thing was the organization of the change we had in guangzhou the staff helped us to go out of the airport offered a hotel and directed to the appropriate gates in order to go out to the city. i hope this was my first and last experience with china southern airlines.    delhi to adelaide to via guangzhou. worst experience to fly with china southern. i was going back to australia on 3rd july from delhi. without any advance information at the delhi check in counter staff told us our flight been cancelled due to a 3 hour delay meaning we would miss the connecting flight to adelaide and without any answer they send 5 passengers into a hotel. more then 24 hours later we are still in hotel and no idea whats going on.    i was on the flight cz604 on june 24 from london heathrow to guangzhou. i was seated at the last row in the business cabin. throughout the whole flight i was interrupted by passengers from the economy cabin to use the lavatory in the front of the business cabin. are these lavatories meant to be shared im not sure if this is the airlines policy. these intruders were ignored by the flight attendants and this made the trip one of the worst experience.    san francisco to phuket via guangzhou on 22nd june. the worst airline and customer service i have ever had the misfortune to deal with. on the day of my flight out of sfo i could not checkin online or see the flight status. my flight to guangzhou was delayed 4 hours and the airline did not bother to send any flight updates the morning of even though they knew by 9am that my 2pm flight was going to be delayed. the checkin counter staff were unorganized. my boyfriend asked if we could be upgraded for free to premium economy and they wanted to charge an extra 400 for more leg room. our 4 hour layover caused us to miss our connecting flight to phuket in guangzhou. we were promised by the sfo staff that we would receive a hotel voucher so we could get some rest before our 10pm flight out of china. we arrived in guangzhou at 2am. no one at guangzhou airport spoke english and there were only a handful of china southern employees working that late. after running around the airport for over an hour trying to find customer service to receive our hotel voucher we were ushered onto a bus at 3am and driven to an undisclosed location to the dirtiest hotel ive ever seen. the bus staff refused to tell us where they were taking us even though it was a 45 minute drive from the airport. we along with 5 other americans in the same situation demanded the bus driver return us to the airport after he refused to let us know when the next shuttle would return. after returning to the airport i asked staff if it was possible for me to change my flight so i could fly into another city in thailand and catch a different flight on a different airline to phuket. customer service told me no and said i was not allowed to make any changes to my flight. when i asked if i could just not board the plane and cancel my trip with them i was also told no. after being stranded in guangzhou for the day the flight to phuket was fine. they lost our baggage but fortunately the staff at phuket airport were phenomenal and found our bag the next day. our return flight from phuket to guangzhou to sfo was on time however they did lose my bag again. the worst airline i have ever had the misfortune of interacting with.    new york to kuala lumpur via guangzhou. i decided to try china southern as the tickets were wellpriced. after flying to and from nyc with them i have decided the lower fare is not worth it. all flights never left on time. they never communicated any delays but kept us waiting at the gate each time. guanzhou to nyc was delayed three hours and we could only tell because the time kept changing on the screen. finally onboard the captain would mention some kind of mechanical issue. communications in general are terrible. dont even bother trying to get hold of someone before you fly. customer service is nonexistent. no one could tell me why i could select a seat on one leg but not the other of the same trip. the seats were uncomfortable. there was no entertainment from kuala lumpur to guangzhou. no personal screens at all. headphones were terrible quality. the meals were edible but never good. the flight attendants did their job but most may as well have been robots. i guess if you just base it on price china southern is okay. but if you are doing a 24 hr flight as i was you might want to be on a better more customeroriented airline. its a whole day you will never get back.    shanghai to new york jfk via guangzhou. i believe bad reviews about their customer services. we chose it for our asia trips this summer 5 flights in total 1 flight 3 tickets was wasted. we couldnt believe we would have run into so many troubles with their customer services. things happen thats why the customer services are there for. however the customer services at china southern airline is there to drive you to mental house  like many previous reviews mentioned. when the flight was delayed no announcement until 10 minutes before the boarding time delayed for over 4 hours no water or food was provided until the majority customers demanded. we paid extra money to select our seats but seats were given away. wanted to change the outbound tickets and paid for the changeable price first was told yes you can change it but later was told we couldnt because the previous customer services rep made a mistake. in any other airlines this change would be granted if they said yes but not in china southern. we told them we paid for a changeable price for the outbound flight but they told us that we couldnt because our inbound tickets couldnt be changed despite we told them we dont need make any changes to the inbound tickets they wouldnt listen they insisted if we changed outbound tickets the inbound tickets were changed automatically regardless inbound tickets are actually changed or not so we asked them why they charged us for the changeable price for the outbound flights they repeated with if you changed outbound tickets the inbound tickets were changed automatically regardless inbound tickets are actually changed or not we thought we were talking to a broken recording machine promised responding time for the damaged luggage first was 35 business days then extended to 7 business days then the respond was they have been working on it but no dates can be provided asked who we could reach out to escalate the matter they gave us a wrong number and extension the guy on the other side of the line was clueless. when called back to the mainline again the customer services told us that they dont know when they can get back to us they are only responsible for taking in the complains and reading the status according to the records by the computer.  most ironically every time they finished every phone call with is there anything else i can help you. they have no idea what customer service is  their mission is to waste customers time and aggravate customers further i wish their management would read through these reviews.    brisbane to guangzhou. we boarded the flight and when having a 2nd small glass of wine we asked for some snackpeanuts  and were told only thing they have got is bread roll. we asked for 3rd small glass of wine and were told no more wine left. due to this airline only stocking a small amount of food ask for more food she said only had bread roll left. when i went back to go to the bathroom she is eating the food from business class. i will never fly china southern airlines any more.    sydney to london return via guangzhou. we boarded the guangzhou to london flight and were sitting in the plane for 4 hours. the captain announced only once that the flight had not got clearance due to bad weather a wait in the transit lounge would have been more comfortable. their online services is very frustrating. i had problems putting in special meals vegetarian request and seat selection. i called them up and requested them to confirm my seat selection and special meal request for family of four. later i checked online and everything seemed fine. the seats worked out fine but on london to guangzhou as well as guangzhou to sydney leg the steward said they had only one special meal request. we had to make do with some buns and tea. i i have travelled very frequently and even on lesser known airlines the stewards have concocted vegetarian meals on the go and serve me. but here they never came back to me. also they were not very fluent in english. on one occasion the stewardess had to ask my fellow chinese passenger to translate for prawns dish. i think the frequency of beverage services should be more. i had to go the galley frequently for my beverage and many other passengers too were doing so.     bangkok to san francisco via guangzhou. unfortunately the flight was a disaster. the flight from bangkok did not arrive on time due to a typhoon had to land in quailing and spent over 2 hours on the tarmac. since my wife is thai a 24 hour visa is unavailable to her so we spent the night in the airport. we were told that first we were going to go to seoul then on to san francisco  numerous lies were told to us before we were loaded onto an ana flight via tokyo narita. the night time station manager continually reassured us that our bag would be on whatever flight they got us on to sfo  but bag lost for 2 days. from san francisco we asked if we could be upgraded to first class but was told they were booked  while there were 3 empty seats. when we were on the plane we also asked the stewardess who asked the head stewardess who asked the station manager but they did not upgrade us.    christchurch to delhi via guangzhou. i was travelling with my two kids whose newborn and the second one age of 6 and as well with my parents.  first leg for me was fine as we all got seats on the same row the real test came when we took the second flight and five of us seats were being given in a different corners and moreover even to my second child seat was given in a extreme corner. i was stunned that you cant allot seat together the least i can expect my kids with me or may be with my parents. i requested the flight attendant to please do something so she replied that for now be on your seats and let me see if i can arrange something. i was being patient but the staff did nothing to help and in short it was a terrible experience.     frankfurt to wuhan via changsha  guangzhou. overall dissatisfactory experience on for the most part older aircraft with no touch screen and little legroom on the a330. food on the long haul segment of the flight was relatively good whilst english service was bad. safety video is extremely old school. no english magazine on the long haul then on the domestic flight they had one  bizarre changsha as a stopover was a disaster. though checked luggage is forwarded you have to leave the aircraft go through immigration and landside security check led by an employee who tries to lead the group. all this in a hurry to catch the same plane again. back in the plane one passenger seems to be missing. stewardesses walk along the corridor 10 times  trying to count passengers with their manual counter seems to be a china southern thing  extremely annoying and unprofessional. no info from crew or cockpit whatsoever in english or chinese for 2 hours after 2 hours water is served. followed by take off shortly after. also unnecessary long roundabout ways in guangzhou airport while the plane lands at a domestic gate a bus is provided for all travelers from frankfurt which brings you again to the international terminal which is especially inconvenient when you have to catch a domestic onward flight. china southern also disappoints by saving on drinks on domestic flights meaning a bottle of water only sadly i cannot recommend this airline and was expecting more from the many positive reviews lately.     i booked my trip from seoul to copenhagen with china southern flying with them from beijing and amsterdam and my own experience was far from great. i bought the ticket from china southern but i could not check in with them at incheon airport and had to go to korean air since they operated the first leg. i could only get two boarding passes for the first 2 legs and i could not select seats on leg 2 and 3. other airlines have in the past checked me in all the way from the beginning. all the problems started in beijing airport. in order to transfer i had to get a 72 hour transfer visa and then check in again even though i had a boarding pass already. when i went to the check in counter there were no staff there even though it was 8pm. no one was helping and very few people spoke english. a line started to form but still no staff. i ended up not being able to change my seat due to no staff being present. beijing airport was terrible old dirty and nothing worked. the wifi was a joke but i was happy when i finally boarded and saw a free wifi sticker next to my inflight entertainment system. i pulled out my iphone and immediately a flight attendant appeared and told me to shut off my phone. it turned out that all mobile phones have to be shut off during the whole flight. adding to the general theme of nothing making sense there was a sticker right next to the free wifi sticker saying no mobile phones allowed. so you can only use wifi on a tablet. either way the wifi didnt even work so you couldnt really do that either. the passengers were mostly chinese. a fight almost broke out in the queue to the plane and people were loud throughout most of the flight. in the morning breakfast was served  i received the saddest omelette with some sort of white sausage next to it. the purser of the plane was friendly though  i had a conversation with her and she seemed really nice. the legroom was not bad for someone whos very tall like me. but the rest of staff food and nonsense chinese rule about switching off your phone and the experience at the beijing airport made me wish i hadnt picked china southern. i will definitely avoid china southern next time.    guangzhou to xian. this was my first time to exchange tickets with miles. i chose the night flight unfortunately the flight was delayed for half an hour. but china southern airlines app can check the plane online situation so i was not very nervous. as the attendance was very high the cabin service was relatively general. crew members was not very enthusiastic. the meal on the plane were beef rice and cantonese dim sum i had tried the latter tasted better. just because it was rainy in xian my bag was wet. it was very easy to exchange a ticket with flight miles.    amsterdam to kunming via guangzhou. not very impressed overall. i was in premium economy supposedly which seemed to mean more legroom but the same food as in economy. entertainment system very limited and the usb charging did not work. furthermore chinese airlines cannot allow you to use your phone even in flight mode which is ridiculous in this day and age. cabin crew are cold even robotic rarely if ever smile. their english is poor to fair announcements were hard to understand generally. they serve wine in minute proportions and i was refused a third glass on an 11 hour flight on the assumption that i would be drunk again staff quite rude and never experienced before as i certainly was not drunk but wanted a sleeping aid. seat was of moderate to okay comfort for economy. flight attendants refused to assist with my seat neighbour who was being rude and refusing to move to let me go to the bathroom saying it was not against regulations. the domestic leg was much better friendlier crew and better and more copious food. will really hesitate to use them again would prefer a western airline in future.    guangzhou to manila. i am addressing this complaint to a rude male ground staff posted at the entrance of all the checkin counters f and g of china southern airlines today in guangzhou airport. he asked for our eticket and was saying something about the long line at the checkin counter and that we go away check if we have our boarding pass and gesturing for us to move aside and go. i have no idea what he was talking about so i asked him again and then he kept gesturing and saying over there over there computer i told him to just tell me where exactly because you keep saying over there where is over there while i am speaking to him he suddenly acted as if he cannot hear and see me. i kept repeating my question but he did not respond and continued on with this behavior. so after asking around we found out that we need to verify using our passports if our boarding pass is already available for printing from a self service machine so that we can queue on the checkin counters with the shorter line. at the self service machine there was only 1 staff assisting compared to the many passengers trying to figure out how to use them. to china southern airlines next time put someone who is competent and can communicate well and who is not rude at the entrance of your checkin counters we dont need to be treated this way.  you also have nonchinese speaking passengers also put more staff manning those self service machine    beijing to amsterdam return. it was a mixed experience flying with china southern. there were good and bad things and ill start with the bad on the outgoing leg of my flight i left my rather expensive noise cancelling headphones under my seat as i exited the plane. i was seated all the way in the back of the plane in economy and i was one of the last passengers to leave the aircraft. an hour after disembarking i realized my mistake and immediately contacted the staff in amsterdam airport. they told me to file a report with the lost and found office which i immediately did. a week later nothing had turned up. i called the lost and found office to double check but there was nothing. i called china southern but nobody picked up so i emailed them instead with no result. so how is it possible that a pair of 400 headphones can disappear like that since i have no proof i cannot say that a certain group of people stole my headphones but i do find it very very suspicious that an expensive item like that can simply vanish from the plane. the worst part is how china southern handled the episode. i emailed them describing my experience only to receive a standard copy and paste response saying that nobody would ever steal from a plane. all my following replies to the email were just ignored. no response at all. the return leg of the flight was better but that was mostly because the staff in amsterdam bumped me to premium economy which is a lot nicer than economy. i cant say if its worth the money since i didnt pay for the upgrade but i will say that it was a very nice experience. the seats were bigger with more leg room way more comfortable than economy and even the toilets were more spacious. the crew were mostly friendly and nice but their limited english wasnt so fortunate. i had a headache and asked slowly and clearly for an aspirin which was understood as ice cream by two different flight attendants. i then told them i had pain in my head and pointed at my forehead after which they brought me a small free toiletry bag. when i finally found someone who was able to understand me i was told that they didnt have any aspirins because it was a serious drug. somehow this isnt a problem with other airlines though. china southern had free wifi available on the return leg of the flight which is a great bonus but in reality it was extremely slow and on top of that it was the chinese version of the internet with no access to google gmail youtube facebook instagram or any of the sites that westerners use. so all in all a mixed bag. the flight experience was pretty standard in economy and pretty great in premium economy. but my expensive headphones that simply vanished on the plane and the complete lack of any kind of assistance from china southern left me bitter and i will look elsewhere next time i book a flight.    christchurch to london via guangzhou. flights were on time and went without any hitches but there is a major problem with this airline being the smallest seat pitch i have encountered even on a domestic flight let alone a long haul 12 hour flight. even some of our taller oriental friends were struggling with it. i was fortunate to be able to move to a seat with a vacant seat adjacent and thanks to a kind person at the checkin desk at heathrow i had a bulkhead seat on my return flight. unless you are of below average stature i wouldnt recommend this airline profit comes ahead of customer comfort. the flight attendants were also a bit slapdash with the service. coffee was premixed with sugar and milk whether you like it or not presumably to save the flight attendants a bit of time and effort. wifi is available at guangzhou airport if you know that you have to scan your passport at a machine to get a ticket with a password but for non technosavvy people it would be hard to figure out. a little cheaper than the quality airlines but not worth it on a long flight.    melbourne to amsterdam via amsterdam. my 7 hour stop over in guangzhou turned into a 14 hour stopover. no one could actually clarify what the reasoning was for. they just kept changing the flight time on the screen but never announced it properly or informed us as to why. on my flight back as scheduled i had a 1 hour stop over in hangzhou. during this stop over i had to go through customs and collect my luggage. after running to check in china southern informed me i was too late and needed to check in 45 minutes before. it is in no way possible to get out of the plane go through customs security collect your luggage then check in within 15 minutes let alone an hour. they did not understand that it was their own faultschedule and told me to buy a new ticket. i will never fly with china southern again.    phnom penh to guangzhou it was not allowed to use electronic device during the whole flight. food was the worst i have had on a plane. but it was in time and the aircraft was in a very good condition. from guangzhou to paris the crew were a lot nicer food was more correct. the aircraft was also in a very good condition but my touchscreen was not functioning i had to cope with the unremovable remote controller in the armrest of the seat. the captain did not do any welcome onboard turbulence or arrival announcement. no announcement nor any kind of information were given when the aircraft missed its landing approach to paris before flying back up making a 30 minutes loop.     christchurch to dubai via guangzhou.  i took a flight from christchurch to guangzhou on 22nd december and had a connecting flight to dubai on 23rd december. due to the terrible weather conditions in dubai the flight was diverted to muscat. weather conditions are not something airlines can control. what was astonishing was their lack of customer service. they threw us in an airport and then did not even reach out to us with an update for 12 hours. they then took us to sharjah because they did not land the flight in dubai at the allotted time. all passengers disembarked at sharjah and zero attention was given to transit passengers with no uae visa and hence no way to leave the airport. the airport manager at sharjah had to speak to the staff at china southern and we basically had to hoard the captain from the previous flight in order to get them to arrange for someone to get us. 6 hours later they fly us to dubai with our luggage still in sharjah. now came the icing on the cake. they were completely reluctant and unwilling to arrange us flights to our final destinations despite us continuously begging them to do so their excuse being we are doing it. we met the most rude china airlines staff there too. 8 hours into waiting i had it and bought myself a new emirates ticket out of dubai. i havent received replies on my emails for refund on my ticket from dubai to kuwait. this experience was an absolute horror and one i will never forget.     guangzhou to changsha. china southern has definitely improved. the only issue is language barrier and difficulty in dealing with ground crew. the cabin crew are much better as there is always one who understands english but for ground crew  check in it is a nightmare. their baggage service is very poor it takes about 1 hour to get your bag on a domestic route    amsterdam to beijing. the inflight entertainment is not brilliant its very limited in its capacity the food and service is not that bad.  punctuality is ok departure was on time. but uncomfortable seats air hostesses not that attentive pilots deciding to wake everyone up by constantly pressing fasten seat belts when they left the sign illuminated for the whole 9 hours. someone was smoking in the toilets people getting luggage doing during landing. pressing the service button alert no hostess.     beijing to hanoi via shenzhen. thankful to ground staff at shenzen. my backpack disappeared from behind me at check in i thought it was stolen. the ground service took me to the police who was unwilling to do something. than i was told i need to go to the gate or lose my flight. i went to the lounge where after a few minutes a representative showed up and told me they have located my bag and it is in lost and found. they helped me back through security and immigration to lost and found and back to the gate in time to make my flight .. this was incredible and i am so grateful to the staff and for pulling this off. this made an otherwise mediocre chinese southern airlines trip with little to no service a gem. thanks again    our flight from manila to guangzhou was 3 hours delayed. our flight on june 14 from manila to guangzhou was supposed to be 845am but we left at 1135am. we arrived in guangzhou airport at 210pm so missed our connecting flight to vancouver at 2pm. they booked us to the next flight to vancouver the next day june 15 1250am. i was waiting for any complimentary food or hotel that they will offer. we waited for almost 11 hours. i asked the girl who did the booking if they have a comfortable place stay for us but she just said just stay inside the airport. she did not even offer a food voucher or anything for the rest of the hours that will wait for our flight. even the free wifi in the airport is very limited. we will never book in this airline again.    manila to tokyo horrible seats with no inflight entertainment and arrived 1 hr 15 mins late. after sitting in the airplane for an hour not a single update for passengers from the crew.  i flew bangkok to manila once a month for business for almost one year unfortunately i dont recall having one single flight on time. the average delay on this route is about 12 hours. whether morning flight or late flight you face the same issue missing your connection no compensation nor accommodation arrangements. i am a gold frequent flyer on air france china eastern and thai airways from now on i am going to stay away from this airline. hong kong to manila pr 301 27 jan 2014. a320 cabin was very confined and there was a long queue for toilets  was nowhere near as pleasant as previous flights taken in their a330. i will make a conscious effort to book pal flights on their larger aircraft in future. here we sit in manila airport waiting for our 2.35 in the afternoon flight to puerto princessa. it is now 5.45 pm. no compensation offered no excuses offered they do not care they are extremely disorganized we will never use this airline again. the staff working at the customer service desks had no idea what was going on as well as being too busy on their phones to even look up and address us. i flew to manila philippines with pal last july 2013 and it was the worst airline experience i have had. the crew were not willing to help passengers. inflight service was slow and did not even offer drinking water during the flight. i asked for one and the flight attendant said in a while and never came back. i will not fly this airline again. 5th april 2014 london to manila pr721. 7th april 2014 manila to puerto pr2781. 15th april 2014 puerto to manila pr2782. 15th april 2014 manila to davao pr2817. 20th april 2014 davao to manila pr2820. 21st april 2014 manila to london pr720. four of us flew to the philippines and out of our 6 flights 2 international and 4 domestic all were delayed. all our itineraries were affected because of it. also the pal domestic flight has 2 terminals which is so inconvenient for the passengers who have local connecting flight from one island to another. mnl to lax flight. they have 2 flights to lax daily now but they have stopped using 747s instead they are using the old airbus. old means smelly rest room no personal entertainment and very limited complimentary services. old leased plane limited to nonexistent entertainment system poorly maintained rest rooms and complimentary service that are limited. they are not that cheap there are other airlines that offers the same price and they have newer planes better service and good food. heres the catch if you want to go on a long haul flight do you want to ride a 15 yr. old leased airbus the only good side is the nonstop flight to lax and thats it. 3814 we were denied to board our flight from basco to manila due to the strong winds. 10 passengers were bumped off including us. reason given was they needed to reduce the weight of the plane. no assistance were given to find accommodation or a flight out. told to go to the pal office in the town and speak to a pal agent there. the agent offered us a ticket on a flight 2 days later even though they had a flight next day. we were forced to buy tickets from another airline to be able to fly out next day. on february 10 i flew from sfo on pr105 which was initially supposed to be a direct flight to manila. upon arriving at sfo we were instructed that we had to make a tech stop in guam. my first concern was not making it on time in manila to make my connecting flight but we were notified that the flight was going to arrive in manila around 5.30am. so then the flight left but encountered a 2hr delay in flying out of sfo. we made our tech stop in guam but then arrived manila around 7.30am instead of the previously scheduled time which was 5.30am. as a result i missed my connecting flight with another airline and had to purchase another ticket to flight out of manila. my original flight was pr105 sfo to manila arriving at 3.30am cebmnl  normally fly business class but when booking my ticket 2 months in advance surprised that my agent said no business class available. but on the 17th when i flew there was indeed business class but this cabin had been taken up by pal employee trainees by the looks of things so they have no sense of putting the paying passengersmabuhay flyers first in this cabin. so to any business class passenger be warned you maybe bumped into economy. we decided to fork out the money for business class because one of us has a medical problem so needs leg room. what a waste of money. the seats were angled downwards so you are continuously sliding down your seat. very uncomfortable to sleep. seats are very close together old airplane so if you are seated next to a stranger be prepared to climb over someone or have them climb over you. food options ran out and we were seated in the front section so we could not get the food we wanted. the inflight entertainment was outdated no new movies also one of our screens we were a family of 4 traveling was not working. 3 out of our 4 reading lights were not working. the business class lounge of philippine airlines is a joke. not a lot of food options and insufficient quantities. the lounge in san francisco looks worse than an outdated dentist office and the hot food was placed out on the counter no cover at all. of course it was cold within minutes. anything that ran out was just that finished. nothing was replenished. so once people got that the food ran out even faster. same for the few cans of juice in the fridge. but the worst part really was the business class cabin. it is like going back in time 20 years. the arm rest of my seat was completely ripped. on the way from manila to sfo they did not have the business class packs with the socks etc so we received the economy class bags. not a good look at all on both trips the food ran out according to the staff they simply do not get enough to stock their kitchens with. for breakfast it was oriental fare only  no western choices at all. the staff are continuously apologizing and they seem genuinely uncomfortable. the reading lights for instance were reported by them countless times. and then nothing happens. if i compare this with other airlines philippine airlines gets a zero out of 10 return trip 4 sectors with transit in manila experienced delays of between 15 minutes to 2 hours. when final connection could not be made staff rebooked the next delay resulting in 11 hour overnight transit in manila. when i requested where i would be accommodated they advised i would have to wait in terminal after an hour of arguing and being told that no managers are available they acknowledged they would accommodate me in manila overnight with transport and meals. accommodation was appalling. i am sorry pal passengers are customers maybe you could notify your staff about this. i am a regular business class traveler on the london  manila sector and was happy that philippine airlines introduced a direct flight from london to manila. travelled on the london  manila  london sectors several times from early december 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. however my recent journey from manila to london was terrible. evidently philippine airlines started using 15 year old a340 planes on the route in early august that appears to be part of the problem  slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality middle eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the inseat media system  understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. very basic food compared to alternative carriers. philippine airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for 500 which is then 500 less than a business ticket purchased online. advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full  presumably passengers took the 500 check in upgrade. philippine airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business. needless to mention that i will not travel again with philippine airlines on the london  manila route. i flew from sfomnlsfo only because of the direct flight schedule. ive flown most of the airlines in the star alliance sky team and oneworld and it is with extreme disappointment to say that pal does not come close to the level of any of the airlines in these groups. pal fare is significantly higher being on schedule is an issue i cant believe that the one time i had to fly pal both inbound and outbound flights were delayed on the inbound flight the pilot says after passengers are boarded we have a mechanical failure your safety is our concern so we will be delayed on take off for at least an hour. the flight attendants have an attitude  they see you struggling with your luggage and stare at you. i asked an fa for water she looked annoyed that i asked her for something and to top it off she never came back with the water. they must be cutting back on food considering how much more expensive they are compared to other airlines  by the middle row there were no choices left  you just have to take what they give you mnlsyd. this was a horrendous flight the plane was older and rattly. luckily it was a night time flight and most was spent asleep. if this was my first time on philippine airlines i would never travel with them again but luckily this is the first time ive had a bad thing to say about them. i booked business class sfomnlbkk only to have them downgrading my seat without notifying me. i booked business class and pal flies me coach and hopes i wont figure it out. i called and they offered very little in the way explanation other options or compensation. they dont seem to have any concept of customer service. when i asked to speak to a reservation supervisor i was told they dont have one tonight. they simply dont care if they fail. flight 538 dpsmnl sep 20. flight 116 mnlyvr sep 20. only one bad childrens movie played from a screen in the middle of the plane at the beginning. no more movies for the rest of the 10 hrs. they ran out of the meal i wanted then forgot to give it to me so 30 minutes later i had to ask. they have no alcohol except bad wine and bad beer. for a 12 hour flight it was horrible. delayed flight of course and a bad terminal in manila. not worth the money cause for a little bit more money you can get a normal international flight with actual service and entertainment. pr731 bkk to mnl on aug 25th. i am a very tall overweight guy. i simply do not fly economy ever. pal changed the plane to the very cramped a330 with no business class available. wish they had told me in advance so i could have bought a business ticket with thai. at the counter they gave me 150 usd credit per ticket which in no way covers the fare difference i had paid. they said even with premium economy seats they would give business service. not true at all. seats are a nightmare food was horrible and i got a cranky face when i asked for a drink refill. they can keep their money because im not flying pal again which should be tricky living in manila but doable. philippine airlines have a very long way to go if they are ever to be considered seriously on the long haul route from mnl to lhr. seats are too narrow leg room is very limited. i have been flying europe to asia and back frequently since 2006 and they rank well below sq ek ba klm cg and malaysia airlines. food is dreadful  poor quality tasteless lack of variety and on my flights to bkk sgn and bkk over the past 3 months they always run out of food choices. there is absolutely no reason why the cabin crew should not understand simple requests. it wasnt even a cheap ticket this time round. basic courtesy and attentiveness is non existent no blanket is given. whilst in the philippines we had to arrange 3 separate flights around the country and back to the uk. never again will i travel with this incompetent airline x1 late by 3 hrs x2 charged 90 5000 pesos for two suitcases 38kg that i couldnt book on via their website x3 pre booked seats the day before flying out of manila to lhr. when we arrived at the airport they said they had overbooked and wanted volunteers to take a flight two days later but with the compensation package of two rtn flight tickets. in the end 15 mins prior to departure they upgraded us to business class sounds nice and it was but surely they need to get their act together and not overbook a flight on 5th jan 2015 one of the busiest days for returning. flying return to tagbilaran with a connection in manila from hong kong. all flights were booked in one booking with philippine airlines. prior to leaving on our holiday we had our flight rescheduled 3 times. the final two times were not confirmed with us until after we contacted the airline staff several times asking for a confirmation email 1 day before departure. the final flight scheduled meant we left 1 day earlier and had to spend a night in a hotel in manila not ideal. our return journey had our flight from tagbilaran to manila cancelled after the departure time of 4.40pm while we were sitting at the gate because another airline had not yet taken off from the runway so the pal flight we were meant to get didnt land and returned to manila. philippine airlines considers this force meajure an act of god and takes no responsibility informs its customers the next flight would be at 7.05am the next day and that they would not pay for accommodation until then. we found cheap accommodation nearby for the night returned for our 7.05 am flight the next day which was delayed and departed at 7.30. we arrived in manila and were expecting to be put on another flight the original connection was missed because pal failed to arrange for a flight to pick us up from tagbilaran in time. instead we were put on standby for a flight that morning that was overbooked then in the afternoon that was overbooked. all flights were full and no seats were available to myself and my partner. pal staff continued to claim due to the act of god not their poor quality service they werent responsible for paying for us to be transferred to another airline. the next non fully booked flight with pal was not for 2 days and they also would not pay for accommodation or often compensation. ultimately we took a taxi to another terminal a much nicer terminal and bought new tickets with cebupacific who were very helpful and got us home on time. never fly philippine airlines. there staff were patronizing and unaccommodating their level of customer service was poor and their flights are constantly cancelled and rescheduled. davmnlhkg by far the worst airline i have ever travelled with and i have had my share. three domestic flights with pal on the same week all delayed over 2 hours including my flight out of davao. surprisingly my connection to hong kong was right on time so i missed it. the fas tell you sorry about the delay but we got you here safe they sent me to a hotel more than 1 hour far from the airport. funny thing is i have had delayed flights from pal for hours until every passenger appears when other airlines would just leave latecommers but they did not wait for me. bkkmnl economy. i usually try and avoid pal due to their poor reliability but it was the only flight i could get. checkin in bkk was efficient and the flight left on time. the price was good and i think the competition from cebu pacific is doing this. food was surprisingly good but there was no ife on a 3hr flight. cabin service was nothing special with the crew seeming oblivious to passengers cluttering up the aisles in order to chat to each other. personally i prefer to spend the flight watching a movie or reading a book rather than having somebodys backside in my face. t2 arrivals in mnl was reasonably efficient. this is the second time i used pal pr721 on my trip to manila and i was very disappointed this time around. first off my seat wouldnt recline so i asked one of the steward to move me to another seat. they couldnt find any in my class so i had to stay in my seat for the whole 15hour flight i asked instead for two extra pillows to cushion my back since the seat was faulty plane pillows are incredibly small so i asked for two extras  no extra pillows. this is the most uncomfortable flight i have been on and i do travel a lot. next  no personal entertainment system. for a 15hour international flight from london heathrow to manila there were only three overhead screens in our cabin needless to say you cant choose what you want to see. last but by no means least the food was atrocious plane food is not the pinnacle of gourmet but ive been on flights e.g. emirates jal singapore ethiad even pal in 2014 where the food was decent. this time its just appalling. my homebound flight in 20 days is still with pal so i still have these things to look forward to though needless to say im flying with other airlines next year and will give pal a miss. pr1846 cebu to manila. pr1861 manila to cebu. travelled business class round trip cebu to manila. ground staff were appalling. no designated area where you have queue up. everyone just jumped in. very unfriendly and unwelcoming staff. worst ground crew staff i have encountered in cebu and manila. business class flight from yvr to manila and back. i boarded the plane first in business class as i am a senior citizen. no one else was in the business class when i boarded immediately a stewardess approached me to ask what i wanted for breakfast. i said just a bun and two small packages of butter. the following morning she handed me a rice porridge. i asked her what happened to my order she looked at me with a blank look and said she would come back in a few minutes. she went through the aisles back and forth ignoring my request. i called a different steward who offered me a croissant and said they ran out of the bun i ordered the day before. the meals inflight were substandard pork salted fish fried rice. the drinks were limited to juices and a small selection of wine. the seats are narrow and the pillows were dirty. the head phones were dirty and they wouldnt issue new ones. ive flown many airlines before with pal next time ill have to go back to cathay pacific. im a japanese tourist flown on tokyomanilakalibo flight mnlkbo was with pal it was my first time flying with this airlines and i think i expected too much. the cabin crews were unfriendly and rude. this has been the worst airline ive flown with i felt like i was flying a lcc. the terminal in manila was pretty small and congested. singapore to manila with philippine airlines. a320 cabin is pleasant but the lack of legroom and aisle space is very evident. as expected there is no inflight entertainment. pal crew demonstrate inflight safety procedures manually. meals was a choice of pepper chicken or pork adobo smaller tray smaller portions  main meal small serving of salad roll and cake. asked for butter and attendant sarcastically replied that its only available upon request. i couldnt believe my ears so i asked again and she replied again with a smirk after getting the butter and handing it to me. since when do you serve dinner rolls without butter  i asked the senior cabin crew if it was the standard for them to serve dinner rolls without butter and she showed me her inventory form. only 10 pcs of butter was loaded for a full flight of almost 200 passengers. she also asked the male purser to explain the situation. london to manila and philippine airlines is the worst airline i have travelled with for accommodating babies. the bassinet seats are sold for extra price for extra leg room so if they are booked your babies needs are not accommodated. we paid full price without any discounts hence i dont think it was value for money for the service we got. the check in was horrendous making the flight on the way there at least two hours delayed and 1.5 hours of that spent sat down waiting to leave. not great when you have young kids hanging around with no room to move. im originally from the philippines and with the experience we received from them including customer service over the phone i would never recommend this airline ever. manila  puerto princesa  manila domestic travel. 5 day trip delayed 3 hours on both legs. poor communication lack of explanations and terrible customer service. the standard of this is airline is far below that of a budget airline and i will avoid flying with pr in future. a highly disorganised domestic carrier to be avoided. booked 2 tickets leaving june 30 and coming back july 5 pr 119 and pr118. staff seemed very tired i pressed the button for stewardess attention she passed by me several times until i physically had to touch her and tell her i needed a glass of water. the food quality falls below the standard for international airlines there were no snacks served in between meals. flight duration between toronto to vancouver was 4 hours and from vancouver to manila 12 hrs. at check in we were asked to pay 20 per person to get a better economy seat even though we paid 4200 for the ticket. the only advantage was that you dont need to change planes between toronto to manila. flew pr 511 mnlsin on 19 may 2013 in coach. pal doesnt have online check in for international flights. fortunately flight was fairly empty and an early morning flight and check in meant that the airport was not as crowded as usual. painless going through check in with a full compliment of baggage from the family wife and 3 kids. immigration and security was a breeze. because of the few number of passengers on this 6am flight boarding was easy. in fact the plane was fully loaded a good 20 mins before scheduled push back from the terminal. the good part of the flight ended there. i knew beforehand that there was no personal entertainment on pals a330 so i loaded the kids gadgets with entertainment to keep them occupied for the 3 plus hour flight an eternity in kids clocks. what ruined the flight for me was the fas attitudes of just going through the motions of completing the cabin service. it was rushed and no effort was made to accommodate passengers requests. my wifes aisle cart ran out of the beef option but mine was stocked with it. when she requested for the beef she was merely told they ran out. i had to point out to the fa in her aisle to get the selection from the other cart. the food was pretty tasty for airline food though. twice requested for coffee and it never came. no after meal drink run and the fas were just in the galley chatting away. i recall the time when the saving grace of philippine airlines was the friendly and efficient service of the staff. now they seem to even be losing that. i never thought id live long enough to see the day when i had better service from american fas was on delta a few months ago than from philippine airlines fas. hkgmnllax jul 12 2013. flight from mnl to lax was delayed 4 hours. old and worn out plane for both flights. no personal entertainment screen which is terrible considering its a 13 hour flight. food is ok but the portions are way too small. the only thing that could have redeemed this airline was if their cabin crews are friendly and hospitable enough  but they arent. there were malaysian passengers who were requesting the vegetarian meal but they did not request it online  before the flight. ideally an airline should be prepared for such situations. it was very disappointing how the cabin crew handled such thing. makes me wonder what kind of training they undergo. they should learn a lot from singapore airlines crew. pal crews will serve food then disappear and reappear again when the next meal is to be served. again learn from singapore airlines. pr512 sinmnl. after a rather lacklustre mnlsin leg an early morning flight marred by dismal fa service and attitude i was optimistic that the outbound leg was merely a fluke. check in at changi and the ground staff messed up seat assignments i traveled with 3 children and we were separated on the flight  good thing we were able to switch with a friendly lady so we can sit together. flight delayed an hour out of singapore and fa attitude was exactly the same as our outbound flight. service was hurried cold and distant. food was inedible. good thing we had dinner at changi before the flight. i really wish pal would pay more attention to the people skills of their staff. mla to dgte in june. flight ended up being cancelled after 7 hours of waiting due to various unrecognizable reasons. we were already taxiing to the runway when the pilot decided to cancel the flight. came back this month september and bought again a return ticket for mladgtemla. the outgoing flight went well although with the usual delay 2 hours but on my return i decided to get an earlier flight from another airline because a day before the return trip i have been monitoring the airlines reliability and they were way off their declared schedules. fearing id miss my international flight later that night i took the noon flight on another airline placing my afternoon flight with air philippines as backup. the other airline got me on time for my international flight and a phone call from my sister confirmed that i wouldnt have made it had i took air philippines as they arrived and left dgte late again. i booked 2 domestic return flights manilacaticlanboracaymanila and manilabusuangacoronmanila. the first one that was also their first flight to caticlan in the early morning was incredibly delayed whereas their bigger competitor was continuing to announce boarding and boarding to caticlanboracay and to various other domestic destinations. my second flight from caticlan to manila on 2nd january 2014 morning was also delayed but not too big a delay. my third flight from manila to busanga on 2nd january 2014 afternoon was cancelled. my fourth flight from busuanga to manila on 6th january 2014 afternoon was cancelled as the third one. canceling the above mentioned flights meant one extra night in manila and one extra night in coron town both paid by philippine airlines including return transfers and very small meals both for dinner and breakfast. based on what i experienced directly i.e. my same afternoon flight from mnl to busuanga was canceled also on 1st january 2014 on 6th january both flights from busuanga to manila were canceled it seems that at least during the first week of 2014 the route manilabusuangamanila was operated by philippine airlinespal express on a best effort way so beware based on my personal experience if you plan to fly to busuanga then cebu pacific looks like a much more reliable option. bkkmanilasfo. there is no web checkin. we waited in line for 2 hours in bkk to check in and check bags. we spoke with airline after booking and prepaid for preferred economy seat bulkhead 31 a and c when i checked the flight status before leaving for the airport it would not let me check in but it did show our correct seat assignments. after the 2 hour check in process the check in woman handed us boarding passes with different seats. told that we needed to go upstairs to their airline office and find out about the payment status. we had less than 45 minutes to clear immigration and security before boarding so we ran up. they then informed us that philippine airlines does not take credit cards over the phone so we could not have prepaid we had to run down to a money exchange to exchange thai baht and then go back to the check in counter. i have never encountered a more disorganized and unfriendly airline. we arrived into manila and it only got worse. we were ushered into a dirty holding area after presenting our boarding passes at the transit desk and then us and a small group of people traveling to sfo were walked into our terminal where our next flight would depart in 4 hours. we then realized that we were completely trapped for 4 hours between 610.30pm in a terminal with no food other than a disgusting hot dog stand that only accepted philippine quezos. it was awful and so dirty. i was told that a request for a vegetarian meal on the flight could only be done in person 4 hours prior to the flight. as soon as i realized the situation i walked up to make my request. they then told me that could only be done 72 hours before but it cannot be done online because nothing can with this airline. the plane had very narrow seats and was an old 747. i asked the flight attendant about the meal situation. she said she would check and left me with an empty tray with a roll and cup and never returned with anything or an explanation. the only positive was that the pilot did keep us updated with clear communication in english and allowed us to arrive safely as he navigated through some bad turbulence. flew philippine airlines from london to manila. comfort very narrow and uncomfortable seats which is more suitable for domestic 23 hour flights and not for a longhaul london to manila straight flight. old domestic flight plane and seat backing was peeling off leg room terrible. staff flight staff young and unprofessional on inbound journey did not even offer the supposed ipads on board for entertainment to anyone on the flight. staff on flight back to the uk were better experienced courteous and professional gave out the ipads on board during the flight and collected before embarking. food terrible and barely any choice at all. i was served a burnt beef dish and they had run out of replacements. the food was not up to international standards packaged poorly with loose foil covers that looked like it had been opened to check inside no way near the quality of food served on other international airlines with the same price. entertainment the plane is old with very primitive tv screen that comes down from the ceiling with no choice at all youre stuck with whatever is shown. no way near the entertainment provided in other airlines around the same price with separate screens each passenger and wide choice of movies shows music and games. as a filipino family 5 based in the uk we had used 7 other airlines before and we were excited to fly our flag carrier for the first time and promote it to others but we were disappointed. the only benefit was the straight flight with no transfers but for us it was not worth sitting uncomfortably for around 13 hrs with barely any entertainment and poor food choices. it might suit solo travellers who just want to get to their destination quickly. as my son would put it the only good thing was that we got to our destination. we sincerely hope that things improve to promote tourism in our country but we will probably use another airline next time. sydney to london via manila. we were running late to our flight and received a call from a pa employee who told us not to rush and that theyd put us on a flight for the next day. when asked if our flight from sydney would be the same with the connecting flight from manila to london also taken care of we were told yes relax and enjoy sydney for one more day... youre details will be on the system. just get to checkin for 9 and youll be good to go. when i asked for more details about the connecting flight and a confirmation email i was told it really wasnt necessary as everything would be ok. brilliant what a great company i thought... we arrived at the airport at 9 went to checkin and nobody knew who we were. we werent on the system. after a very worrying 5 minutes or so the lady at the counter told us she could get us on the flight but once we were in manila there wouldnt be a connecting flight for another two nights. brilliant. the lady who had called had essentially told us the opposite. not knowing a thing about manila and not being prepared with this knowledge beforehand we really werent in any position to stay there two nights. this was a lot to spring on us. when we told the lady at the counter that this wasnt feasible and that we werent told this before we were given little customer service. just a shrug and a look which said i dont care. i understand we missed our flight and of course that was very much our fault and nobody elses but to give us false information was what really caused us more trouble than necessary. because they decided to lie to us or withhold information we were forced to book a different extortionate flight from the airports flight centre. had we known the flight was going to be that way we could have prepared ourselves for a couple of nights in manila or taken our time to find a cheaper alternate flight. we maybe could have even saved on the extra accommodation we ended up booking in sydney. of course weve had even more of a rigmarole trying to tell this to philippine airlines. they dont return emails when you ring they tell us to go through our 3rd party booker skiddoo who are just as bad and tell us they wont complain on our behalf as the ticket in nonrefundable. for me thats besides the point. we were misinformed and nobody is willing to take responsibility for that. so if you dont mind an airline with lazy customer service who dont appreciate paying customers and arent willing to help them out in their times of need book with philippine airlines because they dont care about anything except your money. manila to abu dhabi with philippine airlines  their a330 was an all economy class configuration. no ife no ipads were offered not even a screen to show flight information. food was okay  mostly filipino dishes on the menu. i became unwell mid flight. i was dizzy and was having palpitations. i tried my best selfmanage but 2 hours before landing i informed one of the cabin crew. a few minutes later the purser came and i was not happy at all with the way i was spoken to  said i may have to pay for medical services if i seek medical treatment when we land. i told her that i have a travel insurance so it was not a problem at all. she did not help me in any way  no extra pillow or even asking me how i was. we were given priority to land due to my symptoms plus another person in the flight was also unwell. i was taken by airport personnel from the aircraft to the clinic via wheelchair. overall although pal has mostly good cabin crew there are also some like the purser on this flight who gave a bad impression of the airline.   second time flying philippine airlines to hong kong in 2 weeks in business class. ground service in manila had the same quick check in and average to adequate lounge services. hong kong was the same with access to the hong kong airlines vip lounge. outbound flight was similar to last time with the same flight crew and same warm service. same breakfast options and still good. return a week later on pr 301 same aircraft different crew. i think for a bare bones j class it would be the crew that makes for a good or bad experience. the flight attendants while on appearance looks more experienced than those on the inbound pr 300 flight were definitely less warm and more robotic. considering that there were basically no amenities nor added services such as ife on pr business class i felt like the only advantage to business class on the mnlhkgmnl route is the better meal as the seat comfort hardly matters on the short 90 minute hop. baggage claim was quick for both legs. if the price is right this would be a good option. brisbane to manila via darwin with philippine airlines on an a320. flying such a very small plane on such a relatively long flight meant that there was always a queue for the limited number of toilets. also it means there is no seat back entertainment you are forced to view a 10 inch screen that drops from the ceiling 3 seats ahead. seats were roomy enough and there was adequate leg room even for a larger person like myself. the inflight catering was meager with miniscule portions of barely edible food. the cabin service was appalling. meals were served in a haphazard fashion and for some reason we were not offered tea or coffee. i waited until they had finished meal service before ringing the attendant bell and it still took 20 minutes before anyone came. the male crew members were friendly enough however the females had a constant scowl. this is not a budget airline and the prices they charge should enable them to provide world class service which they dont i would recommend anyone considering using philippine airlines to explore the alternatives.    singapore to manila. i have had many issues with philippines airlines and avoided them for more than a year. i thought i would give them one more try as the flight times were more suitable for my trip.  flight retimed delayed then no retimed departure lounge in singapore was so small there was not nearly enough seats for the extra hour wait. little or no communication. food was awful seats very cramped and no in flight entertainment for a nearly 4 hour flight. service staff didnt want to be there not one smile. aborted landing in manila i know this happens and ive experienced it many times but the cockpit should explain this to passengers. manila airport is a disgrace. baggage delivery was extremely slow and when it arrived it had been badly damaged  i  waited 3 days for a response nothing. return flight to singapore i cannot write all the details because im still too angry. 3 hour delay little or no communication  its a disaster.   manila to kalibo with philippine airlines. pal is one of the worst airlines ive ever taken. the flight going to and from my destination was delayed for hours. the staff were inexperienced and unprofessional. the crew did nothing to compensate for the flights delays nor did they provide friendly service. i will never take pal again as long as i can help it.    hong kong to caticlan via manila with philippine airlines. arrived 1.5 hrs before flight still plenty of time to fly. only to be told they downgraded the size of the aircraft so my friend would get a seat but i would be bumped to a further destination airport. they offered free round trip domestic which is useless to me since i dont live here and dont have plans on coming back in the near future. made to wait 5 hours for my flight to kalibo instead of caticlan so now i have to spend travel time from kalibo to caticlan by bus another 90 mins if im lucky. running on being awake 24 hours now. upset angry and not feeling like coming back to the philippines for a long time.    had a return flight new york to vancouver delayed not by 20 minutes or an hour but 5.5 hours. the manager would not give a hotel voucher even though our flight was supposed to leave at 12.15am and it didnt leave until 5.30am.  but it would have cut into their profit so the whole plane sat in the airport because the manager said they got news the plane may arrive early so we now needed to clear customs by 2.30 am not 3.30 as their paper said and if we didnt our luggage or perhaps the customer may not be cleared to take off  then offered a 15 meal voucher but the food was so expensive that a sandwich and a can of pop was 16  plane was worn and dirty i will never fly with them again. i have copies of boarding pass meal receipt and delayed flight paper. they would not use the word cancel just in case they might have had to refund anyone monies   return from sydney to london via manila with philippine airlines. really excellent food other than portions of bananacake in packets that were literally unopenable. abysmal inflight entertainment. their old a340s just have a few ancient tv screens 4x3 aspect ratio crts hanging down from the cabin ceiling. be warned tuck a packet of paper hankies in your pocket before you go to the toilet. cabin crew dont seem interested in replenishing the consumables. maybe this explains the long queues for the lavs in manila airport. better than thirdrate but not that much better. cheap and cheerful. manila to tokyo narita. i am a mabuhay miles premier elite member and would like to forewarn other mabuhay miles members that it is not worth the effort to qualify for the premier elite level as the benefits over those of elite level are valueless unless you travel with a companion who is not an elite member. there is no difference in the elite and premier elite bonus miles both earn a flat 25 bonus on top of the service class miles and airport treatment free baggage allowance priority checkin and boarding are identical. there is one difference in that premier elites can take a guest into the mabuhay lounge whereas elites can only enter the lounges alone. the main perceived benefit of achieving premier elite is possibly the two free service class upgrade certificates but in practice upgrading using the certificates is very difficult you must buy an overpriced economy qclass fare that is only 15 less expensive than a guaranteed business class fare and mot available through philippine airlines website and upgrade availability is very limited. in reality its much less effort and only marginally more expensive to buy a business class ticket in the first place. philippine airlines repeatedly states its intention to become a 5star airline but i think that given their current policies and attitudes its an unobtainable goal.    manila to caticlan. after waiting one hour to check in at manila were only 2 counters were opened somebody called us out the line and let us wait another 15 min without any information about whats happening. afterwards weve been informed that our flight got canceled. another 30 mins later we got information that we can be rebooked to the next one  which was only possible since that one was delayed. similar story at the flight back. arriving at 6am at the airport airline staff told us to queue in the wrong airlines line. after finally arriving the right counter weve been told that the flight has been canceled again. after a super chaotic back and forth to different counters and 3 security checks luckily in order to catch our connection flight we got booked on another airline. still we had get our luggage and checkin again in manila for the connection flight.     taipei to manila. philippine airlines only send you an email that your flight is cancelled no texts or calls and no other information at all as to when your new flight is. on the email they ask you to call a philippine number. this is very stupid as they fly to numerous international destinations and i believe that it is necessary for them to have an international hotline so their customers do not rack up on uneccessary roaming fees on the 1 hour long phone call needed to know about the cancelled flight and to rebook refund your ticket  booking with pal i expected so much more since it is not a budget airline and they are actually more expensive that other airlines.    auckland to manila via cairns. this was an unplanned flight as i had to return unexpectedly from cambodia to new zealand for a funeral and then travel on from auckland to the philippines. i paid almost nzd1200 for the flight. this compares with 300 for the scoot flight from singapore to sydney. philippine airlines is a supposedly fullservice airline but they offer a much worse service than budget airlines. the a320 is not suitable for longhaul flights. i asked politely for an aisle seat and then i got a window seat which meant disturbing the two people next to me each time i had to use the toilet. the economy cabin is cramped and no individual entertainment screen. indigestible breakfast offered on the cairns to manila leg. only 3 cabin staff working in economy on what was a very full plane. shortstaffing meant that the drink with the meal came 20 minutes after the meal. i am not criticising the cabin crew they tried but there were just the three of them. a very disappointing flight compared to the other flights i had made in preceding days. i will rate the flight as a 1 as they did actually get me to manila.    on the 17th december 2016 i was supposed to depart from manila at 12.15pm but it was cancelled at very short notice with an announcement just an hour and a half from the boarding time. whilst the airline provided their statutory obligations by providing overnight accommodation etc as you can imagine the problems this caused with serious trouble and inconvenience for me and my fellow passengers. the uk agents for pal are aviareps plc. despite writing to them and following up with 2 emails neither company has had the courtesy to respond to my request for out of pocket compensation. apart from this and the fact that this route only provides entertainment from small ipads try balancing these whilst sitting in very cramped seating arrangements. there is also no way to recharge your laptop for this 14.5 hour flight so trying to use their alternative inflight wifi entertainment this service is only available for the life of your laptop batteries. do not expect to get the standard of service offered by the likes of etihad and emirates who i will be returning to forthwith for future flights. i used to fly between 12 to 16 sectors a year with pal but not again not a recommended airline if you like those little extras like good customer service responses to complaints or even an occasional drink during the flight. my australian colleagues tell me that routes to australia are better so why not the uk route\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    bangkok to manila. flight was delayed threes times first and second time half an hour and third time an hour. it was announced late we had to go ask ourselves why we werent boarding and how much longer it was going to be delayed. no accurate answers were given. the ticket was ridiculously expensive so i was expecting a nice airplane with nice spacious seats got the total opposite. on the way back it was also delayed without notice and without apparent reason. staff rude at times. never flying with them again.    tried philippine airlines for the second time and was hoping that it would be much better but it has just got worse flew from manila to london and return. very old and tired aircraft a340 food was horrible ife very poor choices of movies and music ipad. most of the staff both on the ground and in the cabin did not have the attitude of great hospitality which filipinos are supposed to be known for. i really hope that the management will consider changing their aircrafts to newer ones especially for long haul flights.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n   i was booked on a philippine airlines flight from kalibo to manila but due to weather conditions it was cancelled. the flight was supposed to depart at 845pm and they waited until midnight to tell is it was cancelled. it took another hour or so to get back to the check in counter where i was told that the next flight would be from caticlan 2 hour drive at 745am. the airline said they would provide me with a hotel for the night and transportation to caticlan in the morning. they also told me that they will take care of the airport fee 200 pesos that where paid at kalibo and that i wouldnt have to pay again. after 2 hours sleep i got into a minibus for a 2 hour drive to caticlan. when i got there i was told that the 745am flight was delayed to 940am. i was not offered to move to a different carrier and i was also told that i had to pay again the airport fee because the people at kalibo airport say they gave me my money back. when i protested and said it wasnt true the check in person kept on saying that the kalibo people say they gave my money back. so not only was i exhausted from all this mess i had to pay an additional 200 pesos. some service. appalling.    manila to tokyo narita. the level of service is significantly poor especially when the flight gets crowded. the cabin staff are not sufficient to serve a large number of passenger. the service is acceptable to me only when it is around 60 of occupancy. the meal service is too slow the food carts are not evenly spread in each section to serve so some get it early enough but others are left without being served too long drinks that are available in the less crowded flights are out of stock in the crowded flights. the meal tray is roughly put in the table forget the drink order and no any word for apology etc. it is not one time thing that i experience things above but it happens whenever i take the flight that are crowded. i have taken pal flight more than 10 times in past but it never satisfies me even in certain level. one thing that i noticed it was improved is that now the small dessert spoon is available for sure before that i had to eat it by chopstick. the airline celebrates 76th anniversary this year according to their magazine mabuhay. unfortunately the level of service is too poor unlike their proud history of being the oldest airline company of all in asia.    i have flown philippine airlines since the mid 80s till the mid 90s and had weathered the marcos era and the eruption of mt pinatubo when the airline had stopped flying to australia. back then the philippines was known as the smile of asia so your holiday should start when you get on the plane not when you get off. this was my first time to fly this airline in twenty years. the nightmare began at the checkin at sydney the max luggage for economy was 30kg and 7kg carry on it was obvious that 95 of the passengers were filipinos or expat filipinos and part of their culture is to bring back as much as goods as they can to their loved ones back in their homeland. i was shocked to see amount of excess luggage that was being loaded both at the check in and online check in queues. so much that they needed a large cage that resembled something from a zoo i would estimate somewhere between twenty to thirty kilos for at least half of the passengers not to mention the excess carry on baggage. twenty years ago the airline would serve you a snack and 2 hot meals an abundance of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages two movies toothpaste & brush and padded eye shield for sleep on an eight hour flight. today all you will get is a very small almost inedible hot meal very little to drink a cheese and ham toasted sandwich for a snack no inflight entertainment. they do have free wifi but that takes away the experience you should look forward to when travelling. so if you dont have your own tablet or smartphone tough. the aircraft advertised was an a340 but i later found out it may have been a a330 standard 70 rows somehow they managed to get 78 rows virtually no leg room seats were small and cramped the aisle way was very narrow toilets very small could not contact stewardesses as seat controls didnt seem to work. this aircraft should only be used for short flights only one to three hours max and not for an eight hour flight. when i disembarked i felt tired exhausted dehydrated with muscular soreness. i will never fly this airline internationally again. an embarrassment for a national carrier.    manila to vancouver. considering that philippine airlines is the countrys flagship carrier you would expect this airline to be better than most others. i have booked a roundtrip flight from yvrmnl so flying from north america i expected a slightly higher level of service. the flight to manila was delayed for 2 hours without explanation causing me to miss my connecting flight and set back my schedule for that day when i arrived. during the flight it was close to impossible to sleep when seated at the aisle as the flight attendants slam through your arm as they pass by without apology. the food was alright the usual airline slop. overall flying with this airline was a huge disappointment considering on what they want people to think they are.     san francisco to bangkok via manila. canceled flight with less than 24 hours without explanation then sent multiple emails rescheduling. ultimately setting me up with a flight schedule that left me overnight in the manila airport. customer service would not issue a prompt refund when requested though eventually they did after getting the run around. i could not be less disappointed with my experience with pal. never again and i will let everyone know about my unsatisfactory interaction with their customer service.    i am a pal mabuhay miles elite member and fly pal every month.  at least 8 times this year pal has sent me emails rescheduling flights sometimes by more than 4 hours without once providing any directions regarding rebooking etc. each time i needed to spend more than an hour sometimes repeatedly trying to negotiate to be rebooked on a different flight and the reservation agents did not once followthrough on their commitments. pal is not an airline to fly unless you really dont care if you arrive at your destination on the day you booked or a day later.    hong kong to manila. i bought my ticket online and they gave me a confirmation number. one week prior to flying i could use the same confirmation number to go in and to change my seat. when i arrived at the counter they denied me boarding stating the payment did not go through i was furious  i received no emails text messages calls or voice messages about this. and their staff was unwilling to admit it was their mistake. i had to buy another ticket on the spot causing me to spend an unnecessary 4406 hkd it is unacceptable how they can give out a confirmation number and then tell you that the payment did not go through. i am never flying with this airline again.     manila to cagayan de oro. i booked business class and expected priority checkin priority baggage priority boarding lounge access etc. however there was no priority checkin available there was no lounge to access no priority boarding my bags received no priority when coming out at the other end. all i got was a meal and an upgraded seat. there was no pal desk at the departure area to make any enquiries i had to spend 30 minutes on the phone at the terminal to discover that pal had no lounge even though they told me in the booking confirmation email to relax in their lounge. what a joke i even had to stand up in a bus going out from the terminal to the plane parked up far away from the terminal. all the benefits promised to my by pal did not exist and they did not care at all. there was no inflight entertainment either. if you book business class you expect better standards and higher priority however pal obviously dont care about their business class customers at all.  how can pal sell me a business class ticket take my money promise me lounge access and then not even have a lounge for me to access after 30 minutes on the phone i was advised to relax in a cafe in the terminal.     cebu to tokyo narita. check in was pretty good and efficient. boarding was chaotic. seats were 29 and tight. the biggest gripe i have with this airline is the lack of inflight entertainment. my other problem was the service the fas had an aura of being rude. asked for a glass of water which never came and this was during meal service. at the price they are charging and with the service you are getting it is better to fly with another airline    my wifes nonstop flight on august 8 2017 from san francisco to manila was late arriving in sfo by an hour and then diverted to japan for an unscheduled stop and refueling then arrived in manila 3 hours late causing my wife to miss her connecting flight. the plane personnel promised passengers they would arrange for new connecting flights when they arrived in manila. but when she went to the philippine airlines ticket counter the employees refused any kind of help. i spent 5 hours on the phone trying to resolve this with pal and got nothing but frustration from their customer service department. cebu pacific was just as uncooperative and charged my wife full fare for another connecting flight so she paid twice for one flight. philippine airlines has refused to compensate my wife for the connecting flight or give her a partial refund of her nonstop flight ticket. she could have made her connecting flight if the plane wasnt late to sfo to begin with. bottom line the employees lie through their teeth to appease you and once you are at the final destination they refuse any help. to add insult to injury they also charged my wife an additional 150 because her carry on suitcase was over 15 pounds. the suitcase weighed half of that and the candy she brought for kids made up more than the rest of the allowance. 150 because she was slightly over 15 pounds. the flight she took from slc to sfo did not charge her any extra.     new york to vancouver. seat comfort was good and departure and arrival times were close to schedule. however the pre and post boarding experience were terrible. there was almost no inflight service other than handing out and collecting meals. the few requests we made were overlooked.     darwin to london via manila. this was one of the worst airlines i have been on. the first leg of my journey was 4 hours darwin to manila and i was upgraded to business class a very pleasant surprise. there were seats and inflight entertainment on this leg though the food was still very average. i asked for a glass of wine at dinner and it never came but otherwise a very acceptable journey. the second leg manila to london was much much worse. it was a 14 hour journey made even longer by the 2 hours we sat on the tarmac in manila not moving. i received one meal during the flight a dinner which was almost entirely inedible. there was supposed to be another meal but i did not get it not sure why i saw that trolley go past but perhaps they had run out of food. i was seated in the last row of the plane the light was on behind me the entire journey. when we got to heathrow we taxied and parked and then we lost power to the plane.  there was no inflight entertainment. there was an app that you could download before boarding the aircraft which was not advertised at all  the first i knew about it was when i got to the seat and it was obviously too late to download. they handed out some ipads throughout the journey. without the app or ipad there was not a screen showing the progress of the plane or the time. i also flew back from heathrow to manila then manila to darwin. on the heathrow to manila flight there was again no inflight entertainment but i had downloaded the app and it worked tolerably well stuck in a few places due to the wifi speed. i was fed two meals on this flight but for both meals the meat portion was intolerable. they had also run out of the most popular choice of chicken i was seated half way down in economy so there was no choice of meal. the real kicker was the 4 hour delay in manila between the hours of 11.30pm and 3.30am. they were an hour later than the rescheduled flight. they provided us at around 1am with some deep fried chicken from jolli bees.  to top it off it was not actually a cheap flight  the price was around a number of other airlines but i went with them because the flight times were the best.    manila to san francisco. ive flown on 5 flights this summer with philippine airlines and every flight has been delayed by at least an hour. im currently sitting in manila airport which is terrible old and dirty because my flight to san francisco is 4 hours delayed so far. we were supposed to have boarded 20 mins ago to meet our new departure time but since we havent im guessing well be 56 hours delayed if were lucky. if you have the option go with a different airline.    manila to london. the food was the worst i have had on a flight and there was no inflight entertainment on a 14 hour flight. this was preceded by a 7 hour stopover in manila after flight from denpasar which was expected  however this turned into a 9.5hr stopover due to the delayed boarding time of the london flight. neither planes had tvs and the cabin crew gave out ipads half of which were out of battery already and they also didnt have enough for the plane. luckily i had a couple film on my phone to watch. i would recommend paying extra on another airline if possible.    london to melbourne via manila. first time flying business class with philippine airlines. seat okay not very comfortable and not a flat bed. service was poor despite being delivered with a smile. the remote control didnt work had many options on menu and was told to choose anything except anything i chose the answer was sorry maam we have run out of that option. dessert time the ice cream had melted so that wasnt available either. one steward would take my order and another steward would bring me the wrong food each time. coffee instead of tea chicken instead of soup. the cabin space was not well designed with lady next to me havin to climb over me and kicking me each time. said they had wifi but i couldnt connect to anything. their lounge had great food but hot water didnt work on the shower. not enough seats had to look around for ages.    los angeles to manila. things were off to a bad start from check in. the counter staff member on examining my passport asked for my visa and i had to explain to her that i didnt need one that i get an automatic visa on entry to which she replied oh yeah. next issue was that i had no follow on ticket from manila. i told her that i didnt know the exact date i was leaving and so had not bought a follow on ticket. i also told her that on a previous visit to the philippines and on my recent trips to the us and canada i had no follow on ticket and never had a problem with customs. as i understood it follow on ticket is an issue for customs not the airline. i checked my luggage received my boarding pass and headed to the boarding gate. not long before we were due to board there was an announcement over the pa system asking me to come to the counter. same girl is there saying shes talked with her supervisor and that i cant board the flight without a follow on ticket. im trying to reason with her and asking why not and shes telling me its to protect the airline she offers to sell me a follow on ticket there and then from manila to hong kong for 450 almost the same price as la to manila no wifi there at the boarding gate so im not able to buy a cheap ticket using my smartphone. they ordered by bags off the plane. i walked away quickly trying to find an area with wifi and managed to buy a cheap ticket before going back and boarding the plane. the flight itself was ok but ill never fly with them again because of that.    booked flight form london to auckland via manila. informed 2 weeks before due to leave that manila  auckland flight delayed 24 hours. no explanation or apology and told that any rearrangements were our responsibility. had to book accommodation in manila and also in auckland as now could not get home same day plus needed new flights from auckland. check in both at london and manila abysmally slow not enough staff. pal terminal at manila very badly signed and gate waiting area had no water or toilets so had to go out and back through security. plane from manila freezing cold airline staff could or would not remedy. no entertainment on this plane on two 45 hour flights. took us 5 days to get home completely exhausted. after complaining offered flying points which we were probably entitled to anyway and then refused to answer. never again.   to sum up my review different routes and different planes result in a very different experience. let me start by saying that i have been taking flights between london and auckland return for the past 9 years. i always try to take different routes so i can experience different stopovers and different airlines. the first leg from auckland to manila was on the a340 and was a terrible experience. i have never been on a long haul flight which didnt have an entertainment system tv screens in the seat in front until i flew on this aeroplane the plane appeared to be very old and run down very old style seats which were uncomfortable. there was no legroom at all for me i am 6 or 1.80m tall my knees were jammed into the seat in front. they handed out ipads for passengers to use to view movies on the 10 hour flight however they didnt hand these out until we were 3 hours into the flight and then collected them back about 1 hour before landing. the service on the flight was very average with little or no effort made by the cabin crew we were required to keep walking down to the kitchen to ask for water which was handed out 1 cup at a time. the staff gave the impression that they were constantly annoyed at being asked for anything. conversely on the second leg from manila to london we were on a new b777. this flight was much better entertainment system quieter more comfortable acceptable leg room however the service from the cabin crew was still very poor. overall if philipine airlines improved their crew service and plane fleet they would be an acceptable option in the future. until this happens  i will be avoiding it.   i am writing this review to call the attention of the airline. my angeles to tagbilaran flight was impressive. it has been a few months since i last flew philippine airlines. big improvements were noticed upon boarding. the cabin may be old but seats were clean and there was bottled water on every seat now. this is far different from the old pal that i had experienced. however the tag to crk flight was a big let down. my seat was dirty there were left over chewing gum wrapper contents of the seat pocket incomplete no bottled water and service was inconsistent. for example the lady two rows ahead of me was provided with a blanket however when i asked for one the stewardess said they only provided blankets for international flights. instead they would lower the cabin temp so that we dont feel cold. the temperature was never adjusted and when i approached a different crew he gave me a blanket without hesitation. pal has recently also recently been aggressive advertising the following amenities food free luggage allowance blankets on flights new seats retrofits and warm service. food although present is inconsistent for example my crk to tag flight say would serve water but return flight did not have this and would instead serve you a small cup of water around 100ml. this far from the food service of other airlines i have flown regionally eg. sq. blankets not available on all flights. official social media accounts cannot even confirm if they have amenities on specific flights. no listing which routes are served with reconfigured seats. my brothers flight did not have luggage allowance while mine had. most specific service and cabin crews are inconsistent on different routes. i love flying the national flag i hope they improve the consistency of the service whether local or international flight.    cebu to manila. the flight was delayed by one hour only through public announcements at the airport they informed us of that. i was advised to carry my big bag on board as the time required to handle the bags in manila airport would not be sufficient to make my connecting flight to istanbul in time. i suggested they give me a seat in the front area of the plane to allow for a quick exit but they gave me a seat in row 60 plus. upon arrival they did not dock the giant airplane but stopped on the tarmac and used buses. sure enough due to my rear seat i was able to use the 3rd bus only. after some additional waiting time on the tarmac i was rushed to a waiting shuttle bus who transfered me to terminal 1 in manila. suffice it to say that i boarded my codeshare connecting flight at 2237 for a 2240 departure.    tagbilaran to manila. lack of communication at tagbilaran airport which now features zero shops or other facilities. flight service ok but checkin experience was terrible. totally disorganized checkin queues and checkin staff would neither honor the baggage allowance under the ticket nor allocate the prebooked and paid choice extra legroom seat. whilst the hard product is ok inflight service is largely friendly plane looks ok snack service could be improved the soft part of the product is terrible. pal needs to start to take its customers seriously. after flight complaint handling again terrible one month to get the complaint transferred to a handler and another month to authorize reimbursement of usd5 just does not cut it in todays environment anymore.    vancouver to manila. washroom was dirty. one of the flight attendants didnt bring the midnight snacks for us.  they do come around with water which i appreciated so much but they try to not glance your way giving me the impression that they dont want to give you any. we waited for 6 hours before they collected the garbage. it ruined the experience for me. i realize that it was a full flight but the service shouldnt change.     davao to clark. luckily philippine airlines allows early checkin so i was able to drop my bag quickly and got my boarding pass. there was no delay and boarding was efficient. an old a320200 with wider seats and small monitors. i was seated at the exit row with extra legroom. when one of the flight attendants was explaining the exit row manual i looked at my phone because of a text message and she told me sir your attention please. the same attendant got my bag and put it on the overhead compartment for me. coffee tea water and a carrot cake were served. after eating my snack i went to get my laptop and i pressed the attendants button to call for help. the chief pursuer came to me and i told her that i cant find my bag she then called the same flight attendant who carried my bag a while ago and got my bag from the overhead cabin. she told me it was just covered not missing. pal is known for the warmth of its flight attendants but in this flight not.     manila to laoag. check in at terminal 2 early in the morning was smooth and quick no cues. boarding a mess gate got changed 2 times. some  remained in my seat pocket tray table not cleaned. seating space just enough if you over 6 foot its not comfortable. take off was delayed for more than 2 hours seems common for my resent trips. pal is the only operator for this destination sadly no other choice. crew was friendly but distant.     manila to cagayan de oro. i request to the crew that i want to be transferred in a window seat. the crew politely replied that just wait until the passengers will finish boarding since there are still passengers not yet in the aircraft. so i waited but the crew forgot my request and the plane already took off. when i arrived at my destination airport i found out that there is still a lot of empty window seats in the flight. i hope next time the crew should be aware of the little request of the passengerscustomers. overall the flight was pleasant and smooth boarding.   san francisco to manila. do not fly this airline. i frequently fly for business and pleasure. i use united domestically in the us and cathay pacific for trips to asia. i recently scheduled a trip with philippine airlines direct to manila from san francisco and have never experienced a poor level of customer service. i repeatedly advising the sales representative at purchase that i would arrive in san francisco airport 12 hours in advance of the flight to manila. as such access to the lounge for business class travelers would be essential for me. i was repeatedly assured that the business class lounge would in fact be available. upon arrival in san francisco airport i was advised that the lounge was not open and that the personnel of the airline would not arrive until three hours before departure. upon calling customer service i was put on hold for approximately 2 hours waiting for assistance only to be told that my earlier call to purchase the tickets was reviewed and that the representative confirmed access to the lounge as i requested. nothing further could be done. i complained to the business manager upon checkin and received no response. i was however told that a complaint would be forwarded to customer care which in fact was never done. upon departure from manila back to san francisco in business class many of the seats simply did not work to adjust position. passengers in business class were left to scramble to find seats that actually adjusted. those who did not find a workable seat were left to request the staff to manually adjust the seats in business class. i have attached photos of the attendants manually adjusting seats that otherwise did not work at all. one of the attendants agreed with me that the seats were nothing short of horrible.    manila to cagayan de oro. they only use 1 boarding gate for 3 or 4 different flights with the same time. if one flight gets delayed all flights that are using the same gate will get delayed as well.  even though their flight is already delayed they dont try their best to speed up the boarding procedure. this happens a lot of times. they keep use naias air traffic as an excuse for their delay but in my opinion the delay is caused by their boarding procedure.    nadi to auckland. if you are a parent of a child who is not a teenager do not use fiji airways. our flight was delayed understandable due to a strike by their ground staff hence we werent provided any meals on board. they have a intercom announcement system yet they failed to inform us at the counter over the system and at the boarding gate that meals wont be provided and we were allowed to take a meal with us. i have a 1y 4m toddler she grew hungry within an hour on the flight. an attendee just 2 rows ahead of me ignored me when i first asked for assistance and continued even when another passenger informed him i required help. the second time i reached out an tapped on his shoulder and excused myself asking for just a cup of water to make formula for my crying toddler who by now was in a full on hunger tantrum. the attendee turned around and told me sternly that i would be attended to by his coworker. when the second attendee approached me with the meal cart i asked for water and voiced out as to how rude the other attendee was to which she replied its okay its okay any parent with a hungry baby would know its not okay to see your child in tears. it was so hard to get a cup of water from these people i dont know what they would do if a more urgent issue arised. my problems could have been taken care of at so many stages of the days events. they could have sent an email out informing us about the strike and that there would be no meals on board at the check in counter announced it at the boarding gate by the staff. i am a parent i will always need to know that i can feed my child. if i had known at any of these stages that there werent any meals i would have requested to take a bottle of water with me. if you are a parent my advice to you is to not use this airline or if you really have to then you have to take on the responsibility to keep checking with the staff for any issues which my hinder your journey cause lord knows they wont do it    sydney to los angeles via nadi. booked exit seats and paid online got to counter they had been given away mind you we were one of the first to book in. after 9 phone calls not understanding the fijians and 6 weeks later finally got a refund. food is terrible seats uncomfortable. go through all security checks in sydney bags checked etc etc. get to nadi get off a plane and walk straight to security check go through my bag again where they claim you cant have a small roll on deodorant has to be in a small plastic zip bag. why is this i have just carried it off a flight from sydney its less than 30ml it is unopened. of course i dont have a zip plastic bag so i have to give it to them they cant tell me why i cant take it. im on a 14 hour flight i should be able to stay fresh i have abided by the rules set in sydney. walk out and guess what i find in the lounge the same deodorant i asked them do i need to put this is in a bag to take on the plane girl looked at me odd. i would go with you get what you paid for be prepared for the worse.    nadi to los angeles. we paid for our two adult children to fly at the bulkhead seats and to have bassinets for their babies. when we get to the airport they changed the seats and gave them away both on the inbound and the outbound flights. we tried to work with them and showed them our confirmation of the seats and payment of the extra fee. they said that other people were confirmed and that our seats were only requested even though we had a confirmation email. when we asked a supervisor they said that it was because there were three younger babies on the flight and they gave the seats to them. when we boarded the plane and saw that those babies were over 65 years old we knew two things. one we feel they doublebooked those seats and stole our money and they lied to us about why our seats were given away. very poor customer service. we have flown with them more than a dozen times and they always seem to change seats either on us or those we fly with. we only find out when we get to the ticket counter. i will not be flying with fiji airways again. although a full service airline we enjoyed a plane 2030 years old but not the service quality from those days. 2 seats were blocked off due to trim falling off a toilet door bolt taped up with do not use the food looked awful and didnt dare try. lcc service except checkin bags not charged. overall very average. melbourne to nadi b767300. we were served a meal as soon as the flight levelled off and it was awful. 3 hours into the flight i asked an attendant for water i had to wait 30 minutes and when i pressed the courtesy light the fa said she would be with me shortly. 10 minutes she appeared with a warm bottle of water with an unpleasant smile. thirty minutes before landing there was an announcement that the bar was closed. air pacific advertises itself as a full service airline however the service on this flight was that of a limited service airline. i have been travelling to fiji for 22 years and service has certainly declined. sydneynadi and nadila return with a stop over in nadi on return to sydney. staff are lacking in professionalism and basic courtesy. from nadi to sydney we were advised we are only allowed one piece of carry on luggage and had to pay excess baggage and checkin the second piece of carry on. encountered substantial delays which seemed to be the result of poor organization. onboard it was hit and miss if personal screens actually worked and some of the seating did not recline  not comfortable for a 10 hour flight. the food was a warm unrecognizable soft slop consistency. my experiences with air pacific staff have been lacking in dignity professionalism and basic courtesy. i have seen an airhostess roll her eyes and tch at a young boy because he stopped her to ask for another drink. i walked to the galley to ask for a second drink. the female attendant picked up a glass that already had something in it and proceeded to put ice in it. i made a point of asking for a fresh glass. her response was immediately sarcastic oh you dont want this one..okaaay and when she handed me my fresh glass remained with her back to me while continuing her conversation with her colleague. shabbiness has become common behavior. on my flight outbound to fiji fa sounded and behaved like it bored her to be there. i understand everyone has a bad day but this has been my experience often. i travel to and from melbourne to nadi every 3 months in business. part of my enjoyment of the upgrade is the business lounge before boarding. for about 1 year now the business lounge has downgraded there used to be a wide variety of snacks as well as a good selection of wine and champagne. now one can only expect toasted sandwiches no wine no champagne no nuts of course the spirits are still there but i always leave hungry disappointing considering the extra money i paid. once onboard i have to agree that most flight attendants are rude and make you feel as if you are bothering them. as the planes are usually small by the time the attendant gets to you often your meal choice has run out. the wine on offer is so cheap it should not even be offered in economy let alone business class. also used to receive complimentary toiletry bags now they have also been stopped i would like to know why when we are paying more and the prices are going up but the quality is continually going down. aucklandnadi and nadila return. we encountered substantial delays through the entire process which seemed to be the result of poor organization. onboard it was hit and miss if the personal screen actually worked and some of the seating did not recline  not comfortable for a 10 hour flight. at the back of the aircraft it was hotter than the ambient fiji air temperature when we arrived midsummer. the food was a warm unrecognizable soft slop consistency. crew  what crew after greeting us on the plane and serving us the two meals they pulled a disappearing act and were never seen again. the crew demeanour was disinterested and rude towards passengers. this was the worst experience of flying i have encountered. from start to finish the service was nothing short of appalling. some of the problems were  not notified of a departure time change delayed in nadi for 10 hrs with no information or assistance provided. no inflight entertainment that worked seats did not recline or had broken tray tables. over hot cabin temperature causing many passengers to feel faint. extremely poor service from cabin crew who did not attempt to provide any beverages or assistance. dirty toilet facilities. poor food quality which even for a budget airline was below standard. nadi through to lax. staff members were not interested in customer service nor did they smile at boarding passengers. after a relaxed safety briefing i attempted to use the inflight entertainment many of the televisions did not work. the aircraft was extremely cold and seating area was very cramped. many passengers became quite alarmed when the air conditioning vents started leaking large amounts of water people had to move seats to avoid getting wet. furthermore the meal was a cold hot dog bun with shredded chicken and grated carrot. staff were arrogant unhelpful and seemed to be busy discussing issues in the corner. we flew la to sydney via fiji and then auckland via fiji back to la for four flights. the total time delay we experienced on these four flights was more than 8 hours ranging from 12 hour to more than 4 hours. the plane was kept uncomfortably cold during the more than 30 hours of flying. the worst part of our experience was that during the transfer of our luggage at the fiji airport in a very heavy rain one of our suitcases got very wet. flight in last month. i flew on 624 from nadi to la. the staff were not helpful or courteous. the inflight entertainment did not work. the food was not edible. i only flew this airline because i was travelling to fiji and there arent any other airlines operating direct flights on this route but i will never fly them again. sydnadilax 141012. flight was ok food  the worst airline food ive seen. staff very slow or just not enough of them they give you your boxed meal drinks etc at cruising height then about 1 hour later they finally come back to collect the rubbish. at this point you are locked in by your tray table. laxsyd 251012 overall the same problem as 1st flight  terrible food slow staff. my girlfriends tv didnt work the plane sat at lax with apu ground power problems then a full blackout for 15 minutes. travelled sydney to nadi return with 11 members of my family. prearranged seating was ignored family scattered in several areas from front seat 2nd floor to second last row on lower deck. food is perhaps the worst that i have ever experienced. staff friendly but inefficient airline promises a child pack for entertainment. on 1 sector 2 of 4 delivered and on return with maybe 40 children on the flight none were distributed. air pacific is the only full service airline on this route but has its own definition of full service. a very poor airline. they changed flight times by 8 hrs without giving notice. this caused missed connections with other airlines and left us stranded without hotel reservations. airline staff could not care less were rude and surly. this is a budget airline with no customer service cancellations and changed flight times and is not worth flying. travelled air pacific for the first time in august 2012 with my wife to los angeles with a stop in fiji to celebrate our wedding anniversary. flight was delayed over 1 hour before takeoff with no communication on the reason for the delay or how long until take off. we were kept seated on the aircraft without air conditioning on a very hot day during this period. in any case i accept these things happen and is not the reason for my dissatisfied flight. on arrival to los angeles for our three week vacation my luggage was missing and no assistance provided to find it besides asked to complete a form. it was only one week later when they called and advised another patron had mistaken taken it. flew to hawaii via fiji. flight delayed for over 3 hours in sydney due to internal pa system not working. all passengers were on board and communication was limited. this delay caused us to miss our connecting flight to hawaii and the next flight out was sunday evening. service was below standard  flight attendants didnt display any concern for your situation and the food was awful. if you do send an email to provide feedback or raise a complaint they take about 45 weeks to respond  you have to keep following up with them. i would recommend using another carrier when travelling to fiji. upon boarding we werent greeted at all. i sat down to find my seat was broken which the flight attendants ignored me whenever i tried to point it out. they continued to be quite disinterested throughout the flight. the inflight entertainment screen one every three rows from the roof was broken so we couldnt watch the movie so the flight was a little boring i would choose to fly with a different airline in the future. lax to nadi and back in october 2012. on the flight down tv screens did not work no overhead light working and their were no air vents. staff tried to fix tv sets after their solution didnt work all they could say was sorry do you want a comment card. on the way home from nadi to lax we were hoping for better seats and got worse. the seat in front of me was completely broken and occupied by a rather large lady when she sat down she was practically in my lap and our tv screens didnt work again. food was awful service poor. worst experience in 30 years of flying. checked with airline 3 times prior to going to the airport as there had been a storm in fiji. told all was well and on time. arrived at airport and stood in line for 2 hours to be told of a 12 hour delay. got to la far too late to catch any planes to san francisco. put up in a reasonable hotel but then the same thing happened in la told we were booked to san francisco to find the flight was cancelled the night before and we werent notified. didnt get to sfo until nearly midnight after spending a night in la. things happen but keep us informed and dont make people stay in airport lounges for 1012 hours needlessly. will never fly with them again. my wife and i were booked on a flight from sydney to lax with stop in nadi on dec 9 2012. about midnight on dec 8 i called to confirm the flight and was told the flight from nadi to lax had been cancelled. no attempt to notify anyone on the flight. told air pacific would provide vouchers but no other assurances were made. there was a long wait in nadi for air pacific to make arrangements for all the passengers. there was a minimal voucher provided that did cover the hotel cost plus one meal. the flight to lax the next morning was on an ancient 747. in the 3 seats in which my wife and i were located and the 3 in front only 1 light worked. two seats did not recline. none of the 6 seats had a working tv so there was no entertainment. the food was bad. when we finally arrived in la we were told that air pacific would not reimburse any expenses we incurred except for providing hotel in la. we were forced to pay the change ticket costs of our connecting flight in la. aklnan on 12 dec. the service and food was unacceptable considering the cost of a return ticket i have travelled a lot with air pacific in the past and the service and food has deteriorated considerably. food and beverage supplied  small hot dog container of inedbiel pasta and an orange drink  smacks more of a low level budget airline. my wife and i also travelled from nan to chch return on 23 and 30 dec. same horrible inedible food and definitely no xmas spirit. shocked at the quality of the food on this flight considering its a 4 hr journey. we travel for the last time with air pacific to akl on the 13th jan. flew nadi to lax on 10 dec 12. no boarding organization. paid a lot extra to sit in business class. narrow uncomfortable seats. seat broken  would not recline so little or no sleep during 10 hr flight. headset broken sound was all static no movie menu from which to chose screen was extremely small movie already in progress and no controls to restart. because of this didnt watch or listen to anything. because of dietary restrictions could not eat anything on the dinner menu. cheese offered during inflight snack was stale. ordered drink which i did not receive. always had to ask for water or get your own. slow unacceptable service. this was not even close to any other business class comfort and service. will not fly air pacific again. flight sydnadi on 7th jan 2012. flight was cancelled and ground staff unhelpful. contacted the reservation team in fiji that appeared helpful at first but were really were not accommodating. had to book alternative flight to reach destination. my return flight from nadi to sydney was with the carrier on a boeing 737800. the flight was mediocre nothing memorable. staff pleasant enough but not above the call of duty. the customer relations sector are very difficult to deal with. the entire trip was a disaster. we arrived in lax via aa and were given boarding passes for ap. we got all the way to the ap gate and they refused our boarding pass. we had to go all the way back to the ap counter and wait in line for hrs just get a boarding pass. then plane was 2 hrs late. on the return we were never notified that our flight was cancelled we had even gone to the counter early and they said to come back when we came back they said our flight was cancelled and they did not assist at the counter with new flights. we were stranded when we were able to call which took 2 hrs to get a new flight the new flight was 3 hrs late we had horrible seats with no leg room. our trip to and from fiji was at the best very average. the plane a boeing 737 was dated. the food and refreshments were well below what we had expected and the service was so slow. entertainment head phones didnt work on the way over and on the return flight there was no onboard entertainment. i flew laxnadiakl late dec 2012 when a cyclone hit causing delays. that would have been completely acceptable had they responded in a professional manner. but the awful way in which the situation was dealt with had me lose all sympathy. hours of delay in both lax and nadi airport. people refusing to answer our questions or giving us different stories. only one person working to serve hundreds of delayed passengers they just didnt care and in nadi many people were left to sleep on the airport floors. to top that off i received no response after weeks of communication. surprised at the poor service provided both at checkin and aboard flight. also alarmed by the excessive baggage charges per kilo 20 per kilo for excess bag. poor experience overall. flew from lax to nan then to syd. tvs and radio dont work for me or the 2 people next to me. the seat did not lie back. did not get a choice in meal and could not eat the main which was given. did not even get offered a drink from nan to syd. cabin crew disinterested. and during the change over at nan airport the staff were very rude searching all my carry on emptying everything and just leaving it so i had to re pack. i will not fly with them again flight nadi to brisbane 23 july a330 delayed due to female cabin crew running late. at least we had an update once she was located at the airport entrance. food was really bad gooey substance squashed inside softish bun crew consuming something completely different dont blame them probably business class version. cabin crew generally disinterested. plane circulating over brisbane gold coast repeatedly for around 45min until permitted to land. nadi  melbourne  15062013 and 06072013. all melbourne flights delayed due to operational issues. this seems to be normal for fiji airways you turn up to the airport stand in the line for 45 minutes and get told the flight is delayed. staff are rude for the reason that the travelers are frustrated with lack of information. somehow the airline knows that they will not make the flights and fail to inform its customers. melbourne to nadi flights have been affected on the two dates mentioned. nadisydney return on a330. plane delayed due to mechanical fault. captain said it would take a few minutes but instead we were 1 hour late. food terrible service average. very disappointed with this trip. sydnansyd. price was approx 40 higher then other airline due to inflight entertainmentmeal. entertainment was ok. would have been better with sound. meal was smaller than the kids meal chicken curry and rice. one of the worst crew ive ever seen in my 35 years of travelling. jetstar virgin australia is 100 better. melnanmel. booked to fly out saturday midday. fj cancelled this flight and moved us to friday night. 737800 island of gau. packed in sardines. flight was delayed so much that ended up leaving just before 10 am sat. new crew had to be called in. seats were old uncomfortable dirty and falling apart. food was ok. crew not seen. flight back was packed. lady was throwing up during boarding and went through tonnes of sick bags. they ended up giving her a large garbage bag. toilets would not lock. the next person in line would have to hold the door shut a sign said fix in bne. plane was quarantined in mel. crew not seen. melnan 763 due for retirement next month. still had lots of life left. biz half full mini economy cabin packed main cabin only had 15 people. could stretch out easily. food was chicken covered in avocado and rice served with salad chips and a bread roll. plane was clean. flight back was packed. left on time. food was just brown slop with a bone in it and rice. blankets not clean nor was the plane. entertainment poor crew not seen. very disappointing. flew melbourne to nadi return in 2012 both legs delayed 1 hr. no reason given. food i edible and service friendly but poor. did same trip in august 2013 business class. flight 2.5 hrs delayed with no warning. sitting at the airport in melbourne with three very small children until 2 am was awful. plane downgraded to 737 from 747. no kids meals. despite having 4 out of 8 business class seats we did not get a meal choice. no individual televisions except bright overhead ones that kept our kids awake the whole flight. who needs tv at 4 am luggage lost. flight back delayed 2 hrs but no communication. i can honestly say this airline is a disgrace. would never fly them again. sydnan 22 sept 2013 early afternoon on fj910 4 hours in transit lounge at nan then straight onto fj 810 on the airbus. returned tues 8 oct 2013 fj 811. bags only allowed 1 bag as to check in anymore would cost 120 usd each  no notification on ticket or booking ref about this. water security take all your water off you even water purchased in transit lounge but sadly apart from a drink with so called meal there was no more water offered on lax to fiji flight. food would hardly feed it to my dog. entertainment if you get a seat that the wires work to the earphones you have done well. speaker above us screamed some hideous noise for about a minute every 20 or so minutes for the whole trip and even though aircraft sat on tarmac during transit no repair was done so from fiji to syd same very loud screeching occurred. legroom new airbus had less room by far than what should be offered on a 10 hour leg 747 was better but still poor. do not fly with them if you have the option i used fiji airways to travel from los angeles to nadi on flight number fj811 on december 31 2013. after we checked in and were waiting to board the plane the gate number was changed and we were given another gate number to go to. once there the supervisor announced that the flight was being delayed and kept announcing that every 30 minutes. later that night we were told the flight was cancelled and was not going to fly at all due to maintenance. we requested that we be rerouted via australia or new zealand so we could arrive into nadi on time but nothing was done to help us. after waiting for hours at the airport fiji airways arranged hotel accommodation for us. later they provided a taxi and we arrived at the hotel at 2.30am. our baggage was already checked in and we did not have any clothes on us. back at the airport we were told to go to the gate and our names will be called if there was space in the plane. to our surprise they fitted all passengers from december 31 and january 1st on one plane. therefore they combined the passengers of december 31 and january 1 on that one plane which flew on january 1st. we booked our holidays return flight trips to fiji with qantas airline. the route from london to sydney was superb. unfortunately qantas have code shared with fiji airways and the trip from sydneynadisydney was operated by the fiji airways newest fleet. theres nothing good to say about the flight crew airline and services. the plane may be new but the inflight entertainment wasnt working properly and was told to pay if my family wanted to watch movies theres no option when it comes to food. the only option including kids was a horrible wrap stuffed with scrambled eggschickentuna. the flight attendant looked disinterested and almost unwilling to help most of the time. overall i personally wouldnt recommend fiji airways to anyone travelling to fiji in the future. nadi to melbourne. flight was on time however there were multiple problems with the flight. service staff was rude. they never handed out headsets so there were movies on but you couldnt hear them. i did ask an attendant for a headset but she said it would be a while because she had to serve everyone food and then shed be able to bring it to me. well i never did get the headset. the food is awful. nobody expects great food on a plane but what they serve is just a small bun with some sort of nondescript patty coleslaw juice and a biscuit. lastly we travelled with small children and they do not let people with small children board first. they also call people from certain rows and then just let anyone from any row board so it is a real freeforall in terms of getting on the plane. improve the service and the food and this airline could be considerably better. i was booked on a flight lax to nan fj11 13th may. i booked a flight from chicago to lax on united as i was not sure what day i was going to travel. i was informed when i arrived in ohare that all flights had been cancelled but flights were being opened up and it looked like all would be well although less than the three hours. i called fiji airways to give them a heads up. i was informed it was the weather that caused the problem however then learned it was a fire in one of the main traffic towers. again i called and informed fiji airways what was transpiring and that my flight was getting me in later. finally we started to board and i called and said that i was going to miss the flight  this was a good 4 hours before fj811 was due to take off. i was told that the fare was to be 120 for the change plus the change in fare which came to a total of 350. while i was giving my credit card information i was cut off. i immediately called back as i was in line to board and was then informed the fare was now 780. i do not know what sort of scam that was in motion but i am disgusted at the manner that the transaction occurred and feel i should be compensated back to the 350. a change of one day cannot be almost a full fare. i called numerous times to say i was going to be late and was accepting the change in price but to go to double in a matter of 2 minutes is contemptible and it would appear on the surface a way to extract more money due to duress. very very disappointed in your airline. used fiji airways as it was part of package  never again. syd to nan on 737 was ok food below average cabin crew would never get a job in one of the fiji resorts. return flight nan to syd  15 minutes prior to boarding they announced that due to fuelweather conditions 50 bags have been removed from the plane. this left the whole passenger list wondering if they were affected. on arrival at sydney only 1 of my 4 bags made it home. only 1 person left to deal with this mess and she was from a handling agent no direct rep from fiji airways present. i will never fly fiji airways again by choice. i recently had to fly from port vila to suva for work. fiji airways has recently purchased some new atr planes for these shorterleg routes. the problem is these planes dont have enough storage capacity to fit everyones luggage if the flight is full. on the vilasuva leg the passengers werent told that all of our luggage had been offloaded and left in vila until some time after we arrived in suva and stood around waiting in the baggage claim area. the customer service was pretty much nonexistent and it took 2 days to get our bags. the return flight to vila the following sunday used the same airplane with the same result. its now been 3 days and no word about our luggage. its not lost they know exactly where it is but they wont send it to us or contact us on its status. no fa staff met us in vila and have been ignoring repeated emails. avoid fiji airways if you can i flew flight nz4010 taking off from nadi 21.40 24th march 2015 to los angeles landing 13.25 the day after. an overnight flight. i had several young children around me during that time 3 of which were upset screaming and crying for a lot of the time. i asked a female member of the aircrew if i could have a mask and earplugs in order to try to sleep. all she did was to shrug her shoulders and say they were not available she didnt look interested couldnt have cared less and did nothing to help. absolutely shocking. fiji airways inflight services is very poor flying from nadi to melbourne the aircraft was really old the only entertain on the flight was the movie showing on main stream screen there was no alternative inflight entertainment such as back seat personal television or ipad which majority airliners provide these days. i have flow several budget airliners and full service airliners and they offer more meal choices and variety inflight entertainment. the meal service was so poor food was intended for people who are on diet. i have flown on their sydney to nadi route and the same situation their domestic connections are so disorganized and have very poor lay over and connection times if you are unable to make it from one connection to the other then you will be very disappointed. the 737 aircrafts that they use are so old if you are a frequent traveler and have been travelling for years you will be able to tell difference. fj916 on 14 december sydnan absolute poor and rude customer service provided at checkin in syd. stressed and not properly trained staff. flight was ok although staff were very inexperienced. most unprofessional airline i have encountered. my experience with fiji airways across 4 flights in 20122014 1 food is below average my vegan meal had snacks with egg in it and staff came to argue that i ordered incorrectly only to find out later that it was their error. 2 juice is served like ration you get one at the start and one at the end. lucky if they have some spares. 3 the alert button to call staff works fine but staff snooze off at the back after putting passengers to sleep. on 2 flights people were beeping for 3045 minutes and no one showed up. fiji airways staff took their own time to help. 4 once when boarding a flight 0 crew were inside the plane to help with directions and luggage. crew entered 15 minutes after everyone sat down. fiji airways couldnt care less approach to travelers on its nadi to honolulu route. the airline chose to dump its passengers in a closed airport at 1.50 am. there was no food or beverage service and passengers continuing on to the other islands have at least a 5 hour wait sitting on concrete flower planters. on the return flight had to wait 7 hours from the last inter island flight for departure scheduled for 2.50 am which seldom leaves on time. the seating on the plane is so old that the foam that was originally used is now so compressed that it gives no back support. if you were lucky enough to get an exit row seat in the past it would give you a reasonable amount of leg room for someone 1.88 mtr or 6ft 2ins tall. now fiji airways is penalising passengers by charging 99.00 for this comfort. though the company promotes the fiji international golf tournament it will charge you 440.00 to take your golf bag with you even if it weighs the same as a regular bag 23 kilos or 50lbs. try getting your frequent flyer miles credited in a timely manner. impossible. i flew on october 4th and am still waiting. that happens 90 of the time. contacting customer care is a waste of time. they will tell you they will respond within 21 days. 21 days to respond is unbelievable but they never do. the sad thing is that if you need to go from nadi to honolulu you have no choice as fiji airways has a monopoly on this route and they treat it as such. we decide to travel to fiji for a holiday. on our way to back to sydney we were to fly via nadi from suva. we had spend most our holiday in suva while checkingin for our flight to sydney which was via nadi we were told by fiji airways that we will have to recheck ourselves again at nadi for the sydney flight. we were very disappointed to come to know about this we were told well in advance prior to making our booking and while paying for the trip that we will not have to recheck ourselves at nadi and will receive our bags in sydney. the customer service staff said that we had been misinformed which was very disappointing and after my husband and i explained to them that this was our first trip to fiji and we had big bags and we would appreciated it if they can check to see if it was a mistake of some sort. fiji airways customer service said they couldnt do anything and were rude in their approach towards us. we were really disappointed and did not want any drama so we asked them if they can put us on a later connecting flight and were disappointed to know that there was no another flight late in the evening so sad and very disappointing since our connecting flight was 7 hours earlier.  we have just flown sydney to nadi return with fiji airways. the flight over was okay though the service wasnt great as meal service was slow and the food was really poor. fine for 3.5 hour flight. return flight was awful however as we were on a smaller plane the type usually used for domestic travel. it had only one aisle so trying to get to the toilets was a nightmare. the toilets were filthy when we did get there. the food was again really terrible  bland chicken and pasta no bread roll  just a weird cabbage and corn salad. my 7 year old son refused to eat any of it and was hungry for the rest of the trip. no snacks available. the seats were small and uncomfortable there was no inflight entertainment other than shared screen playing just for laughs a gag comedy show. no flight map. the trip took almost 5 hours. will not fly fiji airways again would rather go with low cost provider because at least you know what youre getting this airline needs to lift its game. flew fiji airways from nadi to melbourne. the flight itself was comfortable. the care by staff was another story terrible would be an understatement. not one smile by the attendants. gave a duty free order promptly which was ignored. food tray left on lap for 2 hours. passenger had a small child that was sick and help button pressed which was ignored so friend had to run down to the back of plane to get help but came back without it until a few minutes later. a bottle of water and a cup was all that was offered. no attempt made to help except to say might have to get border control in. poor woman was trying to clean up and help upset child. the staff came up the aisle so infrequently we didnt know who they were. really upset me this flight as most of the fijian people are helpful and obliging.    absolutely disgraceful experience. we were travelling fiji airways from nadi to sydney at the end of our holiday and waited two hours we reach the front of the line people still checking in adjacent counters and get told after a bit of back and forth that the aircraft is overbooked so they attempt to free seats by upgrading other passengers and after a bit more magic  zero seats on the plane. their excuse sorry we thought people wouldnt show up. seriously the next flight wasnt for another 10 hours naturally at this point were a little annoyed as well as probably another ten passengers who had the similar misfortune.. but they say theyll give us a hotel and lunch to compensate. they just need twenty minutes to sort it out. three hours later with near zero communication and with no small part of hassling from our part we finally get a shuttle to the hotel. im still not convinced that anything wouldve happened if we didnt keep asking them every 30 minutes. the only other passengers who came with us were the two who kept asking  i dont know if the other six got any sort of accommodation or food to compensate. when we came back for our priority check in flight  we saw another eight or so people getting the same story we got told weve overbooked sorry. we didnt think people would show up. i wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone. the service was poor and you have to hassle them to get anything done. the inflight food was poor and inflight entertainment was nonexistent. the whole experience just about soured our holiday.     nadi to los angeles. the onboard crew need to be more efficient to customers. waiting 15 mins to get a glass of water is ridiculous. the special meal request was accepted by the airline but no special meal was offered when asked i was told they dont have my request.  i will avoid using fiji airways not worth it for such a long flight.    barcelona to milan. worst airline ive taken. i got charged 55â¬ each for not online checking in on top of that we were two hours early and they did not give us seats next to each other. its a crazy amount of a penalty fee more expensive than the flight and i have not experienced this anywhere else and i have flown with other budget airlines.     lublin to stansted. very bad overbooking experience. we were asked to wait till end of boarding to be told that my wife and son has to stay and i can go. my wife was proposed to go to another airport to catch other plane flying to london on her own using public transport or wait two days but airlines will only pay for one night in hotel. she was told airlines will pay compensation straight away what did not happened. she stayed few hours in hotel then she decided to spend those two nights in our friends house. they never contacted her or me to arrange any help.    malta to stansted. worst airline i have been on. the staff try to take my luggage to put in the hold of plane even though there was enough free space on the plane. then we sat for 2 hours while the crew made excuses up why we were waiting. we sat in stansted on the plane for an hour waiting for someone to get stairs.   manchester to nuremberg. the actual flight was not a problem but my check in baggage was. i had prebooked a suitcase on the flight. my wife had too. her passport is from the uk her bag went straight through at the checkin counter. i have a australian passport and my bag was weighed tagged and given back to me to carry to another part of the airport for some sort of separate inspection. at the special inspection station i put the bag on the belt and it zipped away  there was no inspection. i have traveled in and out of the uk for 40 years on other airlines and never had to do this sort of ridiculous procedure before. to add insult to injury i had submitted my german residency card and passport for stamping at the checkin counter but the desk attendant didnt stamp my boarding pass and i was given a lot of grief at the gate for not having a visa check. kafkaesque and dispiriting  next time i will go on lufthansa and save the grief.    zadar to stansted. the worst company ever  they cancelled the return flight from zadar and they did not bother to assist us in any way no re route flight available no capable people to assist us in any way at the ticket desk we were stuck with a child in the middle of the night in a small country with no possibilities for return. shame on you ryanair i hope you will cease your activity soon.    rome to athens. hands down worst airline ever we were unable to print out boarding passes at the airport and they were trying to charge us to do so. i was not able to get on our first flight and had to rebook with another airline just to arrive in our destination. the same thing happened on our return flight using them. after spending over three hours on their online chat services which one rude representative disconnected us i was finally able to get them to wave our fee to get on the plane when asked for some kind of compensation for our earlier flight i was promptly told no and disconnected by them yet again. this airline cost us over 500 in fees and lost us two days of our trip to athens. i will never fly with them again. i would pay triple just to book with a company committed to costumer service which is clearly not a priority with this airline but charging fees for their poor service is the utmost importance to them.    naples to gdaÅsk. my first and last experience with this airline. there was no space for legs. plane was very dirty. i could find chewing gum in magazine or in the table there was no space for magazines which cabin crew gave out after takeoff that is why magazines were everywhere food & drink prices were very high. cabin crew unpleasant and unhelpful.     budapest to copenhagen. ryanair supply the worst service when they cancel a flight. they refuse to rebook you on an alternative route but if you pressure them they will allow you to book yourself. they will however later then refuse to reimburse you the cost of the alternative tickets even they have to according to eu regulation. worst part is that they know they are doing something wrong. when you keep fighting they will eventually pay you but not before you spend a lot of time arguing with their terrible customer service.   dear ryanair. thank you very much for giving me the opportunity of spending my 35th birthday at the airport. thats always what i wanted to do for that special day in my life.\\xa0your constant flight delays and nickle and diming customers goes a long way to create loyal customers. may i suggest another revenue stream to charge for bathroom use on your flights.\\xa0i hope you saved a lot of money by cancelling my flight and shifting all customers to your next flight.\\xa0    bologna to stansted . absolutely awful. i have never reviewed in my life and the incompetence and poorly trained staff have baffled me. no one tells you what is going on. we have been delayed going out and coming back. i understand that weathertechnical faults etc can slow your flight down. however the staff are rude and arrogant and tell all the passengers different reasons why we are stuck on the runway. total incompetence and poorly run airline will never fly ryanair again.    shannon to stansted. funny how all the flight from and to dublincork can arrive on time but not to shannon no ryanair staff on floor no explanation as to why the flight is over an hour late coming and going. people pay the money to expect their flight to arrive on time. only apparently no one flying to shannon has a job to go to.  they would rather see the airport closed and have all the money going to dublin. if you want to be on time do not fly with ryanair. uncomfortable seats late clinical misrable    edinburgh to stansted. ive never flown ryanair so didnt know about the check in policy. myself and my partner were charged 55 each to print a boarding pass. even the service itself was abominable. the staff were very rude. munich to dublin. had 2 flights with ryanair and each flight was the absolute worst. my girlfriend and i checked in 3 days in advance and we were not given seats next to each other even though the tickets were ordered at the same time and we could *see* that the seats next to each of us were available. ryanair then prompted us want to sit together we could upgrade. basically they tried to charge us extra money to get the service that you get included in every other flight. obviously we didnt do that and when we got on the flight it was mostly empty and everyone could sit wherever they wanted. ryanair wasnt doing this splitting the seating to improve seating algorithm or allow larger groups they were doing it solely to milk another couple bucks out of us from our ticket. same thing in a different vein for every other aspect of the trip from boarding to arriving  boarding groups luggage etc. there must have been a dozen different upgrades you could purchase to bring the quality of their ticket up to the standard quality of every other existing airline. obviously every airline does this to some extent but the breaking up seating was the one that really got to me. their carryon luggage options were just as bad on paper though the actual flight attendants were very relaxed about what could and couldnt be brought on a flight. that might depend on the people though on paper you would struggle to bring anything onto this flight for free as a carryon. caused a lot of needless anxiety as we were preparing to leave our backpacks worked for 99 of other airlines but would they cost us 80 to bring through ryanair if they arent going to enforce the luggage stuff they should relax it on paper so it doesnt cause travelers so much stress. on top of that every other part of the trip was irritating in every way. boarding process started ~30 minutes late for both of our flights. they accidentally left us stuck in a hot and crowded staircase for half an hour waiting for a bus. at some point during the flight they tried to sell us scratchoff lottery tickets for additional flights which was annoying and loud and also just plain *weird*. despite how late we always boarded the flight was never late. the pilots cut down the flight by a lot of time. very noticeable in landing ive dropped my phone with more grace than some of these landings. i guess this is technically a plus but feeling like your pilot is rushing is never a good feeling on a flight for me. in summary it was a miserable experience all around. hard to grade these things since cheapo flights all pretty much suck you get what you pay for but some aspects of this like the split up seating really elevated this one to something special.    seville to cologne. flight was delayed by more than 3 hours due to strike in france. not the airlines fault but had to stay in the standing plane without aircon for more than 2 hours. crew was expressly advised by the airline not to provide drinks. not even water was offered. save yourself from this nightmare. avoid ryanair.    madrid to dublin. the bag policy is just a joke. if you dont buy priority you wont be allowed a bag in cabin. its not even a cheap company any more next time i will fly with aer lingus or equivalent.    stansted to frankfurt. arrived at the airport to absolute pandemonium i could not download my checkin the ryanair website was down the stansted free wifi was not working appalling no signage so noone knew where to go and not one single ryanair employee walking around to assist very irate passengersalthough they could have done with a whole team there was one customer service lady attending to a âline of about 50 passengers  all frustrated and clueless what to do where to go but the queue at the flexidesk was kept free. and then a one hour delay in the plane and a further delay in landing in frankfurt. a one hour flight took over 2 hours. ryanair never again   \\r\\r\\nflew ryanair from budapest to charleroi. second flight in two days that was delayed by over an hour. this caused problems for myself on collection of vehicles from hire companies due to late arrival. i have problems with the airline before and do not recommend it. i would never use for personal travel but have to use for business however i will be discussing with my employer that we no longer use the airline due to appalling punctuality.   late late late taking ryanair weekly at this moment brudub and unfortunately always late. again this eveing 1 hr 10 minutes delay. they every time have an excuse to justify the delay air traffic control strike in france... but other airlines operating this route are never late. what the current issue why are you always late. please keep in mind that being on time is our first concern    mykonos to athens. a total rip off. would not suggest anyone to take the airline while traveling to europe. we were asked to pay 138.6 euros for two tickets extra as we did not do an online check in. not only us we met 5 groups of people having the same issue and we all ended up paying 1.5 times extra of our original tickets price. the staff at the counter said that ryanair sends you mails and reminders for the check in details but we didnt receive any mail other than the one time details we received while booking. so did the other people facing the same issue havent seen any other airline charging more than the ticket just to check in at the airport. they should have self check in counters instead of doing all this. really upset with the experience. thank you ryanair for ruining my honeymoon    brussels to dublin. 1 hour late often late at the moment. 30 mins waiting in front of the gate on the boarding bridge. very warm and unpleasant. whats the need to have priority boarding if you need to queue for an hour on the boarding bridge    milan to valencia. good aircraft. possible strike of french air controllers. we stayed on track 2 hrs. departure delay at least 2 hrs. very hot in the plane. air conditioning at minimum. personnel unkind to passengers. personnel did not want to hear complaints. started saying that they were up since 6am and were tired. however all of them were standing at the front door were air was more respirable. people started to ask for water and they had to pay. pilots failed to comment nor gave explanations for the prolonged taxi. on the whole a real bad flight. service onboard virtually nonexistent. lastly the return flight was cancelled without mail sms or call. we had to learn that from the news on tv the evening before.     milan to stansted. this is the worst of the budget airlines. tatty planes horrible over priced food on board frequently delayed and a multitude of hidden costs. dont let you board early if you have young children even babies if travelling a budget airline easyjet is miles ahead. also let you board early with babies.    sofia to stansted. my first and my last flight with ryanair from the beginning to the end everything was awful they took my cabin baggage with the checked ones the seats were uncomfortablethe price of foods and drinks was too high the staff was unpleasant and unhelpful they even didnt give us instructions in bulgarian language. enormous labyrinth until we go out a lot of walking and no information where we can take our cabin baggage horrible unbearable and disgusting adventure no more flights with ryanair for me my family and my friends    oslo to stansted. the flight was delayed by an hour when we went to oslo but to make it worse when we were coming back on sunday to go back to work on monday the flight was delayed by an hour so it landed at 1030 pm instead and the baggage took 1 hour 30 minutes to arrive. its 12am and i literally barely made it to the last train. worst service ever.  it will take me 130 hours to get home including a taxi journey and there is no trains to my area past 12am.    palma de mallorca to stansted. flight delayed by 7 hours from 1800h to 0154h now and counting. no communication about the reasons for the delay. plane packed with families with young children and babies. informed at 0131h by the pilot in the first photo public announcement since 1800h that the flight will be delayed by another 2025 minutes because there is a thunderstorm above palma airport. why is ryanair not offering any alternatives such as hotel accommodation andor booking us onto alternative flights this would be farcical if it was for the fact that passenger rights are trampled over and we are being treated worse than cattle. shame on you ryanair for allowing practices like this to persist under your leadership.    venice to stansted. absolutely would not recommend. 5 hour delay on the flight and the most unhelpful staff. didnt even bring us food throughout our entire wait when we were held in the flight for 3 hours. didnt reimburse us because the held us in the flight not the terminal.    girona to pisa. terrible airline extra charge can be more than ticket price and luggage. extra charge just for 2 pieces of paper registration tickets. i would never recommend this company    if you long for the good old days of riding on a greyhound bus ryanair is the one for you. the pre boarding experience is like nothing other than the crowd one would encounter in the bus terminal packed. if you are 6 feet tall or more think twice. the one redeeming feature of the seating is that the seats are upright with no option to recline.    knock to bristol. very disappointed to have the flight delayed an hour without anyone informing any of the passengers of any updates. i had prepaid train tickets which are now invalid and have missed my train.  really really irritated.    leeds to bratislava. bad service. overpriced tickets and extra charges for basically everything. the priority service which makes it possible to take the hand luggage on board at extra cost provide literally no benefits apart from what should already be in the price and becomes a commonality rather than an exclusive feature. what is more tickets when booked together do not guarantee having adjacent seats for which we have to pay extra in order to travel together.    all goes wrong with this airline from checking desk that you have to pay 55 euros for not doing online checkin without giving you any hints or alerts till on board that they take your carry on bag away to be carried separetly or checkin without your permission air crew were rude or at least the one that was at my flight to rome from brussels and serving rear rows from 2533. i will never fly with this airline again    palma to dublin. ryanair does a great job making sure to skirt just around the eu laws. the flight was delayed 2 hours 50 minutes and eu compensation laws kick in for this flight at 3 hours. we ended up landing in dublin at 300 am.   flew milan bergamo to barcelona. i would not recommend ryanair to anybody. very bad experience i know that its a low cost company and you dont expect much from it but better pay a bit more money and choose another airline. my flight was delayed 2 hours and nobody said anything as to why. the crew were very rude they seemed very upset and at the end of the flight i asked for water and they didnt want to help not even to buy and they got very offended when i asked. a big 0 for customer service.    my husband and i took a flight from glasgow to berlin and when we try to do the check in online their web site didnt allow us to do it so we have to wait and do the check in directly in the airport and for that they charged us 151 dollars because they said that i had to do it online when i explain that i couldnt do it because their web site doesnt allow me they require me to give them a proof. additionally they charged us 18 dollars more and sit us separately without option in total i paid for this flight 749 dollars the most expensive i had paid for flight for two hours distance. i dont understand why the customers are very vulnerable to this type of company   barcelona to london stansted. terrible flight was more than 2 hours delayed. there was lack of information and really bad service from the staff. overall a terrible experience can not believe that this is no. 1 airline in europe.    malta to sevilla. i gave it one star but if i could give it zero i would. it is the first and last time i fly with them. when i got to the airport they did even open the desk until an hour before we boarded. i had to pay 55â¬ because i didnt do the check in properly. when i try contacting them they charged me .56â¬ per minute and they never answer i was was on the phone for at least one hour. to continue my nightmare the flight was terrible it was like a greyhound bus in the sky the entire time people were walking and standing all over the plain it was a completely chaos.     edinburgh to stansted. my experience was terrible. every possible hassle that i could think of arose. couldnt check in attempted several times and finally was told checkin was closed. also told flight had left before it was time. had to find customer services at edinburgh airport who was so helpful. she followed me through every hassle until i got my boarding pass. took 2 whole hours to get through checkin and security. had heard they were bad news but didnt expect them to be this bad. they really are what they say  cheapest airline but i would add troublesome airline too. special assistance did all they could to get me to the flight on time but she really had to get a move on. got there just as they were boarding. never ever again will i use ryanair.    barcelona to berlin. my last ryanair flight. absolutely abysmal airline. they cancelled flights 2 weeks in a row and did not have next available flights for 2 consecutive days. their chat personnel do not help at all by answering queries. there is a long waiting time and they are slow once on line. their refund procedure takes 28 days and further delay if they need anything more from your end. i never know if i will receive my refunds eventually and if i will ever reach a destination through ryanair.  i am a student and chose it to save costs but even at those low costs i will never book it again simply because of the delay and cancellation troubles horrible customer care response and ridiculous refund policies.    we were supposed to leave at 5 pm. plane was delayed for about an hour. after boarding we got a notification that due to the delay we had to wait in line to leave. this was around 6 pm. half an hour later we got an announcement that we had to wait longer because of bad weather. and one hour later the flight was cancelled. we couldnt leave the plane for about another 2 hours and sat there without anything to eat or drink. we directly went to the desk to book another flight only option was friday june 1st. the day we should arrive home. or in two weeks. we asked them to check 6 different airports but apparently no options available the next day. they told us we could file a claim and get our money back. we filed a complaint it got declined because of bad weather. this is not true. if the plane had been there at scheduled time we would have left without any problems at our scheduled time. a plane to bari with flight number fr8723 left on its scheduled time at 5.25 pm. so this is just a very convenient excuse but not true at all.   abysmal customer service. flight being delayed 2hours 30minutes is one thing their communication is another. we were made to wait over 30 minutes with no explanation no way to sit on anything. the waiting zone was outside we could plainly see our plane was not there. yet they herded the passengers into this tight corner outside no where to sit no explanation. when i complained i only got a shrug. awful awful experience. seats were uncomfortably small but that is to be expected from economy class.    stansted to frankfurt. 29 may 2018 flight was cancelled without information and then no flight for 2 days. i have to buy ticket from other airline. return on 5 june 2018 was delayed 4 hours. they did not pay a penny for compensation    east midlands to las palmas. rude staff ran out of alcohol and other refreshments left us outside plane waiting for shuttle bus as they only had 2 buses instead of 3. worst flight ive had. avoid at all costs.    nÃ¼rnberg to porto. painful way to travel. this airline has been late every time ive flown it. the cabin is super hot and stuffy and be prepared to tolerate drunk groups of people on the later flights.  some flight attendants are polite and kind some are not pleasant. seats are very uncomfortable and cramped. yes the fee for travel can be cheap if you can avoid all the upcharges but you pay in a different way.  through late flights long lines gross cabins drunk passengers constant selling bad food options etc.  so regardless of the cheap flights im done with ryanair. not worth it.    skavsta to stanford. would never recommend using this airlane after todays experience. first we arrive at 5 pm in the morning at the cost of our night sleep. when we have checked in our bags and gone through security they inform that not airplane is coming due to late arrival until seven to eight hours later. still they could not offer any hotel room until four hours would pass as the airplane could come earlier than their estimation. when we arrive the second time the plane is first estimated 30 minutes later than before then to change into one hour. no personal of ryanair was reachable neither at the airport nor through phone. later departure to the same destination by ryanair went into air as normal without any possibility for us to board that plane. i just give a big warning of ryanair the worst flying experience ever though im a frequent flyer.    rome ciampino to stansted. when i flew to rome i bought the priority that allow you to come into the plane first together with your luggage. it costs me 7 at the top if my flight tickets that was around 60. now i came back and have been waiting on the airport more then an hour waiting for my luggage. on my way back i didnt buy a priority as i feel this is stupid for every single service that ryanair provide.  i was told by the person working in ryanair baggage enquirers that it can take up to 1.5 hours i am so disappointed and dissatisfied with them. ryanair goes down every year. i will avoid them in future and there are better companies that are few pounds more expensive and can provide you amazing service.    bari to bologna. there was no cleaning from previous flight. really bad service from the crew. as usual delayed.    palermo to stansted the flight was delayed to start with with more problems but the main problem is when i get to stansted. light check in bag was not on the conveyor belt. i reported this to swiftbolt and they gave me a report. ive also made a complaint on ryanair website   theyve got a chat but for the last two days i cannot get through on it. it seems ryanair could not care one bit about their customers so my advice to everybody do not use them.    terrible experience flying ryanair from athens to rome even worse than my last flight on united. keep in mind i also just spent 3 hours standing in line in the istanbul airport a couple weeks ago. youll walk 2 miles to get to your gate and they will make you carry your bags all the way there if you havent paid extra in advance. departure was changed 3 times from a early morning flight to late afternoon messing up connections. ill never fly this pathetic excuse for an airline again.    dublin to budapest. ryanair dropped the passengers off in the wrong country and provided no support afterword. after personally paying for transportation to my original destination ryanair refused to reimburse me. i will never fly with them again and do not recommend.    thessaloniki to stansted. small seats and the worst customer care. i gave them more than one chance and im truly disappointed about every time    london to barcelona. first time ever to fly with ryanair and this has been an absolute disappointment from the very beginning to the end. booked my ticket in may 2018 thinking i had a bargain compared to the prices shown by other airlines. i even selected the priority option costing a little extra. this meant i could carry a 10kg bag with a small bag. arrived at the airport to drop my suitcase but was told i had to pay 50 because i didnt have this on my ticket. completely shocked i argued but of course had no choice but to pay. after this the flight was delayed for almost 3 hours didnt arrive at my destination until 2am for a conference i had to attend by 8.30 the following morning. well thinking the nightmare was over and glad to have survived the ordeal. on my flight back i thought perhaps the 50 i paid would have covered both leg of my trip only to be told that i needed to pay another 50 on my way back. making a total of 100 pounds excluding the cost of my original ticket which was 98. while queuing pay for the cost of my laugage i met several families who had exactly thesame problem as myself. ryanair needs to state the exact cost implications of their flights. now if i had known that this flight would have cost me almost 200 i certainly would have flown with british airways without any doubt. well you learn every day. im never flying with ryanair again but it would be a complete injustice if i did not share my experience on here. sadly the rating does not allow zero hence the 110    booked a return flight from london stansted to pisa and from pisa back to london stn. stansted outbound was delayed for 2 hrs 30 mins. currently i am waiting for my flight to depart. it was supposed to depart an hour ago however there is still no information available. do not fly with ryanair. avoid at all costs.    venice to frankfurt. 55euro fee to check in. i truly expected more from a european airline. very disappointed and will look for an alternative before booking again. sad that i had this experience as they are very affordable and offer great routes.   . to napleswhat a shambles after not being able to check in online 2 hours before departure as informed on the website i requested help from the staff in the airport. however i was still charged a whopping amount of 880 dkr as a checkin charge. being a frequent flyer i have never in my life had problems with checking in on a flight and im appalled at ryanairs scams. on top of that the flight was delayed considerably of course with information being little to none. i am not surprised that the staff have called for strikes.     palma to stansted. absolute nightmare disgraceful painful and torturing travel. from the beginning of the trip the flights were late staff at palma airport was completely unprepared shouting at people being rude. we were asked to wait for the bus to get to the aircraft which took over 1 hour under heat without being given any explanation or water. then got inside the aircraft and had to wait again for ages before taking off  poor air conditioning. in  stansted when we all thought the experience was over there were 1000 delayed passengers left stranded at baggage reclaim waiting for luggage for hours. staff unprepared rude and clueless. overall was meant to be home at 1900. only got there at 0000. last time ever i flew with ryanair. never again.    we were flying from thessaloniki to london stansted airport on 15072028. not only there was a delay up to 1h and 40 minutes without even letting us know anything when we arrived and we missed our transfer there was no one at the customer service. the worst company. unacceptable service and frequent delays our forward flight was delayed as well    hamburg to edinburgh. unprofessional airline. my wife and i planned a trip together to visit my ancestral home of scotland. we arrived at the airport at 0455 am for a flight departing at 620. ryanair does not have any staff to assist with baggage instruction on how to get to the gate or that there is a preclearance requirement to travel to the uk and no staff that assisted in any way including how to take baggage on the plane through security. we were among at least 12 people denied access to the flight as they didnt have a shuttle to the airplane once to the gate. everyone was extremely frustrated and left without an alternative and no one can provide help particularly if the booking was made online. even the staff in hamburg airport were unimpressed with ryanair and noted this is simply the way they operate. the inexpensive fare was completely wasted and one loses the return flight if you dont make the first flight. this is a fine print airline that may work for the experienced traveler with the patience to lose their money a few times in order to get the hang of their method but do not make the mistake of thinking that this is actually an air service. there is no service. this was a very disappointing experience and im shocked the business model has survived.    palma to barcelona. we booked our two tickets which cost 173â¬ from ryanair but they made us pay an extra 134â¬ just to get the boarding passes. an email was sent to us with no link. moreover their communication was rubbish and disrespectful as well as rude.    worst experience ive ever had both my flights to and from pisa were delayed. we werent informed of this at any point and had to continuesly check the departure board to keep up to date the customer service was atrocious and the only time i felt like they cared that about my experience was when one of the rude cabin girls was trying to sell perfumes or very expensive food on the plane. my plane to pisa was an hour late and i understand that things can happen but the plane journey home was delayed by 8.5 hours with no explanation and no apology they charge extra for any extra luggage other than a small carry on bag and charge silly money for things such as sitting next to the person youre travelling with. british airways is a little more expensive on flights but at least their customer service is good theyre very helpful whenever you find yourself struggling with anything and they dont treat you like a money sign for the five seconds they have to try and take as much money from you as theyre able    \\r\\r\\nstansted to faro. never take ryanair.  they do not update their customers on the status of their service. the boarding process was delayed 30 minutes but no one told us why. they are unorganized and not consumerfriendly. they do not let you check in your bag at the checkin kiosk. instead you have to drag your suitcase through security which means you have to worry about removing all liquids from your suitcase before it gets scanned take it to your gate and then you drop it off yourself on a cart. there was no one to guide or instruct the passengers as to where to leave their suitcase or when it was time to do so and there was no signage to denote that either. they were not prepared for us to deplane when we got to the gate. we had to wait in the plane for 30 extra minutes. you have to pay for any refreshments. there are no seatback pockets for your things.    cologne bonn to copenhagen . when we got to the airport to get our boarding pass was told that we have to pay 55 euros per person to check in which can usually be done on a kiosk in 2 minutes. our family paid 165 euros in the end. our wonderful europe vacation ended right there. this is the first time i experienced this kind of business practice. then later i found in the fine print section on the ticket saying airport check in fee is 50 euros. very disappointed and will never fly ryanair again.    paphos to stansted. more than 3 hours delay. boarded on time then informed about a delay and then sent back to the airport gate. we were put in another aircraft and we left after 3 hours. arrived in london and waited for the baggage for more than 40 minutes to arrive at the belts. all the people from other ryanair flights were piling up waiting for the belt number announcement to reclaim their baggage. most of them had been waiting for 30 minutes already. ryanair did not give any information just blamed swissport also there were 100s pieces of left luggage from the previous day in front of ryanairs baggage information desk adding to the total chaos total delay for me was 3h45 which costed me to miss all my evening. ryanair sent through an email stating 2h54 delay. however the official departure and arrival information states 2h59 delay. someone is not telling the truth. compensation is given for 3h and more. of course they want to avoid refunds to their customers even if they are actually entitled to 0  which does not make me or my family and friends confident and keen to travel with them again. they needed to treat their customers better if they wanted to keep them.    athens to bratislava. the flight was more than an hour delayed and no one gave an information only just before the departure. we arrived at 2020 although the flight arrival should have been 1915. my final destination was vienna so i have booked an inclusive plus airport line ticket from the ryanair site. we departed at 2120 with the bus the driver could not speak english he accused me of a heavy luggage and asked for money although it was not asked from me to put it inside the bus and it is now 2224 i am still sitting in the bus because the driver stopped for coffee in a gas station letting us wait in the bus for more than 15 minutes i should have been home from 8 o clock according to the 3040 minutes that ryanair suggests for the driving distance i will never fly to bratislava again and as clear as that never with ryanair.    rome to stansted. i have been flying with ryanair for 7 years and the last 2 were a nightmare. there is no chance of reaching your destination on time every single plane bears at least an 11.5 hours delay if not more but always less than 3 hours to avoid giving compensation. even when completely wrong they will not allow any flexibility like allowing silence during your flight or boarding your luggage. even after waiting 2.5 h in the airport plus waiting time on the plane they seem to be never getting a slot to leave they will try to sell their junk and shout on their microphones. disgusting. i will do anything possible to avoid ryanair.    cologne to berlin. probably the worst airline in europe. out of my last 4 flights with them 1 was canceled 1 was delayed by 40min 2 by more than 1.5hours. there is absolutely no service at all from ground staff they are more occupied with checking the luggage sizes. after my flight got canceled there was no free of charge hotline available. there was no offering of compensation as part of the eu flight regulations. the seats are super uncomfortable. i am 1.9m and it really is a pain getting in and sitting there for more than 10min. there is no wifi and during the flight i am bombarded with offers of lottery tickets. i am always trying to avoid them as much as possible. unfortunately there are legs only served by ryanair that i need to fly from time to time.    both flights from stansted to toulouse and back were delayed by around two hours. furthermore my bag was wrecked by ground staff and when i complained at the baggage desk i was meant to have been given a reference number to claim i did not know this at the time. instead i was just told how to complain. ryanair are refusing to reimburse me for the wrecked bag because staff failed to follow due process and give me a reference number.  absolutely useless customer service.    ibiza to liverpool. worst airline ive ever been with the staff on the flight werent too bad but there was delays left right and centre and the time management was awful. we planned to get home for 4.30pm and only ended up getting home at 1.00am. we had to do an emergency landing in barcelona and they would not tell us why this delayed us for a good 4 hours and then all they did was provide us with 5 euro coupon to spend on food in the airport what can you buy from the airport with 5 euros and then to make everything worse they boarded us on to the flight at least 1 hour and 30 minutes before the flight even moved. worst airline ive ever been with staff associated with edinburgh airport were fantastic helping us to clear security quickly and with very good humour. in contrast ryanair staff were surly and officious. after a pretence at asking for volunteers to have cabin baggage put into the hold free of charge the staff member decided to pick on the middle of a long line. we explained that the child travelling with us was unwell having been taking calpol through the day and asked if she would not transfer our luggage to the hold especially as our arrival would be late evening. asked about how long the delay at baggage reclaim would take the staff member became very officious and suggested we were arguing with her. we had not been asked to give her our boarding passes until she had become very defensive  are you going to give me your boarding passes  when we handed them over immediately. she was obviously having a bad day and did not transfer anyone elses baggage to the hold after us. we were left to remove valuables and repack our bags. as someone who works in a customerfocused business i find it hard to believe that staff can get away with rudeness and offhanded comments on a daily basis. i also note that the baggage label suggested that our baggage would not be covered by article 4 of the warsaw convention. this was not pointed out to us. i will avoid ryanair at all costs in the future. we were called to board on time this morning at 715am for an 8am ryanair departure. all seemed well. we had concerns after being delayed on the outbound flight from edinburgh 2 weeks earlier. after standing on a staircase for 1015 minutes we were told to return to the departure lounge. the staff not ryanair told us there was a problem with the plane and it may take at least an hour to resolve. we received no more updates and the notice boards simply said boarding and gate closed. at approx 915 the notice boards stated we had to board again but from a different gate. the plane was fully boarded by 945am. the doors were closed at 1002am and we took off at 1015am. this was a delay of 2 hours and 15 minutes. the captain said it was down to spanish air traffic control they told us it was french air traffic control that caused the outbound delay. as ryanairs terms state that if you are delayed by at least 2 hours you will receive a text stating your rights explaining compensation etc. no text received. when i challenged the stewards they said they thought it was 3 hours not 2 wow they didnt even know their own rules. they werent willing to help at all and said i should just complain directly to ryanair. which i will be doing. the staff were more interested in selling as many snacks and drinks as possible rather than apologising for the delay and issuing passengers with a food and drinks voucher. i was a little surprised by the high cost of the lower fares ryanair to fly one way from pisa to london but didnt give it much thought. i made the supreme mistake of not checking in on ine prior to arriving at the airport. i was told that before i could receive the boarding passes it would cost another 45 euros each my wife and myself. its mandatory. this after i had paid for the tickets online with my visa card. not having a choice i coughed up the 90 euros so we could catch a connecting flight with an ethical airline company. i am a 71 yr old retired business man with many transactions under my belt but have never in my 50 years of business been the victim of extortion. ryanair is no longer a lower fares honest ethical or even decent airline with which to do business. if i should ever find myself in the position of having to fly to a place served only by ryanair i will either walk or not go there. if i could post this with less than one star i would. bari to trieste with a 9hr 32mins delay. never again with ryanair. we were on plane on time already and because of an technical problem we have to go off again. thats ok but than started our all day waiting in an unorganized airport of bari. frst they tell us that the new flight time will be 525pm but they have know already that wont be before 740pm.  rule changes at this airline have been definitely for the worse. at checkin if you do not pay extra for a seat selection you will be assigned the worst seat available. some rows will remain completely empty but you will be asked to stay in your assigned seat and fly squeezed between two passengers. a second problem is that in order to be more customer friendly ryanair now allows or does not care anymore if you take two or more pieces of luggage into the cabin. some are huge and well over the size allowance. the result is either you board early or you will not find space for your small piece of luggage anymore. boarding early does not help if you carry a soft bag as you will later see that the crew even help to squeeze hard suitcases into the overhead holds not caring about the content of your soft suitcase. on this fight i was shocked to see that about 15 very big suitcases were stored in empty rows placed in the free space between rows the aircraft was about to take off when the chief assistant asked the assistants to remove the bags and place them elsewhere. bags and suitcases were not put under the seats either most of them were just put between seats.  tried ryanair biz plus as i normally go ba not even a cup of tea. a bun fight in the queue to board and i had asked for disabled assistance both ends. in dublin nobody to help even though prebooked on my return to dublin complained and was assured there would be no problems at stansted. on my return there was nobody to meet me so they let me down twice. will not use again i booked with ryanair in april 2015 and found myself that they had brought forward my flight in march 2016 by 7 hours. i never received a email confirming the change so i contacted them and they said the dont usually contact passengers until a month before as it is more than likely be changed again. so they are selling tickets to passengers knowing they most likely might not be flying at the times advertised  i got a full refund but had i not checked the times i would have been left with shattered plans beware. extraordinary treatment of passengers by ryanair. departing from stansted very early on wednesday morning the weather was horrible and raining very hard. the aircraft was off jetty so had to be boarded by steps front and rear. 2 passengers were in wheel chairs and clearly unable to walk at any great speed let alone climb stairs. boarding commenced with passengers having to walk quickly to the aircraft steps only to find at the rear that one of the elderly was making very slow progress up the stairs. a queue quickly formed as she progressed excruciatingly slowly with help from family members up the stairs. in the meantime without any cover passengers waiting to board became totally drenched. i got to my seat as with many others looking literally as if i had just stepped out of a shower fully clothed. is it really beyond their wit to either have as high loader to facilitate wheelchair passengers onto an aircraft that is off jetty or if this cannot be managed hold back general boarding for just 5 minutes while all passengers needing assistance are able to board thereby avoiding the angst and drenching tried ryanair for the first time. its ticket once you added a checked bag and reserved seat was actually more expensive than aegean however it had a slightly better schedule. checkin costs â¬45 but online checkin with mobile app was free. ok did this. then informed i couldnt use electronic boarding card so would have to pay â¬15 at airport. after silliness with customer service who sent me very fine print detail that does indeed say noneu cannot use mobile app then stopped talking with me. i finally went and found a hotel to print hard copy for me. then there was the mayhem boarding agents ignored priority boarding glad i didnt pay for that. once on board we found space for our small bags and settled into the most uncomfortable seats only to have flight attendants cattle movers start taking bags down so that those with larger bags could put them up. if you had a soft bag even if large they pulled it down to go on floor so that those with huge hard shell bags could put them up. never seen that before. first the positives of our flight with ryanair  the fare was cheaper than a return train trip to london as long as you do not check bags or purchase goods on board. the negatives which mainly focus on stansted. absolutely useless ground staff once the departure gate was eventually flashed up on screen we joined the heaving mass crushed onto the little shuttle to the gate for a mad dash due to the short notice. once we arrived at the lounge we were met with total chaos due to zero management none visible. queues were criss crossing each other and people were getting most upset. i asked one of only two staff checking two different flights no other staff were available which queue was which to which she replied i dont know its all over the place back there. once we got to our desk the lady checking us did not make eye contact she simply looked at the pass glanced at our passports and said go through an opportunity for a security check missed. after walking across the cold wet runway we got to the plane to find out that the back door had only just been opened so of course earlier boarders had had to use the front door which of course meant utter chaos on board. anyway a second security check was missed here as the girl checking our seat passes only looked at one. come on ryanair you seriously need to sort out this appalling issue. who is to blame the airport or the carrier i will not be using ryanair again.  budapest  manchester and back again with a 5 month old and a 7 year old. budget flying is fine i was lucky enough to sit in the aisle seat with my baby and my 7 year old sat on the other side of the aisle. i even paid for priority boarding on the way back to give myself just 3 minutes to find a seat next to my own child and get my bags and it made no difference. they put the gate number up people run to the gate 12 minutes walk away they start boarding and i am still trying to push the pram to the gate. a fellow passenger kindly offered to hold my baby while i collapsed the pram at the bottom of the stairs. i still struggled to get on and get seated people pushing past me. i will be seeking my money back for priority boarding. if you have a small child or infant it is not worth it. i flew long haul from australia with a baby and 7 year old 27 hours worth of traveling and not once felt as stressed and helpless as i did flying ryanair. stansted to barcelona. fine going there. horrendous treatment on boarding for the return flight. my daughters under 16 years of age were summoned to pay 50 euros each for their hand luggage even though the cases fit the dimensions specified. staff started to process the 50 fines without asking for their ages or to speak with their parent then demanded payment. really put a dampener on the whole trip. first and last time we fly with ryanair. definitely not for flying with small children. i flew to poland with my nearly 3 months old daughter and got no help from staff whatsoever. i paid for seat for my little girl however was expected to keep her on my lap as she wasnt allowed to have her own. it would be great if i could just lay her down surely we would both be more comfortable. also women with kids or pregnant get no priority at the boarding gates staff are rude and treated us as a load not a human beings talking down to us. at the end of the day we are paying customers so show us some respect will not fly with them again. my first ryanair flight was manchester to memmingham. what really annoyed me was that my wife and i seemed to be the only people to follow the cabin baggage rules everyone else had huge rucksacks that were no way acceptable  and nobody checked at either end as for families with children and push chairs have you seen the size of them nowadays i would ban them from cabins at any price. one saving grace however was that seat backs are fixed in the upright position. will i travel again with them. probably yes as it is cheaper than swissair to zurich. flying out of manchester staff friendly and helpful coming back through palma a different matter. my hand luggage that was the right size going out was deemed to be too large when i was flying home and i was forced to pay â¬50 and put it in hold leaving me without my pain medication. the priority boarding i had paid for was non existent traveling with small children they tried to split us up eventually got seats together near emergency exit to add insult to injury they had no food apart from sweets and crisps. myself and my daughter took a holiday to kos. i have never seen such a shambles in my life. after the experience of the free for all to get your seats and then seeing the arguments between other passengers as they could not sit together got the holiday off to a great start. it was now the time for the safety announcements prior to take off i do understand that this is important however i have never seen such miserable faces from the cabin staff. we were sitting in row five and it took nearly 1hr to get served i think mainly because they had to keep explaining what they had run out of even before we took off. the list was endless of what they hadnt got. when it was our turn i ordered 1 bottle of water a whisky and a can of coke i was taken back a little when they said thats 11 euros. i quickly put my money back in my pocket. all they wanted to do was to sell scratch cards and smokeless cigarettes. overall not impressed at all and will never travel ryanair in the future. one final thing. budget airline my tickets where certainly not cheap or even reasonable. stansted to pula. tried to adhere to all rules and regulations but failed to print boarding passes for return journey and hence fined â¬240 for family of four. this was a genuine error caused by my printing off the outbound boarding passes at too early a stage in my eagerness to do all correctly at which time unable to print for return. erroneously assumed outbound copies and itinerary would suffice. hold my hands up and agree nominal fine should be payable but believe that â¬60 per person is totally disproportionate to administration involved for the error. walked 5 metres handed over credit card and after a minutes transaction and â¬240 pound payment returned to check in and allowed to board expensive lesson learnt but will avoid ryanair from now on when printing the boarding tickets we got our outboard flight no problem and when the home flight boarding card would not print we thought it was due to not actually being away. on our way home the check in lady at malta said it was going to cost us 290 euros to get home due to no boarding cards even though in front of her on a check list were all the names of passengers and their luggage. after several words and a lot of shouting i paid the money having no other choice. this airline ruined a holiday that was otherwise brilliant and showed no remorse to me and several other unfortunate passengers. this will never happen again because i will never use them again. flew recently edinburgh to bordeaux. outward was good although had to wait very long one for luggage. return trip was awful. the new billi section where the cheap airlines operate is once through security tiny poor toilet facilities and passengers crammed in like sardines. announcements impossible to hear queues for the gates mingling with people in the shopping areas and once at the gates even tighter than sardines. i understand you have to know what you are doing and what to expect with cheap airlines but i will avoid them if i can in future. this experience was stressful and very uncomfortable. to make things worse the staff on return flight were unfriendly and the food was disgusting flew to alicante last week. paid the fee for our measly 15kg bag allowance. checked in online arrived at edinburgh to depart to find a massive slow moving queue. my 2 year old was getting tired and cranky. then was told because my bag was 15.5kg and my wifes was 16kg we would be charged 100 for being over weight if we couldnt repack. the ignorant woman at check in couldnt care less about our upset child. we managed to get our luggage repacked and i was told by another member of staff that my bag would be fine at 15.5kg. when getting onto the plane to get or free for all seat rush. my wife asks for assistance to find at least two seats together but the stewardess snootily told her to keep moving up the plane and find a seat. luckily somebody moved so that she could sit with our child. then you have to spend the rest of the flight listening to bored and rude cabin crew trying to sell things. not the greatest start to our 1st family holiday. have flown with ryanair before to stags with friends with only hand luggage but will never use them again for a family holiday. they just dont care about their customers or the quality of your journey. we flew up to scotland with ryanair and waited for ages to be checked in. the extra cost of printing a boarding pass and check in online was being handed out to a large group of passengers. why does it cost so much to print a boarding pass and check in at the airport. the staff were rude and unhelpful to the point that i just wanted to get my money back for the flight and go home but  no refunds if i were to treat people in my business like this i would have no customers. terrible experience never again my first ryanair flight was manchester to memmingham. what really annoyed me was that my wife and i seemed to be the only people to follow the cabin baggage rules everyone else had huge rucksacks that were no way acceptable  and nobody checked at either end as for families with children and push chairs have you seen the size of them nowadays i would ban them from cabins at any price. one saving grace however was that seat backs are fixed in the upright position. will i travel again with them. probably yes as it is cheaper than swissair to zurich. i thought that i was booking a budget airline and accept all that entails however as the final cost once all the extras such as luggage were added i finally paid over 2500 for my families seats and may as well have gone on a better airline. the plane was clean and it took off and arrived on time. if you are travelling on a weekend break for 2 adults then i imagine it wouldnt be a problem just so long as you read all the small print and adhere to them very carefully however with 4 small children and no way to book a seat it was extremely stressful. i do not understand what they gain by using this system would go as far as to say that it is immoral that knowing that you cannot take drinks on board they do not supply water and a small bottle of water is 3 staff were miserable and openly complained about other passengers whilst stood next to me. they enforce the rules when it suits them. they told a lady that she had to put her cardigan in the overhead lockers but the woman next to me had a handbag on her lap. i would rather stay at home then travel with them again. there and back from treviso tsf to malta mla last march. both legs the plane took off late but landed on schedule with the trumpetannouncement. fas rude and impolite. no ife. flight pleasant thanks to skilled pilots. youre going to pay almost for the air you breathe on board anyway acceptable discomforts for such low ticket fare. no doubt whatever its limits are ryanair helps to move across europe very cheaply. flew from manchester to sicily we are a family of 8 with 6 children under the age of 12. the flight was fully booked and all 8 of us were located all over the plane even the 2 year old was sat with strangers. staff were unhelpful and rude there was not enough room for the hand luggage on the plane so all 7 of our cases were put in the hold so we had no food or nappies. staff were trying to sell things the whole flight we would probably have been better to reserve seats but for 8 people would not have then been a cost effective flight would not go with them again not one case for anyone was checked for either size or weight going to coming back maybe thats why they couldnt fit all the luggage in the cabin kosstansted. our first time on ryanair and i have to say never again. stress repacking our 52kg luggage into the correct number of bags after a day on the beach. stress getting the hand luggage reweighed. stress standing crammed into a much too small area with all the other cattle. no facilities refreshments or toilets in 35 degree heat for 45 minutes. stress barging through to the plane. stress with the bright lights and constant announcements. no quick hostess service followed by a dimming of the lights so you can sleep. awoken every 20 minutes to an automated scratchcard announcement. uncomfortable seats which seem to have less padding than others. i landed with a headache which wrote off the following day. quite frankly its not worth the saving to put up with the constant barrage of sales attempts. luton airport to trapani. flight was on time. not that cheap after all extras added. very poor seat comfort. cabin size bag used gate8 luggage therefore avoided fees associated with baggage checkin. staff were at best indifferent. bristol to palma on 220813. followed all of the baggage restrictions even paying the extra 60 to book my sons small bag into the hold and booked our seats. flight staff on the way over were very difficult to understand. when we arrived in palma on the return told we had to pay 60 euros each as we didnt have boarding passes. i had tried to check in online the day we flew and still there was no option to print any further boarding passes. she could see on her system that i had booked 7 seats and accessed the system but said at it was my fault and that it was an easy system. to add insult to injury i had a message on my home answer phone advising me i hadnt checked in this was left whilst i was still on holiday i am new to ryanair and booked a return flights for a 17 day holiday in spain. when printing out the boarding pass which is compulsory i find that i can only print out the outbound boarding pass and not the return because of the 15 day advance booking in rule not an issue with easyjet. when i asked the customer services if ryanair can print the boarding pass for me at alicante airport i was told this would cost 70 which is more than the flight cost. i have no access to a pc and printer at my destination so not sure how i will get back. this is the last time i fly with ryanair. 28 august i flew fr611 from london to derry. ryanair is the only airline flying this route. i therefore had no other option. not travelling with a printer i needed to obtain a boarding pass at the auto checkin point at the airport. ryanair refused to issue a boarding pass before i paid an additional 70 pounds almost the same price i paid for the ticket. i could have flown to belfast and taken a 65 pounds taxi to derry and still be better off. attendants refusing to make eye contact said it was ryanair policy and failure to pay would mean refusal to board yet i am still unsure how i was supposed to know this. it therefore came across as an express strategy to extort funds from passengers. ryan airs majority passengers being budget travellers makes this particularly mean spirited. in all my travels i have never encountered any airline penalising customers for having to issue a boarding pass. i count myself lucky i never have to make use of ryanairs services again and will actively dissuade anybody at risk of having to do so. the only unpleasant experience during a two week uk holiday and therefore one i recount often. i tried submitting a complaint to the airline directly but the only way of doing so is via snail mail. just been on holiday to mallorca flew there with jet2 they were hassle free no problems and back with ryanair. the aircraft ryanair had us in felt old it looked like an old military transport inside. staff were miserable especially at boarding when i tried helping my grandma put her hand luggage in the metal box sizer she got all uppity because i was blocking other passengers i am never flying ryanair again. edinburgh  bordeaux for a weeks holiday returning on saturday 6 september 2013. ryanair does not when you add it all up save money at all. all the extra charges add up to the point where any saving is completely cancelled out. the staff couldnt care less about customers except as in flight cash cows and clearly the airline is not keen on attracting repeat business on both legs we were herded like cattle. bordeaux luggage collection was unbearably slow and there is no access to toilet facilities in the big shed that passes for a terminal  ryanair dont have access to the main airport terminal. on the return leg we were kept waiting for 40 minutes standing in a queue to board once again in the big shed with no apology for the delay no air conditioning or fresh air  gruesome i cannot see us travelling in this way ever again as it is just too unpleasant for words. lanzarote to manchester 6913. when we arrived at lanzarote airport informed of a delay. baggage check in was an abomination with people having to open their luggage in the queues to take out items. when we eventually managed to get through the farce of baggage check in we had to open our hand luggage and remove laptops etc but at the same time had to take our child out of his buggy fold that up and put it on the belt then pass ourselves through security scanners whilst our 2 year old son was left to his own devices. was waiting over half an our in a queue to actually get on the plane at the gate on the flight only 1 end of toilets was available and people were having to queue behind the stewardesses selling and blocking the aisles i would never recommend this airline dont pay to pre book seats as there was only 50 people on our flight going out so you could sit where you wanted. id rather pay more to go with a reputable company. flight birmingham  montpellier  birmingham. people need to remember they get what they pay for  you pay cheap you get cheap and that includes staff crew seats food etc. do not moan just follow the rules. i cannot understand why ryanair allows each passenger to take a carry on bag on board if there is only space for half of them in the overhead locker. the flight attendant stuffed my bag under the seat in front of me and i was very uncomfortable. i chose a nice looking brown bread sandwich from the booklet and of course it was not available. i have to say though that the flight attendants on this flight paphos  thessaloniki on 12 sep 2013 were very friendly. on the way back on sep 16 2013 the flight was delayed and we finally boarded at 11.00 pm and of course by then i had learned my lesson and ran to the plane to get a space in the overhead locker. the female flight attendant was obviously very tired and huffed and puffed all the way to paphos if was very visible that she hated her job and all the pax on board. the male flight attendant drank from a water bottle closed the toilet door with his foot and counted the money at the end of the service in the front where all passengers could see. my new wife and i were on our honeymoon in kos greece. we booked through thomson who organised everything. outbound we flew easyjet and had no real issues we had one small hold bag each and 1 small piece of hand luggage. we live in jersey and do not have ryanair there. therefore we knew nothing about it. on the way home we were flying with ryanair but had not heard of any of their rules. at check we were asked for our boarding passes. as we did not have them we got charged 70 for both. essentially we paid 140 for two pieces of paper then they said we had not paid for the luggage online. we paid a further 160 to get one bag on. then we found out that there are no allocated seats unless you pay more money to become priority passengers. paid a further 20 each to guarantee we sat together. we could have bought a whole new flight with a non low cost airline for that much it was the worst travelling experience with have both had. flew stanstedrome for a short stay with friends almost got bowled over by the rush to get off the bus and onto the plane to get seats. then on the way back at the rome checkin our checked bag was determined to be too heavy even though it was exactly the same weight it had been on the way out so we had to take items out and add them to the carryon bag before we could check the bag in. i would only recommend ryanair to someone who had absolutely no other way of getting to his destination. i travel with them several times a year. i fly between england and germany. this year i have travelled with them 4 times. after arriving at bremen airport today my partner and i entered the queue to hand over her luggage. we had paid an additional 30 eur the night before in order for her to take one piece of 15kg luggage as it is not included in the ryanair booking price. my partner was flying to stansted which is about 40 miles north of london. after 5 minutes of standing in the queue the ryanair person working at the desk disappeared and was talking to her friend at the hand luggage and boarding card control desk. i went over and asked her why she was not manning the desk any more and she said because i only take luggage 40 minutes before takeoff. when i said but we were waiting there and you closed the desk without even telling us she then lost her patience and got really rude. subsequently we paid the 60 euros. they call themselves a nofrills airline but in effect they are indeed an uncaring noservice airline. i would give them one star out of 10 for their airport staff. i will not be flying with them again. nothing cheap about ryanair make a mistake and they make you pay dearly. my family of four missed the flight stansted to trieste by being held up by immigration and security rebook flight next day 440 penalty original cost was 220 return flight so do the maths. being a first time traveller with ryanair we are from australia. ryanair is an experience you dont want to do to often. manchester  palma. paid for extra leg room which came with priority boarding. well worth the 15 each way to not stand in the queue to board or worry about not being sat together. the seats are very narrow and each seat is separated by an immovable board so you can not straddle empty seats. can not understand the reviews of people complaining about getting charged for not having their boarding pass. ryanair email a week before to tell you that you must check in online. no excuse in the world will get you out of this but you are told by email. they also email you the day before the flight with the hand baggage measurements so no excuses there either. where they do let themselves down is when the flights are delayed they offered no information whatsoever and there was a four hour wait of everyone staring at the screens. planes are also often dirty due to them not being cleaned in the short turn around time. as long as youre flying to a proper airport and not a satellite and end up paying for traintaxibus to get 60 miles to where you wanted to go one then they tend to be the cheapest by a long way as long as you play by the rules. for a 2 hour flight i can get over the lack of service and the slightly uncomfortable seating. even booking extra leg room they were still 150 quid cheaper than anybody else for return flights. ryanair use very small airports dusseldorf weez is not anywhere near dusseldorf 90 km and public transport is not easily available  very easy to be stranded. outgoing flight ok return flight airport staff very poor and continuously checking hand luggage for size and weight obviously trying to increase revenue. flight staff unhelpful and only interested in additional sales booking in very difficult to get right and easy to fall into ryanair penalties. consider other airlines before you use this company. the service is abrupt and very unfriendly. people are treated like second class citizens. our trip to treviso was appalling. at one point it was a free for all. no better than a cattle market. the airline is a disgrace to travel. like a conveyor belt there is no hospitality from staff. herded on like cattle as plane was late getting in from previous flight. what really got me was the fact we had paid to have 2 15kg cases in the hold but had to have our hand luggage sports bag type  a mere 56 kilos crammed under our legs as there was quote no room in the overhead lockers because it is crammed with 10kg luggage cases. so basically we pay and get our legs cramped for over 2 hours and those who dont have priority baggage space and leg space must remember that next time if there is a next time. i dont think we got acknowledged from staff at all apart from if we wanted to purchase anything. i have flown ryanair many times but only when there is no other viable option. other airlines go to my destination but not in the short time nor low fare cost this does not mean i dread each and every trip. fingers crossed my next trip will just get there and thats all i want. staff are rude and disinterested i worry if they would cope in an urgent situation. i am not satisfied with ryanair its just a matter of limited options. overpriced cardboard sandwiches and so to the lukewarm drinks but again i know this and dont buy them. having travelled very recently with ryanair from stansted to dublin i have to say i would avoid travelling with them again. we had checked in online and reserved seats but one of our party had a noneu passport so as directed on the boarding pass he went to show his passport at the check in desk only to be told that he couldnt fly to ireland as he didnt have a visa. would it not be sensible for a warning to come up to notify passengers of this requirement when booking the ticket instead of someone arriving at the airport and being refused boarding it was the attitude of the girl on the check in desk that was incredulous she was unsympathetic and very rude. customer careservice obviously not part of her training. my husband and i were on a 14 day holiday and selected ryanair to fly from edinburgh to dublin on september 15. i purchased tickets on august 23. in the us it customary for passengers to print their airline tickets at kiosk by simply entering their confirmation number of their itinerary. when i attempted to do the same the kiosk requested payment of 140 pounds. my husband and i were completely stunned as we had already made payment to ryanair for the tickets which included priority boarding and baggage fees. when i questioned the employee i was informed that i would have to pay 140 pounds in order to board the flight we felt completely extorted by ryanairs unscrupulous fees. after paying this fee we were then told that we could bring on 1 carry on bagthis would include a ladies handbag. we were instructed to place our carry on in this ridiculous contraption. if the bag exceeded this ryanair informed us that we had to pay an additional 60 pounds. i seriously caution anyone to seek alternative air transportation when considering ryanair as their mode of transportation as it will considerably be cheaper than using the so called low fare airline. i cannot understand why ryanair allows each passenger to take a carry on bag on board if there is only space for half of them in the overhead locker. the flight attendant stuffed my bag under the seat in front of me and i was very uncomfortable. i chose a nice looking brown bread sandwich from the booklet and of course it was not available. i have to say though that the flight attendants on this flight paphos  thessaloniki on 12 sep 2013 were very friendly. on the way back on sep 16 2013 the flight was delayed and we finally boarded at 11.00 pm and of course by then i had learned my lesson and ran to the plane to get a space in the overhead locker. the female flight attendant was obviously very tired and huffed and puffed all the way to paphos if was very visible that she hated her job and all the pax on board. the male flight attendant drank from a water bottle closed the toilet door with his foot and counted the money at the end of the service in the front where all passengers could see. flew to treviso with them from stansted hopefully will never have to fly with them again. awful airline most uncomfortable flight seats ever anything over an hours flight on those seats it makes the journey painful. the staff are awful but then again they probably get treated awfully so dont expect them to really care. london stansted to seville and return 1826th sep. it seems that to supplement the apparent cheap fares they look for any and every excuse under the sun to get money out of you. we did not have the ability during our trip to remote spain to preprint the boarding passes thought this would not be a problem as we had flown with a world class budget airline air asia earlier in the year and they provide machines at the airports to check in or you could use you smart phone to display the barcode. ryanair charged us 140 euros for two boarding passes which took the girl at checkin 30 seconds to do. this was as much as the return fares from stansted to seville. surely a charge must reflect the effort or cost associated with providing the service. they then bombard you before and during the flight trying to make you buy more rubbish from them. having flown ryanair before i thought i knew what sort of flight to expect sadly this airline has gone from bad to awful. i boarded with my hand luggage having been meticulously measured and weighted by staff at the gate to find a free for all frenzy aboard. the over head luggage lockers were already full with many people still clutching bags in the aisle. eventually after finding a vacant seat i asked the attendant where i should place my bag. i was told to put it under the seat in front of me i tried it didnt fit the attendant tried it still didnt fit so i was told to put it in the space between the seats. i questioned where i would then put my legs to be told that i would have to squeeze them in on top of my case. i said that this was unacceptable for a 2.5hr flight to be told that it was by own fault for not booking priority boarding and that my luggage would be off loaded if i did not comply i refused pointing out my bag was within the correct size only after some adjacent passengers chipped in did the steward seek to put my bag elsewhere. on the way back the flight was not fully booked so staff sectioned off a few rows of seats just to make sure no one enjoyed any extra space they had not paid for  talk about no frills this is a whole new level. flight 20913 malaga  bristol. fined 70 euro per person 2 people for not having printed boarding passes  had emailinternet problems and unable to do so in spain  the printing of passes and taking of fines at checkin took less than 5 minutes which seems excessive and very unfair profiteering. boarding gate opened about 17.30  queue enormous as first come first served seating unless you want to pay an extra 20 to reserve seat. started boarding just after 6  still boarding until about 7  nightmare experience like herding animals. held up by spanish boarding staff team as told not allowed duty free bag as only one bag per customer in cabin  option pay extra 60 euro or put in cabin holdall  which we did but very stressful and which then made cabin bag too big. in the meantime large numbers of passengers passed us making us some of the last to enter plane  chaos on board with luggage and seating. btw  3 girls passed in front whilst we had duty free bag issue  they were carrying large shoulder handbags and wheeled cabin suitcases but not challenged at all by boarding team staff. flight left over half hour late which appeared to be related to boarding chaos. never flying ryanair again 02102013. about a month ago i purchased flight tickets online from london luton to dublin. i paid in advance for ordering extra seat and luggage up to 20 kg. we reached the airport at 12.30. desk opens at 1300. when i told the clerk that i had not had the option to print a ticket she answered carelessly and rudely these are our procedures if you do not have 140 pounds to pay do not fly charged 140 pounds for printing two boarding cards then during the flight they flooded us with nonsense and aggressively tried to get us to buy from them. i know that this is first and last time i fly with this company. cheap flight does not mean poor service. charged 50 for extra case which i booked 4 days before i flew out and found out it was only for one way to bring the case back it would cost another 50. surely if you take a case on holiday you want to bring it back so this charge is a total rip off. it has nothing to do with security just pure greed from the airline. found the staff on baggage handling to be unhelpful and miserable. on returning to uk we went into the duty free and was told we could take one carrier bag with our goods on flight with our hand luggage but this was not to be we were told by boarding staff very rudely that are carrier bag had to be put in our hand luggage which didnt have any space. luckily we found a space in someone elses bag otherwise we would have lost the goods we had bought. on getting on the plane there was nowhere to put our bags other people were also having problems we had to put baggage under the seat in front of us which left no leg room at all and had a very uncomfortable flight home. flew bllstn. flight was almost on time and the value for money was very good. ryanair dropped the price of the tickets by 60 after i bought them. i am almost fluent in english and have visited more than 10 countries but i could only understand 20 of what was said in the cabin. i could feel my legs 50 of the time and was constantly asked to buy first hot food cold food standsted express tickets lottery tickets ryanair mobile and so on it was really disturbing beauvais paris to bratislava 8 september the absence of any seat booking as a standard service makes boarding ryanair feel like a cattle yard experience we paid the extra for a seat reservation and that worked well. the total inflexibility on luggage weight is a sham and price gouge policy. we are both smallish people our carry on luggage was well under weight and one checked in bag which of course we paid for was 1 kg over bang another 20e ie it is per bag if hers was under and mine over you still pay on the one that is over. the flight crew were fine but the check in woman forgot to stamp my wifes boarding document so having gone through the queue we had to run back for that. the airport shuttle service from porte maillot to beauvais was very good but it is 1.5 hrs. ryanair is now my airline of last resort. seats uncomfortable ridiculous rules which although we adhered to them we could see that others did not. hot food ran out and staff did not seem to have any comments other than what were likely to have been stock responses it seems if your flight is later in the day it is pot luck if the advertised food is available as it is not replenished between stops didnt want to travel with ryanair but really had no alternative at the time with destination and dates but would avoid in the future. i was catching the morning flight from barcelona to rome with 3 other companions. we sat awaiting to board when the call came up. we watched the farce play out as passenger after passenger wrestled with their carry on to shove it into the small regulation box. if they couldnt get it in the little metal box they got fined. as the line finally whittled down we decided to board. they dont turn on the airconditioning until the plane is in the air. it was then we realised that the seats were not allocated first come first serve. we had to hold our carry on on our laps. i looked above me wondering why we couldnt put our carry on in the overhead compartments. finally the aircon came on  just about the same time the captain started advertising the sale of scratchcards. 249 and 110 manchester  faro. perhaps i am too fussy as i normally fly scheduled for business and this was the first time i used ryanair. i weighed my case at 14kg but ryanair insisted it was 17kg. i was told to take things out and put them in my golf bag. if you forget the boarding pass that is printed by yourself there is a penalty of70 the crew on both legs were surly. all they did on a 2.5 hour flight was to try and sell things. boarding is a joke with everyone squeezing 10kg in lockers which do not have the capacity. as i said i normally fly schedule and they appear a similar price for far superior service. although the flights were on time passenger service and treatment with a constant aim of collecting more money is a dreadful experience. rome ciampino to londonstansted 4 october 2013. my 2 hr 20 minute flight was 1.5 hrs late. though we sat at the gate for 90 minutes the flight attendants charged 3 for water. unbelievable and unforgiveable. add in the fact theyre so strict about carryonbags and youll never even consider flying them. having queued early to get seats together due to no seat allocation. we got two seats together towards the rear of the aircraft and stored our luggage not the maximum size but to large to go under the seat in the overhead lockers. only to have it remover by the flight attendant shoved in my face and when queried as to where i should put it as it didnt fit under the seat was told thats your problem. i ended up with my luggage on my lap for the full 3 hour flight including take off and landing. i will never use them again. stansted to fuerteventura cannot believe that unless you priority board they will separate you from your children. surely this cannot be a suitable situation in the case of an emergency how are under fives expected to understand the safety information. never again our two year old was expected to sit over 7 aisles away from any of the adults in our party. due to boarding staff the queue at the gate was disrupted this resulted in our party being placed further along the queue to board we had been near the front. when we finally got on board there were only odd seats dotted around the aircraft. none of the adults could be seated together which was not such a major issue but the ryanair flight attendants there for safety not service thought it perfectly ok to seat a two year old 7 aisles from the nearest adult in our party. a two year old cannot understand or comprehend any safety procedure and ryanair do not even accept unaccompanied minors. nothing wrong with ryanair as long as you accept them as being 2nd class. they will try to rip you off at every opportunity so it is down to you to double check everything then check again. on my last trip i fancied a drink instead i opted to try the vegetable soup. nothing could prepare you for the obnoxious substance they put before me. i took an initial swig and handed it back to the stewardess saying it was disgusting. 2 other travellers within my proximity also complained about it and asked for a refund. no such luck when it comes to getting change for your order forget it. im still waiting for mine from my 2012 holiday. yes they are awful but they are reasonably cheap. my wife and i booked a flight from dublin to brussels. i checked in online and entered all the passport info. as i didnt have a printer i didnt print out the boarding passes. at the airport i went to an internet access point to print the boarding passes only to find the ability to print the passes was blocked. when i went to the ryanair checkin i was told it would be 70 to print the boarding pass only to find out they wanted 70 for each passenger. 140 to print out two boarding passes is total extortion. i will never fly ryanair again. london luton to knock mayo west of ireland yesterday 161013 on the 11.50am flight. i checked online before leaving and no reported delays. i also checked on the screen upon entering the airport at approx. 10.15am and again no reported delays only information was flight information and checkin desk to go to. then after going through quite a security queue id been informed by another passenger that the flight had been delayed until 3pm which was confirmed on the displays. the scheduled time then varied from approx. 2.45 to 4pm changing quite regularly. so after a considerable time spent waiting at the airport the flight finally took off well after 3.15pm by this time i was sitting on the plane and too tired to note the time of takeoff. i would recommend implementing a free beveragedrink for all customers in cases where any flight is more than 2 or 2.5hrs late. as this would show an acknowledgement the apology by the company and would not cost the company very much in terms of stock. in fact id say customers might then opt for seconds for which ryanair could charge resulting in profitable sales overall. in addition no information was passed onto the customers as to the reason for this delay. i have never been spoken to so rudely or treated with such contempt. i understood i should check in online but as i had problems printing this i was lead to understand that all details would be held by ryanair and this would be fine. the staff were rude and unhelpful. when i requested assistance printing in the airport i was sent to customer services only to find that they did not open until 06.00 my flight was at 05.55. my partner and myself both have eye problems and when i again requested some assistance i was very curtly told just put your glasses on. we struggled to use the pc only to discover that the printer was in fact out of order. i was left with no option but to pay 140 for two boarding passes to be printed at the touch of a button. we eventually got ourselves and a single case weighing 20.03kg on our way to corfu. i was therefore totally amazed when the same case minus two pair of shoes that were thrown away and toiletries that were used weighed 22.50kg. i would have assumed this wasnt possible but at ryanair anything can happen. we travelled as a party my child who is only 10 and had never flown before couldnt sit with me or her dad as there was no seats my nephew wasnt with his mother either  i couldnt believe how we were all separated from each other and a child sitting without a parent. i was annoyed that there was so many seats at the front of the plane where we could have sat together but had rope around them. the crew were rude and not helpful. fr 3232 departed from manchester to malaga on 13 october and i returned to manchester on 17 october on flight fr 3209. this airline is dreadful passengers are packed in like sardines due to a shocking seat pitch cabin crew trying to sell you something from start to finish. food and drinks well overpriced. first time flew with them but never again. absolute rubbish. flew from stansted to lanzarote with my partner. the outward journey was fine. it was the return where the problems started. i had to pay 50 each way for my guitar to come away with me. on my outward journey they let me take the guitar on the plane with no problems. on the return journey at the check in desk the staff asked if i wanted to put the guitar in the hold. i said no as its a valuable instrument. so they let me take it through. they did not inform me that i couldnt take it on the plane. as i was about to board a staff member told me that i couldnt take it on the plane and that it would have to go in the hold. wasnt happy about that but there was no other option. she then charged me 60 euros for this even though i had already paid 50 to bring the guitar and the instrument was listed on my boarding pass. they didnt tell me at check in that it had to go in the hold and that i couldnt take it on the plane. so they either purposely tried to rip me off or the girl at the check in desk didnt know what she was on about therefore i had to pay for her mistake. my wife and i flew to fuerteventura with ryanair 2 weeks ago. we will never travel with them again. we had to pay 140 to have 2 sheets of paper printed by the rudest person you could meet. coming home we paid 14 for a gin and tonic and a hot chocolate drink we had the most uncomfortable journey back to stansted. we were unable to land at stansted due to severe storms and were diverted to birmingham. we sat on the plane at birmingham for 2 hours while the captain decided whether or not to fly back to stansted. in the end he said we all had to leave the plane and coaches would be laid on to take us to stansted. he had no idea when the coaches would arrive but said it would be hours not minutes. the crew as we got off were all laughing telling us to enjoy our coach ride. the crews need an awful lot of training. we had to get a taxi home in the end. plane new. cabin crew ok. punctual free seating so i was not seated next to my travel companion. food and drinks for sale  i didnt try them. constant nagging on the pa about sales sales and more sales. seats not reclinable. no entertainment. leaving from remote airport arrived at remote airport. you get what you pay for. i set off from stansted to madrid last week only to be forced to pay 70 at the point of entry because i could not print out the boarding pass due to complications on how to go about it. on return i tried to print out another boarding pass but still not possible i went to the airport a day before my departure in there desk but nothing came out of it. the next day i was made to pay another euro 70. my son has just returned from a school trip to italy. they flew out with easyjet to sorrento and back with ryanair from rome. we had been told that the maximum hold luggage was 20kg for both flights. going out was no problem but coming back became a nightmare for him. his suitcase weighed 15.9kg at check in. his case was weighed on 3 different machines which all gave different weights. the person behind the desk was not helpful and told him he would have to pay 70 euros for excess my son informed the assistant that he had no hand luggage which would have given him a further 10kg. but all this person wanted was money from him my sons teacher then became involved. in fairness to him he himself refused to allow my son to pay the excess. my son had to open his case and thankfully some of his friends took items out and carried it through in their hand luggage. all the time this was happening my son was being made very aware that the flight would close soon personally i would never book with them. travelled from stansted to palermo return. website very unclear over charges resulting us having to pay 150 more for bag on return no ryanair employees at airport. return late due to earlier problems at stansted  these things happen but nearing arrival at stansted passengers asked to pick up all rubbish from under seats as the crew didnt have time at palermo stunning way of showing that the customer is important. try and complain online next day virtually impossible no inflight entertainment. we just had a flight from rome to madrid a few days ago and needed to do my online check in. me and my mother did the check in through the website and through the iphone app and waited for the confirmation email the night before the flight. we never got it. being tourists we dont know where to go or complaint and get the issue resolved so we head to ciampino airport to be informed that without the printed boarding pass we have to pay 70 eur for the boarding pass. if i didnt get the email even 8 hours after checking in online what am i to print if i never received anything. no customer service at ciampino no ryanair employees on site. dreadful staff at tenerife south two flights dublin and manchester queuing together and only one staff member. had to pay for extra weight after we paid said we could have purchased a ryanair bag to put items in from case. what difference would that make as the weight would be the same to go on the flight. dreadful staff on board aircraft  very rude. instructed all to stay in our seats with seat belts on most of the flights even we had no turbulence just so cabin crew could walk the aisle. will never fly with ryanair again and that was said by most customers on that flight. flight 6366 barcelona to bergamo 24th november 19.20. bag check point. i did this check 3 days before in beragamo the bag was the same and fitted perfectly at bergamo. today mysteriously didnt. inside the bag there were exactly the same things. the rude hostess not only wouldnt help but told me that it didnt fit because i had filled it too much. i paid 60 euros in bag fees. in a long row only my bag was checked and other passengers noticed that there were other cases far bigger than mine  which werent checked. once on board those bags didnt fit in the overhead locker and the crew put them in the hold at zero cost. this is outrageous. i will never use this company again. we returned from gran canaria to stansted on the delayed flight by 2 hours 20 min on 78 december. the passenger next to me was drunk shouting and carrying on when he got on the plane. he then drank at least 10 miniature bacardis and pepsi supplied enthusiastically by cabin staff. mercifully he fell asleep but did not fasten his seat belt during landing although he then stood up while the plane was still moving quite fast. there was no inspection of seat belts by cabin staff before landing nor was he told to sit down. our seats were near the emergency door where passengers are supposed to assist with evacuation. he was a big man who was in no state to assist and would have been a serious hindrance if there had been an emergency. clearly the policy of the cabin staff is to sell as much booze as possible and not bother with basic safety or the comfort of other passengers. i choose the cheapest flights and most convenient schedules available when travelling from ireland and uk to other european destinations. approx 9 times out of 10 the winner seems to be ryanair price and timing are great. when i choose easyjet or aer lingus im delayed 9 times out of 10. do you want luxury do you want 1hr to board a plane do you want 1 hr to disembark a plane if the answer is yes then simply dont choose ryanair are you someone who has several bags are you someone who complains and tries to inconvenience others around you are you someone who takes 1 flight per year if so then dont fly ryanair  and do the rest of us a favour. lets be realistic. who gave europe cheap flights ryanair. not a family friendly airline can not get seats together unless you are prepared to stand in a queue for 50 minutes before your flight. trying to find a place to store hand baggage next to impossible we flew with easyjet this summer and had a much more positive experience maybe someone from ryanair should try an easyjet flight and see how passengers should be treated. bari to stansted nov 24  without access to a printer my wife and i arrived at bari airport for the flight minus boarding passes. we were told that a euro 70 per person would be charged to print the boarding passes  euro140 total. this is nothing less than fraudulent. the first time i travelled with ryanair my problem was that they were trying to find a way to make you pay 50 euros for your bag because it would not fit in their box so i paid them the 50 euros. second time i bought extra baggage so to be in the clear. i flew from thessaloniki to milan and it was ok they were still looking at your hands for luggage trying to find a way to charge you with something. on the way back from milan to thessaloniki i arrived at the gate at 7.10am due to a general strike in milan  an accident on the road the plane was leaving at 7.25 am despite the fact i told that i was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances the pilot refused to board the plane 15 minutes before take off. my girlfriend and i arrived early and were treated to a lengthy queue at stansted before a manic rush for seats ensued. does the company not realise that not allocating seats will cause this it flares up tempers and causes the whole plane load of passengers to be angry from the start. i stored my hand luggage in the overhead compartment and when i eventually got semi comfortable in my tiny seat i was asked by the cabin crew to move my bag from the overhead compartment to under my seat. i am 6.5ft tall and i explained this to the cabin crew that i would not have any room for my legs if i did this. both the outgoing and return journeys were the same with absolutely no comfort whatsoever and incessant adverts being played to us offering to sell ecigs or take part in exciting competitions. any food on offer was overpriced. the return flight from venice the out of town airport was akin to my army days in northern ireland. normally reasonable people cooped up like battery hens in a hot and stuffy room forced to stand for 2 hours waiting for ryanair to sort their act out. after 2 hours the queue system we have ourselves put in place started to crumble and people began to flare up. once the doors opened it was literally a stampede. dozens of angry sweaty people paying for the privilege of running a race. i was exhausted by the experience. they have absolutely no regard for your comfort or well being. booked a flight from birmingham to trieste a few months back. had an email last week saying this route had been cancelled. advised to contact customer services. english seemed to be their 3rd language. i was paying for the call albeit ryanair had inconvenienced me not the other way round. after 4 phone calls i managed to get someone who both spoke snd understood english. the route in question was very popular but ryanair want people to use stansted and are gradually withdrawing services from regional airports. flew fr6621  6622 to tenerife from edinburgh return. first and last time ill use this airline  total rip off. stood for an hour at edinburgh check in then another 45 minutes at the gate in the hope my wife and i would get a seat together why should we pay extra for this. on board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. all cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. we heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old ryanair trick. return check in at tenerife was ridiculous 5 ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks thats nearly 700 passengers. no ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege its standard with everyone else. more rude cabin staff on the way home which cemented not only ours but a lot more people on boards perception of ryanair  never again. ryanair never cease to plunge to new depths in customer experience. always looking for a new way to con passengers into falling foul of a regulation so they can extort money to bring their cheap fares in to line with the proper airlines. this time we made sure we packed a bag within the regulations got priority boarding and then had a rude stewardess snap at us to remove the bag and coats from the over head locker to make room for oversized late boarders bags  then try and take my bag into the hold bristolalicante fr8297 261013. long weekend in benidorm flew out with easyjet and because of the time back with ryanair. the free for all at the gate will stay long in the memory it was a very unpleasant end to the trip and we all vowed never to use this airline again. barcelona  las palmas feb 14 return feb 18. saying goes you get what you pay for with ryanair you get less. went for a weekend to rest and came back exhausted mainly due to a very uncomfortable flight. advertisements everywhere stressed out staff plastic seats that wont recline. 6 february from newcastle to dublin. my daughter has just returned to her home in ireland after visiting for a few days with her baby daughter. why is it beyond staff to help a lady down the stairs with a bag and buggy. she asked for help at newcastle and no one not even passengers offered to help her down the flight of stairs. there were ground staff standing around and still could not help. the staff checking the tickets were very offhand with her. after years of refusing to use ryanair due to timedate constraints i had to book a flight with them today. ive also heard and did notice that theyve removed ridiculous charges for paying on line etc. however ive just noticed that i can only check in online 7 days before the flights unless i buy a preallocated seat. because of my flight times this means i will have to find a place to print out my boarding pass while away. so yes its an improvement that people can pre book seats but they have reduced the online check in time from 15 days to 7 if you dont pre book and pay for the seats. this will be the last time i book with them  ive not even flown yet. 3 friends and i were staying in dublin and decided to take a day trip to liverpool. i did not have a printer so had to pay 15 to get my ticket printed out. this was the worst flight ive been on we were already tired and just wanted to get to liverpool on top of that we had to deal with the unfriendly staff that were not helpful whatsoever. the plane was crowded hot and uncomfortable. if you wanted a glass of water you had to pay for it. i had to take this flight on the way back and i will never be flying with ryanair again. flight from rome to thessaloniki. unexplainable landing at plovdiv bulgaria. when we arrived there no one at the airport they opened it for us. after waiting for a long time someone came and told us that we are going to leave by bus. it was an 8 hour bus trip to thessaloniki and of course they didnt give us water or food. ryanair has a very long way to go to improve the service it offers. i experienced appalling customer service on a flight from bristol to dublin on 14th feb. a male steward took ryanairs poor customer service to a new low  he was extremely rude bad humoured and swore in front of my 11 year old daughter. additionally ryanairs new seat allocation policy appears to be at the expense of carrying on your hand luggage if your bag is not in the first 90 bags on board. not only had i the inconvenience of lugging my case around the airport but had to wait for it in bristol as it was taken off me as i boarded. always 1 step forward and 2 back with ryanair easyjet is cheap and cheerful ryanair is cheap and nasty. feb 14 manpaphos. this is the most budget airline i have come across i became paranoid about the weight of my luggage thankfully we were within the guidelines however on arrival to the gate 2 ryanair employees were waiting to pounce scrutinising everyones hand luggage and asking them to place their cabin bags in the frame. lucky for us we were ok but numerous passengers who could not fit theirs were made to pay 50 which were then put in the hold. why did the check in staff not ask to weigh their cabin bags at check in  in my opinion this is the way they make an extra 50 per passenger  some cheap flight for these unfortunate people students many of whom were going home for half term and short of money to begin with  for me never again. ryanair have no pr skills whatsoever this is a complete lack of training in every area of customer service. fr1121 on sun 9th march 2014  boarded the plane after a 45 minute delay on the check in desk to be told that the pilot was not prepared to fly a plane which had a problem with the water supply. after sitting on the runway for approx. 50 minutes we then had to wait for water and for refuel. finally we took off to tenerife. on landing at tenerife sur the captain aborted the initial landing and escalated back into the sky to attempt a second landing. also no food on the plane other than snacks. paris beauvais to bologna. fr4304 19 mar 2014. ryanairs business model is based upon rippingoff 20 of customers and then using this money to offer cheap flight and cheap services to the other 80. last night i was ripped off for 70 euros which was actually the price of my ticket just because i didnt checkin online it was my first time with this airline and there was nothing mentioned when they sent the eticket they took advantage of the little t&c that they claim to have put somewhere on their website. staff were rude and ready to fight. bhxdub return. first flight was fine but on the way back we were delayed 5 hours and then ryanair didnt bother to tell us that the plane was actually in belfast and that people needed to get on a coach to belfast from dublin in order to get back we got back past midnight and we were supposed to be back at around 5pm. no help whatsoever and no sorry or anything from ryanair. after a severe accident in spain which resulted in both arms broken i was taken to malaga airport to fly home to manchester on flight zb660 on saturday 1st feb. i was treated appallingly by the staff and cabin crew of this flight. i was left in my wheelchair at the boarding gate whilst all the other passengers boarded the plane and when my daughter and i finally entered at the front of the plane we were pleased to see the front 4 rows empty only to be told we couldnt sit there as our seats were on the back row. we explained i couldnt walk down the aisle with both arms at right angles but were rudely told well walk sideways. my daughter stood to put my seat belt on me and again came the command sit down just as the plane began to move throughout the flight not one cabin crew came to offer help a drink or enquire after my wellbeing. no help was offered to my daughter who was trying to help me juggle hand luggage etc. were sitting ready for take off to carcassone and not only were we caught on the 7 day rule so had to pay for seats boarding staff tried to make us put correctly sized cabin bags in the hold. we were among the first 30 to board. when we asked why we were told last 50 passengers today have to do this because there wouldnt be enough space for everyones. in a flight of 200 passengers this would not apply to the first 150 we pointed out. we refused. the scams never end do they we flew from glasgow to dublin with this company the staff were very inexperienced and basically rude. we were not aware that we had to print our own boarding pass this information was sent to our home email address problem being we had already left home to start our trip before we received it. we were told very abruptly by a staff member that we would have to get a boarding pass other wise we were not getting through. we asked where we could get one and he sent us back to a young fellow that asked us if we were told that there was a fee obviously the older bully left it up to the young fellow to break the news of the seventy pound fee. to add insult to injury on our return journey when we passed over our boarding passes that our hotel printed for us they were ripped in half by the airline staff. which makes it more ridiculous that we had to pay 70 pounds for a piece of paper to get it ripped up. needless to say we will never be travelling with this company again. since our experience we have heard of many many complaints from other past customers. flew with ryanair for the first time last weekend never again. took my grandson to ireland for his birthday. our return was very upsetting got to the airport 5 hours early was told by ryanair we couldnt check in until 2 hours before flight. when i returned to check in was told i would have to pay because i had not done it online which was more than the flights 70 euros each which spoilt our break. so annoyed by the new 7 day check in scam how low will they go. you now have to buy an allocated seat even if you dont want to if you are coming back after 7 days as many of us are. flight leaves early in the morning or arrives late at night no staff around to help. scheduled time adds extra hour to make sure they are on time flights are much more expensive than before. there is only one reason to fly ryanair and that is destination they tend to fly to places others dont. if there was choice like dublin then i always choose the rival ie aer lingus. going to spain for over one week and you have got to go find a computer and a printer to print off your return boarding pass unless you do what ryanair want you to do and buy a more expensive ticket and book a seat. now when you are looking at the flight and ready to book it does not tell you about any of this until you have paid for the ticket then when you come to get your boarding pass then you are stung with this. it is disgraceful. if you have a elderly mother like i have you have no option buy to pay as how can she use a pc and printer in a foreign land. never again. horrible experience from lisbon to brussels on 2342014. not only passengers were treated like cattle but the flight had a 45 minute delay. the worst part was that i could not take my personal cabin size luggage into the cabin. furthermore i was travelling with a 3 year old and no logical explanation was given concerning the criteria to select passengers who could not take their cabin luggage. all personnel at the airport and inflight was very rude and not even an apology for the delay was given. finally the tickets were not that cheap. common sense is urgently needed ryanair are a rip off we booked a 2 week holiday with ryanair able to print off our boarding passes for the flight out but not for the flight back. i assumed you were just given them at the airport on the way back when we arrived at the airport we went to the check in desk and were directed to another desk where they told us that we would have to pay 350 or we would not be allowed on the flight as a family with 4 young children we had no choice but to hand over the money. this is a terrible way to run an airline taking all that money from a family and being told we would have to pay or we would not be getting on the flight. we flew from glasgow to dublin with this company the staff were very inexperienced and basically rude. we were not aware that we had to print our own boarding pass this information was sent to our home email address problem being we had already left home to start our trip before we received it. we were told very abruptly by a staff member that we would have to get a boarding pass other wise we were not getting through. we asked where we could get one and he sent us back to a young fellow that asked us if we were told that there was a fee obviously the older bully left it up to the young fellow to break the news of the seventy pound fee. to add insult to injury on our return journey when we passed over our boarding passes that our hotel printed for us they were ripped in half by the airline staff. which makes it more ridiculous that we had to pay 70 pounds for a piece of paper to get it ripped up. needless to say we will never be travelling with this company again. since our experience we have heard of many many complaints from other past customers. on 15th sept 2013 we four people from australia after visiting beautiful paris went to paris beauvais airport to catch 920 am flight fr9632 to rome. all were checked in online the night before in the hotel we stayed. however boarding passes were not printed out as per instruction in the email from the airline. a mistake was made by us. at the checkin counter we were told euro 70 per person would be charged if no boarding pass was presented. we could not believe it in the first instance but later were confirmed by his duty manager. we do not believe that euro 70 for printing a boarding pass is justifiable by any standard. it is in fact more than the airfare itself and more than the fee for an extra luggage euro 60. while we accept the error we made the punishment was well beyond anyones imagination hence it is not reasonable and not justifiable. we felt like being robbed on highway with no way to escape. and we still do. we must point out that the checkin gentleman was kind enough to show us a selfserving internet kioskaccess point where printing was available. unfortunately after tried on two computers with loss of a total of euro 20 worth of coins and notes we went back to the counter and tried to request for printing at a fair and reasonable cost. the second complaint is about the way in which the duty manager a lady handled our request for help. she was arrogant in our view. having heard of our explanation she showed no sympathy but said it was the company policy and we either pay or do not fly today. the fact that we could not print out the passes at the computer kiosk did not bother her at all because it was someone elses equipment hence nothing to do with her. fr697 from palma to prestwick on 16th april 2014. we were not able to checkin online for our return flight to the uk within the 12 days to 2 hours before takeoff window. the website would not accept our booking reference. we assumed we would be able to just print our boarding passes at checkin like any other normal airline. instead we were told that it didnt matter that we experienced issues online. ryanair policy states that we now had to pay 70 per head flying regardless of our circumstances otherwise we would be left in mallorca. this amounted to 210 for my wife daughter and i. the saga did not end there the lady at the ryanair desk decided it was a good idea to sit a family travelling with a 3 year old completely separately. my daughter  16f my wife  17c and me in 16c. we were flying on one of their boeing 737800 aircraft and that rows 16 and 17 are exit rows. the cabin was a mess and on both the outbound and inbound legs it was explained to us that there would be limited catering due to insufficient supplies. at least the flight was on schedule. at what cost though we flew to dublin from paris beauvais. we were so unsatisfied with this unreasonable priced airline who call themselves low cost who were late 4 hour delay on a plane and were told that the only thing we could have to eat or drink was the water from the galley. we decided to not fly ryanair for the return. i have used ryanair before this april when i went to tenerife and have mainly found them ok however on this last trip i printed out the boarding cards for the flight out and was not taken to the flights back so thought i couldnt print those out. however when arriving at tenerife south and standing in the queue for ages i was told i would have to pay 70 euros for each boarding card to be printed also i apparently hadnt booked a case which was a little strange as i had booked one on the way out. after queuing i was sent to the ryanair desk where i was told i would have to pay 140 euros. so two pensioners had to fork out 140 euros for something that took 2 seconds. it will be a long while before i use ryanair again. i dont appreciate their staff service before boarding. in my experience when i was leaving from birmingham for barcelona i was requested to put my cabin luggage into the sizer without reminding. since my luggage which its design is flexible and there are two rows of zippers at that moment it was not suitable for the sizer. i said i can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didnt have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. their attitudes were like robbers and i didnt have any options then because there was nobody beside me. actually when i returned from barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but ive used a belt to tie it up. therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when i left form barcelona for birmingham ive also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. i understand terms and conditions of ryanair in advance. but what a shame the attitude of ryanairstaff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. how come they charged it without any warning if i could have one more minute to organise my suitcase. before boarding especially originally ive been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate. i wont recommend anyone to be ryanair customer and would tell them the story to warn them if they still have to. 7 hour delay from manchester to palma airport flight fr3441. checked baggage in and no mention of delay 5 minutes later through security it stated on the flight boards delayed to 00.40 original flight time 17.35. no one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. really poor customer service in my opinion. hiding behind a telephone. other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. do under 5s not eat and drink although this is a first for me with ryanair the 10 hours we were actually stuck in the airport as no one would let you out was exhausting and for that reason along with the rubbish customer care i will never fly with them again. avoid. i was warned by several family members to not fly with ryanair but the flight i wanted with my friends was cheap so i didnt mind so much. im usually a very easy going person but ryanair make my blood boil they changed my flight time by more than 8 hours meaning that i would lose a day on my holiday i applied for a refund as did my three other friends for the coming home flight we rebooked another coming home flight for a few days later with ryanair all of my friends got their refund however ryanair refused to give me mine they said that i cannot just refund one leg of the journey. eventually they said they would refund it 3 months later and im still waiting for money to be put back into my account. i highly recommend you dont put yourself in this kind of position to be tricked out of your money. ryanairs business model appears to me to revolve around cheap ticket pricing with highly complicated and rigid terms and conditions which the majority of people will fall foul of thus allowing ryanair to introduce additional costs hence restoring their profits. placed a booking ryanair changed the rules between the time i placed my booking and date of flying which meant they expect me to receive return flight boarding cards by email whilst on holiday and then try to get the hotel to print them out for me. there are too many ifs buts and maybes in that scenario so alternatively  pay 13 per person to be able to print boarding cards before we leave the uk. we myself my wife and our two sons booked flight fr 8412 months in advance from milan bergamo to budapest on april 29 2014. we checked and confirmed the flight status on the ryanair website the night before the flight. we got an email from ryanair a few hours before departure saying the flight had been cancelled without stating any reason whatsoever. we tried calling the ryanair hotline to no avail. we checked the ryanair website and called bergamo airport to check if there were other ryanair flights to budapest as we had a prepaid rooms that night in a budapest hotel and definitely had to be there the next morning a the very latest. there were no flights on the same day or the following day from any milan airport. we had to commute to milan malpensa to buy expensive alternate flights to budapest with an overnight connection at warsaw. ryanair is an absolute nightmare of an airline. an utter waste of time and money and the absolute pits in customer service. we will never book it again. our travel insurance will not fully cover all the expenses we were constrained to incur because of this cancelled flight. please spare yourselves the aggravation. me and 5 other girls flew ryanair from manchester to tenerife and back again on may 9th 2014. overall not too bad i guess for a budget airline but the new introduction of the 7 day boarding pass malarkey meant we were stung on the return flight for 70 euros. as this is on the return flight we had obviously spent up and had to contact one of the groups husbands to ask if we cold charge to his credit card to get us home. at no point was this new procedure explained to us and yes i appreciate it is probably in the very small print but if you are a regular flyer with ryanair which the girl who booked was you would expect something like this to at least be mentioned when you book and i can in no way begin to fathom how they can justify 70 euros. it is simple case of robbery and ryanair should be ashamed of themselves. we were by no means the only people caught out with this phenomenal fee and it certainly feels like you are being held to ransom. another peev was that when we boarded some people had to put their hand luggage in the checked in luggage area as we were told there was no room in the above holders  lie they were nearly empty. because of the unjustifiable boarding pass scam i will certainly never book a ryanair flight of my own accord and i will be telling anyone who chooses to to think before flying ryanair. on its new website it started with a contact us form carefully buried in the depths of their website. that contact form has now got a very clever gimmick  theres a comments box for freehand input but you cannot use it because you first have to select a category of commentcomplaint. the moment you do this the freehand box disappears because they want you to use only their computerised answers. basically ryanair has not changed its spots in the slightest. by far the worst airline i have been on. as many others have experienced  i had to pay an extra 70 for each person to check in because i did not know you had to check in online. i was traveling out of switzerland and the ryanair representatives through swissair were rude and not helpful at all we arrived 3 hours early and asked to check in and were told to wait until 2 hours before. 2 hours before we were told we should have already checked in so we had to pay an extra 210 for the 3 of us as far as the airline goes you feel a little like cattle. there is no leg room and obviously cheap seats. terrible customer service and although it seems cheep at first  there are extra charges for everything i recently flew from limoges to stansted on a sunday. i tried to book in by computer but the page would not accept my information. i tried phoning the help number but found they did not work weekends. when i arrived at the airport i was charged the extra 70 euros. what would have been a cheap flight worked out to be very expensive. why is it one has to bookin twice once on the computer and once at the airport oh of course silly me. they make more money this way. i have used the dinardstanstead route many times and found it quite useful and cheap but this double booking is just a ripoff. its supposed to be cheap but ive actually worked out i can do it for the same price on another airline. and how can i avoid paying for their insurance another ripoff. penalty for not checking in for return flight is extortion.70 a head making it a 280 blow for my young family and i. we started outward journey at 4am so no time to check in then stayed in a remote place with no internet or computer. had to sit separately on flight from my young family 3 and 6 year olds who hated it. cabin crew completely hopeless at finding way to allow us to sit together. overall very disappointing will never use ryanair again long gone are the days of 0.99 flights. you cant even complain properly and when you do eventually make contact with someone they dont apologise or use your actual name disgusting customer service ridiculous systems all round we flew from pisa to barcelona the inflight staff were nice but the ones at the airport were horrible and rude. by the time you add in all the extra costs it is no longer a deal. we were flying from londonluton to dublin on june 1 2014. i am a world traveller and this was the first time an airline charged gbp70 for not printing a boarding pass and we had no choice other than to pay. i and two of my friends ended up missing the flight as it took 510 mins to provide the boarding passes  the boarding pass was hand written. we were just running to the gate and airline crew just shut the gate on us the flight was still open and they refused to take us in. we had to return to the counter hoping that they would transfer us to the next flight to our shock they demanded another gbp110 per head to transfer. we had to cancel our dublin trip thanks to ryanair. we were traveling from paris to rome. we did not have access while traveling to a printer so we were unable to print our boarding passes. we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before our flight. we were told that all boarding passes had to be printed or it was 70 euros per person. there were 4 of us so this was a hefty fee. i saw others approaching the counter to check in with their phones. i asked about this and they said it had to be done 2 hours ahead of the flight and it was too late. 90 of the people that approached the counter had to pay additional fees. we also paid ahead for 2 bags. 4 of us ere traveling so we knew we would have that much. they said that only one bag showed on their side of the reservation so we needed to pay for the other bag. i had an email confirming 2 bags and they said they couldnt go by that. 2262014. flying from stansted to treviso venice for 7 days holiday we were fine on our outward journey as we had been able to checkin and print off the boarding passes however the system would allow us to do the same for our return at that point in time. where we were staying we had no access to a computer or printer but assumed perhaps foolishly that at treviso airport they would have the same system as they do in stansted and we would be able to checkin and print off at their machines for a nominal fee. how wrong we were. we arrived well before the 2 hour time scale but ended having to pay additional 140 euros money making at its worse i feel very sorry for the staff at the check in desks whilst we were there i saw at least another 2 people who were in the same position as we were. it wasnt until i got home i saw the email from ryanair advising of the additional costs. i received a text message at 23.00 the night before our departure at 9.50 reminding us we needed to checkin and print off the boarding card if they had notified me in this text of the astronomical charge awaiting us at the airport we would have search around the entire city of venice for someone to assist us but it wasnt included never again will we use ryanair should have gone to marco polo airport and flown british airways like other reviews said the ryanair website kept crashing so i had to have the ticket agent at the airport print the tickets for me at the ridiculous cost of 15 euros per ticket. during boarding i was told i couldnt bring on my coffee which i had purchased at the cafe right next to the gate past security due to security concerns while everyone else brought on their waters and fruit juices. while on the plane a flight attendant removed my bag from the overhead in order to put in someone elses bag. he then tried to fit mine which contained a laptop ipad and kindle into a separate overhead by cramming it in. i finally had to yell at him to stop to which he complained my bag was too large to fit. he then forced me to put it under my seat. needless to say this will be the last time i use ryanair. we paid 277 one way from bordeaux to marseille which was reasonable but they charged us 283 more at the airport simply because we did not print out our boarding passes in advance no matter that we did not have internet or a printer while traveling. we did not know about this policy until we arrived at the airport. they would not refund our ticket and even worse they acted mad at us for being upset what a ripoff santiago de compostela to madrid may 30 2014. i guess we were not the only ones who were ripped off by this airline. we had the same experience as many of the passengers. we reserved online paid with credit card got an email that its been confirmed. so we were hoping that it will be an easy check in since we came two hours early. we were told at the airport that we should have checked in online and that the payment was forfeited so we had to pay again for the same flight. in addition we had to pay 40 euros each for our luggage since only 2 small carry ons were allowed. since we had to go on that flight we had no recourse but to give in. i have never encountered such poor rules and such rude personnel. flew manchestergran canaria. good flight times and got baggage quickly. attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. in the uk the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. when at manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. we were then requested to proceed to boarding that i can only explain as a cattle market. we were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. whilst on the flight to gran canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. baggage  the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. when we flew out from manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. on return from gran canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in manchester and came to light in gran canaria on our return. overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle. travelling from palma to bournemouth june 2014  we were sat in the plane after 40 minutes of wait in the queue and then informed right away after being seated that there was an expected delay of 2 hours. it did literally take 2 hours to take off people on the plane were all unhappy and complaining. travelling with young child we would have expected not to be seated in the first place we would have preferred to wait in the airport hall where some food and drinks are available to buy instead. not pleased at all with this company. on a flight to to eindhoven from dublin on 2762014 the plane pushed back from the terminal and 5 mins later we were informed of a technical problem. we returned to the stand whilst the fault was investigated. eventually we were told that the problem could not be fixed and another aircraft was being prepared. we eventually got on our way about 2.5 hours late. on the return journey on 3062014 exactly the same thing happened. the plane pushed back and then we were informed of technical problems. we returned to the stand and the fault was investigated. after about an hour we were told that the problem was solved and we got on our way. on the first flight we were told we could not use the toilets whilst waiting for the fault to be found. after numerous complaints the staff gave in and allowed us to use the toilet at the rear of the aircraft. return from tenerife south. the same old problem  unable to print out return boarding pass charge 70 euros. baby ill on board the mother was unable to get any assistance and i heard the stewardess complain of the cheek of the women to expect them to help. hand luggage taken at boarding and stowed in hold no warning so last second grab of passports etc. went out thomas cook  superb. never again with ryanair. flight fr9387 barcelona  east midlands 25062014. got to barcelona airport to find flight cancelled due to french air traffic strike. this is when the horror starts had to wait in queue for 4 hours before i got to the information desk first question asked  would you like to cancel with refund of flight. my answer to that was no i want you to get me home this being 25614. answer to that  yes first available flight 1714. here is your new paper work what about accommodation answer find your own transport go to 23 star hotel keep your receipt see you in a few days time. i found alternative flights. i have never been so disappointed by a lack of customer service in my life. we arrived in plenty of time to make our flight from gatwick to dublin. this was a mid vacation excursion. we found out that they cant print boarding passes for anything less then 70 each. we also found out that they cant actually handle the money for the outrageous bag fee. we missed our flight and had to rebook. the whole adventure ended up costing an additional 450. once on the plan we found it both dirty and cramped. i will never fly ryanair again. flight fr 2132  an number i will never forget. 2nd time with ryanair and first time although no real problems felt like we were treated as second class citizens so vowed never to book with them again. however family holiday to lanzarote and the only people flying out in the morning so we arrive before lunch was ryanair. so i hesitantly booked even though it was no cheaper than the other airlines. first came the con where you can no longer print your boarding passes unless you have paid the extra for allocated seating until 14 days before you return date. as this was a 2 week holiday i was already at the airport catching my flight out so had to pay for allocated seating. this was just a snippet of what was to come. the flight out was cattle market heaven but quite uneventful so consoled myself with the fact that i had done the right thing and would have an extra half day holiday by flying out early. the flight home was the nightmare we were called to our gate then the gate changed twice so the long queue of people were already irate when there was a general murmur around the crowd. this was when the first person had received a text to say the flight had been delayed due to technical issues and we had a delay of over 5 hours. not told anything by the staff on the ground the whole airport became chinese whispers. in total i had 4 texts from ryanair delaying the flight eventually by 12 hours. we did not arrive home until 5am. i feel like i now need another holiday after spending 15 hours in a very hot uncomfortable airport and then a further 4 hour flight home. flew with my 8 month pregnant daughter who had required doctor signed ryanair paperwork which she was never asked to show. had just cabin bags on the outbound flight but with family bought baby presents on the return it required a case being put in the hold. getting assistance to do this from the ryanair desk staff was like pulling teeth. dismissive unhelpful arrogant and rude summed up by the comment from one ryanair staff member with the statement i cant be out here just helping one member of the public. i enquired what was the minimum number she could help priority booked and seats reserved only to be herded from one queue at the gate to the next queue at the entrance of the air bridge then on to the queue at the aircraft doorway 20 minutes standing during intense summer heat. not the sort of treatment to subject an expectant mother to. not one member of staff took the care or comfort of this pregnant lady into account. the only smile came from cabin crew when trying to sell their overpriced beverages. an appalling airline worthy of their reputation of flying their customer in cattle class. fr3872 from east midlands to pula on 24th july 2014. we return on 31st july. i was unable to print off boarding passes at home i had to do it at the airport using ryanairs computerised screens. this cost 210 for three people. why i could understand paying 10 but why on earth 70 thats typical money grabbing ryanair. as usual the announcements at the gate and in the plane were so rushed that it was impossible to hear all that was said. ryanair may be cheap but im a human being and expect to be treated with civility and fairness. high expectations no. from the outside the plane looks modern and fully equipped for a flight but no no no. the inside faded yellow overhead compartments torn leather and faded blue seats no inflight entertainment whatsoever. in fact the planes are in such bad condition and poorly equipped theres not even a pocket in front for you to put a magazine or something all of your safety notices are printed on the back of the chair in front which means you have to amuse yourself with possibly scenarios throughout flight just by looking at it. i used to think easyjet was the lowest quality airline but ryanair that sets a new low. the staff unhelpful unfriendly didnt crack a smile the whole flight. stansted to la rochelle. got to airport around 3 hours before departure and as we had no baggage we went through security. security took 27 mins. unacceptable. then we waited for around for 90 mins before flight was called and we went to gate 44 immediately. as being called 40 mins before and getting to gate 35 mins before we thought the plane would be there in 10 mins. it wasnt and was there no earlier than 25 mins of waiting at the gate. we were rushed on to the steps to tarmac whist pax where deboarding and we where on it around 3 mins before our scheduled departure time. we where off 15 mins behind schedule. the flight was smooth and fine. i had a pepsi and just looked out of the window no ife or food. we sat in row 5 and had priority boarding. the aircraft landed 10 mins early and we had the usual fanfare. we where de boarded quickly and went straight through to meet relatives who have a 2nd home and took our bags with them. la rochelle to stansted. we got there 2 hours 15 mins before flight and we went through security. relatives driving back took bags with them. there is 1 duty free shop and a cafe. there where 2 aircraft departing at same time and being the first in the lounge gets us a seat. la rochelle gets overcrowded. the aircraft got in 10 mins early but the other brussels flight was late. boarding began 10 mins before departure and we where off just after the brussels 15 mins behind. the flight was ok. my seat was dirty and had gum under the seat in front. again row 5 and priority boarding. we landed 2 mins behind and ryanair were not sneaky and didnt do the fanfare we were out of stansted in 25 mins. flew edinmaltaedin with my 5 year old son for 7 days and so was unable to print off return boarding pass before arriving in malta. there are no internet cafes in sliema malta so thought would print off boarding pass at machine at the airport. on arriving at malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me i was too late and should have done this in malta how exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel before finally pointing me towards the computer where i could do this. this touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so i was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this womans complete lack of customer service. an eur 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. what gets me is that i knew i had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. i noticed lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. i had to beg this woman to tell me where was the ryan air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me i was too late etc when i still had time. however reading other reviews it looks as if even if i had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged. i am sure they can afford to install these with all the eur 70 fees they have been stashing away this summer. i paid for a flight from madrid to beauvais. my apartment in madrid did not have internet access so i could not access their website nor print the boarding pass. i did not think this was a major problem since all airlines have entry stations to get answers to problems and obtain boarding passes. ryanair charged me 168 and made me go through two very long lines. this was in addition to the cost of the flight. and the cost of a glass of water was 3 euros customer service was miserable long lines no information just shut up and move along. avoid this airline dubbristol uk. even though we preselected seats and paid those extra fees i couldnt get the checkin process to work online. we arrive at the airport and promptly are charged 420 euro 6 ppl to have them check us in  the original trip only cost 380 euro the front desk person told me i had 30 days to checkin and that the reason the flights are cheap is because of the online checkin. so let me get this straight 6 pieces of paper that wouldnt even cover a lettersized piece of paper and the 5 minutes of their time is 420 euros  about the weekly pay of these folks unbelievable. this airline continues to show it has no interest in customer service or staff training. only bottom line. after arriving at stansted 3 hours before the flight was due to depart we arrived at the boarding gate during final flight call. why because of the throng of people ryanair euphemistically call a queue attempting to check in their bags at their bagdrops manned by the ryanair gestapo. it appears these rude unhelpful staffs main training was on extracting extra cash wherever it is physically possible. to watch so many people removing items from hold bags only to add them to their cabin luggage is farcical. or would be if it wasnt so sad. in my own case my bag was 5kg under and my travelling partners was nearly 1kg over. no problem you would think there is still a net difference of 4kg. but no as the tickets werent booked on the same reference number we were deemed to be travelling separately. even though we had booked seat numbers next to each other and paid the extra we were still flying separately according to the misery behind the counter. ok so its no real effort to undo her bag remove a few bits and put them into the bag you are going to take into the cabin with you. but multiply that with the amount of people doing the same and you soon end up with massive queues. and both bags are going onto the plane anyway fortunately flying back was with easyjet who managed the same procedure in less than 15 minutes. i know who i will always use in the future. this flight is ok. the new ryanair is the same quality as easyjet or norwegian. there are improvements which made the journey fine and we will fly the airline again. we got to new stansted airport and the experience was ok. boarding opened 1 hour before and began 40mins before. the plane departed on time and smoothly. there are no advertisements on the overhead bins and there where no scratch cards. an ok trolley came with food for sale. ok priced. better than the airport. we landed 15mins early and no fanfare it was a shock but fine so you dont wake up suddenly. it was a good trip with an improved service. travelled 170814 stnlrh 07.30. la rochelle to dublin. i was not expecting much and got less. first ticket was no bargain only flew ryan because us friends had already booked return to france. priority seating is a complete waste of money. by the time your in the last cattle call line its ignored and not enforced. seats do not recline there are ads on the overhead bins and seat backs. hard working crew but constantly selling everything from food perfume lottery tickets to charities total chaos. i am not a picky passenger flew 30 years nonrevenue expecting little on no service. for the stress it would not be worth flying ryanair again if the seat was free. we have flown ryanair many times without problems. if you know what to expect then you wont get disappointed. however upon arriving at east midlands airport for our flight to tenerife south recently with plenty of time to spare we found that there were 12 flights departing at roughly the same time. 12 flights of people that needed to check in and clear security before boarding. it seems that ryanair just bung everyone together regardless of which flight you are on some people were panicking as their flight was taking off soon and were stuck at check in when asked to jump the queue were told they would have to wait like everyone else it took us 2 hours to get through check in and clear security. queues were snaked round the airport although admittedly this is not ryanairs fault but a better system needs put in place for ryanair check in. we managed to get to the boarding gates just in time albeit at the end of the queue. there we were kept waiting for 20 minutes as staff now needed hand luggage to put on the hold. the staff member was very aggressive and rude to us trying to grab our bags to put in the hold we told her that we needed the bags for inflight and one contained valuables that we wanted to keep with us. she tried to snatch my husbands backpack from his back and took my daughters small suitcase from her before i took it back. we eventually offered one bag but i had to remove everything that was needed and carry it in my hands she wouldnt even give us a carrier bag. she went up and down the last remaining passengers trying to grab peoples hand luggage but as nobody else would offer a bag she came back to us telling us she needed our bags we refused but she wasnt having any of it and barked at us we didnt have a choice as we were at the end of the queue and if we didnt put our hand luggage in the hold we would be fined 60. her attitude was appalling and if shed have asked politely we may have tried our best to accommodate her request. she wouldnt let the last people through the departure gate thus holding up the flight until she had the bags but no way were we giving up our remaining small bags. we eventually got on the bus to the plane and on the flight there we sat for another 20 minutes before actually taking off it was never made clear that only the first 60 passengers were guaranteed to take their hand luggage. yet on our return flight home everything was smooth queues moved quickly and staff were very pleasant helpful and polite. we packed our bags accordingly and offered our hand luggage for the hold. we fly ryanair because it is cheap but cheap doesnt mean but i expect to be spoken to like dirt from someones shoe i use ryanair regularly flying from dublin to the netherlands. you get what you pay for. fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. the staff arent particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. this often leads to a push when getting off. to avoid this i remain seated until people have started getting off. because of the short turn around time it isnt unusual to find some elses rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so its caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly ryanair. flew out of stansted to tenerife on 10th aug. got to stansted early hours of sun morning to be met by a horrendous queue of 8 or 9 different flight destinations being queued at the same 3 desks. after being in the queue for roughly 30 mins a staff member called 5 flights to a separate desk to check in we did this which seemed to take an age. finally we got our baggage in and we get to the gate and board the plane and were met by another massive queue through security. ran towards the gate had to get on a train to the gate. when we finally got to the gate the flight had gone 10 very bemused passengers had also missed the flight. we all got directed to customer services. we were taken to the wrong desk and queued for 30 mins then got taken to the right desk. another huge queue. when we got to the front the staff just said next flight is tuesday at a cost of 440. no explanation of why the flight had left early and left so many people behind. this was a horrible experience and not the start to a holiday anybody should have to go through. just got back from tenerife. what a horrible flight no coffee no hot chocolate only half the selection of hot food  no sandwiches. to top it off ryanair ran out of toilet roll. but they had plenty of fags and booze and not forgetting the scratch cards. never again. to be honest it shouldnt be called a budget airline either not at the price i paid. la rochelle to dublin. i was not expecting much and got less. first ticket was no bargain only flew ryan because us friends had already booked return to france. priority seating is a complete waste of money. by the time your in the last cattle call line its ignored and not enforced. seats do not recline there are ads on the overhead bins and seat backs. hard working crew but constantly selling everything from food perfume lottery tickets to charities total chaos. i am not a picky passenger flew 30 years nonrevenue expecting little on no service. for the stress it would not be worth flying ryanair again if the seat was free. ryanair put up the wrong gate no for approx 5 minutes or so and about 10 of us who were early went to that gate only to be told it was the wrong gate we had trouble getting back and had to wait 20 mins to be escorted back. by the time we walked to the other end of the airport we had missed the flight by about 1 minute we all had to pay for extra tickets at approx 140 for the two of us. staff were rude and very unhelpful admitted the wrong gate number had been put up. fr5579 21 july returned 28 july on fr5578. my family and i travelled to benidorm for 7 days. our travel with ryanair was less than perfect. on the flight over i ordered a small bottle of prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. she did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. i had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. thankfully it was white wine. on our return flight i badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the copilot and finally i had to stand up. i was told from the toilet to sit down i was again told to sit as the copilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. i again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated i use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. i was in row 9. as i approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat i had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on i tried to explain and eventually stressed i had to use the toilet now. then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which i did. the was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board i do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes. i will avoid using this airline again if at all possible i am extremely disappointed. travelled 24814 fr8747. the return to stansted on ryanair from la rochelle was ok. the experience at la rochelle was ok and the inbound flight arrived 15 mins early. boarding began at 10 for our 10.30 flight. the doors where shut at 10.30 and the safety demonstration was played in english and then french. we were off around 10.35 just 5 mins behind schedule. the inflight service began with drinks and snacks. i had a pepsi which was in a small can. then the duty free service before rubbish during our decent over london. we landed just before 10.45 10 mins early. yet again no fanfare but a little announcement about there low fares and the fact they have a 90 punctuality record. overall they just get you there on time which is really all that travel is so i would recommend them if you are on a budget or stansted is your local airport. i would never fly with them again. we were left on a plane in the heat of the italian summer with no air con on whilst they fixed a technical issue. we were left for 3.5 hours and were refused a glass of water. in the end my cousin had to argue with the staff to be allowed off the plane and she went and bought bottles water for all the passengers out of her own money. no apology has ever been given my journey from stansted to ibiza was ruined by drunken stag party members whose behaviour was completely disregarded by the air crew. it was evident from the beginning when the crew did a halfhearted safety demonstration that noone had authority to run this flight. passengers became increasingly distressed as the stag party shouted and swore aggressively ran up and down the aisles and openly drank from bottles of vodka while standing behind ryanair staff. the crew evidently avoided eye contact no public announcements were made to warn them of the consequences and when i complained that the situation wasnt being managed staff simply ignored me. although they did drag their feet bringing the trolley down the aisle they eventually served these men even more alcohol. this was a potentially very dangerous situation. on landing all of the men aside from one who was incoherent and staggering behaved perfectly properly as they exited through security to avoid arrest which suggests that they would have responded to warnings about their conduct during the flight. i travelled with ryanair for the first time 25814 to gran canaria. the flight 4 hours was very unorganised by the flight team. the air host and hostess sat at the front of the plane as was i for extra leg room spent half of their time looking in the mirror in the bathroom playing with their hair and touching up lipstick. the staff at the back of the plane frequently came to the front as they were having some kind of disagreement and arguing over some gossip from another flight attendant that was not present during our flight. it was a he said she said thing that involved all of them. my partner and i were not able to get seats together when i booked for extra leg room for us both so we had aisle seats however the 2 seats in front of my partner were empty and it would have been nice for attendants to have offered us the seats so as we could sit together. i have to say our flight home was much better and the flight attendants were friendly helpful and professional throughout. our flight on the 25th august 8132 at 14.10 was appalling. i fly ryanair frequently its the only airline that goes to riga from dublin. i also have flown with them to other destinations  sometimes they have been ok sometimes not so much. i flew with them on saturday 69 and i was shocked by the level of service i received. im not expecting 5 star service but at least some sort of service. only good thing was that we landed before time this was because the crew didnt clean the plane in riga when it landed from dublin. it was filthy rubbish everywhere. the flight crew were so rude would not communicate with passengers when you bought food from the trolley they did not even say how much it was. i was seated at 33 the last row before the toilets and the cabin crew area two of the flight crew where standing there talking about the passengers. flew to gran canaria and had a perfect flight  lovely british cabin crew nothing too much trouble on route home we arrived at las palmas airport to a queue as long as a football stadium of people. so we did as is british do and joined the queue they then waited ten minutes to open a second check in desk they then shouted people forward. the weigh scales where broke and so the queue grew and grew eventually after thirty minutes of entertaining a four year old we were up. we checked in and struggled with the ladies english which was broken at best but none the less she was polite. we then waited until our gate number was up and boarded the plane. right from the start it was just one of those flights a family had checked in late so all ended up sat individually much to the fathers disgust as a result he allowed his two year old to scream the entire flight we then tried to order food when the cart came this was a particular joke they had nothing. this was thirty minutes in we then very foolishly asked for water imagine the cheek to find the very abrupt cabin crew member to say none left so i again foolishly said what do you have heineken at this point i will admit i was very cross i wanted a drink for my four year old son and she suggested beer. i then explained it was for my son and obviously beer wasnt an option  she then told me not my problem. needless to say four hours later my four year old was furious as he was dehydrated and hungry. 22 and 29 august. flew from dublin to faro return service onboard was terrible. you couldnt even understand the captains announcement because he seemed grumpy and the cabin crew were exactly the same. they didnt even have an inflight menu or magazine. cabin crew didnt even have a smile on their face. have flown on holidays and business for the last 40 years. sometimes a flight can be below standard which usually results in muttering disapproval however my wife and i flew from manchester to majorca last week and we were absolutely appalled by both the service but moreover the behaviour of the majority of the other passengers. they consisted mostly of stag groups and hen party groups who prior to boarding had sampled the wares of the departure lounge bars i suspect for several hours the screaming and shouting and rolling around the centre aisle was a vision to behold. eventually the captain put the fasten seat belt signs on permanently. i think rather than use ryanair again id rather cancel my trip if there was no other option. flew in july with my 3 kids to tenerife first and last time though we checked in 2 cases between 5 people and they charged me an extra 60 staff were rude and unhelpful. seats on the plane were uncomfortable and the plane was dirty. only half the food available to purchase on board. the flight back was even worse late dirty again and we were sent to wrong boarding gate  they decided to change it to other end of airport if youre planning to fly with ryanair  dont only one word to explain it sham after been delayed 48 hours. our flight should have been leaving at 11pm sunday we was still in the airport at 4.00 am until they decided to take us to a hotel we were then told there was no flight until tuesday evening to arrive at east midlands and not from manchester where we had flown from. we had very little money left myself my partner and my 7 year old daughter had to share a meal at the hotel as we could not afford anything else. when we got to the airport tuesday evening we was told that the pre booked seats we had paid for was no longer ours we was treated like cattle with no apology whatsoever. never again will i use ryanair. i have used ryanair for years now sometimes 5 times per year in general and all is good. i booked a flight for my daughter and 2 year old granddaughter. when she left shannon all was well until her return flight home from tenerife. 6.30 am she checked in for the free allocation of seats they were allocated separate seats opposite side aisles. my daughter went early to the departures queue and boarded one of the first after priority boarding and explained to one of the crew they told her to take her seats and they would try to change her once they were in the air. i find this quite incredible for a flight to take off with a 2 year old baby sat on her own. surely the crew have the option to change a free allocated seat but what amazes me more was ryanair had all details as you have to register a child separately when booking. why if they want more money for a flight just put the price out in the first instance. travelled on 100914  having booked airport wheelchair and assistance for boarding to gate and vice versa for departure and both return flight. to my dismay no wheelchair had been arranged at the dusseldorf weeze airport. bus driver unlocked padlock of chained up wheelchairs. stewards failed to inform arrival airport of my prebooked requirements. staff should also insure that passenger take their allocated seats  had a lady whose body posture was extremely intimidating and hostile because she could not get out fast enough caused by her sitting in the wrong seat. flying back same problem again  staff did not inform stansted airport of my prebooked requirements. was stranded for more than 15 minutes outside the aircraft on the tarmac before porter with wheelchair turned up. i shant forget the blank expression on the faces of the aircrew staff either which made me feel very uncomfortable im sure it can be improved with more staff training and please slow down the food and drink trolleys as no one gets a chance to buy anything at this speed and it might cause an accident. i fly all over the world and even use low cost regional airlines in the states but this takes the cake. checked in online but couldnt print boarding pass. no notes online that there are huge fees to print at airport. there was no clear check in sign in edinburgh but thankfully also no queue and 3 staff standing around chatting. when they finally decided to talk to us and tell us of the 20 pound check in fee they said they couldnt help us and we had to use the check in machine well across the way. the check in unit wouldnt process us and told us to see agent. the agent couldnt take our money and sent us all the way round to baggage to pay for boarding passes but then we had to take receipt back to first woman to get actual boarding card and drop prepaid bag our hand luggage was grabbed at the gate and we were made to pay 50 even though it was within weight. flight was delayed an hour originally but left 2 hours late to dublin. flight should have been an hour but with delays took over 3 hours. stay away from this airline i have always praised ryanair as good value when considering the cost however they really let themselves down on 29th sept. arrived at stansted near midnight and could not even see terminal from where plane stopped. then had to wait nearly 30 mins as staff had not thought to arrange transport even the pilot was fed up with their lack of organisational skills. sorry ryanair very disappointed. flight number fr694 on the 6th of september from prestwick uk to ibiza spain. the majority of passengers onboard this drink fuelled flight were unruly drunken and aggressive towards other passengers despite the best efforts of the 4 onboard cabin crew. language throughout was absolutely foul. as a grandmother travelling with 2 young infants under the age of four the condition experienced in the cabin were shocking. passengers were swearing were drinking open duty free were throwing objects from in front and behind us. safety announcements could not be heard as passengers were playing music from bluetooth devices and the cabin was totally out of control. cabin crew were very concerned however despite the best efforts to contain behaviour there was no way they could control the passengers. the crew threatened to divert the aircraft to france and also threatened the majority of passengers with the police meeting them on arrival at the destination. the main point is that safety notices were completely ignored myself and my family felt totally unsafe during the flight. my granddaughters aged two and three have never been exposed to such outrageous language and behaviour  the conditions on this flight were not safe and were not suitable for a family. access to toilets involved standing for 40 minutes in crowds of alcohol fuelled louts. many of the passengers boarded the flight inebriated one group drank a litre bottle of duty free vodka onboard the flight whilst throwing coins around the cabin. we are feeling extremely anxious about our return journey. when travelling from palma to stansted i had a broken foot and was on crutches. myself and an elderly lady with hip problems had booked assistance which didnt materialise. last on the plane we were told that a the booking hadnt been made even though we produced our booking papers and b there were no wheelchairs available and we had to make it to the terminal under our own steam. as the next set of passengers were queuing at the foot of the steps we felt compelled to get off. no staff took responsibility for us once we were on the tarmac. luckily a stansted airport employee was passing by the window and saw me struggling down the steps on crutches and rushed to our aid. she was horrified that we had been abandoned and quickly obtained wheelchairs for us both. herself and a colleague took us all the way to the outside. no credit at all to ryanair whos main objective was to get us off the plane so that the next flight could get under way. i travelled from frankfurt hhn to stansted stn. the flight was as good as any cheap airline. cant say much about seat comfort or staff as you really dont expect that from them. really new to the concept of bringing your own boarding pass from home and being charged if you dont. im pretty sure there will come a time when these airlines would want you to bring your own seatbelts and oxygen masks. the ground staff very strict for checking your baggage weight. first at the checkin then again after the security check which was an inconvenience and didnt really make sense. overall it serves its purpose of getting you from point a to b. i booked a ticket from venice to brussels. first time at these cities. first time traveling with ryanair. 70 euro charge for no online checkin is abusive. this killed any savings from traveling with them. in addition both airports are quite remote from the respective target cites. add 1 hour bus for getting to the airport and out of the air port for each city. this is awful. would rather much fly with regular airline than them. first and last experience with this airline. outward flight from leeds bradford to chania was ok and if it had been the same on the return flight then we would have flown with them again. check in at chania was an absolute shambles made worse by the fact id bought a bouzouki in crete and was unaware of ryanairs attitude to musical instruments. at the check in i was obliged to pay 60 euro and had to have it placed in the hold. i accept the fact that a musical instrument can be a bit of a hazard on a plane but it would have easily have fitted in the overhead locker. none of the cabin crew on the return flight had english as a first language and were unable to offer me concise instruction on how i was to claim the instrument at leeds bradford. the menus were in euros yet the cabin crew asked for payment in sterling with the inevitable delay whilst currency conversions were carried out. this slowed the catering service down so much that it wasnt worth bothering with. we paid extra for priority boarding although this does not seem to offer any priority at checkin and is a complete waste of time at chania as staff try and make as much bonus as they can by finding oversize and overweight hand luggage. we were ignored by ground staff when we tried to use the priority lane. its a case of first come first served until one of the check in staff decides to stem the flow and call the priority passengers forward. we also paid a premium for extra legroom in row 16. the extra legroom was appreciated but the seats are very narrow with fixed armrests and were not very comfortable at all. also the cabin crew are ruthless about loose items in that seat row and my wife was made to wear a cardigan she had on her lap until the aircraft had taken off. no doubt there will be many who are obliged to use this carrier to visit family or their holiday homes abroad and they will have obviously conditioned themselves to flying with ryanair but i can assure you that so long as there is a choice we will not be repeating the experience. 3110 fr293 from stansted to dublin 19.40. left it late to advise gate 88 instead of 49  loads of panting passengers. also they have a very relaxed attitude towards schedule and timekeeping. sat for ages awaiting confirmation of passengers etc prior to takeoff. ryanair customer service appalling as staff members more interested in selling priority seats than helping people who had missed flights due to traffic problems. oddly we sat there waiting for one passenger  how does that work i am now looking to avoid stansted as its like a third world airport. london stansted to frankfurt hahn on nov 8th return nov 11th. this is by far the worst airline i have flown and i am 59 years old and have travelled all over the world in many different airlines. the customer service can not be worse respect for the customer after you have paid is horrible. they are charging 70 british pounds for printing your boarding pass or sitting you in a crowded airplane with uncomfortable seats with crew members that are air merchants who charge you extra money for even a glass of water. also after you have paid for your ticket or are in the process of paying they come out with a series of addons that when you end paying this nightmare of flights from third class airports like london stansted or frankfurt hahn end up costing you the same or more than flying with a prestigious airline like british airlines or lufthansa from a premium airport. ediagp. awful experience rude cabin crew no onboard snacks free or to purchase ryanair are desperate to find fault or earn extra money. unless you want the person infront of you basically sitting on your knee then try easyjet or ba. rome to london stansted 31 dec 2014 cabin crew never greeted or smiled as we boarded plane  looked very fed up and engaged in no personal chat during the flight. very uninterested and worked more like zombies going through the motions. flight was good and would travel with them again. i paid 136 return  it might be cheaper than other airlines but surely the staff represent the airline and what did this service say about ryanair tallinn to milan first and last time flying with ryanair. ryanair is by far the worst airline i have experienced in terms of customer service fees and travel experience. this was our first time flying with ryanair and after booking our flight we were traveling often without internet service when we got to the airport to checkin 2 hours before our flight we were informed that there would be a 70euro feeperson we had no email from ryanair about the need to checkin online 2 hours before departure. the online checkin cutoff time is arbitrary as it serves no purpose other than a deliberate tactic by ryanair to extort additional funds from paying customers who at that point have no alternative but to pay and board the flight. we then were forced to wait in a crowded gate area and our flight departure was delayed by over an hour. during our time at the gate several ryanair customer service agents made their way through the crowd demanding that some passengers must check their carryon luggage. almost every passenger with more than one carryon item was ordered to leave their additional carryon at the ground by the plane to load in to the hold. after making our way across the runway in freezing rain and snow we slowly made our way up the outdoor stairs to the plane only to be met with a surly male steward who was talking with a staff member instead of greeting passengers. all of the staff were rude and only spoke to passengers to ask to purchase items. every item including water was provided only for a fee. we arrived in milan only to be told that we had to sit on the plane to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal. one bus came and filled with passengers. we were in the back of the plane so we had to wait another long period for another bus. bottom line  this was the worst travel experience in my 30 years of global travel. yes the airline industry has changed significantly to cut costs and keep fares reasonable but there is no need to intentionally make customers feel worthless. i will gladly pay more for a flight to not be extorted for additional monies and to have a smile and a friendly hello delivered by the airline staff. my wife and i live in spain and had booked a flight from malaga to stansted and a return flight from stansted to malaga some five weeks later. the night before our flight out of malaga i duly went online to the ryanair website to do the online check in. i filled in the flight details and submitted it then there was on option to print the boarding pass however i didnt have a printer my apartment so i assumed that since i had submitted the details all would be fine. this was not the case however. on arrival at malaga airport the next day we went to the ryanair check in point that was at least 100 metres away from any other check in desk probably so that other passengers could not hear any passenger complaints we were asked for our boarding passes. i said that he had checked in online but had no way of printing the boarding pass. the ryanair representative said that her computer was not showing that the online check in had been done. although i insisted that i had submitted the check in form online there was no way that i could prove it. the ryanair online check in requires that the submit button is clicked on numerous times as it wants to sell extra luggage allowance hotels car hire and selected seats. if the submit button is not clicked on bypassing each of these selection options then the online check in does not go through. the ryanair representative said that we would have to pay 70 euros each for not submitting the online check in and for printing the boarding passes but as an alternative we were then told to take our laptop to the ryanair information desk where they could have 15 minutes of free use of the wifi to find the details. the wifi was password protected however and the ryanair staff member was not exactly showing any signs of wanting to help. i am of the opinion that it was extremely difficult if not impossible for a passenger to be able to retrieve the data. with time to board fast approaching we had no option but to pay 70 euros each a ripoff total of 140 euros to print two boarding passes. no wonder that several review sites describe ryanair as the worlds most hated airline. on a flight back to the uk from dublin last night 26th january we were surprised and pleased to hear that we would arrive back 20 mins ahead of time. on arrival at gatwick the stairs were moved to the door ready for us to disembark but there seemed to be a problem and the cabin crew did not open the door. we sat there and waited and waited but not once did any member of the cabin crew explain to us why we were still sitting there. eventually after some considerable time we used our own initiative and used the exit at the back of the plane. at no time did the ryanair staff say anything so much for health and safety. seats were cramped and uncomfortable but as i am only 5ft 4ins not too bad for me but must be horrid if you are tall with long legs. will try not to use again. east midlands to malaga if you follow the rules you get a cheap flight but at what cost. the seat is poor even for budget airlines with the leg room the worst i have known in 30 years flying. then there is the width. yes i am a big chap but i have never had to ask for an extender belt it went no where near. dignity lost but cheap fares and safe arrival. without doubt the worst airline that i have flown with. we had to check in at the airport and although my wifes check in went through in time mine missed by a couple of seconds and for this we were charged 70 euros each. my wife was allocated a seat in the second row and i was allocated a seat in the very last row even though there were plenty of seats vacant together elsewhere in the plane. there was no organisation with regards to queues re both checking in and boarding the plane. when we landed we had to wait for ages to disembark as the ground staff forgot to bring the steps out for the front of the plane and then when went through customs we were asked for our landing passes which we did not have as they were not given out by staff as they were supposed to be. the seats were the most uncomfortable that i have sat on and the staff were not very friendly at all. you are better off paying extra and flying with someone else we will never fly with them again. today i had the displeasure of flying with these bunch of amateurs. it is 13th january today and it was very snowy and cold at knock. ryanair staff as usual left us all standing in the snow outside the terminal building for ten minutes. it was bitterly cold and those of you who dont know knock it is very open to the elements. it was freezing. we eventually boarded and we sat for 1 hour 50 minutes whilst waiting for an explanation as to why we were sitting waiting to depart. we were told that knock airport staff were clearing the running when out of the sky arrives an inbound flight. neither the cabin crew or the flight deck crew told us anything other than there was going to be a ten minute delay. just not good enough especially as during the delay the cabin crew were to the front of the plane talking and joking rather than looking after their passengers. after spending christmas with my family in uberlingen germany my husband and i struggled back to memmingen airport for the ryanair flight back to stansted on 27th december in freezing blizzard conditions and it was no surprise to us or other people waiting for the 14.40 stansted flight that we were advised there was at least an hours delay in the arrival of the ryanair flight out of stansted. eventually it arrived and we were called to await boarding. we were then told to cross the tarmac to the plane for boarding. however when we reached the plane we were not allowed to board. there was a barrier over both entrances to the plane. the whole planeload of passengers were kept outside on the tarmac in windy freezing conditions for about 15 minutes. there were babes in arms tiny children and elderly people standing outside a plane we had been given permission to board in freezing conditions. people in the queues were shouting to be allowed to board to no avail. when i returned home i wrote to ryanair requesting an explanation as to why passengers were called to board before the plane was ready when the plane was parked just outside the airport buildings and also asking that the explanation be passed on to all adult passengers aboard that flight. i thought that would be the very least they could do. ryanair sent an acknowledgement of my letter saying they were looking into the matter and i have not heard from ryanair since. as a noneu passenger who lives in london uk i have to fill out a landing card whenever i am coming home. with any other airline landing cards are offered to persons like myself during the flight. this saves time filling it out later at customs. however they are never offered on ryanair. on a recent flight home from gdansk i decided to ask the crew for a card since i figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. the crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in arabic half in french which appeared to be for passengers arriving in morocco. it was completely different to the standard form. later in the flight i spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. she giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it just in case. i pointed out that she was not making any sense. how hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight if this is for some reason not possible then perhaps the staff need better training in terms of what to do if a passenger request one. perhaps they could simply tell the passenger sorry we do not carry those onboard. the whole episode was just silly. after a speedy boarding as youd expect from a budget airline we went onto the plane. inside was an eyesore. bright yellow everywhere and everything was cheap and plasticy. bright horrible advert were everywhere  even seat backs  and you had to pay for a newspaper. the food was expensive and the service below average. the seats were cheap and flimsy and uncomfortable. you werent allowed to get stuff out of the overhead lockers for some reason. even though our flight was just over an hour it was awful and i will never fly with ryanair again. yes they are a budget airline but the only reason youd fly with them is if you were skint. ryanair is the only airline that flies from bournemouth direct to malta so great so far as very local. however the purchasing of tickets is laborious and time consuming. the cost of the flights easily double should you reserve a seat standard elsewhere or want to stow luggage in the hold standard elsewhere. the cabin crew were unbelievably poor and one even had a broken shoe ripped trousers unironed shirt and jacket and tie that was thrown on. looked like he had been pulled through a hedge backwards  never seen anything like it. about to start the onerous process again for this years holiday as flying locally is great but oh why dont they just try to raise their standards they should be ashamed of their business as it stands. flew from aarhus denmark to london stansted on sunday 15th february. flight punctual but flight crew unfriendly and had an issue with a child occupying one of the emergency exit seats but whos fault is that when all seats are allocated prior to boarding never once did i see a smile from the two female crew and seemed to see passengers as a necessary evil of their daily job but the male steward was more approachable but he had a ticking off about something with the inflight catering by a more senior stewardess in earshot of myself which was most unprofessional. if you just want a flight then great but if you expect to be treated as a valued customer steer clear. the boarding process seemed entirely disorganised and very little information given regarding the flights delay. when in receipt of information impossible to hear what was being said as engine noise was too loud and flight attendant too quiet with a slight language barrier. i wouldnt have known if there was any sort of emergency or if things were running smoothly which leads me on to the abrupt attitudes from all flight attendants not only this but please ask them to smile once in a while they are after all working in customer service. flew from luton to malta april 1st. plane late arriving but we were kept on the apron in the cold for the best part of an hour. no apology or explanation. we then missed our slot so another hour delay. to add to our misery plane had 20 or so ravers who were in a loud and lively mood. stuff being thrown around no chance of any peace and quiet. cabin crew did speak to the main perpetrators with little effect. these selfish idiots should not have been allowed on the plane as they were the worse for drink. never had a flight like it. i fly with either ryanair or monarch at least once a month. ryanair check in make me feel like a second class citizen as i often need a wheelchair. i have been made to stand away from my husband whilst they check my medication bag. i offered to bin it but they argued that my letter states that i need the injections. i now go without it if i fly ryanair much to my consultants dismay. the last time the wheelchair assistance helper even had to speak to the check in desk as they were so rude to me. its cheap so i put up with it but that is all they have that makes me use them each month. flying from faro to glasgow prestwick. i have flown with ryanair before on short flights from glasgow to dublin which were fine although had us standing outside in the freezing cold waiting to board for 20 minutes. faro to glasgow was a 3 hour flight and i am 6 months pregnant. i had to drag my suitcase up the stairs to board the plane and stand waiting there for a good 10 minutes until other passengers had taken their seats. when we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. my husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. during this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didnt have enough to go round. it was a lunchtime flight and i was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if i could buy a panini. i was told they had ran out again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats. no alternative was offered. the staff looked tired and fed up. also there was a hen do on board with one idiot randomly shouting at the top of her voice. i didnt see any cabin crew addressing this. i would only fly ryanair for very short flights if desperate. will avoid in future and would certainly not recommend when over 3 months pregnant appalling. i was due to fly back from ireland with my husband and two kids when my daughter contracted chickenpox. i contacted the airline four days before the flight and explained that my husband and daughter would not be travelling with us but that my mother had purchased another ticket and would be sitting in my husbands seat i didnt think this was necessary as we had paid the additional fee to sit in the seats that we chose but wanted to make sure my mothers journey was stress free. it was confirmed that this would be fine. when we got to the airport we made sure it was still ok as my mother has limited mobility and finds air travel extremely difficult. they confirmed again that they had kept the seat we had paid for. when we got to the gate my mother had paid for priority boarding but a stuff up by the staff there meant we were left waiting to get onto the plane until after they had removed one of the sets of stairs. when we finally got onto the plane we found a lady sitting in our seat with a ticket for the very seat we had paid for. not only did ryanair representatives lie directly on a number of times to me they had sold the seat within 30 minutes of our first contacting them regarding the flight issue. my mother had to walk the entire length of the plane because the air hostess would not let her sit where she was supposed to sit. i will do everything in my power not to use ryanair again. fr 3002 17th april. fr 3015 20th april. i have travelled with ryanair for years now and in recent times the customer service and service in general has become increasingly poor. i travelled recently to rome and this was a very poor experience  the flights were late the customer service was very poor and the cabins filthy. the yellow tagging farce is actually funny to watch  the policy as i was rudely told is the first 90 bags however it was totally random with customers with large trolley bags walking through and then other customers behind them being tagged there is no correct monitoring system for this whatsoever so you are at the mercy of the poorly trained staff on the gate. you then get onto the flight to find several spaces in the overhead lockers and several empty seats quite frankly i am fed up with the continual poor service so i have now booked with aer lingus for my next trip to dublin. i am also at the stage where i will actually pay a higher fare in order to have a relaxed experience with well trained staff who smile instead or a rude and grumpy scripted person who cannot answer anything outside of that script. flight out on the 29415 was ok flight back not so good 3515. no food left only chocolate snacks and crisps staff seemed as if they didnt know what they was doing slow and no organisation started from the front of the plane and we was at the back row 33. so not much left anyway but no sandwiches at the front of the plane as was sold out on the flight out. very cramped. paid for seats going out and to put a case in the hold 60 return what a rip off. but refused to pay for seats to come back. will not travel with them again if i can help it. i recently flew to dublin with air lingus but had to return with ryanair. having arrived late on the friday night i was up again early next day to work and meetings in the city and was lucky enough to catch the bath v leinster cup game in the afternoon. however that left little time to make it to the airport for the return flight which i did. on arrival i was chastised for not having printed off a boarding pass. how i was expected to do that heavens only knows but that fell on deaf ears and i had to pay up 70 euros extra to get on board. the dismissive attitude i encountered was galling and not what i would expect from an airline. i had heard many horror stories of how this company manage to find more ways than others to get you to part with your money for the slightest reason. that said i wont make the same mistake twice because i wont be using them again flight 8386 and flight 8387 april 11th and 18th. first booking had filthy seats second booking  return from palma. because my suitcase was 2kg over i was charged 20 euros even though we had only one piece of luggage between 2 people. no food on flight as such  1 sandwich also did not get the time to look at mag for inflight purchases. i have been a passenger with numerous airlines since 1957 and in recent years frequently from alicante to several different british airports. ryanair is one of the worst ive ever travelled with and definitely the worst on this route. on the outward alicanteeast midlands airport journey we sat on the runway for almost an hour because they had missed their slot. this made for a long and tedious journey. this however was nowhere near as bad as the return flight. we left plenty of time to return the hire car and arrive at the airport in time to have a leisurely lunch as we always do at gatwick as we knew that it would be late when we arrived home only to discover that we could not enter the departure lounge until 2 hours before our flight was due to leave. this would have been okay if there had been somewhere for two elderly passengers to sit all chairs were taken and we were left standing with all our luggage or somewhere to have a decent meal there is one very unappetising place with food served in cardboard. also two hours would have been sufficient time if it hadnt taken more than an hour to wind our way through the queue to the check in desk. when we arrived at the desk we were told that our case was too heavy 1kg overweight most airlines will waive this fractional overweight but the representative told us that we had only paid for 15kg and would have to put the excess in our hand baggage. this we did in full view of the other passengers and consisted of 2 teeshirts and a pair of light shoes. whilst we were waiting to board the aircraft the attendant asked us if we would like to put our hand baggage in the hold free of charge my logic and fairly basic grasp of maths cannot make sense of this i had been warned not to travel ryanair and i never will again. i am disabled and booked for assistance with ryanair at birmingham airport. on arrival i was told to queue and check in before i could be given a wheelchair. my husband had to push the chair when we finally got it. at the gate ryanair staff discussed who would not be able to take the flight as there were too many disabled. they talked about us as if we were bags of carrots. eventually i said i would try to climb the steps of the aircraft and was allowed onto the plane. at no time was i given any assistance. on arrival in malta i had to struggle to baggage and out of the airport as no assistance was available. you need to be fit and agile to use this airline. the treatment of people in wheelchairs was appalling and humiliating. fr 507 30th april. fr 506 7th may. it may be said that one gets what one pays for but by the time ryanair has ripped through you with thier suite of extra charges many of which are simply an unfair cash grab on their unsuspecting customers at the booking counter when there is no chance of taking another airline ryanair is not well priced. on a flight from dublin to bristol we were encouraged to use ryanairs smartphone app or print out out a boarding pass to avoid an extra charge to have it printed at the booking counter. unfortunately the app didnt work so on arriving at dublin we were directed to the misnamed customer service counter to be helped by the most unhelpful unpleasant rude eye rolling young woman i have ever had the misfortune to encounter in many years of air travel with many airlines all over the world. when i explained the problem she tried to tell me that if the app didnt work i had plenty of time in ireland to hunt down an internet cafe or similar with access to a printer to print out my boarding pass and that she should now charge me for printing them out at the airport. i was then charged for an extra 3kg of baggage even though the two of us had no carry on baggage. the plane was dirty tired and run down and the cabin staff non professional. the seats are small and cramped. in summary terrible service from rude staff will strip you of cash any chance they get tired dirty aircraft poor inflight service. do yourself a favour and give ryanair a big miss they are the worst i have flown by a large margin. ive been flying worldwide for more than 50 years with many different airlines. despite many online complaints about ryanair my experience with this airlines had been very good until my flight from malaga to venice treviso on may 6 fr 2597 when an incompetent female flight attendant and a very rude belligerent male maitre dcabin both malagabased changed my perception of the airline. the maitre d shouted and yelled and my son who expressed his concern regarding fresh air and cooler air temperature in the cabin. ryanair is a budget airline and im aware of that but budget does not mean poor maintenance and rude and unfriendly flight crew. as a very frequent airline passenger i must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day. ryanair cannot keep playing the silly game of were cheap so we can afford everything and if you dont like that go somewhere else. i guarantee you that we will. a return trip from dublin to malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you cant blame ryanair for that. as per my last flights on fr they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. they seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. there was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. the flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time i was at the gate before boarding over an hour but then even when you want to purchase something its a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. the flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. if i thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area i would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about allinall ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldnt be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective. i booked a fairly priced return ticket between dublin and edinburgh in may 2015. the experience was horrible. i think the checkin and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a european or uk passport. if you need to check in a bag or you require a visa its absolute chaos. there is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. this was the closest ive ever come to missing a flight. the price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag i checked in less than 20kg btw and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. this borders on criminal if you ask me. i will never ever fly with ryanair again and i will go out of my way to let people know how bad the service is. 16th april stansted to otopeni fr1005. i flew from stansted to bucharest. filthy seats cabin crew that gave the safety instruction only in english despite the fact that the flight was to bucharest behind me was a non english speakers couple which asked me to translate what the hostess said. very disappointing fr8524 stnsxf 9 may operated on behalf of ryanair by air explore using air explores own but similar 737 equipment. being a ryanair cheap flight cant expect much. but compared to normal ryanair planes the seats could recline. however no safety cards in each seat and few ryanair magazines all in tattered condition  not that i wanted to order any food or drink on this short flight of 2 hours. plane was not very clean  but few planes both budget or fullservice airlines are really clean nowadays. one flight attendant was particularly nasty i took a photo of the cabin and she happened to be in the photo she stormed straight to me and shouted at me to delete the photo immediately. terribly rude otherwise flight was uneventful departing and arriving on time. first and last time i fly with ryanair. flying from krakow to liverpool. flight was on time and arrived on time but on board was terrible. the cabin crew looked very inexperienced. one crew member was very rude on a couple of occasions and they just wanted to get the job done with no interference from passengers. we asked for a menu card to be told they are only given to the people at the front of the aircraft then when approached by the crew staff on what we would like to eat because we had to ask what was on offer were given the look of disgust flight fr9810 from london stansted to barcelona el prat t2 on monday 4th may 2015 scheduled to leave at 08.15 however due to barcelona being fog bound they had delayed all flights into barcelona apparently from many uk airports. we were firstly informed that a delay of 1.5 hours was estimated. after a while we were informed that another 1 hour had been added. so all passengers sat on the plane for 2.5 hours. our first complaint  sitting in a stationary hot metal tube for 2.5 hours is not my idea of enjoyment particularly when nobody was offered even the smallest drink of complimentary cold water in order to alleviate the discomfort. during the 2.5 hour delay there would have been time to have some water delivered. the irony in all of this is that shortly after takeoff the cabin crew came round selling drinks. our second complaint  flight fr9015 thursday 7th may  el prat to stansted. taking advantage of the 10kg on board baggage allowance  small bag we purchased a second carry on cabin bag size within stipulated regulation. on the outward journey not a problem. a different story on the return flight though. on entry to the plane i was told by a stewardess that is not a cabin bag i explained that we had no problems on the outward journey the cabin crew were quite happy. not being convinced she repeated the statement that is not a cabin bag i again repeated my statement and then went to take my seat and stow my cabin bag. little knowing that my wife was behind me she said again in a rather snide voice that is not a cabin bag not wanting to cause an argument my wife just reiterated the fact that it was acceptable on the outward journey. so in summation we have a rather dim view of ryanair. booking of future holidays will take into consideration who the airline carrier is and if it is ryanair we will attempt to make alternative arrangements. 2nd june flight from bergamo to east midlands. whilst in the queue to board a member of staff tagged my hand luggage and boarding pass with yellow  stickers. i was just over half way down the queue. all the people around me were being tagged so thought nothing of it. on boarding i moved to my seat half way along the plane. a member of\\r\\r\\nthe crew who was stood near to my seat told me my bag shouldve been left at the entrance and put in the hold. i had at no point before this been told to do so. the aisle was rammed with passengers but she still wanted me to take my bag off the plane. after much discussion i persuaded her to let me put my bag in the overhead where there was plenty of space and i would remove it if necessary. i sat and watched many more passengers board who had arrived much later than me no stickers on their bags as it happened there was plenty of space in the lockers so my bag stayed put. i had booked hand luggage only as i needed to be out of the airport quickly. my bag was not oversized and i was nowhere near the back of the queue for boarding. i am not happy that i was made to feel so uncomfortable in front of other passengers. glasgow to bydgoszcz on friday 5th june. well this was supposed to be the date at 4.30pm. this was then delayed an hour. so it gets to 5.30pm and off i go to board all good lets us board the plane. once everyone is on they then announce there is a technical issue and leave us on a hot plane for 1.5 hrs. they then tell us the flight is\\r\\r\\ncancelled and we need to disembark. arrange another flight for us at 8.45pm. so we are waiting around for hours with a 3.50 voucher provided for food and drink. anyone that knows airports knows that this would get you a bottle of water if your lucky so take 2 go to board for the 8.45pm flight get to the gate and even though the\\r\\r\\nplane is there they tell us we are not going and no explanation as to why. we then have to go and collect any luggage and when i ask if there is any news get rudely told to go stand over there finally they arrange to get us taxis to a local hotel. well 6 taxis for a whole flight took quite a lot of time. its midnight by the time i get there and the front desk tell us we need to be ready for 5am. so get to the airport for 5am the flight is then put back an hour. finally time to board and not a member of staff in sight they finally arrive at 8.30 and start to board us. once everyone is on board we then have to sit there to wait for paperwork and then another passenger. finally we leave after 9.30am but are then told there are no drinks or food on board. now these things happen when flying but it was the total lack of care or empathy from the staff and the lack of communication that was the absolute worst. i for one will never fly with ryanair again this was the first and last time  flew from warsaw modlin to london stansted. going back to warsaw tried to reach stansted by train operated by stansted express. they experienced some problems on that day 6th june and had delays of up to 120 mins. managed to get to stansted one hour before flight but stuck with security check finally missed the flight. in fact we\\r\\r\\nwere at the gate 10 minutes before planned start time. i was accompanied by a group of 10 people at the same situation. gate was already closed and ryanair clerk informed us that they cannot risk any delays for those who are late. so far so good best came at their so called customer service point where pleasant clerk advised me to take taxi and not to take train next time. thank you ryan for that piece of really valuable advise. next time i am not going to take ryanair in the first place. you ask about food and beverages they are excellent as long as you buy them at the airport and take with you on board. similar with inflight entertainment unless you treat selling some lottery tickets as entertaining activity the entertainment is going to be great onboard provided that you prepared something yourself for the trip. flew with ryanair for the first time from alicante to manchester. i had not printed off my boarding passes for the three of us. i was not able to do this where we were staying. they then wanted 45 euros from each off us to do this. i managed to get to a pc at the airport and do it myself. the queues for check in were like russian bread queues from the 1970s. when we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue without any notice closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours. it was appalling and could have escalated into something nasty all due to the bad customer service from ryanair. i also witnessed an elderly disabled passenger become very distressed when she learned she could not take her collapsible walking aid onto the plane even though shed been told in advance that she could. she became very distressed as she could not walk without it and was not offered a wheelchair. absolutely appalling treatment. i will never fly with them again terrible customer service. flying back from malta to bristol we had to check in 2 hrs before flight to print boarding passes. explained we were not able to get online. got to airport with time to spare asked for assistance maltese staff very helpful and they tried for 30 min to get online. when they finally got on to site to check us in we were 10 min late. we got to the ryanair desk where basically if we didnt pay 45 euros each we could not fly. hence we paid 90 euros to print two shabby bits of paper got to check in desk told we had to sit separately as there were no seats left as we checked in late still nearly 2 hrs before flight got onboard and my husband had 3 seats to himself and i was 2 rows in front. 90 euros because we were 10 min late through no fault of ours. not as good as other airlines but i guess you get what you pay for. you dont expect much from a flight with low prices. staff seem disinterested and lack enthusiasm for their job. inflight food is extortionate and not worth the money. beware that unless you are in the first half of passengers at the gate then you are unlikely to be able to take your cabin baggage onboard with you and will have to put it in the hold. experience was poor. we booked with ryanair after a long time of not using them after previous bad experiences but saw the new website and various other newly replaced items and services that ryanair use and bought tickets for return flights to tenerife. however easier the prepayment section of the booking experience and website may be we found that once you had played the airline used all sorts of dirty tricks such as making you pay for allocated seating if you wanted to make sure your party was sitting together and charging for all sorts of other service that would be expected to be provided freely. this made the flights no cheaper than the ones that other airlines offered. the cabin  despite pictures on the internet  looked gloomy old fashioned and dirty. onboard food as overpriced and service was slow. the cabin crew were constantly pushing you to buy products as they are partially payed on commission. also the main reason ryanair is usually on time is that unlike other airlines they add an additional 10 minutes onto the actual estimated flight time. shambles at check in even though we checked in online late boarding and then sat on the tarmac for almost 2 hours. the flight attendants were not even going to allow you to get off your seat or go to the toilet. very warm in the plane and virtually no info from attendants if possible will never fly with ryanair again. through stansted airport and ryanair we nearly missed our flight we had booked our seats and paid for priority boarding but we had a 2 lane traffic jam trying to get dropped off then baggage drop there were so many people we only managed to get through with 3 minutes to spare before closure then through security and 10 minute walk to departure gate. waste of money for priority boarding they had already gone we had arrived 2 hours before take off but obviously this is not enough. flight was good once we got on but a very stressful experience. ryanair mobile app is rubbish. even if you check in using the app it doesnt mean you have already checked in you need to check in on their website. their customer service is the worst ive ever seen. i purchased luggage the day before i depart using their app and when its time they said they did not receive the payment so i need to make direct payment in the airport. yet they charged me twice for using the app and direct payment.  ive been sending email and they do not even want to reply me.  bought their highly advertised biz ticket. complete disappointment. dumped in the last rows as promised seat was not given  waste of money. when we arrived 4 passengers and waited 40 minutes to check bags we were told that we only arranged for two bags and would have to pay for two bags. but because agent could not take payment we needed to go to customer service to pay. she filled out a form and told us to pay and return to front of line and they would held the plane. we still had over 1.5 hours. so we waited in line at customer service for almost an hour and was told that we owed them 20 for 2 kilos. i informed her that it was 2 bags not 2 kilos. so we were sent back to the baggage line to get the correct form. we went to front of line as instructed and crowd was unhappy. our agent had left. but we got the correct form and returned to front of customer service line crowd was unhappy and was told that it would be 400 that is almost 800 us dollars for 2 bags. we tried to sort that out but to no avail. we were told to read the small print over and over. so i agreed to pay and was told it was too late that the flight was closed. so we had to buy new tickets on another airline at another airport. they sell you tickets at a low price and then through small print charge you for seat printing boarding passes extra baggage etc.  our recent experience with ryanair was unsatisfactory thus we cannot recommend this airline to anyone. we chose ryanair for its low fares. the numerous fees exceeded the original cost of our tickets. while some fees are warranted ryanair is the only airline i have flown that charges fees to print out boarding passes. their excess baggage weight fees are higher as well. even more troubling is the disorganized check in and bag dropoff process and unacceptable customer service. we had to stand in one long line to drop off checked bags another line to pay extra fees and return to the 1st line to complete the bag drop process. during this ordeal we were met with staff who were insolent berating us in french and clearly had no allegiance to ryanair giving confusing directions. ryanair has a lot to learn about efficiency and customer service if it wants to be the southwest airlines of europe. until then we will fly other airlines even if the fares are higher. i flew out to ibiza with my husband and 2 small children for a family holiday and our flight out was terrible. i understand that a lot of people go to ibiza to party but so do a lot travel for family holidays  it was like a party plane. there was no control of the travellers who congregated in the aisles sat 4 to a row 3 seats sat on arm rests music played loudly in the row in front of us and not good music at that. the trolley of drinks and snacks was pointless on both the flight there and back as after a few rows there was nothing left we were in row 14 the seatbelt light was put on half way through our flight out there when there was no turbulence  i believe this was to try and seat people but when my husband attempted to take my 5 year old daughter to the toilet whilst others were still stood i have to add a member of staff was slightly rude and told us she couldnt go and had to sit down. shortly after this the light was turned off. i have flown with ryanair before and not had this problem but i would definitely consider not flying them with my children. ryanair chartered an air explore aircraft for both flights and on both legs we were on a filthy aircraft. the overhead lockers were caked in dust and chewing gum stuck to the seats. the cabin crew were pleasant enough however we did not hear a peep out of the flight deck   a welcome would have been good customer service. im starting to fly this route more regularly and for the first time have to report what i consider to be a significant failing with the cabin crew. our plane fr7974 left late after a late inbound arrival. i was sitting in row 2. there was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing which is often the final point made during the cockpit preflight passenger announcement. the announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. i appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to london as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. the pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear even in row 2. even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. when i asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention she told me it was not really worth it because they the passengers wouldnt do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they dont need to listen to it because they know what to do by now. the drinks run and duty free run were very speedy leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that i have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with ryanair. very disappointing.  our return flight was cancelled with next available a week later no one from ryanair at airport to help. they offered to put us up for one night only helpline told us we had to sort out alternative flight ourselves  we are currently stuck in italy. ryanair do not care should be their slogan. we are having to take 5 hr train to rome to fly with easyjet at our own expense to leeds then try to get to manchester to pick up car if it hasnt been clamped for overstaying on car park. would never use again. even despite following all the rules the air stewards insisted on putting our hand baggage in the hold the flight is busy was their excuse. arrived in palma and waited for ages to get our cabin baggage from the aircraft hold. the return flight was a bigger nightmare. again rude cabin crew and the flight was delayed for around 1.5 hrs whilst seated inside the plane. drinks were offered as it was quite stuffy and to the amazement of passengers they were charging for this. the captain announced that we would be taxiing in 8 minutes and to go to the lavatories if one needs to. i went to the loo and was told to get back to my seat by a rude air hostess. i decided to order some food and the same surly air hostess unfortunately took my order. i know the airline is cheap but we are paying customers and deserve to be treated humanely. the ticket was cheap but not the cheapest. long queue to check in luggage thankfully we arrived 2hrs 30 mins early had just enough time to drop luggage  which was literally that as already checked in online and downloaded boarding passes find the gate and board. told my 3 and6 yr old we would get a snack and drink onboard. only problem was they had no soft drinks or water for the girls and limited snacks. when we asked what we should give the girls to drink the air steward advised red bull otherwise they had tomato juice apparently the inbound flight from ibiza sold more than anticipated and they are not allowed to restock.  im paying for it it should be available and  its not like i was expecting it complimentary. i also found the staff rude and unwilling to assist. this is the first and last time i would fly with ryanair. we are a family of 4 i have a 9 year old daughter and 5 year old son. this airline expected my 5 year old to sit on his own at the front of the plane and my 9 year daughter to sit at the back. no one wanted to help or give me answer to the fact by law there not allowed to fly without a parent but yet you feel its ok to separate my children from their mother. in the end a passenger actually moved so i could sit with my young children if he hadnt my daughter would have been made to sit in the corner with 2 men who actually got really drunk and had to be spoken to on several occasions. i was told its all to do with balance ive never heard anything so ridiculous. on the return flight we had to pay an additional amount to insure the safety of my children i think this is a disgrace we paid for our flights and shouldnt have to pay more. its common sense to put young children with their parents. with ryanair you have to be 100 clear of the terms and conditions read and understand all the small print. they will come down like tons of brick on you if you make any little mistake. my partner and i were compelled to pay staggering 120 extra on top of the fare. the reason we didnt print our ticket 2 hours prior to boarding. it is like they playing cat and mouse with their passengers. since the experience i have been flying with norwegian. ryanair has a policy of printing your boarding pass prior to your flight which obviously includes web checkin. if you fail to do so the airline charges an absurd amount of 45eur per person. while it does mention to web checkin on your ticket first time goers are bound to face problems. the staff gave us a deaf ear on us when we kept saying our web checkin kept failing a night prior inspite of repeated attempts. neither was the ground staff smart enough to tell us how do we go about paying for extra luggage and boarding passes. there are different queue for these. remember to carry a credit card as they wont accept cash. you cannot carry beyond a certain weight hence a small bag is always preferred here. overall experience  15. if only were they more friendly to 1st time travelers. i am not a regular user of low cost airlines but on this occasion used ryanair on due to the holiday destination airport chania crete. the checkin clerk however could benefit from a refresher course in customer service as he appeared extremely bored and disinterested. however my complaint starts when we did not print off our return boarding passes in advance of the holiday and although we tried to reserve our seats for the return flight so my family could sit together we were unable to do this via their website. we gave up after 2 attempts and assumed we would checkin on arrival and take whatever seats available. we of course were not aware that they would be an additional charge for printing a boarding pass and was advised by the desk clerk to checkin online again we tried to do this via our smart phone but again were unable to access the booking on the website. as we had spent a considerable amount of time and with mounting stress from my wife i was forced to pay the additional charge. the 3 boarding passes were duly hand written in 10 minutes by the servisair clerk and 135â¬ extracted. the clerk even told us we were lucky to get the last 3 seats even though we had booked and paid for them. i find these charges levied by ryanair are totally disproportionate to the administration involved and are punitive in the extreme and are extracted under stressful circumstances. up to this point we had enjoyed a fabulous holiday only to have it spoiled on our return. i have a number of issues with this penalty charge firstly it is not clear on their website when making the online seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight or is it ryanairs intention to catch out the new customers and secondly i regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes. i regularly use online booking and the barcode via smart phone but generally this is within 24 hours prior to departure and i have never been charged for a boarding pass this is not the industry norm. i made a complaint to ryanair and got a stock answer hiding behind the t&cs and no refund. still valuable albeit expensive lesson learned never to fly ryanair again. ryanair policies are terrible and staff rude. we had been backpacking for two weeks and were unable to print boarding passes. in dublin when i approached the desk to say that we had our boarding passes on a laptop the customer service worker starting yelling at us. how am i supposed to stamp your boarding pass if its on a device so we got in another line and got our boarding passes printed but felt shaken that wed just been screamed at even though the save as pdf option was clearly one of the options during online checkin and there was no warning about needing passes on paper. on the return from edinburgh to dublin we still had not been able to print passes and were told it would be gbp15 per person to print the boarding cards. it was infuriating and felt like highway robbery. and then you get on board and they charge for the coffee and sell lotto tickets to benefit some childrens charity.  for some ridiculous reason using ryanair online checkin which is mandatory you need to reenter all passport info again into the same system that already stored it when tickets were purchased. i again entered all info for our family of 8 and the website timed me out. i tried again saving the info as i went along but their system does not allow saves. again timed out with an âerror page. at check in we explained to a ryanair agent what happened. she rudely told us this was not their problem and we had to pay extra. we were sent to pay for one bag and a checkin fee amounting to 630cdn more than the price of 8 flights we were told if we prove an âerror page on the computer they would refund. we showed them the error page. they wouldnt accept it there and forced us to pay up front then call customer service for a refund. we did and received a stock email and refused us a refund. everyone we dealt with had a superior couldnt care less attitude. they lied about a refund being possible. as a business owner this kind of service appalls me. this whole episode left a bad taste in our mouth and coloured our first trip to ireland. we will never fly ryanair again.  you should be very careful when choosing ryanair. you will buy a ticket within europe and the currency adopted is the country of the departure which is a normal proceedure. however the currency rate they use to charge you is different from the official rate which leads you to think you are paying x but you are actually paying x  100. in the end the flight cost me as much as full service airline but i got the worst service. i did not get a glass of water on my international flight with ryanair.  i emailed them about 15 times before the flight to explain there was a problem with the amount they were charging which was a totally different amount. to add a bag on the website is supposed to be 45 euros but they charge 56 euros i never understood that and they never answered why. their replies were nonsense emails not answering my questions. at the airport i found out why because their ruddest staff had the courage to say you chose to fly ryanair so you have to pay as much as we say it is.  i was travelling with a family group including three children under 5. i anticipated a delay from palma and so i was not surprised when we took off almost two hours past our due time. at palma after having our boarding passes checked we then went into the glass walkway to the aircraft and stood waiting in the same place to board. this glass walkway was in the full sun with people using anything for a fan and given no reason for this. i was very concerned for my baby granddaughter who was sweating profusely and we were in this situation for approximately 15 minutes. why did that happen could we not have been held back in the departure lounge. it was appalling and of course no offer of any water. on the flight there were members of staff or i assume they were who were helping uniformed staff but one was in shorts and tshirt and the other casually dressed. to state sloppy is an understatement it was appalling.  these flight were not cheap as they were in the peak summer period so no consolation there. appalling an extra 180 euros we had to find to get our boarding passes so we could get home if you dont pay the extra charge you dont fly. you must print off your boarding passes 48hrs before you fly and if you dont have access to the internet you will be charged 45 euros per person. this is in the terms and conditions. why when we printed the outbound tickets from manchester to malaga wasnt i able to print inbound tickets at the same time thats just common sense to me. we were lucky this was the only thing they could charge us for if your luggage is to heavy its 10 euros per kilo. flying from stockholm to london is a short flight so i thought id try and save a few bucks by travelling with ryanair rather than one of the regular airlines. check in were okay if you dont mind broken seats a dirty airport and a customer service worthy of the ice queen herself. im not a tall man but i could not fit my legs in the seats under any circumstances. flight personnel were horribly aggressive trying to push peoples bags in the overhead compartment. i would not recommend ryanair. this morning i received an email from ryanair encouraging me to check in for a flight to denmark. there are three of us in my party. having filled in all the boxes with passport details etc including expiry dates which i had to ring round for the screen timed out and i had to start again. having all the details to hand it didnt take me long to get to the next screen which told me that unless i purchased allocated seating i couldnt check in until a couple of days before the flight. what is wrong with these people that they cant tell you that before you go through all the hoops.  we had the worst experience with ryanair last month. to begin with they do not have airport checkin and boarding pass printing. their system is based on the customer bringing hisher boarding pass ahead of time. we did not realise this and they send us to pay 50 euros for each ticket for a family of 5 it was 250 euros. payments are done in a different office so i had to go there and stand for 20 min in a very unorganized line. when i came back to checkin the agent was very upset that we didnt pay for our suitcases almost yelling at us. guess what we didnt know about this as well. so now she sent me again for the same office to pay another 200 euros. now however there is only one line instead of two so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee. overall their service is the worst that ive experienced. they make you feel as if they are doing you a favor for allowing you to fly their planes. i encourage anyone who wants to fly at a low cost not to fly with ryanair. overall it comes out to a very expensive experience. ryanair uses the motto low fares airline as a trap to be honest. we bought our tickets for a short domestic flight for a good price. however the ridiculous addon charges 55x4 euros per checkin at the airport fee  67euros for a 22 kg luggage made it cost much much more. i understand the luggage fee. however 220 euros airport checkin fee is twice the price of our total ticket cost finding this cost info on their website is almost impossible it is literally hidden on the website  you have to search for that particular thing really. their dont forget to checkin online emails can easily be ignored because they dont mention any airport checkin fee. it looks like a choice not a mustdo. at least three more couple of people paid that meaningless fee. because they were not aware of it. if this airlines were for budget travelers and really cared about customer service they would warn travelers about those ridiculous addon fees. a fee should offer a service so its value should be reasonable compared with the service it gives. so we paid 220 euros for a single checkin not four  because normal airlines do a single checkin per reservation done by a sourfaced checkin officer who scolded us like we were little kindergarden children. this is not an acceptable service. like another couple said on that day never again we were charged 180 euros for a family of 4 because we were unable to complete the online checkin website kept timing out when we tried from an internet cafe despite no other problems doing any other internet related jobs there. when i got to the airport and explained this the lady at the desk that handles ryanair at lisbon said that it happened a lot and that ryanair would refund us if we made a complaint on our return. we waited over an hour to check in as only one guy was managing two flights the flight sat for more than half an hour on the runway at stansted and was possibly the most uncomfortable flight i have ever taken. not only have ryanair not refunded us they havent even replied fully to my concerns. each time i write in i get the same standardised response about terms and conditions. i wonder whether this is strategic so they can dupe people into running up fees with their tricky online checkin service. never again. we arrived at ema exactly 2 hours before check in which was great. there was already a large queue at check in but we accepted the inevitable and joined it with about 100 other passengers in front. i was shocked to see only one counter open and 2 staff. i thought ok must be fairly fast but no  after having moved about 4 feet in half an hour i began to worry. i noticed the ryanair desk across the hall so went over to ask when they were opening the other 2 check in desks they said they didnt intend to. i explained we were worried about missing the flight and were told once you are checked in the flight will wait for you  anyway about 1hour 30 mins later we finally got our bags checked in then we ran to the next stage bear in mind we had 3 oaps and an 8 year old to deal with so running isnt exactly an option. we were told to empty all contents into the little boxes and go through security. after 40 minutes we got through security only to realise they were calling last boarding call for our flight. our flight was at the end of the terminal when arent they so we had to leg it as fast as we could now again 3 oaps me on crutches and an 8 year old trying to run through ema to catch a flight that we had queued up for ages to get. given that we did finally manage to get on board i would not recommend either ema airport or ryanair for future travel. i would rather pay an additional charge to fly from another airport with another company. if there was an option for 010 i would give it zero. ryanair is the worst airline i have ever flown. we payed 344 euros for short 40 min. return trip fight. when we got to the to the airport we had to pay 45 more euros each just to have a boarding pass printed. we were traveling around germany and spain and didnt have access to computer printer unaware of their policy. ive traveled the world and never heard of anything like that. they herd them in like cattle. there is basically no service and you pay extra for everything.  flight was late which almost caused us to miss connecting flight. absolutely no one is available to help or answer questions. ryanair flight from zadar croatia to dublin was probaly one of the most uncomfortable flights i have been on. there is no pocket to store your items such as your phone etc this is the stupidest thing i have ever seen on a commercial aircraft the seats are filthy  there was chewing gum stuck to the seats in front of us and certain parts of the chairs in front of us had a lot of dirt on them. window seats are really uncomfortable i could not sleep  because i had nowhere to rest my head as the seats are flat and comparable to rocks. this is the only airline that flys from zadar to dublin so we had no other choice and i understand it is a low cost airline  however other low cost airlines at least clean their seats and provide a pocket for your stuff. we plan to never fly with them again as we are taking a flight from belfast with easyjet to split which is closer to our location in which we stay in. i should have been on this flight but 15 days before flying it was cancelled together with the return flight from italy. apparently they can do this and there is nothing you can do about it. they claim it was done for operational reasons. i was unable to contact them and had no choice but spend double my original fare in order to book flights with another airline. however the flight still left on the day it was supposed to. of course my seats had been resold at twice the price i paid they were advertising them the day after they cancelled my flight. despite 3 emails complaining to ryanair they have given me no explanation for telling me my flight was cancelled when it wasnt.  ryanair is without a doubt the worst airline i have had the misfortune of flying with. we got to the airport at east midlands in plenty of time and went to ryanair check in desks which took up a good third of all airport check ins. they decided to try and book 4 flights through at the same time with 3 staff after 2 hours stood in a queue we got to the front of the queue and again another porter came this time trying to book a disabled woman on in front of us  the woman had walked down with her husband and was sat on a chair smiling. i said to porter what are you doing he replied booking them on im stood on walking sticks and had been waiting 2 hours. so we had 15 mins left for food and toilets before boarding. the planes have no legroom the organisation is rubbish and staff dont care less. i will never fly with them again.  couple told us they were asked to clean the plane when they flew with them the week before as they hadnt had chance to clear up from the previous flight. and they had no drinks left as they had been busy. ryanair may be low cost but their tickets are not necessarily cheap sometimes more expensive than ba for example by the time you have paid quite large sums for the privilege of travelling with a bag etc. they are most certainly cheap when it comes to airport services and very expensive for anything purchased onboard. the checkin process at birmingham was perfunctory but quick security a fairly long process as usual with inadequate staff and boarding was fine until we stood in the airbridge for 15 minutes only to find that it was not connected anyway and so then had to descend the steps on to the ramp before going up the airstairs on the aircraft  certainly not good for the elderly andor infirm. similarly in murcia checkin was ok but long queues had formed by the time staff turned up and we were made to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes until the crew deigned to let us on board. at birmingham once again no airbridge. all very convenient i am sure for ryanair but not so for their customers. the cabin crew were amateur at best and seem to be there mainly to extract more cash from the passengers  all their prices are ridiculous and a claim that perfume etc is 40 less than the high street is at best disingenuous. on the positive side the aircraft are clean albeit uncomfortable and the flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule. they do more or less what they say on the tin  but do not have any other expectations take your own fooddrink purchase nothing and prepare to be dehumanised. three elderly ladies were refused entry to this ryanair flight from stansted to kos for being 30 seconds late one of whom was disabled. my wife had just gone through and they could literally reach out and touch her ryanair is a terrible airline which in the long run costs more than most full service airlines after all ryanair addons.  due to the closure of a section on the m25 we arrived at stansted with only one hour to go before our flight left. knowing we were in trouble and seeing the hundreds waiting to be checked in i joined a queue at ryanair customer service to ask how we should proceed. mrs miserable at the here to help counter uttered that same litany as if we had arrived late on purpose just to annoy her  checkin opens 3 hours before you fly. her head twitched sideways and she announced checkin 80 where another long queue was waiting then turned her back on us. when our turn finally comes after one assistant has closed up and gone home leaving only two operating we are told we are too late and the gate is closed. if you want a bad situation made much worse then fly with ryanair. of course this is a very lucrative action by ryanair as people are then offered  as a gesture of goodwill the chance to buy another flight for 100 per head. flew ryanair from hhn to opo. not enough counters at the checkin but flight still on time. beverages are expensive. the lottery is annoying. seats are very uncomfortable. go for the extra legroom in the firstrow.  apart from the price i cant think of any positive aspect of ryanair.  the crew was in such a hurry that procedures like other airlines have are not respected. no explicit crosschecks no orders from the captain no visual purser on board. crew was working individually and had language issues between them. on this flight neither a german or spanish native speaker and a level of english that has to be questioned. boarding procedure chaotic took therefore more than 40 minutes both ways no gate in cologne although aircraft was parked next to a gate. arriving in madrid taxiing at highest speed to gate aircraft parked to far from gate so it took 20 minutes to connect. i would not like to fly them again. the ryanair flight was 35 minutes late in departing there were no hot meals onboard and the cabin crew could not care less about the situation despite it being a 3 hour 20 min late flight. they ran out of ice when finally they came round with a drinks trolley 90 mins into the flight. it said on every seat back that receipts were issued but they cant or would not do that.  bristol to chania with ryanair. online check in so got to airport in plenty of time but lines getting through security so long we almost missed flight gate almost half an hour away from security. usual melee on board staff pressuring people to buy rubbish food drinks duty free goods and lottery tickets and complaining loudly to each other when failing to do so big problem when we came in to land at chania airport. pilot failed on first attempt  think he was travelling far too fast for runway  and despite perfect weather conditions we had to climb again and were then an extra 20 mins in sky and ten mins landing. no explanation given by crew lots of people worried in case it was a pervasive mechanical problem unable to drop landing gear for example or just a careless pilot  neither are happy thoughts to have as you circle your destination so no phoney fixed on time landing song to endure but no apology or explanation either. ryanair needs to be a bit more accountable and cabin crew need to have some consideration for their customers. this is a review based on my ryanair experiences at madrid barajas airport on 23 september 2015. i arrived 2 hrs early at around 1130 for the 1335 flight. at around 1300 our boarding cards were checked and we went down the ramp to embark. at around 1320 we were asked to return to the departure lounge due to a technical issue. for the next 3 hrs we were not advised of the issue nor of the plans to get us back to the uk. gradually over that time people would ask the 2 relatively junior staff members of ryanair and news or lack of it would filter down the line. no announcements were made. by around 1700 we heard that a plane was on its way and we would depart at around 1930. ok 6 hrs delay but at least wed be home. the 2 officials then handed out photocopies of the eu regulations regarding flight delays etc  useful but to be honest we just wanted to get home as can be imagined people then were asking lots of questions of the 2 lads. at around the same time food vouchers were being handed out and stamped by the 2 officials. however not one of the food outlets would take the vouchers because ryanair had tried this in the past and had not paid their bills to the food outlets at around 1830 the 1930 departure disappeared off the departures list. we heard that another flight had been delayed and our rescue plane had been used for those passengers  presumably to avoid 2 sets of compensation time progressed slowly we then found out that a flight would take us back to the uk around 2305. the flight actually left at 2330  10 hrs late. during the 10 hrs the 200 or so customers were shunted at least 5 times between gates  can you imagine 200 people racing around getting from a to b ok these things happen. lessons to be learnt  ryanair have someone on the ground such as a manager to deal with the situation and inform people officially by adequate communication. pay your bills to the local food outlets. having reported all the above ive travelled extensively for the past few years to spain and back and used ryanair a lot. mostly they are cheap and get you there on time its just at times such as the above where you realise their service is quite flaky. i hope this accurately reflects events the other day and it will help someone in some way. ryanair was great value for money. only problem was as we were amongst the final few to board we were unable to find a space for one of our bags in the overhead locker. as a result my husband had a very uncomfortable flight home with the bag at his feet. i noticed several handbags had been placed in the lockers and thought the cabin staff could have asked the owners to move them.  i booked our flights with ryanair months ago via their website. all seemed to be fine until i tried to print out my boarding passes that same morning as our flight. i tried several times but their site would not complete the process and i had no choice but to leave for the airport. ryanair charges for printing up boarding passes at the airport 20 pounds a person so i went to the customer service desk and explained my situation to them. without blinking an eyelash their service person said there was nothing she could do and i had to pay the charge regardless. she even called my honesty into question. while we were waiting in line we had conversations with 2 other passengers that encountered the same problem. reviewing others comments online i can now see that this is an ongoing complaint with ryanair. i will challenge this charge with my credit card company but for now i just want to alert others to this scam. this is a budget airline and they live up to the title the seats did not even recline at least on our flight and their customer service should be call customer disservice just horrible. the worst checkin experience i have had. they charged me 4050 eur at the airport to check in without any baggage. the inflight experience was poor the seats look like plastic. yes its a low cost airline but i have flown low cost airlines and none has been this substandard. will avoid it by all costs unless they are the only airline flying to my destination. we arrived at stansted after an earlier longhaul flight from new zealand. unfamiliar with ryanair online checkin and baggage check procedures. noted one free checked bag 11kg and was gobsmacked to be charged 50 extra for desk checkin and 45 for baggage checkin. this more than tripled the cost of the flight. even if i mastered online checkin i would never use ryanair again and will advise others to not make the same mistaken choice. our return flight to stansted was due to leave corfu on 20th september at 10.30pm. we arrived on time checked in and flight was on indicator board. went through security and in to departure lounge indicator board showed delay one hour later indicator board showed diverted. ryanair reps were very evasive passengers all upset given a food voucher for 5 euros could only have bottle of water and cheese sandwich and passengers told flight would not be leaving until 1pm monday.  ryanair staff said had a technical difficulty passengers told to go to arrivals area. no further information. no reps to be seen and had to sleep or should i say try to sleep on airport seats. i am 76 years old and found it very uncomfortable and painful. monday morning arrived plane on tarmac watched by the passengers was being repaired  okay there was a thunderstorm on sunday night but it was hot dry and sunny from 8am on monday but the plane was still not ready to fly at 1pm. finally flew back at 3.45pm. asked for a cup of tea on the plane told i could have a cup of tea but no milk or sugar on board. will never use the airline again given forms for compensation not worth the paper they are written on no compensation due as delay was supposedly due to unusual circumstances quite sure they will have received many complaints about this flight. another plane which was delayed easyjet all the passengers on that flight were taken by coach to a b&b and they flew out the following morning long before ryanair finally flew out. after paying 70.00 return for my ryanair flight for travelling in june 2015 i was disgusted and dismayed to find that ryanair have hiked up their prices for exactly the same travel dates in june 2016 to over 200.00 return. after emailing to ask for an explanation for this extortionate price hike  given that oil and fuel costs are at one of their lowest  i was dissatisfied with their response that they always offer the best price on their website where else would i be looking. the following is their list of price determining factors  number of passengers already booked on a flight  flight time  day of travel  time of year  high seasonlow season etc. given that we are travelling on the same flights and the same period which have virtually only just become available i fail to see how such a price increase can be justified other than pure greed and the mindset that they have a captive audience. as the accommodation had already been booked we had no option but to book ryanair on this occasion but i can assure them that it will be my last flight with them. shame on you ryanair and goodbye. i bought 2 ryanair tickets from eindhoven to london for 34 and at the check out instead of 68 i paid 128.75 because they added 60 fees. they dont allow you to check in and print your tickets sooner than 24 hours prior to your flight so if you are unable to print them when the time comes it happened in my case since i was in the middle of my trip they charge you 15euros per itinerary to issue them at the airport which is insane the staff is rude. we arrived at the airport in the netherlands and the employee was replying to us in dutch even though we were talking in english and we made it very clear that we dont understand her. for tickets that were suppose to cost 68 we paid in total 174.  do not book your ryanair flights through edreams. they charged me 20 for baggage and for booking the flight. it is a rip off when i got to the check in. i was told i did not book my bag in and i got stung for 50 euros. why does ryanair let a company like this promote them edreams can only be contacted via a high premium number and their email is no reply. i know if you get it right with ryanair it can be a good deal. but the stress involved is not worth it. i would rather pay more next time and have peace of mind. i had a negative experience with ryanair. on arrival to the airport i was informed that i had not checked in online and there would be a 47 euro charge to do so at that time. they claim they sent me an email alerting me to this request. i then discovered the request at the very bottom of a lengthy email which i needed my reading glasses to see. the email heading was that of a receipt for my flight following which there were large bright colored advertisements and after that offers to increase legroom check in extra baggage etc. all of these were prominently displayed. the heading of the email had nothing to do with checking in online. i was refused boarding unless i paid the extra cash by the haughty person behind the desk  i simply left and took a cab back to porto. this type of deceitful behavior on the part of ryanair deserves special mention. cheap airline with no frills flying. flew ryanair for the first and last time while in europe. had been warned prior but didnt think it would be a bad experience so opted for the 2 hour flight. had paid for costs including additional baggage upgrades online but was still asked by gate agents to pay for additional weight despite internet agent telling me otherwise. was rather upset with ryanair. overall flight was mediocre and cabin rather dirty food from prior flight still on floors. agents not really attentive and overall more concerned with getting flight over with rather than helping customers. seats were leather but thin and poorly cushioned. stay away from this airline as the pricing is fools gold. aircraft clean and departure on time. check in was ok but ground staff not very customer service oriented. cabin crew gave a friendly welcome when boarding. during flight no free foodsdrinks but for sale. after service was finished i noticed two of the cabin crew sitting on boxes in the galley playing games on mobile phones which is not very professional.  i gave 5 star for seat comfort as i booked a seat in first row  emergency exit row with a lot of leg room. we havent flown yet the flight fr5995 from madrid to stansted due to go at 13.35 was first delayed 6 hours and now due to go at 23.30  its now 18.40. no info or updates one measly food voucher that covers a sandwich and coffee. they could have let us all on a later flight and put those people on our later one but that would have meant 2 plane loads of disgruntled travellers. never again with ryanair. utterly strippeddown and basic flight as usual. very restricted legroom. no hot drinks not good for a 3.5 hour flight. and why allow huge hand luggage into the cabin then demand that people with smaller bags put them under their seat when theres hardly any legroom ryanair is flying at its least pleasurable. london to dinard return. only fly with them because convenient airport not far away from where i was going. short flight of 55 minutes. but constant announcement some crew with poor level of english including the one in charge. very poor customer service. on landing on the second flight was seated toward the back and heard crew conversation that was not what pax want to hear then they were more interested in checking their phone than saying good bye to the pax. very unprofessional. only consider flying with them if its convenient but otherwise forget it. ryanair flight from london to barcelona was ok but seatbelt light was on for nearly the whole of the two hours and definitely the last hour. people kept trying to go to the toilet and were told to sit back down because the seatbelt light was on. there was no turbulance and no reason for the seatbelt sign to be on. i think they forgot to turn it off and made people sit in discomfort. very annoyed because i was obviously one of those people. our luggage also took 1.5hrs to come out which was annoying because i had to meet my b&b host at a certain time. ive flown with ryanair a few times. this flight from warsaw to madrid on had something unpleasantly memorable for me. i was sitting in the back 28 or 29 in an aisle seat. the flight attendant who was in charge of the back was a man a strong and big one. the space between ryanair seats are tight and also the aisle is not a wide one. thus it was very difficult for that flight attendant to move. i never forget how he unintentionally hit my head with his elbow when he was trying to move in the aisle serving drinks to passengers. to my surprise he didnt even turn back to say sorry. he might not have realized that he ever hit me to cut a long story short ryanair can change the space between seats in order to host more passengers as long as the passengers are informed beforehand like their rules about printed boarding pass but their employees ought to fit in their technical amendments and measurements copenhagen to charleroi and ryanair is not the best company for this route. was late 30 min  the same three days before when arrived to copenhagen. we stayed one hour standing and waiting to board after the control of the tickets. without any explanation both times. so if you want to be late you choose the best company for this route. the plane didnt have a table in front of the seat very poor service. and also in the copenhagen airport is at gate f almost every time far from the entrance. really very poor. ryanair flight from stansted to lisbon was delayed by 20 minutes at first then we were ushered onto the flight very rudely and told to speed up in order to meet departure time. only 1 person to board the entire flight making it a slow process despite being rushed. they then missed the second departure time by 3 minutes due to slow boarding not the fault of the passengers but the fact only one person was checking boarding passes and we were then delayed a further hour and a half. not even remotely worth the cheap prices. unimpressed to say the least. the most annoying airline and it is cheap for a reason. i wanted to check in but i couldnt check in for the flight back because it is more than 7 days away. they insisted that i pay for the seat with a minimum of 11. kiosk check in will cost me 45. just unbelievable  bologna to madrid in march 2015. the service was pretty good there wasnt much queue for boarding  deboarding at the airports. there wasnt so much legroom in the seats but i asked the crew to sit on the seats that are near at the emergency exit where there was more legroom and they said yes. the food and drinks arent free at all a glass of water or a cup of coffee costs about 3 euros but if you consider that the flight costed something like 30 euros that was acceptable. horrendous experience flying with ryanair is basically what i imagine hell might be like and if i never have to fly with them again it will be too soon. cramped seats tacky promotions and they try to sell you all manner of things from food to watches and toys. the back of the seats reminded me of a mcdonalds menu with the tacky yellow plastic. our flight was also delayed due to technical faults and we were told we could leave the gates and the next information would be made available in 20mins. no further information was given so we returned to the gate anyway and were ushered through by two staff drinking pints of beer. simply unbelievable and incredibly unprofessional. the outbound ryanair flight was fine and ran to schedule however the return flight was a different matter entirely. on 11th december the country was suffering some severe weather and ryanair cancelled every inbound and outbound flight to dublin. i appreciate that safely is of upmost importance but many other airlines were still operating with the majority of air lingus flights still flying in and out. there was no explanation why this was so. the next available free transfer to another ryanair flight out of dublin was 6 days later. we managed to book on an air lingus flight a day later. the refund from ryanair was paid promptly but it would have been nice to receive information as to why there was a blanket cancellation of all of their flights on the day when other airlines were still operating. horrible experience with ryanair from dublin to london gatwick. flights were cancelled while the planes sat at the gates unable to take off because of weather they said other airlines were landing and departing. they emailed us to notify us of the cancellation  no staff to help at the gate. it was chaotic. the lines at dublin airport were hours long and they encouraged us to leave the queue to book online. their website poorly designed by any standard could not handle the traffic and we could do nothing. i finally ended up booking a flight on aer lingus just to get out of there. although i had paid little for the ticket the inconvenience was significant.  ryanair from manchester to malaga return and delays out and returning. very cramped badly stocked trolley both ways at extortionate prices. worst landing i have ever experienced out and back. landed with such a bang that i surprised the plane undercarriage survived it never again. copenhagen to kaunas on 23rd of december 2015. the lowcost price of my return ryanair ticket was â¬ 310. not exactly what i would call cheap for a 1 hour 10 minute flight. safety and security instructions were given on a low volume pa system so that few people could barely hear it. onboard the seat was filthy from last passengers food waste the carpet was filthy with chewing gum food and chips and even the shabby looking steward didnt bother to put his shirt inside his trousers. also it looked as if his shirt apparently hadnt been ironed for a few weeks. ordered a drink and a sandwich was prompted to pay â¬17. after having done the maths for the stewardess the price was suddenly â¬10. ryanair has some kind of lottery sale onboard their flights. i dont know what this is all about but it seemed a lot more interesting for cabin staff than the safety instructions. upon landing in kaunas i asked a steward what the local time was but he had no idea that the time zone was one hour ahead of the departure airport. this is a filthy airline and staff couldnt care less.  some claim that lowcost is the future of flying. however i have absolutely no trust in this joke of an airline.  we were stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours after boarding because according to them they had problems with air traffic control over france.  ive never had this problem before even flying with ryanair before which was okay because i had extra legroom. this time i didnt get any extra legroom and the time on the ground was another 2 hours of torture on top of the four it took to get to tenerife. because the seats are so close together. lets just say it was painful on my legs. im flying back to birmingham on ryanair as well in a couple of days. this time i managed to get extra legroom. you better not disappoint now ryanair  the problem with ryanair is that they seem to have the price table in pounds and euros but it costs the same amount units for example i wanted to add a bag to my trip it costs 25 inbound and 15 outbound thats 40 or 40 euros depending in where you live. now i do not know any other company that does this 40 euros is 29 so why i am being asked to pay 11 extra than the chap from euro zone on top of that there is 5eurgpb charge for adding a bag after you have booked the ticket not sure what this covers as this is simply to add to my eticket that i have also booked a bag. so thats another 10 so in total i have to pay 50 when a chap from euro zone pays 3650 euros on the same flight ill be honest if i had a choice i would never fly with this airline unfortunately i dont as they are the only airline that fly to my destination direct. ryanair shows a total contempt for their customers. my partner and i arrived at the airport for our flight from rome to barcelona only to discover that with ryanair you are required to checkin online or be charged at 45 euro fee per passenger this wouldnt have been an issue if it were clearly stated in the confirmation email they sent when we booked however it was only make clear in an email sent to us shortly before the flight. as we were travelling we had limited email access which i feel is far from unusual when people are travelling. this is a pretty cynical way of extorting extra fees from their customers as they know that a certain percentage of people will not receive the eleventh hour email and be forced to pay the fee or be stranded. we were arrived an hour and a half before our flight and they still wanted 45 euros to print two pieces of paper the planes were unclean staff rude and the service horrible.  jerez to barcelona with ryanair. i would ride bareback on a donkey across a burning desert before id ever fly this airline again. you have to print out your boarding pass before you arrive which is really easy for someone traveling or they charge you â¬50 they walk back in forth in the aisles with perfume for sale and wont even give you water on a twohour flight. they are the worst manchester to faro and a very disappointing experience. i booked in july for a holiday to faro in december party of 4 of which 3 are disabled 2 of which needed to use the abulift to access the aircraft. i booked special assistance at the time of booking and was allocated specific seats for out party to be able to access easily. we all booked in and went to special assistance area. all fine and good well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. flight called we were taken to board the plane. wait theres a massive problem theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift but we were told ryanair would only take 4 it seemed 2 others hadnt pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldnt take more than 4 we got as far as the tarmac sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. we were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance thankfully i always keep the paperwork safe. no other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. it seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help.  ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was for us to actually get on the plane. we were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. maybe when ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag forget those who are confined to a chair. as a result id never fly with them again. i was made to feel like a nuisance. ryanair from luton to lanzarote. we were just about to touch down at lanzarote on boxing day when we took off again. the captain announced 10 minutes later that we were going to land at fuerteventura with a vague explanation about weather being a bit hazy. when we landed we were told that wed be refuelling and taking off in 3040 mins. after 1 hr 55 mins we were told to get off the plane to get food and drink. we were then dumped at the baggage carousel. didnt even go through passport control and the next thing our bag were coming off. no one knew what was going on. we had to leave the airport and go to the ryanair counter. eventually we we told that wed be getting coaches to the ferry port and then take the ferry back to lanzarote then another coach back to the airport. we reached our hotel at 1010 pm when we should have got there at 310 pm. ryanair flight was ontime and arrived slightly early into lanzarote from leeds. cabin crew were just downright miserable and didnt look to be enjoying their jobs. all were foreign and very difficult to understand same for the flight crew. i wouldnt like to think what they would have been like if we were depending on them in the case of an onboard emergency. seats were a bit uncomfortable for a 4.5 hour flight but thats acceptable for the low price we paid. priority boarding is well worth the extra if you are taking a handluggage size suitcase on board to make sure that there is space available in the overhead lockers. i know that ryanair is an economy no frills airline but for goodness sake there are limits. flew from luton to valletta. they tell you that you can take a bag into the cabin and then spend the next hour or so harassing you at every opportunity and asking you if you would like to check in that bag for free. the seats are bolt upright and cannot be moved the pockets on the seat in front of you have vanished and there is approximately 4 inches between your knees and the seat in front for a person with average length legs anyway. if you sit next to the window you end up freezing cold and getting wet as ice forms on the inside of the cabin wall and when you point it out on the way off the plane the pilot explains that its because their air conditioning system is so efficient that it ices up. the call to go to the boarding desk is far too early which results in at over 150 people standing strung out across the boarding gates for three quarters of an hour whilst the staff checking you through to the plane know full well that the plane hasnt even landed and of course they are happily chatting away in their seats behind the desk so they dont care. this is just cruel and unfair especially to those people who find standing around quite difficult. the staff on board the aircraft were more interested in gossiping and playing around than paying attention to the passengers. they know that most people wont buy anything because ryanair rip you off so they are totally disinterested in what they are doing. one of the staff doing the announcements did so in such heavily accented english that it was almost impossible to understand what she was saying. i thought easyjet was bad but even they are better than ryanair and that takes some doing. i will never fly with this company again. worst possible flight for not so cheap price since we needed a visa to travel to spain their mobile app to checkin online did not work for us. so from edinburgh to barcelona i printed my boarding pass and asked them what should we do on our way back since the app did not work and we may not have access to a printer on our way back they said since the app did not work for us it would be ok and they will print a boarding pass for us free of charge at barcelona. of course they didnt and charged us 30 euros for a piece of paper. they dont have a decent customer service even for payment and we had to stay in a long queue for nearly an hour. they claim to be cheap but i dont consider 300 per person for 130 hrs flight cheap. anyways i will avoid them if i can. nuremberg to london stansted. watch out for ill bring your change later scam. this is the second time recently that a ryanair steward has claimed not to have any change when selling me food andor drink. he promised to bring it once he got some change and i reminded him a few times but still he didnt. the first time this happened to me i was obliged to let it go. the second time yesterday i went and found my steward just before we started landing and asked him to go now and get me my change. he blushed and did so. it wasnt much one euro but each euro pocketed is a euro stolen  from ryanair from me the passenger  oh and a percentage from the taxman too.  but right in front of your seat there is a notice saying that every sale will be accompanied by a receipt. i didnt get one  or think to ask for it. thats how they get away with it. always demand your receipt on ryanair even if its only for a couple of quid. generally i dont expect much from ryanair. however when travelling on a flight from cork to stansted london last week i came across the most disinterested rude and incompetent air hostess ive ever had the displeasure of witnessing. not only did she not greet anyone she was rolling her eyes throughout the safety demonstration she was performing  the only thing she was demonstrating was how bored she was however the cherry on top was that she broke a bag she broke the handle off a bag when closing the over head bin picked it up from the floor and shoved it back in beside the bag as if nothing had happened i was outraged and i wasnt the only one. so what is the procedure when a member of staff breaks a passengers suitcase hide the evidence and hope nobody notices the only brief moment this woman cracked a smile was when everyone was getting off the plane and she was glad to see the back of them. so unprofessional to say the least mad to palermo with ryanair. seasonal summer flight. many people bought priority boarding service making priority boarding as crowded as normal boarding. plane was delayed for 30 minutes but somehow arrived only 15 minutes late. baggage was delivered fast. no complaint on this lowcost carrier.    seville to dublin with ryanair. loud creaking noises from overhead luggage bin on take off. following by 3 hours of cold air blowing directly on my head. i was seated in aisle seat 11d. my wife was seated in 11e. reported issues to cabin crew repeatidly by myself and a lady passenger in our same row in seat 11f. crew requested pilot to turn up temp in cabin 3 times. no concern expressed by crew regarding noises. cabin became too hot after 3rd request by crew to pilot but cold air continued to blow from overhead. crew did not at any point check back with me to see if matters improved. i suffered severe headaches after landing.  we were contacted by ryanair at 1am with news that our flight from alicante to birmingham was cancelled due to french air controller strike. despite given a helpline number we were unable to get through. the information at the airport was poor. a queue of about 100 people with 2 people on the desk. people had been in the queue for over 3 hours. seats were not available for at least 6 days. on our return information and support from the helpline was very poor . we wont be flying ryanair again. flew edinburgh to brussels. this airlines business model is essentially as long as its cheap they will buy it no matter how badly we treat them. if you find a really cheap flight with ryanair go for it but just beware that if you try to change anything their customer services will not be helpful in any way or polite. the gates they get are always on the edges of the airport and they do not give you water on the plane if you ask for it. you have to buy bottled water. every other airline i have flown gives you a cup of water. you will be charged for anything extra and it isnt cheap for the extra stuff which includes suitcases. if you need to take suitcases just take easyjet or another not budget airline. it might end up only being slightly more expensive and you will actually get treated well.    the flight from berlin to east midland airports was on time. this is the first time i have flown with ryanair and i paid for business plus which was a total waste of money. i was expecting what they advertised priority boarding no hassle on checkingin lugagge and security. in fact i was had to queue up like usual to check in luggage i did jump to their so called businessplus counter to ask where to check in staff asked me to stay back and wait and nothing happened. when i was about to go into the priority boarding area staff stopped me and asked me loudly you have priority when the bus came and we are about to board priority staff again stopped me and asked me again are you in priority i did have priority boarding but not on the plane but only on the bus that transported us to board the plane. so when boarding the plane we still boarded as usual in a long queue. the seat onboard is normal and i was sitting in the front row near an aisle which was really annoying as the corridor was so small and people kept going to the toilet located just in front of my seat and therefore i could not enjoy the long leg room as the space is just too small. overall ryanair is economical to fly with but remember dont waste money on upgrading especially business plus which is a totally waste of money. from my experience you dont get priority on luggage checking in security boarding and thus it is just a money rip off.     malaga to manchester on ryanair. unhappy with the customer service and attitude of the staff. when my flight was cancelled i was surprised with the lack of empathy and assistance that ryanair staff offered. they did organise an alternative flight however ignored my friend and i on numerous occasions sent us running around the airport looking for our luggage without direction shouted at other flyers whilst they were attempting to organise their return did not offer food and drinks vouchers and were just unhelpful. our luggage was left abandoned in arrivals with no supervision whilst other desks were manned. it was a very scary experience for me never having a flight cancelled before. on my rescheduled flight boarding was delayed by 40 minutes as the check in staff did not offer hand luggage to be stored in the hold and the flight staff again looked very unhappy in their job resulting in a very depressing flight home. i expect better and would reconsider flying with them again. luton to gran canaria with ryanair. this is the worst airline i have ever flown with. changing flights online is near impossible and their customer service calls cut out half way through on 4 occasions. the staff are generally unhelpful and rude. the worst flying experience ever. even if i could say i paid peanuts it would be some sort of justification  but we didnt we paid a competitive price and all the added extras are charged for so it was above competitive rate for a less than budget service. very very poor  absolutely no value in this company. dublin to london gatwick with ryanair for a connecting flight to guernsey. the experience i had was pretty poor when we finally managed to board the plane we were greeted by an overheated claustrophobic cabin. the plane left late which seems to be the norm and we found the experience to be very stressful. this was bad enough but the return journey was worse  we boarded the plane about 5 minutes before the scheduled departure time and eventually departed over an hour late no apology or explanation as to why. the consequence was that we were 2 hours late returning to dublin and missed our prebooked transport to cork and had to wait an hour for another connection. i am annoyed about this mainly because as i have stated there was no apology or explanation as to the delay needless to say i wont be using this airline again. i read some poor reviews of ryanair before my trip but i didnt pay much attention to them. i wish i would have. i will never fly ryanair again. we had three flights  dublin to paris paris to shannon and shannon to gatwick. every flight was terrible. the staff were rude and  very unhelpful  especially the check in staff. the flights were all delayed planes were dirty and seats uncomfortable  they were more concerned about selling raffle tickets than attending to passengers.  it didnt even end up being that much cheaper to fly ryanair than our other options anyway because you have to pay for each seat and each bag that you check. it was a terrible experience that i will never repeat. we flew from london to copenhagen with ryanair flight could not depart on time from london because of different excuses ryanair pilot kept announcing on the plane. first it was bad weather ten minutes later another plane had an emergency landing and we could not leave yet. next we were waiting for airport clearance so about one hour later we were finally in the air. while in the air i asked ryanair personnel what can i do about my connection because we will arrive late. all they could do is tell me it is not their fault we will be late and they cannot call the other airline to announce that we are running late. they did not care what would happen to us. they also told me to go to their ryanair office in the airport to sees if they can help. when we arrived at the airport we found out ryanair does not have an office in the copenhagen airport so we were left in the airport with no help. i will never recommend this airline to anyone.    athens to mykonos. im the not the type to write reviews good or bad but after being conned into using ryanair i had no choice. this airline will nickel and dime you to death. that is where they make their money. the fees they charge for checking in and overweight bags are astronomical more than my flight cost. they only allow 15kg for bags. 18 euro charge per kg overweight check in fee of 55 euro.  do not be fooled by the cheapflight cost.    barcelona to rome. take note of checking in online prior to your flight else you have to pay an arm an leg to get your boarding pass printed at the check in counter which was expected of a normal airline check in. to make the situation worse\\xa0the 45 euro  pax penalty was not stated during the purchasing process or on our etickets. after queuing for almost an hour at the check in line of ryanair  we were slapped in the face by an impatient check in officer who just rolled her eyes and\\xa0 said that sorry the online check in just ckosed 2mins ago. and rudely shooed us to the other counter to make payment as she hurried to attend another customer. she said no payment no boarding and just shrugged her shoulders. to rub salt in the wound we were told we could have checked in while waiting in the queue. how would we have known when there was no signage whatsoever while we were queuing. at the payment counter there was another 20 mins queue with more than 30 other passengers paying their penalty. what a great way to easily earn a few thousand extra euro per flight.  anyone who travels will agree that wifi can be inconsistent and even unavailable for a period in a foreign country. after boarding flight was dirty with food bits and paper on the cabin floor. one of the worst flight experience in my 20 years of flying.     the plane was very dirty with crumbswrapping on seat and floor. im sure this is due to the 2 hour delay for boarding and turn around time. captain made paregulationrestrictions would not allow us to push back for 45 minutes crew laughed at this pa. this seems like more than enough time to clean a plane. female crew in the aft of the plane giggling through their safety demos looking behind at the other female crew and making jokes. a lady pressed the call bell and i could see the crew ignoring it and eating crisps instead. what if its a medical emergency when she finally came to check she was still chewing. crew were running through the cabin with scratch cards laughing at 1am. no hot food no tea available. the crew found this hilarious and kept laughing when people complained. it took 1 hour to get to row 25 with a drinks cart. the crew kept using the call bells during service even though people wanted to sleep. one female crew could not even form a sentence toward the end of the flight. during all her landing pas she was laughing. she had to stop and start two safety pas because she could not stop laughing. all the crew were having a fantastic evening. the customers however after 3 hour delay and terrible customer service were not. then as we left the plane the crew didnt even look up or smile. we were a total inconvenience.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n brussel to berlin schonefeld with ryanair. this is one of the cheapest airlines i have ever seen. for a 1 hour flight it was so worth the money didnt have to wait too long. cabin crew seemed slightly annoyed i am not sure why. seat was fine i am a tall person so legroom would mostly be a problem but i had just enough legroom so that was great. food and drinks were expensive although the coffee is reasonable. there was no in flight entertainment and no wifi but i didnt need those things because it was a short flight. flew from manchester to barcelona. due to travel back with ryanair tomorrow morning but received a text at dinner stating flight has been cancelled. no flights available with them for the 3 consecutive days ive checked i run my own business as does my partner. now searching airlines to get home on wednesday and not tuesday. thats 2 days worth of clients let down.   flew from thessaloniki to stansted. we had already taken the time out of our holiday to checkin online for our return flight and print off our boarding passes. but we had 1 hold bag to drop off which we assumed would be a simple bag drop at the airport. we were wrong. we had to queue for an hour to check this bag in as there were only 2 desks checking in all ryanair flights at the airport. we should not have had to queue at the check in desk to drop a bag when we had already completed our online check in. to our horror we then had to queue for another hour to drop the bag as the airport doesnt take your bag from the check in desk to the plane on the usual belts but thats not the airlines fault. there were two further queues at the gate to board the plane. with all the time wasted we had no time left to get our evening meal we had allowed a generous 3 hours before our flight but it was not enough time. so we were relying on the cabin food once onboard. but they had run out of everything. only a few pain au chocolat crisps and coffees were left to share around all passengers onboard. i felt as though we werent paying customers but instead should be grateful for the disgraceful service we did receive. it was an incredibly stressful experience and i will not fly with this airline again if i can help it.    first time i have been on a ryanair flight flying from nuremberg to london stansted. departure in nue always is nice as the terminal is small and the ways short. as we had cabin baggage only i cant rate ground handling of ryanair in nue. the boarding for ryanair is always efficient. i had to drop my trolley at the aircraft due to full cabin which was a bit annoying. since you have seats assigned boarding is absolutely comparable to any other airline. once in the cabin you need to get used to the strong colors. the seats are absolutely sufficient for the 15 hours to stn. announcements had been in clear and understandable english. takeoff was ontime and the flight to stn was absolutely smooth with a safe landing in stn. as usual there is service against charge onboard as well as duty free. after landing the baggage was available at the baggage claim immediately and we left stn approx. 25 minutes after landing. flight back to nue was comparable. the crews on both flights were very nice the time you saw them. ryanair is a great and safe way to fly. malaga to london stansted with ryanair. the plane had not been cleaned  immediate strong smell and faulty toilet on entering the plane. the floor of the plane was littered from its previous flight. cabin crew asked cleaners to come on but none came into the plane and it was not cleaned. passengers sitting nearest to the offending wc were advised it had been flushed out and would be ok though the strong and unpleasant smell persisted throughout the flight. cabin crew urged us to sympathise as they were having to work with the smell. they confirmed the state of the plane would be reported by them on landing. i doubt that ryanair will respond. the crew members confirmed that ryanair could be contacted about the uncomfortable flight but said ryanair wouldnt do anything.    my wife and two children missed a ryanair flight to stockholm stavsta from stansted after the baggage check in was slow. they joined the baggage queue 110 mins before take off. not enough check in staff. no sense of urgency apparent. she complained and was asked to pay again. the whole family is very well travelled and have never missed a flight before. we lived in nigeria for several years and experienced many african airports. even before getting to ryanair check in i was shocked. the toilets and the chaos  fly ryanair again no. stansted again no. fuerteventura to glasgow prestwick with ryanair. they claim to be a cheap and cheerful airline until they hit you with all there add ons and not so cheerful staff. on our flight home we queued at our boarding gate for 40 minutes which i assumed was because the aircraft would be getting cleaned from the flight that had just arrived. but no there was crumbs and sweet wrappers all over the floor. aswell as the staff ignoring the mess on the floor another member dropped rubbish off one of the trollies and just left it then continued to step over it every time she walked up and down  pure laziness. staff werent very welcoming at all never smiled and everything seemed like a struggle. wasnt happy at all with this flight and as this is the first time i have flown with ryanair it is very unlikely i would fly with them again. travelled with ryanair from murcia to luton on 29 september and went through security etc. the plane was rerouted to depart from alicante and we were told to go outside and wait for buses to take us there. no explanation was given. some time later i did receive an email from ryanair telling me the flight would now depart from alicante at 12 midnight instead of the original 21.55pm from murcia. we were not provided any proper instructions or checks and we waited a considerable amount of time for just one bus to arrive and then it was a free for all to get on the bus. some time later another two buses arrived and we were driven to alicante airport. we had to go through security yet again and the flight eventually took off at 12.40am. the crew were very grumpy and didnt really want to serve you. in fact you felt that it was your fault the plane was delayed. we understand things happen and changes need to be made but keeping your customers properly informed should be your priority. london luton to murcia with ryanair. the quality of service received was what we expected. we paid bucket shop prices and got bucket shop service so no surprises there. the company mantra has always been you get what you pay for so dont moan. however my complaint is about the way ryanair treats its customers in that they dont provide accurate information in most cases no information on delays corral them like cattle and make them wait for very long periods outside in the rain return flight from murcia with no regard for our well being. ryanair has been a very successful airline mainly because of ticket price but as the number of people travelling abroad is slowing down they may want to pay a little more attention to customer care if they want to maintain or improve market share. price is now no longer enough. cork to stansted. regular traveller with ryanair not so much by choice but they are only airline going to stansted which is near where i work. i have found nothing different about ryanair since their effort to be more friendly according to their ads. the staff on the plane are generally unhelpful and unfriendly the staff on the ground are the same and you can add look disinterested. i have been a regular traveller for 18 years and i will try to be impartial so i must say they are generally on time. apart from that one fact which is important they are a disaster as a service and god help you if anything goes wrong ie lose your ticket passport etc or have a query. you will be referred to the website by the person on the ground and when you get on there you can talk to an agent on their webchat. i have done this a number of times and nothing ever gets resolved you go round and round in circles. i recently had my passport stolen and did not realise this until i got to the airport. i saw the ryanair help desk and it was like talking to a brick wall  no facial expression not a care or desire to help. i had my irish driving licence with photo id and my address on the card but they said it needs to be a passport which they know i had stolen. i said you can check on my ryanair account which shows clearly when logged in i had 4 other flights booked in the next 2 months plus the previous 100 taken in last 2 years again just a sigh and no help. i feel that the staff really do need to be recruited better and trained to help and find a way to express themselves. you do not even need a passort to fly from uk to ireland so what was the problem i ended up catching an aer lingus flight back from heathrow to cork and what a treat that was  a far cry from ryanair in every detail such a professional outfit. i tried again to contact ryanair when back for my next flight to uk but their chat line  phone and email to which i had no response was unsatisfactory and no help whatsoever. portobarcelona. landing was very rough and it seems to be a regular occurence every time ive flown this airline. seats very stiff and uncomfortable with no neck support but i suppose thats what you get for the price. most annoyingly i paid to check a suitcase and it came out with zipper damaged and lock missing but i only noticed when i got to my final destination so couldnt file a claim. considering this it was very poor value for money.    worst flight flying back to glasgow prestwick from murcia with ryanair. they never restocked anything no coffee tea etc.. staff grumpy and just grunted not the best english. very disappointed. there was no where for a magazine or a sick bag to be stored and the plane was dirty. you would be better paying the extra for better service with drinks included ie ba.  cork to lanzarote. i am writing a review on behalf of my partially sighted 76 year old mother who flew alone on flight fr9943 from cork to lanzarote on the 8th of sept. 2016 to meet other family members who were already holidaying there. my mother who also suffers from a chronic back problem can not walk quickly nor can she walk long distances requested wheelchair assistance and a person to walk her on to the aircraft to find her seat as she is incapable of reading seat numbers due to her sight. all this information is clearly stated on the boarding pass. easy simple wouldnt you think not so for ryanair my mother was wheeled to the departure gate area and left there. eventually after a period of time she managed to make her own way to the departure desk to inquire what was going on. the person there literally man handled my mother and ran her down the gangway onto the aircraft dropped her luggage on to a seat and left just as the flight was about to leave. there was not one member of cabin crew helped my mother other passengers on the flight helped her to find her seat she put her luggage on the floor as she would be totally unable to put it in the overhead locker. as any traveller would image a very uncomfortable 4 hour flight with luggage taking up the small space where your feet should be. on arrival at lanzarote she and another passenger with need of assistance were left waiting at the exit door of the aircraft for a very long time i dont know exactly how long but it was certainly long enough for family to start worrying and try to find her afraid that they had somehow miss her. my mother was so upset with all she went through that she could not even 2 days into her holiday relax and enjoy herself. her flight home was changed by family an added unexpected expense to a different airline only then did she begin to enjoy herself. ryanair shame on you.    ibiza to bologna. cheap for a reason if anything goes wrong they will charge huge fees and then if you try and complaint to get a refund they are unreachable. we had a printed boarding pass and it was fine right up until entry to the plane where apparently a new booking was made and we had to pay a 45 euro check in fee and then to get refund later. good in theory but try even contact anyone in ryanair its impossible. do not use this airline.    flew dublin to amsterdam with ryanair. after being left standing on the tarmac in the cold for well over half an hour with no information forthcoming as to why we were not being boarded onto the aircraft standing right in front of us we were herded back into the terminal boarding area now full with passengers for the following flight and told that we would all have to be checked in again. no apology no explanation nothing. some 30 minutes later we were boarded onto a different plane which stood on the tarmac for at least another 45 minutes waiting for refueling. apparently the first aircraft had too much fuel on board and the second not enough. adding insult to injury our vegetarian panini was full of bacon and the replacement we were given after complaint was best before september 2016. again no apology from the surly hostess who threw 5 euro at us when we showed her the date of expiration had passed. we made our connection to abu dhabi with five minutes to spare sweating profusely from the sprint through amsterdam airport. my wife and i have just returned from tenerife after 1 weeks holiday. on the outward flight my wife asked for a cup of tea only to be told that they only had coffee left. there were no inflight snack magazines in place for people to look at all we had were adverts stuck to the back of all seats which said that there were hot beverages available. on the homeward flight you could have any hot drink you wanted as long as it was coffee with out milk or sugar my wife asked for a bottle water so she could take her tablets and she was charged 3.50 euros for a bottle that only costs 1 euro to buy in the airport. it is awful that when the plane lands at its destination that they do not request a restock of items that they are low on. copenhagen to edinburgh with ryanair. absolutely appalled. have been sat in edinburgh airport for 40 minutes waiting for my hand luggage that was stowed under the plane despite the face there was ample room on the flight. i have missed 2 trains. all because my standard sized hand luggage not allowed on the aircraft incredibly frustrated. london stansted to tallinn with ryanair. absolutely one of the worst airlines on the planet. dont be fooled by the initial cheap fares. they add charges for everything printing your ticket baggage checkin meals drinks choosing your seat etc. traveling around i did not have access to a printer. at the airport they charged me 15 euro just to print the boarding pass which i had to do myself. so that is charging me 15 euro for me to touch their screen a few times and use a small piece of their paper this and everything else is pure extortion. even on the flight you are constantly harassed to buy things. there is no doubt that you are seen as a moneymaking opportunity and not as a person or valued client. the crew are friendly but not the ground staff and their system is cumbersome and disorganised. i vow never to fly ryanair again. id rather pay a higher fare with another airline and get good service which in the end is not much more expensive anyway when one considers all the additional charges. bergerac to stansted. just come off a particularly unpleasant ryanair flight where for the entire 1 hour and 20 minutes my wife and i were subjected to an all pervading smell of vomit. when initially challenged the cabin crew claimed to know nothing about this although we were offered a move to the row of sets in front of us which was empty despite an otherwise full flight and from whence the smell seemed to be emanating. interestingly when we raised the issue of the foul smell with a different member of crew on leaving the plane we were told that we had been offered a move and that there was a limited amount they could do to clean up vomit so despite the initial denial of knowledge the crew were well aware of the unpleasant conditions in which we had been expected to travel. i am well aware that ryanair is a budget airline and am generally happy to accept that but do think they need to adhere to basic levels of cleanliness and be honest with passengers which sadly wasnt the case today.    stansted to poznaÅ with ryanair. i usually pick ryanair cause i truly hate flying from luton airport. i flew many times with ryanair and what i can tell is that they have very good ground service. quick checkin possibility of having eboarding pass much more useful when you dont have a printer  1010. what always happens fir me with ryanair in stansted is delays. on my most recent flight with ryanair everything was perfectly on time. boarding was quick no problems. i was sitting at the front of aircraft  seat 07c  first from the aisle. i would never ever do that again. i would rather pay extra money to sit next to the window than 50 cm away from nonstop walking cabin staff. i know they are cheap airline but 15 hrs of nonstop walking and talking passengers selling charity coupons duty free stuff food & drinks are tiring when you just want to rest a little. ryanair is worth travelling with best choice to travel around europe for small amount of money.   im pretty amazed by the positive comments for ryanair. i was flying with them last week from malaga to palma de mallorca after many years avoiding them. im not criticizing this company but it is obvious that is a low cost company without any kind of comfort for the customer. i have experienced long lines in order to access the plane and have a place to store your luggage  it doesnt matter if you have assigned seat. passengers have to stand more than 45 minutes before the call to board and even after this they made us to wait other 30 minutes before entry to the plane. once inside there is a big rush of people trying to put their luggage in rack without any consideration for the next passenger. staff quite overtaken by this and during the flight only bother to sell food drinks lottery tickets and perfume. our flight had 1 hour delay. seats are quite uncomfortable. all in all they transfer you from a to b in the most basic fashion.    absolute worst airline. i made the mistake of booking 3 trips with this airline. 2 of my trips were canceled by the airline leaving me stranded in paris and greece with no help at all and leaving me with a bill of 450 that they would not reimburse. the one trip from dublin to copenhagen that i did make it to my destination on we were delayed by over 1 12 hours. cabin crew were rude. i have nothing good to say about ryanair and will never fly with them again no matter how cheap their prices are. i have flown other budget airlines with no issues and enjoy most all of my experiences with them but ryanair takes cheap to an unbelievable level and i guess you get what you pay for. budapest to manchester. ryanair is awful. im currently stood waiting for boarding in what can only be described as a glorified shed in budapest airport. its 5c and there are no seats on my flight there are pregnant women and families with young children. i can just about accept that ryanair has a purpose as a no frill carrier but this is very poor. ive been in the aforementioned shed for 20mins now who knows when ill be able to have an uncomfortable seat in bright yellow surroundings    flew ryanair from faro to edinburgh. not as bad as the outbound experience but still left 40 minutes late in faro as we missed our departure slot due to boarding the aircraft late. i later found out that it was the aircrafts first flight that day so dont really understand what could of caused the late boarding. if the first flight of the day for the aircraft was in the afternoon cabin crew were distinctly average with odd deminers. plane arrived in edinburgh 20 minutes late pilot and first officer were informative.    edinburgh to faro. checked in online so upon arrival at the airport proceeded straight to the gate to find that just under half the flight had also purchased priority boarding so that pretty much defeats the point of the perk we were then made to queue outside for 20 minutes until the aircraft was ready  bearing in mind its january and were in scotland it was freezing. once i boarded the aircraft one of the flight attendants commented on how cold my hands were which was bizarre as the only reason i was that cold was due to the airline that they were representing. the flight also almost ran out of food and they flight attendants couldnt of cared less it felt like they just wanted to finish their shift and get home. we missed our departure slot at edinburgh which was slightly frustrating as we were standing in the cold outside the aircraft for so long  but the informative captain got us there only 5 minutes later than scheduled it made me laugh however when they thanked us for choosing ryanair because in actual fact we did not have a choice for our dates of travel. overall i just did not feel as well looked after as i continually do on their rivals easyjet. on the whole the flight from manchester to berlin was good nothing to complain about there. i have a nut allergy and according to sources on the internet the best thing to do given ryanairs limited advice on it is to inform the cabin crew upon arrival. then they should make an anouncement about the nut allergy and also stop selling nuts inflight. however this was not the case after telling the cabin crew about my allergy they proceeded to do absolutely nothing. about halfway through the flight i was even asked if i would like to purchase some peanuts.    ponta delgada to lisbon. there are many factors that contribute to a satisfactory journey and unfortunately not all the expectancies were met for this flight. lets start with the positive side and then see what was wrong and could be improved. the value for money was great just 15 euros for a 2hourflight. i would never had booked this journey without getting a similar fare. it makes all the difference. now its time to see what could be improved. ground handling below the standards. the incoming flight was delayed so they decided to start boarding when the plane arrived at the stand. that added more delay and resulted in a slot loss and in a 30minutedelayed departure that could problably had been partially avoided with a better coordination. the flight time was shorter than scheduled so that we catched up the delay and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule. the onboard experience was good and being asked to move to a vacant seat in the emergency exit row gave some rest to my long legs. awesome isnt it negative score to the bar service the food products we selected were unavailable and that was a pity. i dont mind having a snack or to dine on board instead of doing it at the airport but with no guarantees about the products available ill start to consider the airport bars when flying with ryanair. at least i can find more options and make my own selection.    lisbon to ponta delgada with ryanair. standard flight with nothing impressive and nothing too bad just a 2hour 15 minute flight experience in a ryanair middle seat that sounded to me like being packed as a bombonniÃ¨re. great landing despite the strong wind gusts. arrival 8 minutes behind schedule acceptable for a late evening flight. anonymous cabin crew. great value for money only 15 euros with a reservation made 3 weeks in advance. no frills airline but made a new journey possible.\\r\\r\\n    dublin to manchester. awful. usually fly on alternative airline on this route but booked late and this was cheaper. you get what you pay for cabin dirty and unacceptable. flight was 1 hour late and not a single employee not ground staff cabin or cockpit crew apologised for the delay which im sure comes from senior management. manners cost nothing. never again    santorini to athens. we had a flight at 730pm which was delayed for two hours due to what they called bad weather. olympic air had a flight at the same time and they were able to fly. after waiting two hours they had everyone go through the security line again and then to find out the flight was cancelled. due to this flight being cancel we couldnt make it to our flight from athens back to the united states. the only thing ryanair could due was provide hotel for the night. we couldnt make it to our flight and had to purchase new tickets back home which was expensive never flying ryanair again.    liverpool to alicante on fr9886. after boarding the plane at approximately 6.45am my wife and i both noticed that some of the passengers had brought onboard their own cans of beer and were starting to drink even before we took off. throughout the flight the cabin staff were serving them alchohol even up to about half an hour before landing. they were very noisy using bad language and generally causing a nuisance to other passengers. we certainly wont be using ryanair again.    memmingnem to stansted. ryanair bag drop at stansted was very stressful. not so much bag drop as bag wait around faff about with printing your own luggage labels whilst in a busy confined area trying to manage 3 children. very stressful. food quite pricey on flight 3â¬ for a cup of teacoffee. stansted airport was awful too overcrowded nowhere to sit not many toilets. air crew on outward bound flight were not that friendly. much nicer on return flight though.    flew ryanair from bucharest to timisoara. cheap flights but services are definitely not the best. lots of flight delays announced at the lastminute because of the fact that the flights are over booked the hand luggage had to be moved to the aircraft deposit so at the end we have to waste extra time that we shouldnt have considering only a hand luggage. the trip delay caused damages to my business schedule which is not the first time.    flew from stansted to fez. ryanair did what it said on the tin and i got what i paid for. we were delayed 30 mins outbound and on time inbound. cabin crew on outbound were ok but not going as far as giving a smile on return the cabin crew seemed to be partying in the galley they were the noisiest bunch ever slamming and banging and laughed raucously until it came to serving customers then they went back to their stale faced selves. if you are over 5 ft 10 seating will be painful for flights over 3hrs. will use again purely for price but wouldnt do a long flight.    eindhoven to lisbon. we checked in 4 days ahead of our flight which is the max possible and they split me and my girlfriend while the plane was empty. then they charge 10â¬ extra to sit next to each other while other seats where 4â¬. i had to place my hand luggage under my seat while the luggage compartment was empty. also totally rude stewardess.     stansted to rome. terrible experience. i know it is a budget airline and so have little expectation for amenities and service which is fine but what i wasnt impressed at all is the lack of transparency in whats required. myself & my partner were almost charged extra 50 euros each as we didnt know you had to print out the boarding pass ourselves. luckily the lady at the desk found us a different solution and printed our boarding passes. this should be made clear not in small print. if there are extra charges for such thing do make it clear as clickable option like airasia do.  i am quite put off to book ryanair again.    edinburgh to barcelona. one person tells us we dont need our boarding passes printed so we went and waited in the gate line when we got to the front another individual said they needed to be printed and therefore we had to wait till the end of the line. this now left no room for our carry on bags. additionally the gate number showed up and by the time we arrived at the gate leaving immediately after seeing the gate they were already doing final call with many people having no idea what proper line they were supposed to be in. they are unprepared and overall messy.    flew from edinburgh to vigo. ryanair were responsible for my wife and i being separated they tried to hold our seats to ransom unless we paid 20 extra each way for allocated seating which we refused on principle. as a consequence we were allocated random seats. the craziest thing is my wife found herself sitting in the middle seat between a husband and wife who were also allocated random seat numbers. anyway we got our revenge by frequently wandering up and down the plane to speak thereby causing delays to the cabin trolley service. i suggest others should do likewise until this policy is binned.     flew ryanair from london stansted to krakow. ryanair started a random seat allocation scam even if you book tickets together. they make sure people traveling together dont sit next to each other until they have paid an extra fee. everyone around me had the same experience. miserable staff. only flew them out of the desperation because no other flight was available. avoid if you can.    i was found absolutely mortified when coming back from my holiday flying with ryanair. the plane was hectic and had many difficult passengers onboard for the cabin crew members. me and my sister paid for allocated seating going and coming back from bristol to malaga which cost us 20 in total which we didnt mind because we knew wed be sat next to each other. once we sat down we found it quite disrespectful to see passengers moving their loved ones next to the empty seats next to them and the crew allowing them to do so and it wasnt just the one it was several. the flight finally departed and we was in the air ten minutes in a cabin crew member came up to us and asked if we would be separated for the flight for a lady that wasnt very well when i explained that we had paid for these seats and many others hadnt but moved her response was roll of the eyes and stormed off. after that she was cold with us all flight and went straight past with the drinks trolley without even asking us its made me not want to book with this airline again if thats how staff treat their passengers.    outrageous  excessive charge just to check in at the airport. fifty euros each  100 euros to check in for the flight  that we had already paid for  through online booking. a friend of mine and i booked a reservation on flt # fr6332 from barcelona to santiago de compustelo  approximately a 1 hour flight. after waiting in the check in line for 20 minutes the agent informed us we would have to pay a fee of fifty 50 euros each  just to check in for the flight in addition to the fee for the flight which we had already paid. along with some 40 or more other passengers we all had to go to a different location wait in line again and pay the fee in addition to 35 euros each for our checked bag  a total of 85 euros each which was in addition to the cost of the flight. ryanair advertises themselves as the low fare airline. what a lie there was no argument no one to hear our complaint and it is impossible to reach them by phone.     i have just done my check in and to my surprise me and my boyfriend were allocated separate middle seats 6 rows apart from each other. this has never happened before when doing check in. now if we would like to sit next to each other we need to pay 9 for reallocating one of us. im shocked how low ryanair has fallen and with all honesty i can say this is the worst airline i have flown. i was a regular client of theirs but from this day i will definitely switch to easyjet or wizz air.     flew from colognebonn to berlin. absolute bargain at 12.98 euros one way. since i went for the low price i didnt want to add any extras so no reserved seat. its irritating how ryanair keeps pushing you to buy a seat or maybe you wont sit together. on the outbound flight the computer put as together at an a and bseat but on our way back we were punished for not buying our seats my wife and i were seperated about 15 rows and put both in a bseat. why is a mystery since there were enough seats next to each other and the cabin crew allowed me to join my wife. i would suggest that ryanair stops this mocking of passengers. apart from that a flawless efficient flight with not too friendly crews but it gets you form a to b for a really low priceso in that regard they keep their promise. i even noticed more legroom thans to new seats.   i booked tickets from stansted to valencia for me and my partner at the same time. the latest money grabbing trick by ryanair is to seat a couple at the furthest ends of the plane from each other even when the plane has 90 empty seats so that if you want to sit together you have to pay to allocate a seat  i have got to say i have been waiting years for them to work this one out  so predictable. this now goes beyond cheeky and is into the realm of despicable behaviour. seats have always been filled on a first come first served basis until now so it is clear that this is done on purpose so as to generate more profit. but do you know what this profit is not going to be coming from me as i vow never to fly ryanair again. i am a very regular flyer who tends to sway towards budget airlines so easyjet will be seeing much more business from me in future unless they try the same filthy trick as ryanair.\\r\\r\\n    edinburgh to dublin. nothing but grief and trouble from the start  extras for everything. we are pensioners not geeks and the company refused to help stating do it online. very rude staff at dublin airport and in several poor english skills. we were so traumatised by the whole event we return with another airline. you cant say you get what you pay for because its not much to start with. never use them they must hand pick the rudest staff in the country.    have flown with ryanair a few times at this stage and from now onwards will try to avoid them at all costs as they are probably the worst airline after united. they come across as a low cost airline but they make up for it in as many ways as possible. if you want checked baggage it is an addition a fee of approx â¬35 each way for a 15kg bag if you dont have a boarding pass before arriving to the airport they will charge â¬50 to print each one and their latest trick is to try and get people to pay for their desired seat allocation. if you dont want to pay for your seat allocation they will purposely split you up myself and my partner were about 10 rows apart on our way to palermo and back from dublin. we know there were many others in the same situation including families with children. on my return flight i even had a free seat next to me. seats dont recline on the planes and there are zero complimentary refreshments including basics like water. if youre flying from ireland just pay slightly more to fly aer lingus as at least with them what you see is what you get.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n   i implore others to avoid this airline at all costs. do not be swayed by low prices as you would be better off walking to your destination. i have flown many airlines over the past 40 years and the worst experience i have had with an airline goes to ryanair. if i would have been smart enough to read reviews before booking tickets from stansted to edinburgh i am sure i wouldnt be typing a review while on holiday. nickel and dimes are more like 20  100  to ryanair and you will pay or you wont board your flight. no customer service extremely rude employees who would obviously rather be somewhere else.    over thirty minutes late leaving poitiers but arrived at stansted only a few minutes behind schedule. pretty scruffy aircraft obviously the late arrival in poitiers left insufficient time for a thorough clean. aisle seats are not great given the constant movement of trolleys and the inevitable knocks to arms and legs. random seat allocation  this term is somewhat of a misnomer. the only way it is random is that if you dont pay to select a seat before travel you will certainly be allocated seats away from others on your booking. ba despite their recent demise usually have the sense to allocate passengers on the same booking adjacent seats. on this flight we were seated just 15 rows apart. from the comments of other passengers and on social media this really must be considered an âown goal by the airline. surely it would be better to increase lead in prices a little and get rid of this ridiculous policy and stop antagonising numerous passengers. until the last couple of months i had been increasingly impressed by ryanairs more customer focussed attempts. in future i will travel with another carrier wherever possible. hopefully the âbean counters at the airline will revert this ridiculous policy\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    sofia to stansted. my first and last flight with this airline. service was dreadful cabin crew could not be bothered serious delay on inbound. they demanded that i must check in my hand luggage which i made sure is within limits but they said that after 90th passenger all luggage must be checked in. the overall service and punctuality was dreadful.    weekend booked with my family allocated different seats round the plane asked if we would like to sit together for extra charge. when we got on the plane i was sitting with a family that were scattered round the plane talked to 2 other familys with the same issue. this would not have annoyed me but i had a free seat beside me my sisters had free seats beside them and also my mother so it looks like we were deliberately seated at each ends of the plane. this isnt such an issue today but i will definitely pay extra to fly with another airline when i bring my children.    we fly a lot. we have flown with the best etihad cathay singapore airlines emirates etc. we have also flown with many budget airlines around the world. we can now say we have flown with what must be the worst airline on earth. we were in the middle of a cruise with no internet. we docked at ibiza and went for a coffee. whilst there we got internet access and received an email from ryanair saying if we didnt check in we could be charged 50 euro each. to our disbelif we tried to check in online but at the final stage we were kicked out of the website. we tried several times. at that time there was a global virus effecting everywhere and our search engine google was not allowing us to access many websites. we were in the ryanair website but could not complete the checkin. we eventually gave up and decided to try later. our next stop was palma where we departed the ship. as we did not have internet access we decided to get to the airport early so we could hopefully complete checkin well before the 2 hour window ryanair gives. we arrived at palma airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our flight. we waiting in the checkin queue for around 25 minutes. when we finally were called we explained to the checkin lady that we could not checkin as their website wold not let us complete the checkin the day before. she then went out of her way to try and check us in on our mobile phone. she gave us the thumbs up but then she must have had the same problem. she tried again but could not check us in on our phone. with 8 minutes before the the 2 hour window she gave up and said sorry you have 8 minutes good luck. we tried but could not check in on time. then we went back to the checkin counter and the lady gave us a docket to go to the service counter to pay the 100 euro 50 x 2. we walked to the service counter and stood in line for another 15 minutes. we paid 100 euro because we had no option. when we originally booked this flight we had other options and wow didnt we regret flying this airline. whilst waiting in the checkin queue and the service counter queue we heard complaint after complaint about the serviceprocedures. when we boarded the plane we saw the seats and could not believe our eyes. the tightest seating i have ever seen including all the asian airlines. scattered crumbs loose hair and rubbish on just about every seat. i brushed the food off our seat and then thought to take a photo. i wished i took the photo before when you view the seat photo the yellow is the head rest of the seat in front. this will show how tight the seats are. the plane looked dirty. as we sat down we heard a lady with a british accent discuss the lack of baggage storage. she had a small bag. the ryanair stewardess said bad luck take your seat. the lady passenger yelled typical ryanair the photos attached show the condition of the plane. the seating stunk worn leather. so on top of an extra 100 euro we flew the longest hour of our lives and were counting the seconds to get off. thankfully there were no more dramas after we landed. do not fly this airline. the response from ryanair was a standard reply and we could tell they did not read our email. now we can brag about the best airlines and the absolute worst  ryanair.    berlin to stansted. we purchased ryan air tickets for this leg of our flight because they had the best price. we bought the tickets several months in advance. fortyeight hours before the flight i got an email saying that we had to precheckin to avoid a 50 euro additional charge. i used my cell phone to go online and do this but when i got to the website i went as far as i could with the precheckin and thought it was done. i clicked on every button that seemed to advance me to the next part and then came to the end. when we got in line to check in we were told to go to another line where we learned that the precheckin never went through so we had to pay an additional 50 euros for each ticket. there were also others in the same line who had the same experience. when we finished the trip i wrote to ryan air about it and got back a curt letter saying there was nothing wrong with their website and that they would not reimburse us. i think this is just a supersneaky way of getting more money out of some customers. so beware   ryanair is the worst airline. they will literally make you pay for everything. i went to rhodes from athens and then athens to santorini with the same carry on and on the way back to athens from santorini staff said that if my carry on does not fit in their thing that measures our bags ill have to pay 60â¬. my carry on was less than 2 kilos. i made it fit and guess what  they didnt have any space in the plane so i had to put it with the checks bags anyways. ridiculous. also if you forget to check in 2 hours before they charge you 60â¬ again to check you in. ive traveled with so many different airlines this one was far the worst one. not recommended.    birmingham to malaga. shocking service. in the airport the displays went from showing the gate number to final boarding with 2 minutes they rushed everyone onto the plane making people leave behind drinks that had been purchased. once on the plane captain announced that they were missing vital paperwork and do we could not take off. after 45 minutes the captain said that the drinks trolley would be coming round if anyone wanted to buy a drink. the plane was very hot and staff unhelpful. when paperwork arrived we were then told there was no flight window and so had to wait another 35 minutes. but they kept the seatbelt sign off do passengers could go to the toilets.    \\r\\r\\nflew ryanair from stansted to rome. terrible from start to finish. split up a family of 4. both ways. with our children both having a spare seat on the way home the flights were delayed both ways by a total of 3 hours. priority boarding was longer than normal boarding. we were normal boarding. the plane was too hot with the air above our heads barely blowing. the seats and floor were dirty with the seat next to my husband covered in melted chocolate. we were so far apart from each other we couldnt see any other member of our family even though my children are not yet 18. they are deliberately splitting people up if they refuse to pay the extra to choose seats. so if you leave it to chance you will be guaranteed to sit apart. they never used to do this so why start now but please do not give in or they will win. the staff were heard talking and they all want to leave and go to other airlines. heartless greedy and cheap.    timisoara to stansted. a star is too much. one of the worst companies to fly with nowadays they intentionally seat families and group separately with the option to pay extra another 1012 to be seated together. there is no such a thing as customer service with ryanair truly recommend to avoid flying with them    girona to stansted. being on beginning of the queue non priority wasnÂ´t allowed to go on board with a small luggage. i complained to the staff and they said that too many people were on priority. they told me really rude that next time i had to buy priority if i didnÂ´t want that to happen. when the flight started more than half of the luggage place on board was empty. i asked the stewardess why that happened and he said that wasnÂ´t their problem and give me no help or answer. will not use or recommend ryanair ever again.   flew ryanair from stockholm to rome. they charge for seat selection and put you as a family in different seats intentionally to force you to pay up. never seen any other airline do that. the flight back home was late because the airplane was had still not arrived to the airport the seats are uncomfortable. in general a low quality airline.    malaga to stansted. after paying gbp190 one hour late to boarding. being taken on a bus to the plane. and drop off next to the gate we have to walk under the rain. asked for a glass of water for my pill and they tell me they dont have water because they dont have ice to cool down the boiling water  joke or what they can spare a bottle of water for individual glasses for costumers  hopefully never again with ryanair.    i was flying from dublin to budapest with my wife but this was the last time we fly with ryanair. we were given 2 middle seats 5 rows away from each other. the seats beside us on the left and on the right were empty but we were still given the seats 5 rows away from each other so we had to pay 11â¬ to seat together. its a shame how ryanair want to make extra profit we never experienced something like this put two people in two diferent seats even if they bought the ticket together and you have lots of seats empty for 2 beside each other.    flew naples to manchester with ryanair. i decided to give this airline another go after a few years of avoiding it. never again theres always a problem. it is not worth save the extra 50. food is awful just eat before. seats terrible small and uncomfortable. refused to check in my suitcase although i had booking confirmation that i had already paid. forced to pay a further 35 to drop my case and told to claim back any bag booked at a later date. spend the extra money and fly elsewhere    flew london stansted to cologne. never ever fly ryanair they never have any staff on duty to help or book you in on time and the ones they do genuinely couldnt care less about you and your journey. shocking customer service. on the outbound flight i arrived 2 hour and 10 mins early and queued in line after checking in online the day before to check my bag. they had only a few members of staff and failed to book us all onto the flight because of lack of staff. i missed my flight. i then had to queue in the customer service line for 2 hours and the response was awful. i was told i had to pay another 100 to be reboarded three days later. apparently it was mine and my fellow stranded passengers fault we missed the plane the plane that left half empty according to my colleagues who were onboard who didnt have to check the company gear. i had to find and pay for another flight to join my colleagues online for the conference for which you will recall i had the gear. oh and did i mention that they lost my passport at the outset when they randomly checked it. my return flight was no better even with priority booking oh yes dont be fooled that means nothing they took my hand luggage away because the flight was full meaning i couldnt do my work and then the flight was delayed by an hour and 20 mins. and guess what there was no one to talk to from ryanair awful    wroclaw to warsaw. the flight experience was overall quite good. we checked in a day before the flight and it turned out that although we had our seats assigned in two diffrent parts of the airplane we were seated in extra legroom seats 1 2 and 16 row and that was a pleasant surprise. i really despise the ryanairs boardnig procedure â the gate opens before even the airplane finishes its previous rotation. it causes a necessity of waiting in the bus which drives you to the aircraft for a long time up to 15 mins even on a domestic flight. the cabin was not fresh but despite that it was quite clean. the flight was smooth and everything went without delay. the thing that made me uncomfortable onboard was the air in the cabin â it smelled as if it was really polluted which made me difficult to breathe. what is more it seemed like the cabin crewâs only duty was to sell foodscratchcardsduty free products to the âcustomersâ. they didnt really care about passenger safety and comfort some safety announcements were only made in polish. to conclude i really appreciate the effort ryanair puts in providing low fares and ontime flights but still they should improve some parts of their service.    flew ryanair from naples to barcelona. lined up at the gate only to wait for over an hour. no explanation as to what was causing the delay. when we got on board we were told the previous crew had gone home and they had to find a backup. plane was very old and uncomfortable. no seat recline bought some inflight drinks and couldnt use credit card as it wasnt european. had to wait another hour for bags at the destination but not sure if thats the airlines fault. in the end arrived over 2.5 hours late.    edinburgh to stansted. if you are looking to fly low cost with your family avoid ryanair. they will give separated seats to all members of your family and then if you want to stay together you would need to pay for the seats which could add up to a lot of money.     manchester to fuerteventura. i paid an additional 26 to sit next to my wife only to find they had split us up again. i contacted ryanair only to be told they were a non refund company and that my only option was to cancel the flight or sit in our seats. we had delays both sides the cabin staff wouldnt take litter off anyone until the end of the flight. i know not all airlines provide complimentary food but i think 13 is ridiculous for a rubbish toasty and a water. it was 4.5 hour flight that was delayed you would think there would be something. overall myself and others we met at the airport have all said we wont be flying with ryanair again. my advice is fork out a few extra quid and not have the first last part of your holiday ruined.    gdansk to bristol. having never flown with ryanair before i assumed it would be similar to other budget airlines i have flown with in the past. i was shocked at the filth i had to sit in on the flight. the seats and carpets were covered in crumbs and all sorts of rubbish. i pulled down the table to discover it was encrusted with food from previous customers and absolutely disgusting. i will never fly with ryanair again. they charge premium prices for the lowest service. im sticking with easyjet.    rome to budapest. one of those airlines that charge very low price but take every penny out of you they can. i travelled with ryanair before and this time they made me pay â¬50 for oversized bag because the type of material my luggage was made hard samsonite ones didnt go through the side size of the measurement compartment they had. i saw the same bag inside the airplane with no oversized ticket on them. i hate this lack of pattern the company puts to get the money out of its clients for non rational reasons as the staff could see that my bag would fit into the measurements but the material wasnt made to be soft or squishy. seriously will avoid this airline from now on.    faro to east midlands. we have 5 people in our party all with hand luggage weve just been told they have to go under the plane in the hold. got on the plane to find out that there was more than enough room in the over head lockers. the worst thing is the fact we have a 4 year old boy with us who obviously wants to be sat next to his mum theyve gave him a seat one side of the isle and his mum a seat the other side. the other 3 passangers which would of liked to be sat together got put in random places on the plane one back one middle and one at the front which i find really annoying because they could put you together but just want more money from you. i will not fly with them because of this reason     edinburgh to faro. as usual ryanair staff show no professionalism no communication not to mention appalling service. passengers stood waiting for 1 hour in a queue to board no explanation but 5 members of ryanair staff chatting and joking in front of an increasingly angry crowd. when will they learn we understand that some issues are outside their personal control but not telling us whats happening while elderly and children become increasingly distressed. as previous encounters another 1* flight.    krakow to rome ciampnio. the flight itself it was usual standard lowcost lack of service and flight arrived on time. i have to complain about 3 things 1 lack of price transparency  it is almost a trap. i chosed a round trip for 86 euro and at the end the final price was 170 euro having to pay 35 euro for registered baggage of 15 kg and for doing the web checkin. 2 badly organized website. i filled in billing address section when i made the ticket thus expecting to get an invoce only to discover later that ryanair does not issue invoices for international flights without vat  something there was no notice about. this caused me a lot of problems. 3 badly handled customer care. i contacted them via live chat to solve problem listed under number 2 and i was promptly dismissed. i could email them i was told. so i did but until now i did not receive any answer.    hamburg to manchester delayed by 45 mins. every time im flying with ryanair its late and things are very unorganised. very disappointed for one more time.  not even worth the cheap flights.    flew ryanair from corfu to stansted. flight was delayed over one hour passengers told to start queuing at least an hour before boarding. predominantly elderly forced to stand for this time. further queue on tarmac as aircraft not ready. speedy boarders ended up boarding after those rushed through a second departure gate and onto the first transit bus. so that was a waste of money. this was not a cheap flight booked because of timing of departure.    stansted to riga. if you do not pay to choose your seats they make sure you are separated from people in your party. they do this so that you pay extra. but i really hope people dont pay as this is typical of the management at ryanair. in flight from stansted to riga the cabin crew announced that the the money from the scratch cards goes to charity. the priority boarding was funny from riga to stansted  they let both queues in at the same time  can you imagine paying to be let onto the plane at the same time.  we all know they are cheap and therefore popular but you are the worst household brand and my least favourite airline.     dublin to stansted. i am not sure there are actually words within the english language to describe how terrible the service this airline provides. they treat their customers like livestock. in fact even livestock do not get treated like this. they cannot even tell the truth regarding what is the situation when things go wrong and have no compassion for human comforts and necessities. i honestly dont know how they continue to thrive in a world where we should be showing corporate responsibility.    manchester to alicante 110 per person return flights with hand luggage. if we wanted hold luggage it was a further 90pp outbound and 80pp inbound.  outbound flight my hand luggage had to be placed in the hold because apparently only 90 bags are allowed in the cabin.  there was plenty space for many other bags in the cabin  strange procedure. outbound flight staff were rude. didnt smile. were not polite and too busy flirting and handing out their number to a group of lads rather than dealing with their other customers. money making scam we would have had to pay a further 27pp on both outbound and inbound to sit together. inbound flight i was row 31 very back and my boyfriend was row 3 front. what would happen if there was a potential emergency all you would want is to be close to your loved ones or the people you have come away with. instead i was sat in the middle and amongst a group of people who didnt know each other. you get what you pay for. yes but i didnt pay a total sum of 220 for terrible customer service real life tinder or to be sat amongst strangers absolutely nothing good to say about ryanair  will be avoiding this airline in the future.   we were told half an hour before we landed that we are goint to trieste as fog was stopping planes to land in zadar. after we were dumped at the airport no one from ryanair contaced us the passingers to let us know what was happening also no food or water was offered.    flew from bristol to palma. completely shocking behaviour sooner that ryanair go out of business the better. couldnt even sit next to my wife and checking in way before although forced to pay more. all cabin staff were on about when selling perfumes etc was that they wanted to meet their targets. no one seems to care less about customers.    paris to porto. even if you want to save money in the end you spend more. from paris the flights go from an airport that takes 2 hours to get to. they dont mention you have to book on line to avoid a 50 euro tax at the airport. they are tight with baggage and they arent around when you need them.  spend 50 more and get a nice flight in a convenient location or even better dont spend more and still get a better flight. i never rate things online but this experience forced me to    glasgow to lisbon. 11 hours waiting on a delay without any explanation in glasgow airport please avoid this airline at all cost. customer services are rude useless and have not providing any information at all rather than delay the flight.     i wanted an affordable plane ticket for a 2hour flight from ibiza to malaga and i came across ryanair. the prices displayed in their or a booking website is just the price of the booking you also need to pay for your luggage seat and online checkin afterwards at a hefty cost that they do not mention before youve made the purchase. their staff was one of the most uncooperative and unprofessional i have come across i very politely confronted one of their staff member regarding the luggage cost and her response was do you want your bags shipped or not. i personally found it extremely shocking and disappointing.     from the plastic seats lottery tickets and cheap perfume to them forcing me to check in my bag this is a bad airline even by low cost standards. i will avoid if there are other options.    ryanair is the worlds worst airline. flew faro to bristol. disorganised poor customer service frequent delays and cancellations. i paid for priority and fast track. did not receive this service. 160 for a name change. absolute rip off. they cant organise a simple holiday planner. avoid at all cost. they are cheap but it will cost you more stress and a lot more money in the long run. our flight was delayed for over an hour. no reason or explination given. treated like animals at the airport. easy jet and flybe are much more reliable and professional. i am a frequent traveller and avoid them at all costs now. i prefer to pay more to travel than fly with his shambles of an airline.    east midlands to dublin. approaching my flight i followed the instructions to board and someone tagged my hand luggage bag after viewing my boarding card with no explanation. i thought this was a mistake so i removed the tag and then was confronted when boarding the plane by two confrontational girls asking me why i removed it. i explained that i didnt want it putting in hold as it had stuff in a needed as hand luggage and was in a rush when arriving in dublin they were rude and and told me i didnt have a choice. this is not acceptable if i wanted my luggage in hold id of booked it in hold. thats the whole point of having hand luggage you have it with you. poor service rude staff and diabolical attitude.    roma to madrid. apart from the fact that i had to pay for one of my check in baggags twice cause i travel with a guitar and they are strict about their oversize policies beware guitarists ryanair is the only airline that is so strict and petty for that matter about oversize luggage  okay it is the policy granted but when the flight turns out to be chaotic overcrowded staff must be overworked or dissatisfied in general because a smile is the last thing you are greeted with and the flight turns out to be so full that your hand luggage ends up being checked in at the gate. you get the feeling like they are strict only about matters that are in ryanairs interest such as those that translate into revenues because the oversize fee wasnt exactly lowcost  it was almost the same price as the flight. all luggage costs in total were the same as what i paid for the flight so i paid double. so much for lowcost. i felt ripped off and also felt the underlying greedy vibe of a company that only uses the lowcost label as a means to market and boost their brand. the only thing low about this company is friendliness legroom. also seems like it targets business people with briefcases or it sets out to favour these rather than guitarists surfers etc travelling the world.  wont be fooled by their flashing marketing campaigns with apparently low prices again.    malaga to amsterdam. terrible service all around. if you dont check in online 2 hours before flight youll be charged 50â¬. for no real reason. no previous notice. just got email few hours in advance. very easy to miss. food is not free and it is of a bad quality. even water is paid. small seats. flight attendants are fine but company rules are strict and stupid.    rome to athens. i have flown on many airlines but this is by far the worst. if you do not have tickets confirmed and printed before 2 hours expect the printing to cost as much as the flight itself. upon going to the gate the people at the ticket desk were randomly telling people their bags were too big and charging them 50 euros to check at the gate. there was no rhyme or reason to it people were selected at random. some had larger bags that were getting through those that were stopped. their comment every time was that you booked a cheap flight what did you expect. do not go with this airlines because although it is cheap when you add up all of their random fees you can get a better flight with someone who is upfront with their charges.    porto to stansted. if you are flying via ryanair with little children please be aware of their scamming operation they say you can take baby equipment safely enclosed in a box or hard case so long as it doesnt exceed 119x119x80cm and a max of 20kg and truly flying out from stansted is fine because that is the rule  however when you come back home its another matter. you are only allowed 1xbaby equipment max of 5kg despite the fact of going out you can have two free baby equipment and we paid for an extra one too. we were charged for having less coming back home as we exceeded the rule. they have a different rule for every country you go to apparently and also they commented that we were yet another of the same case. after having flown with ryanair for the last 14 years with no problems i will never fly with them again. was super stressful with a screaming baby and all     budapest to dublin. i have flown on many different discount airlines both inside the states and outside mainly in europe. ive never had a worse travelling experience than with ryanair. the airline has yet to be on time for flights and for this trip was delayed both ways significantly. an hour sitting on the flight to dublin and already 20 mins to budapest. the attendants are rude and unhelpful and do not provide any useful information. for example telling the cabin the delay is from a attendant who was going home because hes sick instead of the reality that he never showed up which is what was said earlier. it wasnt that only instance where the staff acted errantly. on the way back to budapest my fiance and i got belligerently approached by a staff member who demanded to know why our visa check had not been completed and that she didnt have time to check it herself. even though weve been waiting in the delayed priority line for the plane for 20 mins. i tried to explain to her that the staff we dropped our luggage off with said we had nothing else to do but go to security. finally the website also needs to have a better system of checks when offering other services like car rental. my fiance and i rented and paid for a car in dublin knowing that an extra fee is often charged to people under 25. the site gave no indication that this wasnt taken in account for or that there was an issue with our rental. when we showed up the company would not give us a car and did not offer us a way to contact the airline for a refund. we have yet to get a reply from customer service in their limited and costly to call internationally hours. i will never buy another ticket with this airline again.    rome to tel aviv. we were seated separately and even after a passenger agreed to switch seats with us the air crew prevented it. before boarding the crew was very rude and checked passenger hand baggage for overweight in order to charge extra money. the entire atmosphere was as if the passengers are not customers but a source of money that should be exploited as much as possible.    lanzarote to berlin. upon boarding the pilot announced that the plane is too heavy for the fuel to be enough and so we will have to land in frankfurt to refuel and only then continue to berlin.  an hour delay before departure in lanzarote after boarding. another hour refueling in frankfurt and in total we spent almost 8 hours in the plane for what should have been a 5 hours flight. the plane landed just 15 minutes before the 3 hours delay which would have entitled us for compensation by european law. on the plane we were never offered any kind of complimentary food or drinks. we were not offered water. the toilet door handle broke during flight which made the front toilet unusable until the refuel landing in frankfurt. we wouldve chosen another company if it was possible but theyre the only ones flying direct. i will also mention the flight there from berlin was delayed two hours after boarding.    athens to malta. luggage policy. before if you added after booking the ticket was 20 euro now they put it 40 euro. you pay the luggage and then at the airport for other people they take their luggage for free while we have paid the expensive fee. i booked and while i had the ticket confirmed and in my iphone wallet the system showed my as off the flight and i had to recheck it. while the show the ticket they told me i had to recheck in and while there were 5 min left before the flight was closing the system wouldnt allow me to check in from the app and while i was in the office they told be to pay extra 50 euro because the had to check me in. totally unacceptable cannot be any worse company than ryanair.   passengers travelling with children need to be aware that if you do not pay for seats ryanair will split your family up. i have just checked in for our flight. we really dont care where we sit on the plane but after checkiing in we selected free allocation and were offered window seats 7f 23a and 31f they could not have been anymore far apart. when we looked at the seat map we found that next to each allocated seat were two free seats  how ridiculous and mean is this. i cant have our nine year old sitting at the front of the aircraft in 7f next to a total stranger so we had to pay for one adult to sit next to our son. i believed that it was the law that an airline could not split children up from at least one parent. when your travelling with children and booking a ticket with ryanair you do have to select if your travelling with children. i believed this was to stop the system splitting a child up from at least one of the parents. the child fare is the same price as an adult with ryanair so why do you have confirm one of the passengers in the booking will be a child ryanair this is extremely tacky and obviously a money spin to earn more money. not happy or impressed how you treat families with young children shame on you.    liverpool to barcelona. i travelled with two kids and even though the staff could see me struggling to fold a double buggy whilst carrying a heavy bag and a baby they offered no help or assistance. thankfully other passengers helped me to get on board. when i was on the return flight home same happened didnt even bother to ask. at one point my daughter had dropped some pringles which we paid ridiculous amounts for and a passenger stepped on them so i couldnt pick up the little crumbs.  the crew member walked past and picked up the crisps and muttered other passengers have to board this plane too you know. i just thought how rude and also why do they not clean the aircraft between journeys it was filthy to start with. greasy seats and magazines on the floor just shows you get what you pay for. if the service was better then it would have been full marks also the food is so limited  for vegetarians they have a panini which is always sold out even though ive been like the second customer theyve served on numerous occasions ive been on the flight.     there were many hidden costs and i made a mistake in checking in the return flight before the first flight and had to pay 50â¬ per person i was with my wife so 100â¬. this put a downer on the whole holiday i dont think i will be using ryanair again because even when i explained my mistake the staff just laughed at it and were really blunt and miserable which made me feel even worse   we had a very cheap flight flying ryanair from birmingham to verona but even so the flight crew were not very helpful and actually quite rude the seats were very dirty with rubbish left on the floor and the downside of seat no room in above locker. my bag was way down the cabin from my seat would not be accommodated to sit together even though there was empty seats now i have just heard they are thinking of going on strike on 20th dec thats very nice of them    budapest to stansted. i found this airline the most opportunist of all airlines. for the 15 minutes delay in checkingin they charged me 100 whilst i still have 1 hour 45 minutes to the boarding. i would have rather paid more money at purchase than paying a penalty fee. its just not right.    flight from stansted to berlin 7.50am boarded late not the end of the world but hardly perfect 1hr later still sat on the plane  3 hours later. its snowing nowstill on the plane  captain assures us the runway is open and we will be off momentarily. asks the stewardess for some water to be told i would have to pay despite eu regulation and ryanair website explaining after 2 hours they will feed and hydrate passengers. i was told to get food we would have to go to the terminal except they wouldnt and couldnt open the door.  6 hours later the captain promises that help is on its way in the form of a staircase to take us back inside stansted but still no sign of a staircase unless you count the one outside the aircraft gathering snow. 6.5 hours later we depart. finally we are in the air bewildered and shocked that ryanair can ask a full plane of customers to sit for over 6 hours without water without food and without explanation.     prague to stansted. since british airways are really expensive from prague this was the only early morning option. this aircraft is based in prague and as the first flight of the day it was on time which is important. the interior is nothing extra and i miss seat pocket because i use it for my phone and etc so this is thing i dont like the most on ryanair aircraft interior legroom is small as well but im not really tall so its alright for me and prices on board are reasonable. boarding was quick and efficient same for deboarding. so on this flight everything was ok and its really good value for money.   i always fly with the same cabin luggage. on my flight back home from dublin to kaunas my luggage was recognised as too large and i had to pay â¬50 for it. lady who took my luggage was really rude did not explain anything properly was talking in an inappropriate manner. i felt very stressed and upset afterwards and i am very disappointed in the overall customer service of your airlines.    leeds to faro. after the pilotholiday fiasco ive not found communicating with ryanair easy. i was required to travel from leeds rather than newcastle. i paid for petrol parking and underwent major stress in the process. ryanair emailed me beginning of do december telling me they get back in due course but still no correspondence yet. they credited me with 700  and were quick enough to retract that mistake they had made. ive now been calling them for 25mins which they said would take 12 mins.    zaragoza to stansted. i checked in at zaragoza airport a samsonite suitcase and when i collected it at london airport it was badly damaged and unusable. i approached the ryanair staff at the airport to make a complaint about it and a woman said to me that i had to make a complaint on the website because it was a bag older than 5 years. i insisted and she refused to acknowledge my complaint. unbelievably after making the complaint on their website they have come back to me with a letter that says for the purpose of a claim under 15.1.2 acceptance of checked baggage by the bearer of the baggage identification tag without complaint at the time of delivery is prima facie evidence that it has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the contract of carriage. my suitcase could have lasted for at least another 5 years if it hadnt beenfor ryanair but what i really find annoying is the way the staff conned me into not being able to make a complaint immediately.    manchester to malaga. probably the worst experience ive had flying with ryanair. staff very rude unhelpful and miserable. i understand that they are very busy but manners take nothing considering they are the first people you encounter when starting your holiday. also found it very disappointing that they could offer very little in flight snacks.    stansted to brindisi. since more or less 6 months ryanair say that if you want to have your baggage with you you must a priority fee. this fee suppose to allow you to pass for first at the moment that you show your ticket. in the flight that i took yesterday this didnt happened many people without priority passed before of me and this is something really unacceptable doesnt make sense to pay something if after you cant have the service that you are paying for i know for sure 2 people that passed before me and that are been relocated to the priority even if they dont have it and i guess that someone else is passed as well. very very disappointed.    madrid to marrakesh. ryanair while servicing its customers with prices that are reasonable for flights in nearby countries such as in my case when visiting spain and flying to morocco knows nothing about customer satisfaction or conflict resolution. aside from experiencing technical difficulties upon departing to morocco when trying to checkin my flight prior to and when boarding was equal and my experience incredibly poor. the flight was announced to be delayed only 30 minutes when the plane really landed over 2 hours later than scheduled. this caused for me to be stranded at the airport late in the night as i arranged with my hotel to be picked up from the marrakesh rak airport making me feel very unsafe. during the flight one of the male flight attendants was being very flirtatiously aggressive with two women traveling together that i was sitting next to on the plane. every time in passing the male flight attendant would take the opportunity to engage in unprofessional behavior with one girl in particular. at one point the two exchanged phone numbers and planned to meet after the flight landed in marrakesh rak and this event caught the attention of other passengers on the flight. also en route many of the passengers that were traveling in groups were kneeling in the seats and talking to friends that were sitting behind them. this happened in multiple groups and was never addressed by airline staff. my experience with ryanair has been frustrating and communicated very clearly to those working with ryanair three times. unfortunately it seems that ryanair is a company that knows its own rules and regulations very well and if you do not as a passenger you are considered unfortunate and will only receive a mere apology for any uneventful experience had with the airline. paying a small amount more for another airline is much advised.   surely the worlds worst airline. a budget airline that has so many hidden fees  its not so budget. and the service is awful. you now have to book priority booking in order to guarantee a backpack and a small handbag its just a way to scare you into paying more money. you cant check in your return trip without paying extra for early check in. this wouldnt be a problem if they provided digitalmobile boarding passes. they dont  as usually when you are travelling you are not taking a flipping printer with you you have then pay extra in order to print your boarding pass in advance. completely unnecessaryarchaic and incredibly poor service. also think of the trees people. they are so useless they rig the time of flight knowing that they will run late but somehow magically be on time. planes are shabby. fine for budget airline  but as i said its no so budget with so many hidden fees.     berlin to bucharest. they were late and the staff was agitated because of it. they boarded priority travellers first without checking their tickets so that half of the travellers profited and skipped the line without having the right to do so. we didnt want to ruin our evening so we didnt object we just wanted to get home smoothly. after boarding the aircraft and after having found a small space in the cabin storage compartment to store our coats two late passengers arrived each of them carrying a rather large suitcase. without saying anything the flight attendant took our coats out of the storage compartment from above our heads and into my wifes lap. she then pushed one of the suitcases inside and left. no explanation no intention of helping us store our coats somewhere else. my wife stood up and tried to store the coats somewhere else. this got the staff angry because they were keen on making up lost time and wanted to depart as soon as possible. they started shouting through the microphone urging everybody to take their seats and saying that taking your seat is really easy to do. not only were we denied our minimal confort decency and respect but they were now also offending us in public. when i asked them during the flight if their attitude seemed normal to them they started shouting again and they immediately joined the one i was adressing as to create pressure and intimidate us. it was unbelievably rude and hostile.     bratislava to stansted via aalborg. that ryanair is low fare is well known and so i did expect not to have much space on the plane and that i was able to take one bag into the cabin if lucky. when i was already sitting on the plane from bratislava to stansted i received my email that my flight from stansted to aalborg was canceled and i could not get off the plane to stansted because it was too late. in stansted i was told that i have to wait 26 hours for a next flight and i had a right to have a refund and at least a hotel room where to stay till the next day. after waiting for 7 hours at the customer service i was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available. after another 3 hours they told me at the customer service that they dont know anything about a hotel room and that they will give me a standby ticket to billund and i can try to catch it because in that time i had less than an hour and there have been more standby tickets and they took just limited amount of them. it was hell but after problems at the airport checkin and running for life and plane i got there. i arrived in billund at late night and i had to travel to aalborg by buses until the morning. i asked for refunds and they told me that i will receive them within 10 working days. that was in september 2017. i did not receive anything and i tried to contact them multiple times but either i was ignored completely or they just wrote me that they forwarded my emails and complains to different departments. in december 2017 i finally was able to contact them and account department of ryanair wrote me that i will have my refunds on my account within 28 days. 28 working days passed and i havent seen a penny. honestly i would not recommend using this airline no matter what. if you have a chance to use a different airline or transport please do. if you have a problem they are sending your messages from one department to another or they just ignore it saying that they have a lot to solve and its not only their online service but customer service at the airport and cabin staff as well.   really disappointed about all the supplements you have to pay after buying the ticket. the new rules about not having the right to bring your hand luggage with you on the plane small purse  small hand luggage as typical is absurd. now you have to pay to be sure not to get it in the hold. in my case i had another flight to catch so i needed to have my hand luggage with me which forced me to pay the extra price. furthermore we are two travelling and when i made the checkin online the system gave us two seats far away from each other. next option was you are sitting apart do you want to sit next to each other click yes and an extra supplement is charged to change one of the seats to be next to the other one. why just not put them together from the first moment if two normal seats are actually available   flew cologne to dublin. overall service standard is basic. whilst there is nothing wrong with the airline it is certainly a nofrills airline. cheap fares but expensive extras. almost the same price to check in my luggage as i paid for my seat. the cabin crew could perhaps pay more attention to the passengers. when serving drinks and snacks they missed out row 26 altogether. slight delay due to a technical issue with the aircraft however we were transferred efficiently to another aircraft meaning the delay was restricted to *just* 61 minutes. i was travelling with a family member on the same booking however we were not allocated seats together. this is not the first time we have been separated in the past few months with ryanair. i would however fly with ryanair again due to the ticket prices and route network provided from my local airport dublin. flew thessaloniki to rome. they offer cheap flights and then they try to trick you in order to get extra funds for example the charge 55 euros if the check in is less than 2 hours before the flight a day before the flight ryanair contact me in order to inform me that i have to check in for my flight. i tried to check in through the email link but that was impossible for some reason when i arrived at the airport a few minutes less than the two hour deadline they told me that i had to contact ryanair to explain to me why i couldnt check in on time. in the meantime the deadline passed and we had to pay 55 euros per person. never again.   flew manchester to budapest. ryanair is getting worse by the day. i first flew with them about 2 years ago and for the price i paid i couldnt really complain back then but things are now changing. i have just returned from a short trip with my fiancÃ© to hungary and i dont really have a good word to say about ryanair now. the initial price seemed ok but then comes all the extras. sit next to your parnter  add 24 to the cost of the journey. add 1 check in bag  add 80 to the cost of the journey. take your carry on bags on board the plane  add 50 to the cost of the journey. the seats are the worst and most uncomfortable i have ever sat in on a plane and they seem to be adding more rows which means even less leg room and im not a tall man so i really feel for people over 6 feet tall. they called the passengers to the gate and kept us waiting for over 45 additional minutes with nor aircon so it was like sitting in an oven. the planes are incredibly noisy and it was actually dificult to watch a movie on my tablet with my headphones due to a constant dull droning noise. i dont think it will be it will be long until passangers are charged to use the toilets.   some days ago i made 2 bookings for a trip from athens to dublin and later on the same day i realised i needed to change the flight dates and so i did and proceeded to do it in the 24 hour grace period that ryanair proclaims that it provides for this kind of changes. however i was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings 40 euros for each booking  20 euros for each flight although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking moreover the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period actually it was done less than 23 hours after the original booking. according to ryanairs website and the 24 hour grace period for this kind of changes the dates change should have been at no cost as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same. i initially tried to address the situation with ryanairs live chat customer assistance. but not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened but they were also abrupt and rude. and of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. unfortunately i have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and i thought that if i address this matter through their website and the complaint forms which by the way good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. i even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges. however the only reply i got back from ryanairs customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime no one argued against that  however they dont even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same and that there can be a fee for changing the dates no mention of the 24hour grace period. i confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received great business policy right. never trust ryanair for anything. they prove to be one of the worst scammer airline companies there is.   flew london stansted to cork. very strange airline. im not sure how they got to where they are as i dont really enjoy flying with them. peculiar practice of getting people who have not paid premium to take their bags to the gate and then once boarding put them on a luggage cart for loading into the hold. i guess might as well get the passengers to do the heavy work soon im sure theyll be asking the customers to load the bags as well. luckily i was only travelling out and back in a day and had a small notebook. the main thing is that i got there and back safely and thats really the only positive thing i can say. the joy of flying is absent when using ryanair.   ryanair is the worst airline. theyre are incredibly greedy for money and cant find enough ways to steal from you. ive flown with them before but never again firstly the ticket is affordable but each bag costs 40 which means the cost of bags will exceed the ticket so flying with a more expensive airline with more benefits and quality assurance will technically equal the money you will spend with ryanair. secondly unlike every other airline it now requires you to pay 6 yes because 80 isnt enough for you to be able to take a small bag on board. i took a small trolley bag as i knew this was the policy and they still tagged it. my bag had no lock was not strong enough to be put in the deck and had very delicate things inside. they only gave me time to remove my computer and all my appliancesmakeupmany other products were left to be thrown away in the deck and we both know what happens bag breaks and all my things inside break. the best part is they only tell you about this policy in an email after you buy the ticket yes it is written in the small letters of the terms yet they know we dont always read it all especially when ive flown with them before and never had to do it so just assumed everthing was the same. when boarding i realise half the top shelfs were empty which means this could all have been avoided but like i said money tops it all for this airline. no customer service quality terrible unhappy and unfriendly staff in the airplane. all i know is that i have given so much time and money to this airline but you can be sure i will never fly with them again. absolutely ridiculous.    birmingham to malaga. weve all seen the online blogs about ryanairs reputation for avoiding compensation claims but i experienced it first hand when they cancelled my flight to mallorca just 6 hours before take off back in october of last year and i lost a fortune in transfers hotel costs train fees travel money etc. i thought it would be very straight forward to get compensation for something for which i was totally blameless. not so. i contacted ryanair with all of my proof of purchases and got an email to say they would pay me nothing because of circumstances which was due to a general strike outside of our control.  i contacted the ombudsman aviation adr and they contacted ryanair on my behalf and received a reply saying that they still would not compensate me. i went higher up and still nothing. i am continuing to fight this. im not going to say i will never fly with them again because they are cheap. but the reputation ryanair have for abysmal customer service and compensation claims is utterly justified. if you book make sure you are atol protected because otherwise you will have one mighty battle on your hands.   i thought i would flag what appears to be a persistent problem for ryanair passengers flying from frankfurt and the lamentable response from ground crew and frankfurt staff. bag security takes place at the gate at frankfurt t2 not on entering the departure lounge only passport needed. i arrived at the gate ~50 mins before the flight departed lets face it  at stn with ryanair you only generally start to board ~5 mins before the departure time to be confronted with a large queue all for the same flight. security did not seem unduly concerned. far from being last in the queue unfortunately i was directed to a very slow moving parallel screening queue for xrays etc  which did indeed leave me one of the last downstairs to the gate where i was witness to a queue of some 20 people already arguing with the gate staff who told them they were late and could not board. the situation was made more ridiculous as there was a halfempty bus waiting outside for at least 10 minutes while the team of 2 on the desk refused to let more people past. eventually this bus departed only for another one to turn up  again we were not allowed to board this by the gate staff. someone else turned up and we were effectively told tough go and rebook as they would not let us through. as a result families were split as the block was seemingly arbitrarily applied from one passenger to the next  which was appalling moreover he had medication for his wife and they still would not let the guy through nor make any attempt to get these to him. clearly there was no communication between security and the gate which was hugely frustrating security was understaffed as they could not physically process the volume of passengers in the timeframe if i were more suspicious i would think there may be some special arrangement to engineer this. moreover this happens regularly  one of the gate staff told us *45* people were denied boarding under similar circumstances the day before and a quick twitter search showed this happened at least once more this same week. overall it was a lousy experience but it seems to be a common problem  be warned if flying ryanair out of fra get to the get super early.   in the old days ryanair meant low fares simple. now it means low fares with loads of hidden costs. very poor and unprofessional service from boarding to flight attendants. all starts at boarding where a tag with limited liability is attached to your hand luggage if you dont pay priority which btw seems to be bought by half the passengers nowadays. the fake receipt is then glued onto your id which once resulted in one staff member actually breaking my plastic id card. this tag is so made up you can just rip it off and try your luck getting your hand bag into the cabin. if you are traveling with your so or a child expect to pay just to sit together because it will purposely randomly allocate you as far as possible. inside the cabin youll find the worst flight attendants the aeronautic industry has to offer. those who often bump into everyone and will actually hurt you when you have an aisle seat obviously without any apologies that keep selling lottery tickets enhancing the flea market spirit even when turbulence requires all passengers to be seated. they sometimes forget to perform the safety procedures demonstration from start because theyre on the phone. i once even heard one of them screaming when we bumped into some turbulence good luck trying to sleep if there are constant announcements over food perfumes tickets and other diversified sales. also ryanair seems to think theyre above eu regulations no beverages are offered in case of a significant delay. now the plus its simple and sometimes very cheap although it often requires you to waste tons of money and pay exorbitant train tickets to reach its remote airports ryanair keeps growing without proper scaling and training disregarding its customers and aiming towards maximum profit only. if an airline forgets the holidays of its pilots how can you expect itll care about its customers    toulouse to frankfurt. it was my first experience with ryanair and believe me it was worst. i tried web check in whole day of travelling date but not able to web check in because of web issues and also i called customer care to solve but got reply to go airport for check in. when i reached airport they charged 55 euro for boarding pass this charge is almost similar to flight rate i am very disappointed with ryanair i didnt face issue with any flight but worst experience is with ryanair.    edinburgh to brussels. worst experience ever and ive has many good and bad. arrived through customs 2 hours early then stood in a 45 minute line while our flight was delayed only to get to the gate and be told i had to verify my passport at the airport entrance a half mile away go through customs again and get back within 5 minutes or miss my flight. at least 12 other passengers had the same dilemma and not all of them made it. i had an asthma attack but made it. my wife is british and printed the tickets so didnt read the warning as it didnt spot to her and was tiny. ryanair must either require non eu customers to check in manually or have the first security gate flag up the need to have your passport checked. ill never book with them again even if its free.   london stansted to la rochelle. terrible flight they had to drop us off in nantes because of the weather thats fine. but the fact that we had to wait 5 hours at the airport for the bus to take us back to la rochelle is unacceptable half the people from the flight didnt even speak french and didnt understand anything on arrival in nantes. no one was keeping us informed. only got to my destination at 2am. i have taken so many flights with ryanair and they have been getting worse every time they are not even offering money back or discount.   flew knock to toulouse via london stansted. although departures and arrivals are on time it is a shame to report the irony of the travelers having paid for their trip at a low price. handlugage taken as for checked lugage because there was not paid extra for it handlugage is not checked lugage right this forced me to wait another extra 3040 minutes on arrival. and on the trip back surprise 10 euros tax per passenger to pay at knock airport if we wanted to have our flight. none of this was notified either by email checkin or even booking. a disaster the budget explodes even more. no smiling flight attendants. without forgetting to notice the dozen calls ladies and gentlemen we ask for your attention please to announce the selling of the dutyfree products whereas one would understand there is something serious  important happening. a little quiet flight and so commercial when its free the product is the traveller. i flew from tokyo to san francisco. the seats were more packed and less comfortable than any other airline i can recall. for the first time in over 100 crosscontinent flights i have taken the airline did not offer a proper meal until 6 hours after departure shortly after departure a sorry snack was offered  pack of nuts and a cheddar toast. inflight entertainment was the least elaborate i have seen with small screens. the cabin crew were nice and smiley but airport staff were extremely unhelpful. i wont fly jal again. lhrnrtlhr. flight was bumpy which was due to the weather but after eating we went through a particularly bad patch of turbulence and i became airsick. i used the supplied bag which instructed you to hand it to staff when used. i got up to dispose of it and flight attendants avoided me for 5 minutes eventually a female attendant came over to me and took the bag. i asked for some water. 30 minutes later still no water. my husband went and asked the hostess for the water and she told him shed forgotten and shed just bring it over. 10 minutes later she came over with a bottle of water by this time i was asleep anyway. nrtpvg was excellent food and service. tpehnd a few days later was not so good  although a 3.5hr flight the order for drink and meal was taken after takeoff and arrived together 45 mins later. no refill offered. the economystyle japanese ricepork dish had been ruined by reheating leaving rice more like a biscuit pork and veg solid. when i said it was inedible they appeared surprised. an apology and hope that my next jal flight experience will be better from manager. i wonder whether there is a different service standard inout of hnd compared to nrt. the price for the service is too high. the customer service at this company seems to be a well you already booked so there is nothing you can do attitude. they are not willing to try to make any accommodations to their customers. prices are higher than other better airlines. for an asian based airline i was very disappointed. inability to choose seats before the flight for certain booking codes is one thing but to allow it on one leg of the trip and not another is odd. after purchasing a rt ticket i was able to chose seats for the outbound flight. when i inquired about seats for the return trip i was told that the fare did not allow it. i even offered to pay to be able to select a seat and was told that i would have to pay over 600. 250 of that was a penalty for changing the ticket really the representative seemed to be completely uninterested in trying to come to a reasonable solution. since when is upgrading a ticket class worthy of a change penalty i am sorry that i chose jal. if you are travelling with family do not fly with japan airlines jal. my wife son and i are currently sitting in the qantas lounge at narita airport as we transit to taipei from boston. why are we in the qantas lounge a 10 minute walk from the jal gates rather than the jal lounge even though our entire return journey from taipei to boston was with jal because the friendly staff at the jal lounge informed me that even though i am a platinum oneworld member of which jal is a partner i can only bring one guest into the lounge even if the second guest is my 8 year old son both cathay and qantas have shown common sense whenever we use their lounges allowing the three of us to enter. jal where process trumps common sense  not nice at all. jl0772 8 mar 2015. jl0771 20 mar 2015. cabin terribly hot took over 8 minutes to answer service call no amenities kit staff reluctant to give us a pen to fill out immigration form despite having heaps of them. food poor but edible. inflight entertainment poor  old movies not much choice. no japanese meal option. crew robotic slow to remove meal trays. would never fly again. if you feel heat easily do not go with this airline or wear shorts and cool tops. on our japan airlines flight from narita to sydney my partner and i were so disgruntled because the cabin was so hot we were sweating and struggling to breathe. as soon as i got on it was stuffy and hard to breathe. i was about to start panicking as warm air makes me feel like were very enclosed. i was nervous and agitated the entire time  my partner and i did not sleep once i even had to resort of chewing on ice getting bottles and putting them under my shirt. i asked the staff numerous times that the temperature was too hot but they kept saying its on 24 so we can try put it down to 23 degrees. im sorry but 24 is too hot. in my office at work 22 is considered the standard.  i will never fly with japan ever again ill pay big money for qantas instead. they also played the same movies over and over again.    bangkok to haneda with japan airlines. lounge was packed prior to the 0945 departure to haneda. business class forward cabin looked cramped although fresh and spotless. 7across angleflat seating is surely now outdated and was not very comfortable especially with the seat itself being quite hard. not really a problem for a daytime flight but i would be very unhappy to find this layout on the inward overnight flight. reasonable ife selection but small screen. my main complaint is the lunch service. with limited main course selection taken at takeoff and the first course not delivered until an hour later youd think the service from then on would be relatively speedy. not so a full 40minute wait between the first two courses is quite unforgivable the more so when i had to return my steak as it was not even lukewarm thereafter the flight was uneventful although it was all but impossible to hear the cabin service announcements. departed on time and arrived 10 minutes early. haneda to itami and this is my first time with japan airlines. check in was nice and the stuff was professional. but onboard the plane the seats was comfortable but the cabin was freezing. i ask for the blanket and no one would give it and told me theres no blanket and im trying to warm myself in the toilet no food and drinks even onboard for an hour flight and wifi was not available. i will not fly jal again and used ana instead on the return flight. still at tokyo nrt admirals club waiting for connecting aa flight to dallas. first leg new delhi to tokyo. in new delhi after priority boarding was over everyone else was waiting when suddenly a japanese official turned up and started moving a few people from the back of line and few late comers towards the priority entrance. he kept shouting â with no one understanding and shrugged others off. awful inflight service it seems as if staff are forced to serve passengers they want to get it done as soon as possible and dont respond to calls. i saw calls from multiple passengers left unanswered. most of the food was ok. twice they provided empty cup for teacoffee as part of meal tray but my cup went empty both times. on the other hand admiral club facility at nrt proved to be a great experience. much better than those in chicago. after todays experience i would not travel jal unless i am forced to.    tokyo to frankfurt. they ran out of japanese food and all breakfast options on business class. i had pot noodle for breakfast on business class. i was offered a bottle of sake on plane but they do not stock resealable bags on board so could not accept this due to connecting flight and airport security they did not offer to post it to my home address. on outbound flight they did not place us sitting together even though booked under one reference and requested to sit together a month in advance of travel had to complain at the gate in order to get seats assigned together. after complaining after experience japan airlines did not offer any apology so would not recommend based on overall service food and seating arrangements.\\r\\r\\n    tokyo haneda to london. flight was okay in business class on boeing 777 not my chosen airline but paid for by client. i have used ana on previous londontokyo trips and ana are superior to japan airlines they seem more international and staff are much nicer. check in and lounge in tokyo was efficient lounge rather crowded seat onboard boeing 777 was comfortable but cabin temperature was unbearably hot and stuffy to suit japanese passengers. food was passable again well below ana inflight entertainment is poor. clean cabin poor washrooms no amenities at all. i can see what ana is 5star compared to japan airlines.    frankfurt to tokyo in business class. seats were quite confortable although rather narrow for sleeping and the cabin was overheated for non japanese passengers but staff dont seem to care. i have now flown this route with lh ana and japan airlines and have to say that japan airlines are below standards of others. cabin attendants speak very poor english they have foreign ca and the service is so slow and rather poor. i didnt expect them to be this poor and a long way behind their rival ana who i will choose on next trip.     the very flight happened to be japan airlines 50th anniversary of tokyokuala lumpur route. i got my class of service upgraded from economy to premium economy at the time of check in for nominal charges. the seats of the aircraft was very nice and the cabin was very clean. some negative things to note. the food. the menu was introduced to have been developed by naomi iijima a food designer. i had a small bite of everything and none of them was acceptable. though designed to look fancy everything tasted terrible. id say regular meal that youd expect on economy class by other airlines would be far better. cabin attendants english was not good. very unclear and hard to understand. the attitude of ca towards passengers was not something that worth a compliment. cabin entertainment menu offered is quite limited. the flight arrived at kl and was greeted with water arch. at least that was a little fun.    tokyo to new york. absolute worst customer service and experience with this airline. on my honeymoon and paid for an upgrade on the way to my destination and halfway was downgraded. they blamed jfk for not properly communicating the upgrade was only halfway. either way we got the runaround with a few different people at the haneda airport. most notably was an incredibly rude manager i was shocked when she said she was a manager because the way she spoke and handled this was incredibly unprofessional. i was interrupted nonstop by no no solution unless you pay more. horrible experience i will never fly with this airline again. dont use them if you want to avoid the worst headache and rude customer service. i would give zero stars if i could.    tokyo narita to taipei. the crew efficiency was a big problem they do not offer welcome drink when you board the plane. the meal service was a disaster the speed was really slow and they did not offer the drink service before meal. they just gave you a whole tray. it took one hour from i boarded the plane to i got my first drink. also the taste of the meal was really bad. i would never spend money to buy their business class ticket.   taipei to narita. this was an really disappointing flight. the meal was terrible it looks really nice but the taste was really bad. also the staff was lack of efficiency. the meal service go through very slow the service was really bland. the dessert they offered was just a really small size haagendazs ice cream. i am so disappointing. also the ife system was a disaster the speed was really slow and the interface was really not user friendly.    mauritius to singapore. flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure. no update was given to know what was the way forward  especially since a connection was involved. when you call air mauritius the people were rude and could not help at all. it took 7 hours of timeless wait on the phone without someone to even lodge a decent complaint to finally get redirect to another flight combination with inconvenient timing. they do not even get the emails right. no compensation for the delay  no apologies for the inconvenience. no miles no upgrade nothing. its as if we need to be grateful that they actually redirected us for a ticket which we have paid for the service on board was below standards compared to the price but i never knew that the on ground customer service was so lousy as well.    london to mauritius. in july 2017 myself my wife and 2 children aged 1 and 3 travelled to mauritius. as a regular kestrel flyer i expected better treatment and better service. they are very child unfriendly.  when we landed one of our luggage was missing. this is despite the flight was the flight was delayed by more than one hour. we landed on a sunday and had to attend a wedding the same night. my wedding clothes and that of my wife were in that luggage. i complained to the staff they could not care less and said i was not entitled to anything and was sent away. no manager was available and later in turned out that the duty manager on the day was busy attending to the prime ministers wife in the state lounge and could not be bothered about paying passengers. i complained to their customer service and the service i received was poor. i wrote to the ceo and their chairman. no response at all from them. when we returned to the uk 2 weeks later two air mauritius staff were travelling. they were being given business class treatment when they were travelling in economy in front of paying customers. i spoke to the cabin crew about this and they could not care less. what they offered me is 5000 travel points 50 euros and to use their lounge when i travel next which is pathetic to what my family went through travelling with them.     i travelled from london heathrow to mauritius. i was expecting comfort but things have not changed. customer service at the checkin desk was nice and welcoming. customer service within the flight was nice too. negative  seat was very uncomfortable for an average guy of 6 feet. leg space under the seat in front of you is awful. there was a black box next to my feet. arm rest was painful food below average. cold tea  coffee served and i had to complain. entertainment was poor. the new movies contained strictly old movies. overall people only travel with air mauritius because its a direct flight however i have to say that this service is not good value for money.    singapore to mauritius. the worst flight experience. we should have flown on a budget airline to mauritius for a better experience there was an hour delayed departure out from singapore and the aircon in the plane was not working.\\xa0 after take off my husbands entertainment system was not working and we press the call bell and no one attend to us. i have to walk to the galley to inform crew about my husbands entertainment system not working. \\xa0after informing about the unserviceable system and i doubt he did anything because they were more concerned about meal service. \\xa0finally we get hold of another stewardess and inform her and she said she will do it later as she was occupied. \\xa0when we receive our tray i informed the 3rd crew again about the entertainment system and she said she will reset again and doubt that it will work. she offered a seat change but we paid for the exit row usd50 each to enjoy the extra legroom instead of having to move to another seat behind and be separated. there were many announcement throughout the flight duration.\\xa0 first meal service was rushed and after that lights switched off within 2 hours.  our holiday mood to mauritius was dampened by the experience with air mauritius. \\xa0 very disappointed with the inflight service. flight from mauritius to heathrow is 12.5 hrs. usually on long flights flight attendants on other airlines would on several occasion offer passengers a glass of water. with air mauritius not once did the flight attendants offer water to passengers. you have to ask for it. once the food was served their duty was done. the quality of the food was very poor. the entertainment choice was limited and outdated. worst airline ever. business class ticket they lost our luggage and did nothing to find them. we spent 8 days in mauritius with a 15 months old baby and without any luggage a nightmare. our luggage were lost in nairobi. its not the first time it happens but with other airlines they usually find them and deliver them in a couple of days. service in the flight is bad. from nairobi to mauritius you get a kind of breakfast when you board then after nothing not even a glass of water and we travelled business class i was delayed more than 48 hrs in shanghai pudong airport the whole ordeal started when we boarded the plane we were told there was a technical problem and take off would be delayed. the crew had to open the middle doors for us as it was getting too hot inside. during the 4 hr wait we did not get any food or drinks we were driven finally after 5 hours on the tarmac back to the terminal to be dumped in the airport hotel without food or information. for the next 2 days we were left without any info on the flight we had to fight with airport staff to get our luggage back after more than 24hrs. absolutely unprofessional management of problems lying to customers covering up a major problem and never getting back to us for any kind of compensation. lhrmrulhr. poor seating told we had bulkhead seats during checkin but found this was not the case upon boarding. on outbound and return flight we had specifically selected the vegetarian option yet no veg meal was available on the return flight. flight attendants were arrogant as to suggest we had made a mistake in the booking although we had the confirmation to prove the contrary. all in all poor staff training poor inflight experience and poor postflight service. lhrmrulhr. very disappointed with inflight service. the quality of the food was very poor. entertainment choice was limited and outdated. staff service was bad. travelled with children but unfortunately did not specifically request kids meals which meant they were served the adults over spiced food. travelled in the middle 4 seats 242 which had the added discomfort that only 2 of the 3 arm rests lifted making it difficult to sleep on the overnight to mru. the customer service was non existent. we were sat at the back of the plane near the toilets so the 12 hour flight we had no peace with people going back and forward. couldnt even draw the curtain to block out the light from the area of the toilet and where the cabin crew sat. the leg room in economy was the worst we have experienced. bad enough for me who is 5 ft 5 awful for my husband who is 6ft 2. we didnt even realise we would travel air mauritius for this long flight we had booked with air france. awful experience. flight mk 034 from mru to cdg on 121208. the most uncomfortable trip in businessclass we have had. the seats are not only no lieflat when you try to find a position to sleep it is not possible as you always slip downwards. the cabincrew were unfriendly and unenthusiastic. the quality of the food was poor. on 260912 my family travelled to mauritius 11 people. we embarked on our journey from melbourne on virgin to perth then boarded air mauritius. the first thing i noticed was how old the plane was leg room was non existent and felt really boxed in. the onboard entertainment was not working  made it hard to entertain 6 teenagers on an 8 hour flight. i felt the staff were annoyed with any request made. upon our return to australia the experience seemed worse. the cabin temperature was really hot which made it uncomfortable. refreshments were only served twice. the crew were unresponsive  no politeness customer interaction no smiles  almost robotic. service is an integral part of customer satisfaction. london and back in oct 2012. i wish now i had read the reviews here first otherwise we would not have flow air mauritius. i agree with all the other reviews no leg room entertainment box in way of feet the worst food i have had on any flight. my daughter and wife did not eat any of the meals on the outward and return flight. where has all the friendly mauritian welcome and smile gone having flown regularly on mk since 1978 i will think twice before booking another mk flight. last year the service was on the downhill and i thought that this was a one off but to my amazement i was faced with a worse experience this year. it appeared that the crew were doing you a favour the meal choice was chicken or lamb and the crew had no idea how they were prepared or what they were served with we only got a drink half way through the main meal. as for the state of the aircraft a complete refurbishment will do a bit of justice to the experience compensating for the service delivery that we received. return journey was on a code share with air france it was like chalk and cheese. india to mauritius. frustrated when i saw the touch screen was not working properly. i pressed the call button to call an fa who came to my seat after 15 mins. water requested was provided after half an hour. i was unable to see flight attendants as they were sitting chatting with each other. never again. atrocious service on air mauritius and no follow up on complaint. having prebooked 2 aisle seats we found ourselves seated behind an incessantly screaming infant. since the flight wasnt full we asked to be moved. the young father of the child overheard our request took offence and became aggressive. we called the purser but before we could say anything the father accused us of threatening his wife and children. the purser believed him. we are a well travelled couple in our 50s and have never experienced anything like this. we were moved  but we were shunted to rear of the plane and put in a middle and window seat  despite there being several rows of empty seats which we were told were broken. id further add that flying on an am plane is like traveling in a compressed sardine can  there is utterly no leg room. air mauritius the cheapest way of getting to mauritius. per to ssr must have been the first a330 built seats coming apart  big black box under seat which after reading skytrax is the entertainment box  it did not have much in it  only one movie that was worth watching. the staff appeared so uninterested  i would suggest air mauritius employ some staff from a country where people want to work. on return i noted that air mauritius did have some staff apparently not mauritian perhaps in an attempt to lift the service standard. two cups of tea only in a long flight one with uht milk and one with that chemical called creamer so i had coffee instead of tea to hide the revolting taste. return flight about 90 full. i really noticed the difference when i got back onto qantas at perth for the sydney run. qantas offer some entertainment  a better range of movies the sound was good had a selection of australian music  seekers john williamson etc. comparing air mauritius to qantas  like chalk and cheese. have relatives that will be making two trips back to australia this year  first will be by air mauritius as they are paying the second most likely by emirates as the company is paying. i can put up with a old plane but there is no excuse for air mauritius poor entertainment or slack in flight service. fly air mauritius once a year and the service keeps going down. leg room is very poor seat material is old and dirty entertainment equipment is old. on our last flight my wife pressed the service button after 10 mins no one came. she had to go to the back of the plane where all the attendants were too busy having a chat to ask for a bottle of water. mk745 delhi to mauritius. the flight was late by 1 hour. the staff were rude. it was a day flight but they served johannesburg to mauritius 10 december 2013 code share with saa. seats very cramped a nightmare to say the least. flight delayed could not checkin online. food awful served breakfast at 2 in the morning. no air conditioning. staff uncaring. mk745 delhi to mauritius. the flight was late by 1 hour. the staff were rude. it was a day flight but they served only breakfast. there was only 15 movies to watch. it was very hot onboard. london heathrow to mauritius return 20th september out return 19th october. poor flight the food was horrible and the staff rude. i had my two year old son with us and they didnt order his food on the was out. the staff tried to start an argument because our son was asleep on one of the seats without his seat belt. i will not be flying with air mauritius again. mru to lhr 12 hours without any inflight entertainment and 3 children to occupy. the only difference to a childs meal was the addition of a kitkat dirty seats rude staff and no overhead locker space. everyone except us ignored the 7kg hand baggage restriction and took full size suitcases onboard this was even ignored by the staff. my husband and i and two friends travelled to mauritius. they had our prebooked return seats not reserved. we were kept waiting an hour before booking in. the ground staff were rude and arrogant and we had ring our travel agency in england for them to confirm we had paid for the extra legroom seats all to no avail we still never had the seats the food was disgusting aircraft really cold the cabin crew extremely unhelpful. other passengers were unhappy with the service and sent the food back even writing to customer services once we were home they were exactly the same not in the least bit interested. i would rather travel with one of the no frills airlines at least their staff are pleasant. not a nice experience between perth mauritius and paris then return. the seats were too close to the ones in front and were some of the smallest i have ever travelled in. the video was not working and nothing could be done which made the 26 hour travel time even longer. i had asked for a lactose intolerant meal on all legs of the journey and none was forthcoming which means that i did not eat for the whole journey but still paid the same fare as others who had full meals and proper entertainment. i will never fly with these people again and suggest that others also avoid this airline. recently travelled to india on an air mauritius flight back and fro on mk748 and mk 749 respectively. however i am very disappointed by the services offered on board. i travelled together with my spouse and infant of less than 2 years old. on departure on 27th december we requested a baby cot ticket booked on 11th november 2013  more than a month before and on checkin same was requested again and approval obtained. however to our disappointment we did not get one on board. the reason given was that the baby was too big for the cot and the weight was too heavy. the infant weighs 10.3 kg and his height is 73 centimetres. the crew did not even bother to check if the infant fits the cot or not but bluntly refused. we had to hold a crying baby whole night which not only disturbed us but we had an earful from other passengers. on our return 10th jan 2014 same scenario. despite request no infant cot and even worse we did not have a front seat to handle a baby. instead we were put on a seat with other seats in front which was really uncomfortable. i and my spouse had to carry the infant whole night. there was another couple who benefited from a cot and we tried it on my infant and he fits perfectly well. in fact we had more rooms than expected. when i told the cabin crew they told me that you are not in a front seat and hence cannot give you one now. the irony is that a cot was requested and approved at checkin in mumbai. we did not even get an infant meal on both trips. the service we got on the flight was very disappointing and frustrating. i am frequent traveller on air mauritius and as from now i will rather use other carriers for my overseas trip be it personal or business related. a very disappointed customer. we had to travel from mumbai to mauritius. air mauritius flight mk749 got cancelled on 1772015 10 hrs before departure without an alternate flight arrangement. we had to book tickets from mumbai to mauritius via dubai. return flight of air mauritius on 2172015 mk748 to depart at 2120 hrs was rescheduled late by 3 hours at last moment without indication to passengers. the staff on the am planes do no more than the bare minimum service wise how many times does a customer have to ask for a glass of water when you get the water its in a plastic cup and its warm their own pre flight customer care video states that consuming water is suggested for all flights if only you could get it. then there was the seating smelly old uncomfortable and zero leg room. i am 175cm tall and i was looking for space we flew overnight leaving at 22.00 and the lights in the cabin were off for all of 3hrs in a 8hr flight what also annoyed us was excessive the use of the pa they love it everyone has a go the captain the assistant the fa captain and assistant and the toilet cleaner. give it a rest no one listens to the announcements especially when we are trying to sleep totally disappointed with the flight outbound dated aircraft in light entertainment was ridiculous all the films started at the same time with no option to rewind or pause. the meals were bland youll not starve but thats about it. we couldnt book our return seats online we tried several times but no results but thought nothing of it but this morning once the 24hrs online check in opened we logged in 3 mins after it opened and all the seats were booked. so me and my partner couldnt even be seated together. id never fly with air mauritius again id rather pay a few pounds more and have a happy 12hrs in the air. this air mauritius flight was awful. there is very limited leg room due to a metal box taking up most of the available leg room beneath the seat in front.  impossible to get remotely comfortable on the flight. no sleep was had due to very uncomfortable seats and constant cabin announcements. badly designed and old plane. inflight entertainment system poor. service poor. food awful. what a shame as we love mauritius but with no option but to fly from perth via air mauritius we will not be returning until they have upgraded aircraft. or perhaps there is another direct carrier. air mauritius is appaling whilst on holidays i am mauritian born the airline and its associated problems were in the papers on a daily basis. i got home with marks on my knees even though i have a baby which kept me in and out of my seat  entertainment system did not work on 2 of our 4 seats  delayed for 3hrs in terminal due to technical difficulty. ground and inflight staff were extremely unhelpful trying to carry sleeping baby and two toddlers no one offered help  passengers were offering help.  aircraft is cold with atrocious service  we had food on the trays for ages whilst trying to move around in a limited legroom. flight staff barely cared and when asked to assist appeared to be indignant.  i am extremely disappointed of with air mauritius  it does leave a good taste for tourists. a truly awful experience and one as a family we have no wish to repeat by flying again. it was a daytime flight and all the cabin window shutters were kept down and the lights kept down so we flew in darkness  we asked the purser to put up the lights and blinds and we were told he could not do this. there was obviously bright sunshine outside but we were subjected to flying in darkness. the food was truly awful  i am not expecting haute cuisine on an economy flight but we were served pap. we have eaten good food in mauritius but no attempt was made to serve reasonable food  no fresh fruit  it is a tropical island and i believe an attempt to serve a slice of pineapple is possible even on a tight budget but the salad that was presented was ghastly. the bread rolls were as stale as bricks on all three meals presented  watch your costs but dont bother presenting it to customers as a meal. just because they have a tray to fill with their little boxes for a 3 course meal doesnt mean the customer should be treated as a fool the whole experience was a shambles and can reflect on the island of mauritius as a destination. the airline is getting it wrong by subjecting customers to this kind of serviceexperience in this day and age.    we travelled with air mauritius two days ago for our honeymoon from cape town. we were bitterly disappointed in the lack of service and unfriendly staff. we waited 2 hours before being served a drink and ended up getting our meal at the same time. the entertainment system did not work for half the flight. when we asked for some water we were forgotten and we had to get up and ask again even after ringing the bell to alert them. to top it off one of the air hostesses rolled her eyes at us on three separate occasions when she had to give way to us in the passage when we asked her to remove the empty cups and when my husband needed the bathroom before landing. not a great start to our honeymoon very disappointing we are due to fly back on the 20th april lets hope we are better received this time.    a319 from cape town to mauritius and atr72 between mauritius and rÃ©union. the staff was not friendly. they serve the meal without watching you dont expect any smile.  the food was poor. the a319 looks old inside no modern entertainment like personal screen. on the atr its the same but flights are short so its not a problem. the real good thing with air mauritius is the number of lines from mauritius. and prices are correct. i know the company is going to change some aircraft soon. a good thing for sure. lets hope that will bring back smile on crews faces too.    mauritius to london. checkin was chaotic leading to long queues with not enough staff to deal with it and looking visibly unhappy too. it took about 1.5 hours to get to front of queue for checkin. we boarded late only then to sit for about an hour in swelteringly hot and airless cabin before takeoff as the auxiliary power unit was not on probably to save the airline money as the crew were unwilling to say more than they were suffering too and encouraged me to complain to the airline. once again staff unhappy and unmotivated. requests to talk to senior crew member were ignored and they only came to answer my call button to switch it off muttering later or words to that effect. no choice of breakfast offered but what came was the most unappetising on any flight i have ever had. the entertainment was very outdated  tiny screen with picture shaking so much that it was unwatchable. and also poor choice of films. on the plus side the seats were relatively comfortable but only for normalsize passengers. on our outbound flight the rather large gentleman behind me was in visible pain due to lack of room for his girthlegs. not that the stewardesses offered any solutions. luckily i found another seat so i moved instead to give him more room. as our chosen seats when booking had been unceremoniously reallocated to others by the time we checked in another first experience for me this wasnt too much of a hardship.    mauritius to perth. flight to mauritius was delayed for 2 hours. no explanation then was cancelled with no warning. a guy from air mauritius came out and yelled over the top of everyone saying flight has been cancelled come back tomorrow at the same time then just walked off like that. no one knew what was going on or what to do. then when we returned the next day the flight was delayed a further 4 hours with the same poor service. now on my way home flight is delayed a further 2 hours with the same appalling service. what a joke of an airline and the staff need to work on their customer service too   flew malaysia airlines from phuket to london via kuala lumpur. awful experience awful customer service. they emailed me after i had departed for the airport to say that my flight had been brought forward a few hours. how can they possible leave it so late and expect me to arrive in time not even a phone call. actually they didnt move the flight forward  they cancelled my original flight and decided to put me on an earlier one. i then had problems with seats food and so on. my complaint took more than 6 weeks before i received a totally inadequate reply. never using them again.    kuala lumpur to kuching. i requested a cup of water and the cabin crew told me that all cabin crew are busy preparing food therefore no one is able to get me a cup of water. furthermore she asked me to turn off the service light above me. my experience with malaysia airline was unexpectedly disappointed.  for the price i paid i should not be getting the service of a budget airline.    jakarta terminal 3 to kuala lumpur. the checkin service was fast and the ground staff was very helpful to accommodate my request to send my baggage directly to singapore although i have a 9 hr lay over in kuala lumpur. the flight was delayed for more than an hour which led for me missing my shuttle service to my hotel in kuala lumpur. most of the cabin staff were very good. the cabin cleanliness was okay but the table and the ife was smudged with dirt. the food was okay but beverages were very limited they do not serve alcohol in this route.     london to kota kinabalu via kuala lumpur. ive flown business class on mh regionally and domestic six times in the past 2 years and been very happy apart from the no alcohol policy so decided to book this long haul business class flight. mh3 lhrkul had a creeping delay which ended up at 5 hours 50 mins late. new onboard business product on a350 is very cramped and a big disappointment. while in sabah mh reservations removed my return booking from their system which caused me problems and humiliation at check in at kota kinalablu and again at kl transfer desk 30mins plus 45mins as they couldnt get my booking back to be live on their system to issue boarding passes. when we did eventually get on the flights we didnt have the seats wed selected. i submitted a complaint 20 june and still not had any response 1 month later. shockingly poor service to a bus class pax and oneworld sapphire card holder. they seem to be ignoring their legal obligations to pay delay compensation for an eu originating flight.   delhi to bali denpasar via kuala lumpur. as this was a holiday with great expectations i booked business class with malaysia airlines. while booking i had cheaper options from malindo air and a slightly higher price from singapore airlines but i decided to go ahead with mas. check in experience was good and welcomed with smiles. counter staff explained that there was a 60 minute delay and promised updates will be passed on through lounge staff. also received a call from mas call centre about the delay and i was satisfied with the way i was kept informed. waited at lounge until 2200 with no update from staff departure was meant to be 2125. i went to the gate only to find the flight is not ready and is rescheduled to 0005. at 0030 enquired with the counter staff about the revised timings and informed that it may take one more hour. we finally departed flight at 0330 hrs  a good 6 hour delay. onboard at my seat 5a to my utter surprise trash was not cleared from seat pockets and material from the previous flight and was removed by staff when asked. to my astonishment towels and welcome drink were offered to some passengers but not all including me. more surprises in store for me on this flight. my call button was not working. tv remote not functioning. i called the supervisor from the service area to show all the defects and he blamed maintenance and communication systems. due to this even breakfast could not requested and for coffee i had to go to the service area and ask one of the staff. i requested information about my connection between kuldps but none of the staff had any idea but assured me that i will be accommodated on the next available flight. on disembarking at kul mas staff gave me a new boarding pass and made me rush to the gate as it was a short connection. on enquiring about baggage no one has any info but assured me it will reach my destination. reached dps waited at the baggage carousel for a good 45 min until the belt stopped. went around to enquire at baggage services counter and after verifying and lot of internal discussion they asked me to wait as some baggage is coming in at 1725. now being a business class traveller i feel i have a right to know whether my bags are loaded or not and it is the airlines duty to inform me of this and not to waste my time. after a good 75 min wait the staff say they will send my bag later once it is arrived.    london heathrow to sydney return via kuala lumpur. whilst the process of flying with malaysia airlines was satisfactory one of my bags was delayed by 4 days on the flight out. in the first case i had no indication from the airline as to whether it was lost forever or would arrive in a day week or month. this was just the beginning of the poor correspondence and eight weeks later i am still yet to have a single email or telephone call answered by them. ive tried telephone email facebook and even twitter and still not a single person has got back to me. probably the worst service ive ever received.    kuala lumpur to kota kinabalu. travelled economy with 2 elderly pax 1 pax with wheelchair assistance and a child. upon arrival from tokyo haneda proceeded to the transfer counter at klia satellite building. the staff was edgy and made no eye contact. thereafter prior to boarding at gate b11 for mh2646 the boarding gate staff reluctantly attended to us. she was impatient with the 2 elderly passengers when they were quite slow in producing the documents. inflight service was no better. flight crew were rude and no interest in customer service and throughout the flight made it look as though they were simply forced to work. food was inedible. cabin looked tired and dirty. toilets were no better. overall the service on this domestic sector was not commendable at all. mh seriously needs to improve on the basic customer services skills if they ever want to be on top again.     london to kuala lumpur. i was looking forward to my trip in malaysia airlines as they enjoyed flying with them before but this flight was one of the worst i have taken. the check in and lounge in london were great and i had a nice seat although hard and uncomfortable when flat once we were airborn a faulty door seal resulted in an alarm sounding for over 3 hours. the crew carried on with the service despite there clearly being a fault. we circled over amsterdam for about an hour while he captain tried to fix it. however no reassurances to the passengers or apologies or explanation of why we were circuling during the time the fault was evident. i travel frequently but this engendered severe anxiety and ive never wanted a flight to end sooner. the csd was pleasant enough once he saw my and others passengers anxiety but the crew were really set on dishing out the alcohol and satay. there were other faults on the plane  lavatory lights not working in business class and seats and bowls filthy and scratched. indifferent crew too. some delightful others really rude. the safety of the aircraft was my main concern and the lack information made the situation worrying. i will not fly them again.    kuala lumpur to london an unpleasant experience. some toilets out of order queuing for the toilets. no announcements of meals so hopefully youre not still queueing for the bathroom. great plane the a380 but the interior looks tired bathrooms not great. staff attitudes not very flexible toward the customer  no you cant when asking to use a bathroom upstairs in economy downstairs ones are mostly our of order. airline really needs to get its act together.     london heathrow to kuala lumpur. totally disappointed. on my return flight from london we had to wait for almost 2 hours standing in queue just for boarding pass to be issued. we are then served by unprofessional customer service counter staff.  standing in the queue for 2 hours and with an elderly makes everyone restless and tired especially its morning flight. we were told system are down and we will be allocated seats that we have chosen during online checkin. i make a request to just have my elderly mother to be seated beside my sister. it was turned down by him given the same reason as system are done.  hence we are seated separately. however during queuing to board the plane i overheard a customer service lady staff telling a lady infront of us that she can only get her seats to be seated together with her partner if they have paid the additional cost for the seat tickets during booking.  i ask for it while its my turn but she told me a different story and it cant be done as the system are down. i was disappointed and proceed on as the given seats. the last draw that makes me write this review was that i found out that the whole row seats in front of me are taken up by a family of 6 or 7 which continued to the same row in the middie seating.  i paid more to book an aisle seats and my allocated are window seats. i will not be recommending malaysia airlines even if the tickets are cheap. delayed flights in both london and kul back to sin.     kuala lumpur to london. received the message about 9 hours flight delay one day before the flight. then during the night the flight was cancelled completely. no information was given from malaysia airlines about further arrangement. staff at the kuala lumpur airport very unhelpful. no attention to customers. they put me and my pregnant wife separately on the next available full flight which was 3 hours late. so we spent 14 hours waiting for next flight. will never fly again.     kuala lumpur to bangkok. checkin was relatively smooth given the long queue. boarding was a little unusual though with window seat passengers called first for boarding ahead of other economy passengers.  legroom was a little tight during the flight especially when the passenger reclined his seat and it made the personal space feel rather claustrophobic. this also made it hard to eat when the meals were served as the steward didnt even seem to care that the passengers in front had their seats down. meal service was quick and efficient but the quality was ordinary. the steward seemed rather lazy during the drink service and was more interested in not serving the drinks.  ptv was working although the usb port on my seat and the seat next to me was not working. experience worse when trying to put the seat upright for landing. the seat adjustment button got stuck and although the seat came back up it would not lock in position. had to sit for landing without putting pressure on the seat back. overall the aircraft was poorly maintained and crew not very hospitable nor caring.     initially purchased an economy ticket kuala lumpur to auckland. however 2 days before flight was offered chance to bid for an upgrade to business class which i succeeded in obtaining for an extra us395 one way. then the problems began. the upgrade was mistakenly given to my travelling partner who had opted to stay in economy. boarding passes were back to front i was still in economy he was upgraded to business no matter how hard i tried it fell on deaf ears. no one was interested nobody wanted to help. i spent over an hour pleading my case but to no avail. staff were rude arrogant and obtuse even trying to blame me for the situation.  i asked for my money back policy is no refund on upgrades.  it is incredulous that a company treats passangers in this way     london to kuala lumpur return. without doubt the worst airline ive flown  both long haul and short haul. an incredible level of incompetence in the digital age. on the outbound flight we called malaysia airlines and prebooked exit seats several weeks in advance all ok. turned up to heathrow and the malaysia airlines computer system had lost all prebooked and checkedin seats sending the checkin queue into turmoil. i appreciate things happen but malaysia airlines staff did nothing to help. no one came out to speak to passengers and say there was an issue. families were all split up and those who hadnt checked in were given the seats of those whod done it weeks before. we spent 2.5 hours in the check in queue and the attendant was frustrated the customers were frustrated. delayed 45 mins on outbound. no apology at all.  the a380 is 10 years old. malaysia airlines have made the interior look like it was 30 years old. was dripped on by the aircon unit the whole flight to kl. delayed 1.5 hours on return leg managed to split up whole families and assign exit seats to 3 year old children and have new born babies travelling alone. again no apology. both legs people had seats back blind and tables down and for take off and landing and no one checked seats belts. staff arent rude they just dont care. on the return journey the staff spent 2 hours in one hit laughing and joking in one of the galley areas. worst plane food bar none. entertainment system kept breaking on the way back. again staff werent even offering an apology and showed not interest in finding a solution ideal for a 13 hour flight.   mumbai to jakarta via kuala lumpur. the ordeal with malaysia airlines started at mumbai as the flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. it was fine as i got a message that flight is delayed and accordingly i planned my arrival at airport. the issue of my boarding pass took about 30 minutes as the i was checking in after the actual scheduled departure and they had closed the desks in the terminal. why this was not rescheduled is still a mystery. as i was worried about the connecting flight i was assured by the staff that i shall get a connecting flight 3 hours later. the flight is 5 hours and the business class seats are just a little better than economy as far as leg room is concerned. so in my cramped space i was sitting all the way five hours and dozing off as it was past midnight with no sleep. the crew never served breakfast. that was surprising and there were no amenities like toothbrush etc. the second part was even more interesting. on reaching the transit counter i was told that 200 flight is full and change is not possible. so i was offered a flight 5.5 hours later. which again was delayed by almost an hour. the lounge is just functional and does not allow you to rest as their are no reclining seats. i was wondering why a transit hotel was not provided. i did not expect a better business class seat in short leg of 2 hours from kuala lumpur to jakarta. on board as i had booked special avml meal i was told that no such booking exist. they had not transferred my preference in changed flight. so i remained hungry all the way. so over all i remained seated for 15 hours through the night and almost a full day with small snacks in lounge as i have special meal requirement. on landing my baggage was missing so i wasted half hour waiting on belt and then half hour to register the missing baggage. it was delivered next morning at the hotel which was some relief.    flew london heathrow to kuala lumpur. i have been a long standing passenger with malaysia airlines for well over a couple of decades. through this time the airline has had several ups and downs which were also experienced by passengers such as myself. nevertheless i have continued to fly with the airline probably because of habit even though i have had reasons to complain on numerous occasions. i have now decided to put pen to paper here because of a recent complaint i submitted but did not even get an acknowledgement including to a followup mail. the issue i have now is that the airlines enrich loyalty scheme is not a loyalty scheme at all from my experiences. for example a few months ago i had an accumulation of about 160000 points. my flights were for the end of january 2017 and early february. the ticket was booked and paid for in early december. i requested to use my points for upgrade from economy to business but was told i had to be on the waitlist and there was one other person ahead of me. i followed up on numerous occasions and on each occasion was informed that i was till on the waitlist. while still on the waitlist i had well over 20000 points which expired at the end of december. i remained on waitlist till the time of my checkin for my flight in early february when i was informed there is an upgrade seat to business available. i accepted the offer. however what is the point of being upgraded with my points at the last moment. it did not enable me to utilise the benefits such as baggage allowance etc. this is an example of why the airline enrich loyalty scheme is not a loyalty scheme for loyal customers. \\r\\r\\n    jakarta to phuket via kuala lumpur. i choose this airline because it was a full service carrier with comfortable departure times and it was quite cheap. there are several positive sides such as there was always a hot meal on every flight the entertainment system was working on 3 out of 4 flights good enough. however there are a lot of negative sides such as the impoliteness of the fa was shocking the poor selection of drinks no wine at all the dirtiness of the plane as it looks it has never been cleaned and the persistent delays  3 out of 4 flights were delayed. however the ground crew at klia was quick to approach us and transfer us to our plane to jakarta.    london to kuala lumpur. my first time in the a380 think i prefer the boeing 787 but will give it a few more goes before making a final decision on that. check in was efficient no issues there. cabin crew not impressed. food was ok. water nonexistent i had to go hunting for it all the time. toilets filthy. entertainment system adequate at best. no wifi. power connector did not work.  i would fly again but only if very cheap.    bangalore to seoul via kuala lumpur. the flights are basic 737 the options on inflight entertainment are limited. though the food was just okay they had no option of selecting the food type indian veg type during the check in process or at least the food type selected.  even though i booked through the veg food my travel from malaysia to korea the crew has no info on this. flight maintained the timing on departure and arrival. select this flight if the service is given to your city to connect to malaysia.    singapore to kuala lumpur. we encounter 40 minute delay for depart due to the plane arrive late. besides that not so bad overall the cabin staff provide good services. there one highlight which mas alway have promotion and price even cheaper than budget airline value for money for ticket.    melbourne to kuala lumpur. my table was broken and inclined to front of me but crew still put my meal. meal slipped off to my side so i have to hold the meal during i have the meal. crew was aware of this occurrence however she pretended not to see and denied clear my table even after i finished eat. also served cutlery was only knife and spoon for chicken steak. after arrived at klia our baggage was supposed to be priority as one world sapphire member however first baggage was cabin crew and our baggage was no priority tag and almost final baggage. i was really disappointed with this airline and i shall not choose this airline next time.    london heathrow to kuala lumpur. worst service ever on this route to date 30 april mh 003. as a frequent flyer on this route i have noticed if the women are in charge of the service red uniform all will go well. if the men are in charge then look out you are in for bad service. this flight usual seat front cabin of 3 rows upper deck. orders taken for main course but not for starters to be informed they do not have my choice very strange but not the end of the world however other rows asked after me were offered all meals despite me being told they had run out then when the meals come out and ask what starter again told they had run out  but the 2 other rows after me were offered all choices it might be a coincidence but the rows after me were both malaysians and maybe travelling as staff or family of staff as throughout the flight they were constantly getting meals and drinks without having to ask please sort it out as there are other airlines to chose     kuala lumpur to penang. we left on time which is a plus. old plane very tight seating very little leg room. drop down screens for safety video. no checks prior the lady next to me was holding her bag prior to take off. we were given a juice and peanuts after take off. the flight was uneventful although being so squashed i was glad it was just for an hour.   melbourne to kuala lumpur return. good price day flights generous 30kg baggage allowance and ability to check bags ahead the day before at klia the 242 seating is great for couples. flight to kl left 30 min late but arrived early. the seat was narrow but had good leg room. the ife was very slow to respond and the annoying ads before each show whether movie or tv show was annoying. the movies were either old or mostly detective  murder  action  sci fi. we got peanuts and a choice of juice soon after take off. food was served about an hour or so into the flight choice of chicken curry or basil fish. we were in row 24 four up from the toilets which reeked. quiet flight though no screaming kids. a pizza thing was served before landing congealed and barely lukewarm inedible. there were no landing cards to be filled in before arrival. its all biometric. first time ive experienced that. returning started poorly in the holding pen at klia i needed the toilet. the gate agent said hed hold my boarding pass and id collect it from him on my return. long wait in line up but finally got back to him and he had lost it said he gave it to a friend at the desk who had left. made me sit by the door till all passengers had gone through and boarded. was getting worried by now. i did know my seat number though. eventually he sat at a computer and gave me a print out. the plane was newer than the one we flew up in and the ife more responsive. still annoying ads. the brunch was minimal in size a quiche and two cakes. before landing we got given a pastry thing. we landed an hour earlier than scheduled. would i fly with them again doubtful. keep your expectations low if flying with them.    singapore to hyderabad return via kl. my baggage was delayed on both onward and return journeys.  flight from sin to kl was delayed leaving 50 min to take the kl to hyd flight. however flight was delayed by 20 min so i thought there was time 1 hr 10 min to transfer baggage. but baggage not delivered. i had to wait for nearly 40 hours and endless calls to have my baggage finally delivered. and it happened during my return journey too. this time baggage delivered the same day. malaysia airlines refused to apologise and offer me even the basic compensation.  mh refused me compensation as i was travelling to india with an indian passport.     the flight from kuala lumpur to london had incompetent and lazy staff who were not interested in customers. they just did their bit and no more the seats were shabby with broken ife handset foot locker broken. i used the book the cook. it was awful so i asked for something else only to be told there was only a pack of nuts left and no other food of any sort. there used to be a place close to the stairs on the top deck where you could help yourself to soft drinks snacks and a magazine. not now nothing there empty. when i fly thai or singapore airlines on a long haul the staff are constantly coming round with water or a juice. not malaysia airlines not once did a member of staff walk through the business class aisle to ask or serve anyone. i fly quite a lot to south east asia and many times with mh but this was the last time the company has gone down hill fast. their customer services are slow to answer emails if at all. my luggage was damaged in transit and they have admitted liability i have email verification from their claims dept. they offered me a renumeration package which i accepted but i have yet to receive it.     flew kuala lumpur to sydney. one hour late departing no apologies. two of the toilets were out or order very long queues to use the one at the rear of the aircraft. food was awful. check in was awful. i had to ask six times for my preferred seat. i know it was a night flight but that should not excuse the lack of response when i press the call button. however in 18 flights with malaysia airlines this is the only bad one.   horrible services from hyderabad to melbourne via kuala lumpur with malaysia airlines. poor quality food seating is a horrible experience. one should think twice before booking with this airlines. they are reluctant to serve water also. even the staff are very rude and behave cheaply. i traveled in business class and the seats are horrible you can imagine about the economy class.    siem reap to kuala lumpur. food was good seats were ok. cabin staff service was horrible. i asked the male attendant for a blanket he forgot.  i then waved for another attendant who came out from the business class cabin and asked her for a blanket. to my surprise she said this cabin is not under her told me to ask the flight crew which is in charge of my cabin.    singapore to kuala lumpur. i have been flying malaysia airlines mas for many years and also used many various other airlines. mas pales in comparison with many other airlines while the prices are cheap. i have observed the quality of the service from comfort of seat to meals served going down. the punctuality of the airline is questionable with my flight departing 80 mins late.   had a horrible night flying with malaysia airlines. first i booked for mh804 kuala lumpur to manila scheduled to fly 3rd september 5.30 pm. at first we were informed that our flight will be delayed for two hours due to adverse weather around airport. we were ok with this. however after around 3.5 hours there was no information about the status of the flight. the gate crew did not know what was the status of the flight where is the plane and where is the cabin crew. the induty manager was unreachable. there was neither food nor water provided during this period. bad thing is that we had elderly and babies among the passengers. then after 4 hours we were told that we can board the plane. we boarded then after 1 hour waiting in the plane no flying yet we were informed that the cabin crew apparently have exceeded their duty limit period and thus they have to make decision whether they were going to find replacement or cancel the flight. after waiting for one more hour inside the plane we were told that the replacement crew will be fling from singapore and we can fly at around 2 am in the morning. everyone were asked to step down from the plane. at least at this point they have decency to provide us flight meal. then came 2 am the replacement crew apparently could not make it so the flight have to be cancelled. some of us get lucky to be rebooked to mh806 flying next morning some others well i do not know what happened to them. no hotel room was provided some of us trying to make up rest at the airline lounge which is very bad. as a result i had to stay up all night miss important meeting in the next day and spend the following day on sick leave.    kuala lumpur to male via colombo. after booking a vacation in september 2016 to maldives on april 6th my wife called to check our seating arrangements. the mh agent said our connecting flight to male from colombo was cancelled to our surprise which meant we would have to have a 89 hour wait in colombo. knowing some friends were on this flight but book via sri lankan airlines we checked with them finding out the flight was not cancelled at all. then we called sri lanka airlines and they also confirmed the flight was fine. so my wife initially called mh customer service spending 34 hours 34 calls trying to sort out the problem. she was put on hold for hours only to be cut off. many times they promised to call back no call was ever returned. after her frustration i called similar responses on hold for over 4 hours 4 calls called hung up after being put on hold promises made for returned call etc. what was frustrating is that we told the agents clearly the flight was not cancelled why could they not escalate  on the date of our flight we went to the airport hoping possibly getting on our correct flight but when we went to sri lankan airlines they said they could not book us in.  no only was our 2nd flight changed but we could not even get on the flight we booked on. after back and forth between the two airlines  mh put us back on the flight which we booked and had never changed anyway by reissuing the ticket. after arriving in colombo we realized that the mistake of our 2nd flight would not be resolved and we had to wait 89 hours in the colombo airport. now to find out that our flight back to kl from colombo was moved 1 day.  we called long distance only to have the same issues with the customer service staff. on hold no answer no return call etc. the agents response was that they could not put us back on the same flight we booked as the rates went up amazing but we never changed the flight mh did.     kuala lumpur to london. this is a route i fly often and have done so for more than 20 years. never the class leader i have always considered malaysia airlines  to be a decent runner up but on this form service standards have taken a steep dive. two of my recent flights were cancelled at short notice without explanation or compensation and at some inconvenience. whilst re booking my cancelled flight the airline tried to charge me a change of flight fee. finally on board i was moved from my reserved seat by a charmless steward claiming a booking error. the food and beverage offer has declined markedly and cabin service generally has suffered. not sure what has changed in the last year or so at mas but there is plenty of strong competition on this route and having been a loyal customer of mas over the years i have finally voted with my feet. my next two bookings are with ba and singapore.    london to perth via kuala lumpur returning from melbourne  between june and august 2017. booked because of very good price but eventually got what i paid for. london  kuala lumpur  perth was a disaster to start with. those days malaysia airlines were upgrading their systems and no online checkin was available had to queue for roughly 2hrs 55 mins at heathrow try and imagine a queue for a packed a380 because 2 out 4 agents couldnt care less about the situation and decided to show up just 2 hrs prior to takeoff. i mean really you know you are going to get massive queues put more people to work for those 23 days of emergency. obviously flight was delayed roughly 80 mins  but arrived to kul with just a 30 mins delay. flight itself was less than remarkable. food bland entertaining system not brilliant seats just ok and i didnt like the cabin crews attitude as they all were rather uninterested and cold although not openly rude. one male member in particular acted like he was the owner of the airplane and was doing everybody a favor to be there. transit in kul was rather smooth and 737 to per left on time. one of the bags didnt make it to our destination despite the connection being quite comfortable and received that with the following flight  lucky i had insurance to cover the emergency expenses. melkul on a330. no delays same comments as above about foodcabin crew etc real problem for this flight was the state of the toilets. 34 hours into the flight they were filthy smelly and just disgusting and no one cared to clean them. been flying around the world and never seen something like that. kullhr on a380 luckily enough i had booked preferred economy seats on the upper deck and the flight was smooth. couldnt eat their food i tried but it was just awful but at least it departed on time crew were better than what i had gotten until then and they managed not to misplace my bags. all in all a rather disappointing trip. good if you want to save money but otherwise there are tons of better airlines out there.    kuala lumpur to melbourne. this airline is probably the worst airline we have flown for few reasons. the plane itself was quite old. the crew members were rude and abrupt and could not care less about the passengers throughout the flight  an example is when we had sat in the wrong seats by pure accident one of the flight attendants rudely exclaimed you are in her seat. she could have asked politely to check our boarding passes that we were in the correct seat or even said something like sorry but i think you may be in the wrong seats. we had no issues with changing the seats as it was an accident on our part but would have appreciated some politeness. after serving dinner and lights turned off for people to go to sleep we did not see a single crew member for about 45 hours this was an 8 hour flight. on other airlines on flights of this duration crew members walk down the aisles with glasses of water every hour or so which my family would have appreciated as we were quite thirsty. toilets did not seem to be cleaned throughout the flight and were in a terrible state a couple of hours before landing. headphones were taken off passengers 45 minutes before landing so inflight entertainment could not be used which is an issue particularly when travelling with kids. i have never seen this occur with any other airline. seats were small and uncomfortable. overall this was a terrible experience i would have been better off paying a little extra and travelling with a better airline. never again    kota kinabalu to kuala lumpur. my 2nd time engaging business class with them through plusgrade bidding.  however my impression change after boarding them and went to my seat. tired looking recliner seat. the plus side the seat pitch and width are above standard. service from crew member not impressive though. although flying domestic cabin crew service should be consistent. when come to food the quality is very disappointing. i opt for the seafood pasta. it was too oily to consume or inedible. no wonder other national airlines and international airlines already catching up and overtaking malaysia airlines. i really hope the new domestic business class seat will roll out soon.   flight attendant was very rude while serving water and only bought this after a second reminder. i am very disappointed with the quality of service especially inflight where it was delayed more than an hour to take off. i certainly dont recommend this airline to anyone with    flew london heathrow to manila via kuala lumpur. bad service throughout. as a one world emeraldba gold member and flying long haul x 2 per month i use all the one world carriers all with good efforts and service but on these 4 flights there was no recognition of member statusdirty tables no basics like a toothbrush on a 13.5 hr flight lost bag one of 15 on the same flight poor ground staff at kl. i complained and the reply was full of regret but no actual sorry and not any compoensation for the travel back to the airport for the lost bag etc.  so were a couple travelling brisbane to london via kuala lumpur currently seated in the air malaysia lounge in kl. the first leg is complete and failed to impress. not only did the breakfast egg option run out before seat row 6 but the coffee was horrendous and twice had sugar added when it was specifically not requested. although i am trying to be optimistic about the upcoming 13hr leg we have just confirmed that the attendant that checked us in 11hrs ago put us across the aisle from one another perfect considering my fiancÃ© is a nervous flyer. kuladl on 30th aug. ground staff at klia are appalling. after security there was only one person at the boarding gate to check boarding passes into the holding area resulting in a very long queue. no consideration given to people with babies and young kids. boarding was a free for all resulting in congestion once on the aircraft. fas were efficient but that was all. no smiles no interaction just the bare minimum. food was good but the portions were small. since it was a night flight they took too a long time serving the evening meal and that cut down on sleep time in what was a flight of 6 hours and 45 minutes. they would have been better off serving a snack and a drink and then lights off with a more substantial meal before landing. toilets were clean no announcements from the cockpit crew and avod was just mediocre. flew mel to bkk with a 2 month old a330 and a new 737. the standout was the new aircraft. the a330 was so comfortable modern and beautiful the seats were extremely comfortable for economy. however everything else was pretty poor most of all the cabin crew. they were horrific i never thought that cabin crew could be so rude to the point that it made passengers feel uncomfortable. the only reason i would fly with this airline is because of the new aircraft and its beautiful hub kul is always a pleasure to transit through. everything else was atrocious if you want service do not fly mas flight from kuala lumpur to melbourne 8913. plane a little dated but i can cope with this bad service however is a different story. just after meals were served i got quite a bad blood nose after which i fainted. my traveling companion recognised the need for me to lay flat and recoup. he quickly took our untouched meals to the stone faced stewardess to enable me to lay flat and asked for assistance she showed no concern for me whatsoever. when asked for some extra tissues she threw a couple of handtowels my way. we complained to the head steward who apologised and offered us our meals back which we declined. having flown over with british airways who were professional on every level it was very clear to me that there was an enormous difference between these similarly fared airlines. i will never fly malaysian airlines again. perkulbom in economy class on september 13th. perkul was on an a330300 and kulbom on the super congested 737800. the only meal served on the perkul leg was breakfast at 5am choice of quiche with sausage or rice with shrimp sambal since the flight had taken off at 1.30am. perhaps it was automatically assumed that people wouldve had a nice heavy dinner before boarding the plane. whilst the food served on the kulbom leg was good roti and chicken curry it was a bit disappointing to know that none of the fas spoke hindi which pretty much made it very hard for a few passengers who could not speak or understand english. overall i think mhs quality seems to have dropped a bit. kuladl 8th september. morning departure from adl. checkin was efficient and well handled by ground staff. boarding was very well managed by ground staff in adelaide. once on board the plane things were different. cabin crew were just plain disinterested had poor english skills and again there was minimal interaction. tray tables were dirty video screen was smudged and talk about a sticky in flight magazine pages were stuck together the food was mediocre this time and before landing a flight attendant went around barking seat belts seat belts this is a 5 star airline i think not. flew business class istanbulkuala lumpur in an aged boeing 777. the seats are not lay flat but angled very hard for me to get any sleep. service and menu was disappointing. this airline needs to move with the times on long haul the competition is doing a much better job and offering a better product. lhrkul a380. great check in given exit row seats for long legs. customer service was non existent like we were an inconvenience. prodded my wife in the shoulder to get her to put her seat upright. very little verbal anything and bad english when used. for a flight with 90 westerners i would have expected better. kulphuket on boeing 737 a shocker. cabin was filthy spent half the flight planning how i would clean it. will never fly with this carrier again. kulcdg on a380. the aircraft is nice and entertainment system was sufficient for the long flight. but the crews were terrible. poor services throughout the flight not attentive to the needs of passengers and when requesting anything seemed reluctant to provide anything. no smiles from the crew. definitely not a 5 star airlines with this kind of poor service. finished 5 domestic sectors with mas over the last two months kulsdkkul sbwkulsbwkul on old b734 and new b738 mas is certainly not a 5star airline anymore. having flown with so many other airlines in the past their services were not better than most of them. the male cabin crew were mostly rude and unhelpful. was this what you should expect from an airline who once claimed to have world best cabin crew. they are an ok airline but definitely not a 5star airline. melbourne to delhi on oct 1 and while melkul leg was okay  even though we were woken up a few hours before arrival into kl and offered a breakfast of rice and prawn the option was frittata had run out. the second kul del was the worst flight i have been on. we were sitting in a 737 which had only 2 toilets for the 120 passengers flight felt like a domestic short haul flight but ended up being a torturous long haul. i understand that there was a delay due to unforeseen circumstances. the crew were far too young and far too involved in their own chatter at the back of the plane people had to go up to ask for water and biscuits. flight was bumpy so the seatbelt light was on and no tea or coffee could be served. i asked for sprite and it had run out. when the seatbelt sign went off we had to ring the call bell to ask for tea and coffee. it was a very unpleasant experience  and one that has me convinced that something has gone downhill in this supposedly five star airline it was the first time i had flown malaysia and there wont be a second. i had tried to web check in exactly 48 hours before on my return and found most seats blocked. kuladl melkul business class. mas adelaide checkin for return trip failed to provide the fasttrack immigration pass needed in melbourne and was rudely ejected from fasttrack queue despite showing business class boarding pass. queued over 30mins in slow lane. seats when fully reclined are very uncomfortable. on return flight only one particularly rude fa insisted that small bag in foot well be stowed for takeoff and landing. never seen this before. mas impossible to get hold of by phone despite promised callback service. flew kulmel on their new a330. nice and modern cabin. good selection of inflight entertainment except for the annoying ads at the start of every movieshow. however the cabin crew were appalling they seemed uninterested and made their passengers felt like they are a burden. travelled from bangalore to singapore and singapore to delhi last week both ways stopped at kl. i must say that quality has gone down very much compared to 20089. the staff is not at all caring. the food was very oily. the staff is more concerned about finishing their tasks and are not really concerned about customer. empathy is totally missing. ist to kul in business october 2013. flight delayed 7 hours due to technical problem on the ageing 777200. we were bussed to a nearby hotel but hotel and especially food provided was of low quality. once we did take off the plane was showing its age although i found seat pitch generous and slept ok on the angled lie flat seat. no champagne before take off and no satay which they brag so much about. the older all male crew were efficient but not warm or attentive. ife pretty poor compared to ba emirates etc. amenity bag small but adequate. their a380 may be better but overall the experience fell a long way short of market leaders. kulmel 6 oct mh 129. been travelling malaysia airlines regularly over 20 years now have noticed their inflight catering and staff attitude some of them is getting worse and rather appalling. they need to start treating all economy passengers much better. recent flights got served a snack from  to australia flights. dried pastry overcooked and almost inedible lucky to get a second drink if you needed one. very disappointing. they could take a tip from air asia staff. melkul in business. disappointing flight with very little attention from crew who had the annoying habit of talking to you with their heads turned away. it meant that they had to begrudgingly repeat what theyd said much to the frustration of all. how they won worlds best cabin crew is inconceivable. angled lie flat seat comfort ok. drinks haphazard. pillows a joke  so thin youd get more support using the blanket. meals surprising  a feta cheese pie and orange juice for dinner more in keeping with a budget carrier. below average airline for the price they charge. the much cheaper air asia was better in service. some seats wouldnt push back absolutely no inflight entertainment in kulhyd sector and average food. had a bad experience with the staff not wanting to checkin a hand baggage at the gate a request that most airlines would accommodate. heathrowkuala lumpursydney. after boarding at heathrow the entire a380 stayed on the tarmac for 4 hours due to a failure to lodge the flight authorisation form with heathrow. this delay means that after a 13hr flight to kl we missed our connecting to sydney. no one on the plane was able to assist passengers that needed connecting flight and upon arrival at kl no one helped with the transfer counter either. ground staff were incredibly rude unhelpful and tried to refuse us food vouchers. they simply handed us a computer printout and told us to go to cathy pacific counter for a boarding pass. turns out they stuck us on a flight from kl to hong kong then to sydney. that flight was full and we were sent back to line up again with malaysia airlines. this happened twice more and it was 4 hours standing at the transfer counter before we were put on a flight to singapore then sydney. when we arrived in sydney 12 hours later than the original flight our checked in bags were missing. turns out our bags were still in kl. no apology. travelled cokkulmel mh129 oct 2013. the 737800 on the cokkul sector was congested but the 777 on the kulmel sector was okay. inflight service was perhaps the worst we have encountered. the catering was most noticeable as meals were insufficient and no choice of drinks. malaysia airlines is cost cutting even on tea and coffee. i suppose you get what you pay for. will never travel malaysia airlines again. laxnrtlax economy. i purchased the ticket while they were on special offer the fare was very reasonable. larnrt check in staff were not friendly aircraft was old but the seat was comfortable. entertainment system crashed twice and the sound and screen quality was bad. inflight service was okay and the food was average. nrtlax check in very slow. poor entertainment service and the flight attendant who delivered our meals dinner and breakfast was disrespectful. i wouldnt recommend this airline. what an absolutely noncustomer service focused airline. never again will i fly with malaysian airlines. it was the first and last time. normally i fly with singapore or emirates but had seen some reviews saying that malaysian was good. how wrong could you be. 19 hours delayed bag lost. when i missed our connection due to delays not one person from malaysian made any effort to help over 20 people also delayed with me. i arrived terminal 1 heathrow was told to go to the tranist area in terminal 4 where i was turned away by security. i then had to return to terminal 1. i then queued for an hour at least before i was told to go landside for assistance. this then took four hours before i was rebooked. i was then given some pittance value food vouchers that were only eligible in a terminal i was not departing from. then even though the staff had over 9 hours before i departed on my rebooked flight with etihad i was told on departure my bags would not make it. my single stop trip had also been turned into a 2 stop trip which added another 68 hours. no help whatsoever when they lost my bag just left at an airport in australia with no clothes. pay a little extra and travel with singapore airlines. sinkulakl. i dont think they deserve to be classified as s 5 star airlines i traveled with thai airways from singapore to auckland and their plane was much newer better food and flight attendants were friendlier. i boarded a very old boeing 737 from singapore to kul with connecting flight from kl to auckland. the aircraft from singapore to kl was old with many of the seat arm rests torn off. some staff were not friendly we were served a dried pastry overcooked and almost inedible and the inflight entertainment took a long time to work after take off. a real disappointment. lhrkulbne. thankfully only one way. having flown singapore airlines emirates kingfisher air asia malaysian airlines were a real disappoint. most disappointing was the customer service which was badly lacking. very strict on luggage limits. poor food service taking a long time after take off to serve no regular checks on passengers for drinks or food and generally unfriendly. perhaps the cabin crew were having a bad day but given the choice of competitors we wont be flying this airline again. travelled cokkulmel mh129 oct 2013. the 737800 on the cokkul sector was congested but the 777 on the kulmel sector was okay. inflight service was perhaps the worst we have encountered. the catering was most noticeable as meals were insufficient and no choice of drinks. malaysia airlines is cost cutting even on tea and coffee. i suppose you get what you pay for. will never travel malaysia airlines again. kulhkgkul economy class on a380. full flight both ways. boarding at kul was chaotic due to change of departure gate at the very last minute which also resulted in late departure from kul. assigned seat was taken by another passenger and was informed by the passenger that the stewardess told her to seat there. had to wait for almost 10 minutes while the cabin crew rearranging the seating according to the seat number stated on the boarding pass. meals were good on both sector. ife crashed 3 times and the supervisor only managed to fix the problem onehour before touchdown at hkg. cabin crew were not interested in their job. hong kong to kl to adelaide a bad day for malaysia airlines. scheduled departure 240pm but major delay to aircraft arriving. departure estimated to be 430pm but eventually closer to 600pm. captain cited technical issues but no other explanation. flight ok up until half hour out of kl. entered holding pattern due to traffic conditions at klia. we were not too concerned as we had experienced something similar flying in from adelaide a few days earlier but by now we had eaten up our 4 hour transit to catch a connection home. after 3 or 4 circuitsthe copilot announced some unexpected news that we were diverting to penang due to the fuel situation. we proceeded to penang with a later assurance that we had plenty of fuel to get there. in my experience most airlines have problems from time to time with weather equipment and other factors out of their control but it is how they handle the situation and their paying customers that is a true measure of their quality. this situation unfortunately highlighted some deficiencies with malaysian airlines systems and processes. we got plenty of apologies but not much more. on landing at penang we were given very little information about what would happen. we got the usual announcements about not moving until the seat belt light goes out but nothing about what would happen next. passengers gathered their possessions and stood up expecting to disembark but silence. eventually after about half an hour the pilot announced that the flight crew had exceeded their allowed flying time and another crew would need to be flown up from kl to fly the aircraft back and this would be about 1230am  we landed at about 930pm. so there we sat for 3 hours. the cabin crew were conspicuous by their absence and it was hard to identify anyone in charge. very little attempt was made to make an effort to look after the comfort of the passengers and almost no information or updates were passed on until the replacement crew arrived around midnight. of course the headphones had been collected before landing so we could not pass the time watching a movie. it was possible to go and get a drink from the galley if you were able to get past the groups of agitated passengers. eventually we left around 1am and arrived at 2am at kl. on arrival we were given vouchers for hotel and taxi and boarding passes for a flight to adelaide the following evening and pushed out of the airport without our luggage. i suppose we should be grateful that malaysian airlines found accommodation for us but it was in a village called sepang about half an hour from the airport and while rated 3 stars i think this would be rather optimistic. i could not help thinking that this was a pretty cheap effort and this was reinforced by the expression on the face of one of the ground staff who asked us where we had been accommodated. in the end we arrived home 24hours late and minus one bag. this experience raised many questions about malaysia airlines commitment to passenger satisfaction and comfort their cabin crew organisation the suitability of klia as a hub their fueling policies and procedures and their management in general. it is hard to imagine a circumstance where i would consider travelling with them again. adelaideklphuket return. firstly they ran late for every flight. no drinks regularly offered you had to ask constantly for water cups of tea and coffee served with powdered milk. the food is disgusting dried up pastry sausage roll. the meals were awful and half the food was left off my husbands tray. our final journey kl to adelaide i just wanted to cry i was so uncomfortable in my seat. over the years malaysia airlines is going bad. the service is one of the worst i have ever had. heard a lot of people say the cabin crew treat asians differently if compared to europeans. i guess where you come from affects their service towards you. everything in malaysia airlines is downgraded the comfort the services the food etc. although i do undertake around 10 longhaul trips per year this trip from kuala lumpur to amsterdam was my first leg with malaysian airlines. it was a bit of a disappointment as i had been looking forward to a new experience. i felt the cabin service was not of the quality expected and experienced with most other airlines. there was no eye contact and no smiles. there was an air of impatience too if a request for say a choice of main course required a second look at the menu. i just felt my server just wanted the chore of serving passengers to be completed as soon as possible. having said that the flight was conducted professionally with pretake off and landing checks in the cabin being completed diligently. i hesitate to recommend but this was of course a first time experience perhaps future trips would be better. i decided to go with malaysia airlines instead of jetstar because you get full service meals drinks entertainment etc but it was a horrible old plane food inedible costing me around 1000 from melbourne to phnom penh. rude staff uncomfortable seating economy poor selection of entertainment. coming back to melbourne i was seated at the back right next to the toilets smelt horrible. never again. horrendous experience flying from london via kuala lumpur to yangon. flight mh3 was delayed by over 22 hours from 10.50 on 81113 to 09.00 on 91113 following a technical issue causing it to return to kuala lumpur. there was no attempt at warning anyone who was already checked in not to leave home very early to get to the airport even when the travel agent had over 25 people travelling. unfortunately it then got worse. returning to the airport on 91113 i was unable to check in because no onward flights from kuala lumpur to yangon were booked or available even though the previous day we had been reassured it would all be done and the travel agent had also been reassured. for the next 4 hours i had to queue at customer services hoping i wouldnt lose another day of my holiday. all they really seemed to want is for me to cancel the flight and go away. eventually i travelled on thai airways and bangkok airways to yangon who were great but the planes was full because of malaysia airlines. my luggage even managed to keep up. i tried to complain at kuala lumpur airport on my return journey but even the duty manager was not interested. the last few times i travelled with malaysia airlines they were really good but i wont bother again not after this experience. sydkullgkkulsyd firstly the long haul flights. sydkul flight was on an aged b777200 with small television screens and old broken seats. kulsyd flight was on a fairly new a330300. the return flight landed 30 minutes late primarily due to the fact that it took the ground crew an hour to board the plane. on both flights the cabin crew were rude surly and inefficient. the food was generally appalling especially the sausage roll served two hours before landing and poorly planned with wine served mid morning and tea served in the afternoon. drink runs were lacking on the both flights especially the return flight where i had to suggest that the cabin crew make one and even then they missed several rows of seats. the kullgkkul flights were both serviced by extremely old b737400. the fact that mas still operates these planes is a disgrace. the interior was extremely dated the seats were broken and the air conditioner works poorly on the ground. the return flight landed 45 minutes late in kul due to problems with the air conditioner. the cabin crew were younger and generally more pleasant on these flights. overall mas is inconsistent the cabins are dirty and i am baffled how it achieved the 5 star airline status. brisbane to kl 15 november 2013 and returned on 23 november 2013. travelled to penang on 20th november and left penang for kl and then to brisbane on 23 november. malaysia airlines is one of the worst to fly with. the service is poor and on the trip there was no dinner given to passengers. no drinks were offered and when i asked for water it was ignored. on the way back we got no food except for a snack and then the meal was served just an hour before the plane landed at brisbane airport. i wont be flying them again. disappointed with the services. travelled from phuket to kuala lumpur on mh787. the meal that i had preordered was not provided. i ordered a seafood meal and got the vegetarian meal the flight attendant said there was nothing but pasta left  tasted horrible. when i asked for orange juice the flight attendant said all she had left was apple juice. no apologies just take it or leave it. when i requested headphones i was told the flight was too short so i watched a silent movie for 1.5 hours. however on the flight i took from kuala lumpur to phuket headphones were given to all passengers without requesting them. i dont expect this kind of service from a 5 star airline. kuala lumpur  ho chi minh. my family and i took a 2 hour flight to ho chi minh for our christmas vacation on the latest boeing 737800 plane. however the flight was not pleasant at all. the plane had poor ventilation and it was an afternoon flight and as the sun shone through the cabin it made the cabin very stuffy and warm. meal on board had 2 varieties for economy class a chicken and a fish. the stewardess attitude does not even reflect what mas to claim best cabin crew or malaysian hospitality. she barely smiled. disappointed. mh17 amsterdamkuala lumpur 3 january 2014 business class on 777. seat was outdated and uncomfortable. cabin crew were not helpful and attentive. catering was really bad and disappointing. garlic bread was inedible and hard as a rock. meals were ordered through chefoncall but was given different meals. cabin crew replied maybe they thought rice and potatoes were the same when i asked about the meal. ife was not updated and still showing last month movies and tv programs. definitely not a 5star airline. travel very frequently using domestic route kulbki. im not a fan of airline food they are all bland especially when you are travelling domestic economy. but this particular trends get my attention. back in 2011 the food was very good 2 selections of malaysian dishes chicken or fish with dessert normally kit kat and fruit slices. then in 20122013 the fruit slices were gone. my latest trip on 68 jan 2014 we were given only the main dishes no dessert  appetizer. looks like they are not even trying to improve the main dishes and lack of creativity. not sure if this is the cost cutting measure they are trying to pull but it is not worth the money you are paying for full service carrier. and the cabin crew for domestic flight is ok since theres no other fsc operating on that route. the enrich miles program is good though love it when they made miles promotion last december. but ive seen better from the other carriers. peramsper in business. malaysia airlines feels like a cut price airline rather than 5 star. fare competitive and significantly less than other carriers. lounges substandard especially in kl. no alcoholic drinks pre takeoff. 777 quite old and seats angled although reasonably comfortable. service variable professional on outward and staff called you by name. unpolished and unfriendly on way back. food terrible brunch of vegetable fritatta with chicken sausage truly revolting and almost the only meal i havent been able to eat in my life most carriers would consider this meal too substandard to serve in any class let alone business. malaysia is ok if you are paying a discounted fare but avoid it otherwise. took return flights to australia via kl. dont understand how ma qualify for 5 star rating. outbound flights 17 oct were both night flights from heathrow and kl mh001 and mh123. first time travelling business class and didnt come up to expectations. crew were noticeable by their absence and surly when present. hospitality from the crew was minimal and not a smile in sight. quality and choice of the food was disappointing lacking imagination. return flights from melbourne 04 dec via kl. both daytime flights mh148 and mh004 crew were much better they seemed to want to deliver a good personable service making both return flights more enjoyable. unfortunately the food again lacked imagination and therefore disappointing. to summarise standards of the crews on aircraft are inconsistent so its pot luck whether you have an enjoyable flight or not and food was consistently poor. flew melbourne to london return. experience inferior to that 4 years ago. paid extra for seat choice. change of aircraft type meant chosen aisle seat became middle of 3. service very impersonal. would prefer quality food not quantity. flew business class january 2014 it was a special price. we usually fly qantas or singapore. no comparison in terms of inflight entertainment and seat comfort i found the staff of malaysian hit and mostly miss. on our kl to mumbai the staff were so disinterested it was almost amusing. i rarely eat the food my companions commented it was reasonable and all agreed. inflight entertainment outdated and seat recline was good flat position was uncomfortable if you can get the special price its worth it otherwise i would not be happy paying full price for this level of service. on time was always good. flew sydney to kl then kl to mumbai colombo to kl then kl to sydney. london to australia via kl and return journey. food was bland and the crew surly and rushed. have had much better service with other airlines. thumbs down. flew business class perth australia to paris france in dec 2013 and back in jan 2014. terrible experience both ways. malaysia airlines delayed flights to london frankfurt and paris for a handful of passengers delayed arriving in from jakartasingapore the stories differed and showed no care that hundreds were inconvenienced when they should have instead rebooked those few late passengers. noone took responsibility to help with onward travel plans that were now destroyed. meals not great not enough food to ensure your choice was met. movies poor choice. on return trip a wailing child in the small economy section behind business class meant i could not sleep. it wailed for at least 9 hours. i paid for business class for the supposed comfort and experience. let me tell you it is not worth it. even had a crew member tut at me when i wasnt immediately ready with my breakfast choice never mind she appeared out of nowhere with no warning that they were collecting breakfast choices. lounges very poor  terrible toilet facilities and food just not up to scratch. i am extremely disappointed. flying kulcgk route mh very disappointing. still using an old b737800 aircraft. cabin interior looks old and boring. the seat cannot be recline. the meal was very simple only rice curry fish and boiled vegetable which had no taste. the service was very slow. passenger beside me order a nescafe one hour before landing. however up until landing the plane was still not served. staff apologized and offered the salted nuts snack. no entertainment on board this was an international route and a 2 hour flight. travel from sydneykl mh142 and klsydney. everything was just average the food being served was horrible i will not consider using this airline in the future. travelled economy class from kl to melbourne mh147 on 6 jan 14. service was below average. food was awful. toilets were dirty. my wife and i flew from manila to kuala lumpur on january 30 2014. the checkin process is very antiquated. long lines are not managed at all. sure baggage allowance is generous. but inflight service is atrocious. food was terrible. attitude of the staff was indifferent  they just did not care. we were glad when the flight was over. mh 126 per to kul in a330. relatively new aircraft that was the only positive point. boarding staff at the terminal were rude. the mh cabin crews were very indifferent and disinterested. i asked for a snack prior to take off but was not given anything no excuses given did the same with qantas and was given plenty. meal was served with two main choices terribly bland. that was the only thing served throughout the entire 5 hours flight. staff did not do their beverages round. bad taste for ife. all in all i think this would be my last trip with the mh. i am not impressed at all flew kl to melbourne late last saturday night. had been offered and received a boarding pass for this leg of the trip the previous day in yangon. at that time id been asked if i wanted a window seat to which id replied that i did. when i got on the flight i found myself squashed in the middle of the row two people each side. the seat didnt recline and the inflight entertainment didnt work for most of the journey. this was the most uncomfortable flight i have ever been on and definitely would not recommend malaysia airlines to anyone. flew kl to denpasar 9th feb. rude check in clerk altered our pre booked seating allocation separating my family of 4  i had booked these seats 6 months in advance. cabin crew equally unhelpful. they left the seat belt light on for the entire trip. when i approached the business class cabin crew to use the lavatory urgently i was told to go back to my economy seat and wait. for a supposed full service airline there is no service. kl to brisbane on mh135 on a330. checkin was efficient and the flight left on time. during the 8 hour flight we only had one meal. it was announced that there was a choice of fish pasta or chicken curry. my wife and i were both looking forward to the chicken curry. when the trolley arrived the hostess told us that they had run out of chicken curry. when she saw the disappointed look on our faces she told us it was the pasta or we go without. we both chose the pasta which turned out to be bland and awful. the cabin crew just couldnt be bothered serving passengers. we barely saw them during the entire 8 hour flight. the entertainment was average. also i had never been on a flight where announcements were made so frequently. they were made twice in english and malay. if you were trying to sleep or use the inflight entertainment these constant announcements were annoying. i will not fly malaysian airlines again unless the price is extremely cheap. i flew business class last dec from kl to perth return 3 adults and 1 infant. i must say i was very disappointed with the service. service was slow our food was extremely salty thus inedible. they did not give me the baby food that i had pre ordered. i am now having trouble with my seating arrangements and customer service has been very slow to rectify this problem. mh 171 ktmkul 21 feb. the cabin crew were not very interested in service and completely disappeared after the meal was served. i could hear the chatter and laughs from the galley and also saw them using tablets in full view of the passengers. unprofessional. mh002 sgnkullhr on 737800 and on a380 for the london leg. good service from ho chi minh. nice food and nice plane im used to ryanairs version of the 737800. disappointing service on the longhaul to london. cabin attendants failed to clean up a full glass of red wine which was spilled all over the exit door in front i was in 74a which is a window seat without another seat in front. incidentally this seat isnt worth paying extra for unless you are over 6 foot tall  the tray table and console are poor. passenger in 73 left wine on the flimsy tray table he had similar bulkhead style traytable as me which then got propelled across cabin due to turbulence. took several attempts to get steward to clean it up. will be avoiding malaysia airlines in future. leaving frankfurt 19th feb arriving 20th feb. mh 5. i have just returned from new york via frankfurt with 2 different airlines of which one was malaysia. i really have to say that it now feels like a different airline. in short i feel that the cutting cost is obvious. i feel the spirit of the crew is not there. kuldxbkul. airport check in staff were good check in was quick. flight en route to dxb was 30 mins delayed but arrived on time. flight back to kul was on time and arrived 30 minutes early. outbound stewardesses did not smile at all and did not showing much interest in customer and comfort  disorganized team. otherwise return flight fas were attentive. food for lunch was soso and sandwich was awful. ife was good and functioned well. all in all sad to say nothing special about mh and it was average. we flew from amsterdam to kuala lumpur and back from denpasar to kuala lumpur and from there to amsterdam on 18 feb 2014. the flight amsterdam  kuala lumpur had decent service and friendly staff. however the return journey from denpasar to kuala lumpur was a disappointment. staff were bland and ignored your wishes. even worse was the journey between kuala lumpur and amsterdam. the food was distributed quickly the lights did not work which meant we could not read our book. we had different expectations of this airline. i am a frequent flyer. having flown 6 sectors with malaysian over christmas and new year i have enough experience to make a judgement. the cabin crew are generally inefficient and disinterested. the food is mediocre breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks. despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors i was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance. no safety demonstration given on 2 flights. they failed to honour a bulkhead seat reservation that they charged me extra for due to a change of aircraft and instead gave it to someone else. flight from kuala lumpur to seoul mh 0066 on 15 feb 2014 and seoul to kuala lumpur mh 0067. mh 0066 flight was delayed 3 hours because of a problem with the cargo we were sat on the plane waiting. mh0067  the cabin crew were not very interested or friendly during service. i have flown hundreds of time on various airlines and have never felt the inclination to leave a bad review until now. we flew from melbourne to hanoi with malaysia just a few days ago and it was an experience not to be savoured. the staff were very unhelpful when i asked if there were any rows of seats available after take off i was promptly told that by the flight attendant that she didnt know and that i should walk to the rear of the plane and check for myself this was despite the fact she had just walked the aisle several times prior. generally the staff were very unfriendly and unhelpful. then the food arrived it was the worst dinner i have seen on a plane  needless to say we skipped dinner. all in all i would not fly with this airline again as i know what great service can be found on others like emirates etihad or qatar. perkulams in january. the cabin crew were rude no smiles and not friendly at all. it was as though us passengers were a major inconvenience for them. like so many negative reviews about malaysian airlines the seatbelt sign stayed on almost the entire flight despite smooth flying. passengers were ignoring the seatbelt sign and would leave their seats and the cabin crew ignored it. we booked 2 seats together yet when we checked in we were separated for some unknown reason. the meal was awful. that was my last flight with malaysian airlines. my wife and i travelled on flight mh 120 to kota kinabalu ex perth western australia 13th march 2014 and returned on march 23 2014 on mh 121. both these flights did not serve tea or coffee with the excuse that there was a safety reason. the crew was nowhere to be seen when departing the aircraft in perth except for the captain who said goodbye. we have travelled all over asia with a number of airlines and we have never had this type of service. sydkulhyd and return in economy. compared to the competition the level of service was not up to the mark. general attitude of staff was not friendly. though both the aircrafts were pretty new the quality of service only meant that the overall value was still lacklustre. food was ok and the choices were very limited. staff tended to be between neutral to rude. i stood up to stretch my legs on the flight when the seatbelt sign was off and was told by a crew member in a commanding tone to go back to my seat and sit down. it took at least 5 presses on the flight attendant button and 15 mins of waiting for them to serve a glass of water. dpskul b777 economy class. flight delayed 30 minutes and no information on the delay. cabin interior looked very tired. food was really awful and service was slow. cabin crew looked unhappy and surly. please avoid the airline unless the fare is extremely low. mh711 march 8 2014. flew from kuala lumpur to jakarta recently. flight was okay overall but it was not without its unpleasant moments. one of the lavatories at the back of the plane was out. as a result quite a large line formed after the food service. while i normally do not use the front lavatories as i know those are for business or first class i assumed given the circumstances it was justified. what followed was a very ugly scene with the flight attendant who accused me of lying about the lavatory being out of order. we argued for quite some time as well as while she called to confirm. only then would she let me use the restroom. i didnt appreciate being treated like a small child. i think it is highly unlikely that the lavatory broke midflight which means malaysia airlines undertook the flight knowing it was a toilet short of what it needed on a full flight. amskulsin and kulams. really disappointed would sum up my feelings. it was my first experience of mh we usually fly sq for our trips to the far east. dirty old looking plane that looked like it hadnt had a deep clean in years. very old entertainment system which seemed to go faulty throughout the flight to the annoyance of passengers and indifference of crew. outbound the crew seemed completely disinterested disappearing for hours after serving lunch much more friendly and professional crew on return trip but same stale hard product filthy toilets dirty worn out seats arm rest came apart and seat would not remain upright. food and beverages decidedly average with no choice on two of the four meals we had. would only fly again as a very last resort. mh003 and 135 on 10th feb. returned 13th march on mh134 and mh004. flight from heathrow to brisbane. poor quality food. staff reluctant to offer extra beverages especially on the outward leg from heathrow to kl. mumbai to perth with a stopover at kul. by far the worst experience ive had. the flight in mumbai was delayed by over 2 hours due to late arrival of incoming flight. finally staff started boarding and let passengers into the gates. however everyone was stopped from boarding and were kept waiting at the aerobridge for more than 1.5 hours there was little explanation with some staff talking amongst themselves about a technical problem. no one was allowed back into the terminal to use the toilets. had to run at kl with hardly 10 mins to catch the connecting flight. their seats are by far the most uncomfortable business class seats ive seen. the angular seats leave you with a terrible back ache. never again. i have travelled frequently with mas between london and kl for the past 4 years. throughout this time i have also travelled the same route with singapore airlines but had generally chosen mas as they fly direct. the general standard over the past 4 years on this flight has been consistently anything but pleasant. the standard of food is what you would generally expect in an economy cabin albeit served differently. the cabin staff are unwilling to serve anything alcoholic prior to departure i have tested this on every occasion i have flown. the seats fail to recline fully every time i point this out to the cabin staff ends with the same unsuccessful trial and error approach to rectification despite knowing that this is how they have been designed. on my last sojourn i wished to sit next to a colleague. the flight was fully booked but despite this the check in staff provided me with a boarding pass that was next to my colleague. shortly after boarding another passenger approach with a boarding pass which had also been issued for the same seat. the flights are consistently delayed. my last 3 flights have been delayed by 3 10 and 2 hours consecutively. as mas are the only carrier to fly direct from london to kl the cost of the flight is considerably more expensive more than flying with other airlines that are not able to fly direct. my last journey was the one that finally broke me in the future i will choose to fly via an indirect route as i cant tolerate the consistent level of service provided by mas any longer. used malaysia airlines to fly from london to australia. the flights were on time and the leg to kuala lumpur in the a380 was very comfortable. the food was very average and the service too. this airline is stated in this website as a 5 star airline but i dont think is up to that standard. the service compared with other airlines i flew before was nothing special. dehlikl 5th may. it has been a couple of years since we flew with malaysia and in the last 6 weeks have flown with them 4 times. on this flight i had to endure takeoff with the seat in front fully reclined. second time this has happened and a word to crew members is met with a shrug. food on all flights inedible. like the other flights no alcohol on offer was coke orange juice or water. i asked for water and got juice. attitude of fas unacceptable. although i live in malaysia i will avoid this airline wherever possible. flew from melbourne  jakarta. the ticket was cheap but service was poor no smile when serving food. we had our baby with us and wanted their help to heat up some milk but it took ages for the cabin crew to come when we pressed the call button. my family and i flew 3 sectors manlhr ba and lhrkuldps on 13th april on the a380. booked through mas. firstly nearly missed the flight as the domestic flight from manlhr had been brought forward by 2.5 hours mas had failed to notify us by email post or phone. it was only because i insist on being early that we made the flight on board mh3 first impressions of the a380 was of dirt and ingrained filth and unfriendly crew. the seatbacks were really grimy and gave the relatively new aircraft the impression of having never been cleaned. no menus or amenity kits. the toilets were average but not cleaned to a good standard. the meals were revolting. no salt and pepper. coffee offered before meal started. the childrens meals were just lasagne. no choice at all. no kids packs offered. drinks were poured into thimble sized glasses and the white wine was warm and vinegary. crew flung the meals out in a disinterested fashion. no drinks brought round in the flight at all. we had to keep asking the irritable crew who were sitting in the galley reading magazines with curtains pulled round for glasses of water. seatbelt signs on permanently and pointlessly since it was smooth as could be in the cruise. we kept hearing ladies and gentlemen as we are experiencing turbulence hot drink service will be suspended what hot drink service was that then i must have blinked. we flew mas in 2005 they have plummeted in standards since then. this time i chose them because they were excellent before and paid 710 per person this time around. what a big disappointment. flew 195 and returned 225 denpasar to kl. flight out on a 777200 the flight being on time was the highlight. have to say the meal service was the worst i have experienced. staff appeared confused and missed a few rows out completely. the meal was down sized to a hot meal only. return on a 737800 again on time and easier to use entertainment. the first drink serviced arrived and we were offered either a chicken or egg sandwich. this was the meal service for this full service airline. on asking if i could have a beer with that i was informed that this was a non alcohol flight. have to agree with geoffrey carver about the boeing 777 that mas still use. these belong in the scrapyard with the seats not even meeting premium economy standards. how do skytrax manage to maintain the 5star rating for the airline besides the cabin products looking old tired and often shabby the once fantastic cabin crew are now more often miserable and certainly not focussed on customer service. kuala lumpur to kota kinabalu. the positive point is only punctual operation. i was disappointed with the business class product. i dont understand the concept of using old 738 with no ife. what do you expect passengers will do with no ife on a 2.5 hr flight. the seat was fairly uncomfortable. the biggest let down was the food the food served in business class was awful. stewardess courteous but not attentive nor particular warm and friendly. flew sydkuldelkulmel. like most of the reviews i found that the cabin crew had no customer service and all seemed to hate their jobs. that being said i found everything else great. the aircraft  we had the a330 b737 and the b777  were great and all had personal entertainment screens. the entertainment on the international flights was excellent and on the kuala lumpur  delhi flights there wasnt as big of a selection but still good. i found the food great and alcohol was complimentary on all flights. i would definitely fly mh again. sinkul 737800 and kulakl 777200. as a one world sapphire card holder i was entitled to use the mh lounges in sin and kul. both were dated and featured a limited selection of refreshments. similarly both aircraft cabins were tired and filthy  scuffed walls carpets littered with crumbs torn seat covers etc. ife was ancient and featured only a limited selection of older movies. two hot meals were served and to be fair they were decent for economy. however the crew did not offer refreshments in between meals not even water. indeed both sets of crew i encountered were distant sullen & at times downright rude. prospective customers should be aware that mh is far from a 5 star airline these days. in fact i would rank it towards the lower end of 3 star carriers. would only consider mh again if the airfare was exceptionally cheap. kuala lumpur to kota kinabalu. the positive point is only punctual operation. i was disappointed with the business class product. i dont understand the concept of using old 738 with no ife. what do you expect passengers will do with no ife on a 2.5 hr flight. the seat was fairly uncomfortable. the biggest let down was the food the food served in business class was awful. stewardess courteous but not attentive nor particular warm and friendly. lhrkulbali and return. part on a380. my husband and i fly long haul regularly with close family living in australia. this is the first time we have flown malaysian and sadly will be the last. i was led to believe they were a good quality airline however the only positive i can say is the comfort of the seat with the fact they have a 34 pitch. everything else was either satisfactory or poor. the food compared to other airlines was awful and the service wasnt much better. there didnt appear to be enough cabin crew to do what they needed so when i dared to ask for another blanket because id spilt water on mine the stewardess was extremely rude to me stating she was too busy and id have to wait. when she did bring over she threw it at me and walked off i dont expect to be treated like that when i had been nothing other than polite. it wasnt as if we had used the call button for anything else. i flew them in june. unfortunately my travel experience was really bad. i say this mostly as the staff were unfriendly unapproachable and disdainful. the foodentertainmentseat etc were all pretty standard although i thought it might be better than average. the rudeness of the flight attendants was sadly on each of the 4 flights i took  melbourneklmanila and return. i asked for water and eyes were rolled i told them about the headphones not working and the lady argued with me. all staff appeared tired flustered and not happy to be there. flew economy from auckland to kl and then onto london on 20 june returned on 910 july. the 777200s on the akl to kl leg are in poor condition. seat covers were worn carpets dirty and stained tray was cracked and the lcd monitors had a poor picture quality. cabin staff were quite terse with passengers and a few did not have a good command of english. i asked for a dark rum and coke. the stewardess started pouring a bacardi and lemonade. advised her twice it was the wrong drink but she ignored me. passenger next to me asked for a can of lager and had to repeat himself three times before i pointed to a can of beer. food was barely edible with undercooked chicken and stale rolls. kl to lhr leg on the new a380s was better. planes are new and staff made an effort to be friendly. food was ok but only 3 drinks offered on a 13 hour flight. passengers were constantly asking cabin crew for water to stop dehydration. check in staff at akl was rather chaotic and some leadership is required to deal with passengers with excess luggage who were constantly holding up the queue. disappointed that passengers relatives were wandering in and out of supposedly off limits check in area. check in staff at london were terse and did not greet me with a hello or thank you. only positives were cheap fares and planes all left on time. sad to see a once top airline declining so badly. kuldps 737. dpskul 777. very odd seat layout on the 777 2x5x2 which ive never seen before. sandwiches looked revolting both ways didnt even unwrap them. rudest stewardesses ive ever seen surly abrupt and when the people opposite me requested blankets they were practically thrown at them. i can only assume their long haul product is in a different league. jakartaklguangzhou on 22072014 went smoothly. cabin food and staff were good average. on the way back we flew from hong kong to kl morning flight at 8.45am. it was on time. entered the cabin and was met by a very sullen tired and bored looking stewardess. cabin looked filthy. pillows were scattered on my seat and on the floor. table had some sort of dried stain. the seat cover in front of us was dirty. nothing babywipes couldnt wipe clean so why didnt whoever was in charge of cleaning the cabin do so a child tried to go to toilet while a stewardess was distributing food. blocked by her cart the boy waited for her to move. immediately she barked where do you want to go the boy looked surprised and pointed at the toilet behind her. she then moved the cart to the side a bit with a terribly bored look on her face and signed for the boy to squeeze through. not even a smile or the kindness and patience expected from fa. from kl we flew connecting flight to jakarta. aircraft looked old and tired. no ife at all. we had ife on the flight from jakarta to kl two weeks before but not today. it was a 1 hour and 45 mins flight with nothing to do but eat and sleep. needless to say in the future i will try my best to avoid this airline. the cheaper price doesnt justify their bad attitude. let me say that passengers who dont have infants and toddlers should not have these problems. we my wife my 2yr old son and my 6 month old daughter travelled to asia from australia. everything went fairly well on our way from australia to malaysia. we were allowed 3 pieces of hand luggage and 4 pieces of main luggage. almost all of our hand luggage was full of essential items. when we land in malaysia for the transit and are about to board the connecting flight we were told that we cannot take 3 pieces of hand luggage onboard as its a smaller flight. we had paid for 3 seats and a bassinet. however after arguing with the ground staff for 10 minutes they still would not let us take the last hand luggage in with us. when we got onboard the flight wasnt full. to add to the misery they had allocated seats for us in completely different places leaving my 2 year old by himself my wife in a completely different section by herself and me with my 6 month old in another section when i complained to the onboard crew they said that they were unable to help and that id have to speak to the passengers of the area where i wished to be seated and swap seats with them. our return flight wasnt the best either. no bassinet for the complete journey although we had fully paid and confirmed a month ahead of our journey. the excuse was that there were 9 infants on board and only 5 bassinets. my poor wife had to hold our 6 month old for over 12 hours in a cramped seat at one point my 2 year old was getting unsettled so i asked one of the stewardesses if they have any toys or kids activity books to keep my son occupiedentertained. she disappeared for about 15 minutes and came back with 4 packets of peanuts never again will i fly malaysia airlines. flew with mas from lhr to syd and back. first on a380 which was cosy then on b747 which was old and dated. seats were uncomfortable and staff were really rude. nothing compared to sq. food was woeful and not enough cabin staff to serve. wont fly with them again. ktmkulmnl return. the cost cutting is evident and so is the total lack of service from the fas. the 737800 operated in all the sectors were fine so was the ife. as soon as the sub standard meals were served the lights dimmed and the crew disappeared happy to chat and laugh out loud amongst themselves. for a 4 hrs 30 mins flight after the first hour i did not notice any crew before the captain announced it was time for touchdown. this appalling service is simply not acceptable. flew sydkulsyd. we have flown mh a few times over the years. sadly service levels have declined. the disposable covers on the pillows looked like they havent been changed in months. they are meant to be white but were actually yellow. my daughters tray was dirty and all staff could say was thats not our issue thats a cleaning issue so just complain when you get there food was very average on both flights and much less food served than normal. my kids were very hungry. i do not recommend ordering childrens meals. ife was ok but could improve. faulty headphones both flights. seat did not recline on sydkul flight. there were less cabin crew than usual and they were not very attentive. definitely not on par with sq or cx anymore. only good thing were the seats which made for a comfortable flight. bkk bangkok2 to syd sydney via kul kuala lumpur. travelled on a whim as the flights were so cheap. used to travel on mh a lot 20 years ago and they used to be excellent. bkk to kul on 737 had surly staff a tiny croissant and no coffee. ife guide featured latest hollywood releases but the system only had bollywood movies. seat was ok. flight on time. kul to syd on a330 was only 30 capacity yet the service was still very slow and not very friendly. no drink rounds were offered. food was reasonable but on the small side. seat had plenty of room and many customers had 4 seats to lie on. syd to kul 100 full a330. service was as good as the earlier virtually empty flight. staff looked harried as if they had to meet a deadline yet they were so slow one flight attendant looked as if she were about to cry. food again reasonable. kul to bkk on 737. faster service and friendly staff. with very good fares and a 30kg baggage allowance i will fly mh again but they fall short on this run compared to qantas or emirates. mh 795 aug 4th hktkul 25f mh 135 aug

food for economy ok. price usd 350 less than sia and even better than most lcc. good value for money. negatives kulbne flight freezing cold cabin. apprx 70 of passengers were shivering wearing blankets and jackets. asked to pls increase temperature. nothing happened. one particular staff member argumentative patronizing and confrontational. took forever to get to speak to cabin manager but once he intervened issue was sorted out amicably. nevertheless caught a cold since this was 4hrs after initially addressing the issue. on mh 135 airshow not working window shades pulled down and no announcements made from cockpit. in light of recent events i find it rather insensitive of mas not to understand the need to keep passengers informed. upon request the clearly annoyed first officer announced we were just passing alice springs. cockpit crew really should communicate more with the cabin especially if airshow is inop. we all know this airline has had unfortunate problems however this does not excuse the tardy service well was it even service on two sectors london to kuala lumpur and kuala lumpur to auckland in july. for a 5 star airline both my wife and i were very disappointed. we flew the day after the ukraine disaster the cabin crew on both legs looked for want of a better word tired. we were served very quickly on the london  kl leg the cabin shut down and then left to our own devices. there was not a crew member to be found a couple of times that i wandered back to the galley. in fact there was not even any water or juice left out for us to help ourselves to nor was there as with cathay on our trip over a cabin attendant roughly every hour bringing water juice and snacks around. the same happened on the kl auckland flight. i also found the inflight entertainment disappointing especially on the second leg where the screen was not performing well nor would either my wifes or my hand piece retract into the seat arm. if this is 5 star service then it must only be in the front of the aircraft or did we have an unfortunate couple of flights i hope the latter jakartaklguangzhou on 22072014 went smoothly. cabin food and staff were good average. on the way back we flew from hong kong to kl morning flight at 8.45am. it was on time. entered the cabin and was met by a very sullen tired and bored looking stewardess. cabin looked filthy. pillows were scattered on my seat and on the floor. table had some sort of dried stain. the seat cover in front of us was dirty. nothing babywipes couldnt wipe clean so why didnt whoever was in charge of cleaning the cabin do so a child tried to go to toilet while a stewardess was distributing food. blocked by her cart the boy waited for her to move. immediately she barked where do you want to go the boy looked surprised and pointed at the toilet behind her. she then moved the cart to the side a bit with a terribly bored look on her face and signed for the boy to squeeze through. not even a smile or the kindness and patience expected from fa. from kl we flew connecting flight to jakarta. aircraft looked old and tired. no ife at all. we had ife on the flight from jakarta to kl two weeks before but not today. it was a 1 hour and 45 mins flight with nothing to do but eat and sleep. needless to say in the future i will try my best to avoid this airline. the cheaper price doesnt justify their bad attitude. my partner and i flew from kuala lumpur to sydney on august 21st. i found the food very ordinary and the vegetable rolls are awful. i was so hungry after being awake allnight due to a child in the seat behind me continually kicking the back of my partners seat. the service is also average which is unfortunate. i spilt water all over me and looked for someone to help me maybe grab me a towel or something. i waited until an attendant came into view. i waved to him and smiled to let him know i needed him. he stood there looking at me then turned away. totally ignored me. he eventually came. by the time he decided to come i had used the blanket to wipe up all the water. not happy at all with service. i really would like to see airlines group families together a bit separate from adults traveling with no children and i feel it is really unfair to be kept awake all night and inconvenienced by badly behaved children. i can not see me flying malaysia airlines again. my husband flew from perth to kuala lumpur to tokyo to los angeles. when we got seated on the plane in perth we had to use wipes to clean the surface in front of us and our tables as they were filthy. when we got seated on the plane at kuala lumpur we sat there for approximately in a hot plane without taking off for about thirty minutes then advised there was a technical problem and they were waiting for an engineer. we then sat in the hot plane for about another half an hour and not even offered a drink of water. passengers had to go into the service areas and ask the hostesses for a drink. i understand planes do have problems from time to time but to not even be offered a drink. after about another half an hour we had to get off this plane and get onto another one. on the flights to tokyo and the following one to los angeles the meals were disgusting and we are not fussy eaters at all but couldnt eat the meals. also on these flights the rubbish incurred by the passengers was not once collected. on the ten hour flight tokyo to los angeles we did not get one cup of tea or coffee. every time it was time for tea or coffee they said they couldnt serve it because of impending turbulence which we are still waiting for. we flew home from rome to perth with emirates and experienced a lot of turbulence but still received our tea and coffee. we were a bit hesitant going with malaysian airlines after the disappearance of their aircraft but did think they would go out of their way and offer a very good service but not to be. we will never fly with them again because of the dirty inedible food and shocking service on their flights. mas is truly an airline that has lost its way. for longhaul they used to be a byword for comfort and good service with their old 747s having a greaterthanaverage seat pitch. since taking delivery of their a380s this has all changed for the worse. seats are now as crammedin as with almost all airlines but worse still are actually uncomfortable to sit on. cabin service is far worse with many staff appearing to wish they were anywhere but on duty with mas. meal quality is mediocre except for special meals that are generally good. added to all this are very high fares and what i regularly find to be the worst and most unworkable website of all the airlines i have used in the electronic ticket age. mh is supposed to mean malaysian hospitality  but the malaysian government might like to lean on this airline to make this a realistic claim if they really want people to visit malaysia. sorry mas but you are a oncegood now poor airline. i am a frequent flyer with malaysian airlines and have been loyal to them during this last year but standards seem to be slowly declining. yesterday i took the midday flight from london to kl. i declined a glass of wine with my lunch as it was too early in the day for me but a few hours later i fancied a drink so i went to the back of the upper deck and requested one. the flight attendant was preparing soft drinks and refused me any alcohol. its finished she snapped. is this a new policy also the air quality was noticeably poor. maybe thats why the flight attendant was so grouchy. i regularly fly malaysia airlines and am usually pleased with their service but this time the abysmal service on my bangalorekuala lumpur flight needs reporting. i was placed on a seat in front of an exit row and was horrified to find the seat couldnt recline at all to make matters worse the seat pitch was no different to some budget airline like ryanair imagine being mashed up for 4 hours in a seat that wont recline while the seat in front of you is reclined all the way for 4 hours by the end of the flight i was exhausted as it was so uncomfortable that i was unable to sleep squashed into the tiny seat with the tv screen mashed up to my face meaning i couldnt watch anything without hurting my eyes. my back and neck still hurt even though it has been a day now. for those who are wondering i bought a full service class l economy ticket not one of the ultra cheap h or k tickets so at the very least i should not have been stuck in such a seat from now on i shall fly singapore airlines to bangalore even though it means that i have to transit in changi. kulktm 9 oct mh 114. below average service from the fa and disgusting food. it took them an hour and a half after takeoff to serve meals and there was no turbulence to delay it. platinum status not acknowledged as well as names not used at all by the unfriendly lead stewardess and her crew. its a pity the way this once great airline is headed. mas is truly an airline that has lost its way. for longhaul they used to be a byword for comfort and good service with their old 747s having a greaterthanaverage seat pitch. since taking delivery of their a380s this has all changed for the worse. seats are now as crammedin as with almost all airlines but worse still are actually uncomfortable to sit on. cabin

high fares and what i regularly find to be the worst and most unworkable website of all the airlines i have used in the electronic ticket age. mh is supposed to mean malaysian hospitality  but the malaysian government might like to lean on this airline to make this a realistic claim if they really want people to visit malaysia. sorry mas but you are a oncegood now poor airline. we flew from kl to syd earlier this week and were very disappointed with the staff. we checked in and were told we were being given a bassinet seat for our 10 month old when we boarded we realised it wasnt a bassinet seat but was the second last row in the cabin. when we raised this with the flight attendants they were not helpful at all and said it was the ground staff that we had to talk to  this is after we had boarded. eventually they decided to call the ground staff after all the passengers had boarded so they could sort it out. when we spoke to the ground staff we were told that we were given incorrect information and that we were supposed to check our seats i dont know how we are meant to know where our seats are allocated. he said there wasnt anything they could do and that we had to sit at the seat without the bassinet for the 9hour flight unless we asked whether anyone was willing to swap seats with us. they refused to talk to the passengers and find a seat for us. i will never be travelling with this airline again and was very disappointed with their service. sydklhan. extremely disappointed in the ma service. we ordered vegetarian meals on all four flights however there was a huge mixup and were given everything but vegetarian meals. we called the booking line when we arrived at our destination to make sure that our meals were vegetarian on the way back. they confirmed that they would be. we got on our return flight and we were only served one vegetarian meal and one meal with meat. we spoke to the air hostess who said it was our fault because we didnt order a vegetarian meal with our booking. this was incorrect. treating us as hindrances rather than being accommodating or apologetic the attendant offered the staff meal which was vegetarian slop served cold. as you can imagine we were extremely unimpressed. further the ma planes are dated and seating is uncomfortable. the attendants dont clean the toilets throughout the flight so the floors were wet and the toilets smelt. hands down the worst four flights of my life and will never fly ma again. travelled kl to adelaide on 11112014. seats ok but sleep quality poor. cabin crew polite but impersonable  no warmth or sincerity  travelled economy class and i felt that we were made to feel that way. instead of serving peanuts to passengers first drinks waterjuice should be served first. refreshments seemed to take aeons to arrive. food unappetizing. breakfast of a chickentuna sandwich short of appalling. toilets were not spruced up during the course of the flight or if they were poor job was done  they were disgusting by the time the flight approached adelaide. in short irrespective of fares i will never fly mas again. flew sinkulams on december 23 2014. the sin to kul was delayed for an hour but it was okay because we were flying business. we stayed in the lounge while waiting. lounge was very quiet with total of 6 passengers using it. food and drinks selection was okay. we loved the satay and wines. flight was quick comfortable seats and with some refreshment. it was with a new plane b737800. service was excellent kulams was also delayed for 45 minutes. they could not get a clearance for take off and also waiting for other delayed passengers like us. the transfer was nicely organized. it was with b772er an old plane. small personal screens limited and not so great selection of moviesentertainment. food was fish or chicken. i chose fish which was overcooked. it was served with veggies that were very salty. breakfast was nasi lemak or omelette. the omelette was nice served with sausage and hash brown. my partner chose nasi lemak and it was very spicy for breakfast. seats were comfortable in the economy although it can be improved and need some cleaning. it was lots of leg space for tall guys like me40d. we had 4 rows on our own although it was a busy flight. service was not impressive. after serving the supper most of cabin crews disappeared. they served only one round of drinks throughout the flight. we had to look for them in the pantry area if we need something. also no snacks were offered in between. one of the cabin crews even asked me boss what do you want we normally take singapore airlines and klm. we took mh because of the pricing. malaysia airlines is far from this two in terms of comfort food service and fleet maintenance. im a little worried now on my flight back to kul and to sin. i hope its a different plane a newer one. very poor experience. flight delayed on 11 december out of saigon by 2 hours. they said they would hold the connecting flight to london and that ground staff in kl their home airport would be on hand. none of this was true. no information given on the flight about connections. nobody available on their transfer desk for an hour to sort out issues and took two hours to get transferred overnight to a hotel and reticketed. nobody took responsibility and the duty manager declined to come down and deal with the issues. kulsyd. enjoyed flight except two problems  meal request not available a first in business class and fas disappeared for three hours which happens in a night flights but this was an all day flight. otherwise good value. economy class from kulsyd. i fly this route regularly. glad to see they finally changed the menu after a few years. ife selection was fairly poor for new release movies but the rest was ok. seat very uncomfortable. crew were very abrupt and rude. i interacted with 5 on this flight and they all were very rude and seemed annoyed by every request. mas is a very average airline but i have no choice on this route. malaysia airlines has become one of the the worst airlines to travel. i and my family travelled from bali to bengaluru recently and the flight was delayed by over 6 hours. the airline didnt inform the passengers through smsemail nor display the revised travel times in the airport monitors but kept delaying the time of the flight. we missed the connecting flight from kl and had to wait until the morning in the airport for the next flight. there was no one in kl airport to guide on transit visahotel facilities for the night. the staff were clueless and disorganized both at bali and kl airports. there was no senior staff to organize alternate facilities or inform the travellers. not recommended. i flew mh from perth to kl and again kl to siem reap. normally i would fly qf to. sin but they no longer offer full service flights out of perth. anyway mh offered a flight at a reasonable hour of the day and a good price. the plane was fine the flight into kl early and essentially turbulence free despite warnings. seat comfort is just ok. the biggest complaint is with the quality of the service. staff seemed surly and uninterested. food quality was also average whilst the drinks seemed positively stingy. wine was very cheap quality and when i asked for a soft drink i got a glass mostly full of ice with a dash of coke and no can to refill the glass. give me the whole can. could also increase frequency of water handouts especially one just before descent. the flying was ok but a little more effort would go a long way. flew sinkulams on december 23 2014. the sin to kul was delayed for an hour but it was okay because we were flying business. we stayed in the lounge while waiting. lounge was very quiet with total of 6 passengers using it. food and drinks selection was okay. we loved the satay and wines. flight was quick comfortable seats and with some refreshment. it was with a new plane b737800. service

two in terms of comfort food service and fleet maintenance. im a little worried now on my flight back to kul and to sin. i hope its a different plane a newer one. ho chi minh city to kuala lumpur on december 29 2014. the only 4 checkin counters open and i had to wait approx. 45 mins although only about 10 people queuing. the flight used a b737800 and the crew were good. the magazines and newspapers were in a bad shape. the food were good didnt get any options since they were running out of food. the luggage took another 45 minutes to come out. i flew malaysian airlines for the first time in business class from london to kuala lumpur on christmas eve. the plane was an a380 and the seat was comfortable. the cabin crew in business were the most unfriendly team i have encountered in the sky. when asked why the standard preflight drink of bubbly was not available a cabin staff member said that this was due to customs regulations. red wine with the main meal was served cold. while the facility to preorder meals is a positive feature business class with this airline is poor value compared to that available from other carriers flying between irelanduk and south east asia. my wife and i are platinum one world frequent flyers. we flew from sydney to kl on mh122 on the 20th of january in business class with our son in business class. the plane was one of the oldest i have ever flown on. the staff were not welcoming and proceeded to talk the entire flight loudly in the galley. the toilets were flooded and dirty yet no effort was made to clean them. the entire crew attitude was unhelpful and a poor reflection on malaysians who are typically very warm and welcoming. this was the worst business class flight i have experienced. the ratings posted here are the ratings ive flown on more frequently on the b777200 from mumbai to kuala lumpur. the aircraft had a clean and tidy cabin and all seats have a different colour. toilets were hygienic enough. the staff service is terrible because they dont respond at all the seats were comfortable enough that i was able to sleep well on the seat. the indian food they catered was warm and delicious but their items are always exactly the same every time ive flown on the same flight. the entertainment system is really pathetic in terms of the screen quality it is so small and unclear that it could possibly strain ones eyes badly and the touch screen is also very unresponsive. ive flown on another malaysian airline flight from hyderabad to kl in brand new b737800. that was a very good flight with nice ife and it had it had usb slot luckily as my phone battery was dead. flew amskul on mh19 on what was a very old cabin and seat 777200. cabin crew were not at all welcoming on boarding the plane and this just set the scene for the whole flight. the seat is an angle lie flat very uncomfortable and not a seat i have used in about 10 years of flying in business. also wasnt offered a mattress for the seat. the tv screen was small and low resolution the headphones cheap plastic not noise cancelling and with a poor connection which affected the sound quality. food was ok however the nasi lemak for breakfast came with a watery curry sauce and was poorly presented. my biggest gripe is reserved for the cabin crew who seemed to want to do the minimum possible they offered the minimum of drink services the seat belt sign was kept on for almost the entire flight meaning they refused to make hot drinks although apart from this restriction all the passengers and crews seemed to ignore the seat belt sign and walked about as normal. yes i know its the flight deck that switches the sign on however the flight had next to no turbulence. overall this was the worst business class flight i have ever been on. their competition is supposed to be cathaysingaporeemirates but they came nowhere near those airlines. flew mh 131 kulakl business class on jan 31 on b 777200. first time flying business class on mh. appalled by overall experience. the only positive aspect of the experience was the seat which was reasonably comfortable even if not 180 degree lie flat. warning signs started a few days earlier when attempted to book a meal online through chefoncall service. unable to do so due to maintenance issues had to call mh contact centre. golden lounge at klia had adequate seating but poor selection of food staff did not greet you personally upon being seated in business class cabin as i had come to expect with many other airlines on business class magazines on pocket of front seat dishevelled and looked dirty no food menu  cabin staff came around asking if you would like the lamb or the fish with no further description offered  this occurred for both meals served during the flight the meat dish i had preordered had to be returned as it was inedible. a cloth serviette was place on your tray and a clothe serviette containing cutlery was then given to you prior to being served your meal  ie there was no laying of the table for you. staff seemed hurried and uncaring. cabin looked tired with threadbare carpet. ife substandard. mh enrich loyalty card going in the bin  as i wont be flying mh again. flew melbournephuket via kuala lumpur return. outbound on an a330. entertainment was good. cabin crew were abrupt. first meal was edible but the second was some sort of sausage roll and it was revolting. they didnt offer too many drinks. on the kulhkt sector an old 737 was used. we were served the most disgusting soggy roll. at least on this sector the cabin crew were a little more friendly. on the return from hkt to kul a newer 737 was used the food was quite nice and the cabin crew were friendly. the last flight from kul to mel was on an old 777200. mh rather inconveniently uses a 252 layout on this plane. the plane was old with an ancient looking entertainment system. the food was okay on this flight and the cabin crew were better than on the flight over. overall they need for do far better if they want to be an airline of choice in the future. kuala lumpur  ho chi minh city return 1618 jan. we were a family of 6 adults and 2 kids. flight was uneventful but i have nothing nice to say about the crew serving us. outbound the steward sarcastically ticked off my 9 year old nephew for taking a few seconds of his time to decide which meal he wanted. no social etiquette at all. outbound we were only served a sandwich which was awful. inbound a stewardess gave my nephew a childs meal but not my 4 year old daughter. when i asked for another one for my daughter she said no i had only ordered one. i am malaysian and have flown countless times with them but not anymore. travelled recently to new zealand with my wife to visit our son. the flights out and back were with malaysia airlines. the flights out from lhr to kl and from kl to auckland were not exactly the best we have experienced. the service on board during both flights was average and did not reflect the friendliness with which malaysia is renowned. the staff seemed intent on serving drinks and food as fast as they could and ignored reasonable requests for additional items such as water not only from us but other passengers as well. the food served up was pretty poor and certainly did not reflect the style or quality expected of richard corrigan the airlines named chef. to add insult to injury when we arrived in auckland our luggage apparently was still in lhr we eventually received them 5 days later. our return flights this time from auckland to kl and kl to amsterdam were no better and we rated the food on offer as being worse than the outbound flights. indeed neither of us could eat anything on the kl to amsterdam flight as it was almost inedible. the service was marginally better than the outgoing flights however still fell short of what we had expected. when we queried the delayed luggage at auckland prior to the return flights we were simply passed off with various excuses. indeed the contact numbers we were given somewhat reluctantly were useless as they only connected to ticket offices and the staff in these locations presume lhr were incapable of offering any help or alternative contact numbers as they tended to hang up on our calls. feb 2015 flew business class perkul mh126 a333 kulkbi mh2640 b737800. kbiper mh0121 b737800. i hadnt flown with malaysian since around 2009 and over the years there has been a noticeable drop in service. i used to rate mas right up there with singapore and cathay but that has changed. those little toiletries bags are no longer issued in any shape or form and as another reviewer noted the magazines and literature is tattered and worn. indeed as we descended into perth the stewardess scrambled around the seats collecting the menus for reuse. i am guessing they were for reuse because as i read mine on the flight i thought it looked a bit dog eared and worn. the cabin service on all flights had one modus operandi and that was that the cabin crew would get the food service done as soon as possible and then draw all galley curtains so they can doze or chat for the duration. cabin attendance and presence on all sectors was woeful. i recalled my past flights with mas had the cabin crew were almost graceful as they went about their business however now they seem to be in a rush and they really should be wearing joggers so they can run around the cabin. the service was simply awful. to highlight this point on the kulbki sector i boarded the aircraft to find a rubbish bag sitting on my chair where the cabin had been cleaned by the ground crew but they had forgotten to take the rubbish bag. i handed it to the attendant and she simply smiled and said thank you sir like it was a gift. when i sat in my chair it kept reclining backwards and would not remain upright so i called the same attendant and pointed out that the seat was broken. yes sir we know this because it is reported in our flight maintenance log. so why would you put a passenger in a broken seat more to the point there were spare seats available so i moved but the crew should have blocked that seat and redistributed pax automatically. on the a333 the business class seats are as you would expect but there are better on other airlines however the b737800 business seats are the old style barber chairs and are simply wider and all manually activated. this decline in service and product has been obviously happening over a period of time and i feel mas is on the decline. i wont be flying with them again if i can avoid it. sinkul on mh608. travelled business class sinkulakl. poor selection of food at lounge on klia magazines etc in seat holder dirty and placed any old how. no menu  air crew just came around asking each person if they wanted the beef or chicken dish. preordered meal had to be handed back as it was inedible. staff lacked any sense of customer service. cabin looking tired. just received the malaysian airlines enrich membership card upon return home  it went straight into the bin as i will never be flying malaysian again. it is with a very heavy heart that after travelling with malaysian airlines for over 20 years on a twice a year basis and enjoying the wonderful cabin servicing they offer i have to write this report. on boarding from lhr in the upper deck i asked the hostess if she could put my bag in overhead locker as i had wrist splints on for arthritis i was amazed that she pointed to my wife and demanded why she would not do it. at 5 ft my wife could not reach the locker so reluctantly she put the case up for me. thus began a very miserable flight. cabin crew did not serve hot drinks throughout the 12 hour flight only on demand then reluctantly. food was ok but served with a miserable attitude by all the crew. this sort of attitude shown by the crew will not help an ailing airline. come on malaysian get your act together and serve those who are willing to keep loyal to you. melpnhmel. ive flown with mh 5 times in the last 15 months and noticed nothing improved in staff performance and catering staff looked businesslike not much time to smile and abrupt. food was soso and i must admit that soggy rollsandwich served as breakfast from kul to mel was so revolting. only once or twice were drinks served between meals for the whole 7 hour flight. mh is now just a bit above budget carriers that means well below par for an airline that used to be 5 star. still ill continue to fly them because of their competitive price. adlkulpnh and return. outbound adlkul the crew were very ordinary. plane was only half full but flight attendants rushed through drinks and meal service to hide for the for the majority of the flight. meals were virtually thrown at the passengers. kulpnh was better but crew did their jobno more. legroom was extremely tight. return sectors were better but standards no match for rival airlines. my recent flight from kl to bali and return was the worst i had taken with mas. the crew service was so bad that i felt like i was a burden to airline. the food onboard consist of a bun and what l was told was chicken on a 3 hour flight and on the return flight a snack sized chicken with potatoes at least it was a hot meal. what happened to the warm buns with butter served with a side salad and a dessert which mas used to give even on a 2 hour flight in addition technical glitches on the seat display screen showed that we were flying across eastern europe when we were flying across indonesia. on the way back the distance from location was displayed at 1145 km from destination for the entirety of the flight. the seat was constantly in a reclining position even after many attempts to straighten it please look into fixing seat 16a flight no. mh 714 25th feb 2015. first time on mas for a long time jakarta to london via kl. first flight was bang on time newish looking aircraft with good seats decent ife and nice food. the long haul flight to london was pretty good when we eventually boarded it as it was delayed 15 hours due to a technical fault. the ground staff were quick to organise hotels for everyone but were completely clueless when trying to rebook me and various other stranded business class passengers onto other carriers as an alternative  given that this was at mass base this stretched credulity. once onboard the a380 to lhr the standard of the product remained as good as the first flight albeit with even more room and a decent proper flat bed seat which was a lot comfier that its conventional appearance suggested. its a shame that the management of the delay put a major downer on what otherwise was a good experience mas could do with a few lucky breaks at the moment and it feels as if they shot themselves in the foot here. feb 2015 flew business class perkul mh126 a333 kulkbi mh2640 b737800. kbiper mh0121 b737800. i hadnt flown with malaysian since around 2009 and over the years there

has been obviously happening over a period of time and i feel mas is on the decline. i wont be flying with them again if i can avoid it. reasonable business class product but economy is not as god as other full service airlines. flew bkkkul economy kulsyd business and sydkulbkk economy. business was due.to an mh upgrade bid being accepted. i found the staff in business were friendly and proactive but in economy they can be surly and do not go out of their way at all to be of assistance. golden lounge in kul was large but the food selection was limited despite malaysia having some excellent dishes. on board the satay was excellent but my chef on call meal was accompanied by very hard vegetables. dessert had no choice and was not exciting. wine choice was excellent. the seat is better than economy but the angle made me feel like i always had to prop myself up so thank goodness for the footrest. economy food was lacklustre and the wine is just palatable. service not happy no menus and it took more than an hour for drinks to be served on a two hour flight. i did not see the staff come through with water or other drinks once. ife is ok but it takes some time to get going and the collect the headphones a long time before landing and then show arrival videos. ok for a first time flyer but annoying for more frequent travellers. overall it was safe online check in 48 hours before flight is good safety not an issue. mh just needs to elevate staff attitudes and encourage a bit more friendliness and the perception of their product will improve even if the hard product does not. good prices make mh a decent choice but they are not as good as other one world carriers. melkulpnhbkkkulmel. my trips were nothing to cheer about and as a strong supporter of mah for a long time i considered myself as a lowmaintenance passenger still i came out of flying with mh very disappointed. crew members were soso on their performance. meal serving time looked like they do a sprint race rushing through to have the job done quickly so theyd time for themselves behind those blinds. there was only one time of drink offering between meal during 7h and 10mins. that soggy rollsandwich served as breakfast was so pathetic and inedible. its amazed me how once a five star carrier now becomes the ordinary one. mh please raise your game and dont take your passengers for granted. the airline is a mix of good poor and very bad. the first problem was booking vegetarian meals it can be missed if booking online and no way of changing online once booked. had to phone twice to get it sorted the website quotes a number in malaysia to phone found a uk number that redirects and considering i was on hold for 30 minutes thank goodness i did the first flight lhrkul was excellent got seats in upper deck and was less half full ample drink runs and very friendly crew ife was excellent. kulmel bnekul what difference snarly crew things were thrown at people and i saw a couple of people even being shouted at. for bnekul leg the seat belt sign was left on for 5 hours even though no turbulence and crew refused any hot drinks. i looked forward to kul lhr but was in bottom deck of full flight and seats are very uncomfortable there and only 2 drink runs were done for 14 hour flight people were all pressing call button. reason i chose malaysia is so we could get ba miles but when returned discovered no miles awarded as was deeply discounted fare even though was not cheapest and only 10 cheaper than cx who would have given miles. not worthy of oneworld membership based on economy product. mh19 amskul 2703. mh141 kulsyd 2803. mh122 sydkul 1004. mh16 kulams 1004. amskulsydkulams in y. one word dreadful. persistent delays on 34 sectors. service onboard is below standard. toilet supplies are never replenished on any sector. complaints get a standard dont care response. poor communication from baggage handling staff. delayed luggage process is an utter shambles. inflight entertainment has limited options. on the first leg the attendant left hot chilli pretzels for my two young children giggled and walked off. i went to change the packs for a different flavour and was rudely told that its only one per passenger. on the second leg to syd the attendant brought my childrens food out. the attendant confirmed that these were child meals  when i opened it i found it was a spicy dish. i brought this to the attendants attention and asked if they could fetch the child meal that we requested. he stormed over to the people behind us snatched the food from in front of the children and dumped the food in front of my kids telling the people behind me in a very loud voice that i changed my mind. the return service was very similar. departure out of kl was delayed an hour. if you need the toilet best to go in the early part of the flight as the toilet supplies are never replenished on all four sectors. arrived in sydney and with the delay in ams meant my luggage was left in kul. my luggage arrived the next evening. the air fares on mh are not the most competitive. if you can go with a competing airline for a similar price or slightly more go with that option rather than mh. i did a return trip from sydney to london via kl. the sydkl flight arrived half an hour early for some reason just making the stopover longer. the kllondon flight was an hour late. this meant i missed my connection and had to sit in heathrow for 7 more hours. the return londonkl was once again delayed meaning another stuffed up connecting flight. the customer service was appalling no member of staff on the planes ever smiled at me. all of the food was inedible both in economy and business except the satay. the only decent thing about this experience was the comfort of the a380 seating although the qantas one i have flown was superior in more ways than one. last time im flying malaysian considering how much extra it cost me in rebooked flights and how poor the overall experience was. just back from a trip from sydney to vietnam via k.l. at 194 cms tall i always try for an exit or aisle seat. in sydney outbound i was first in the online check in 3 hours before take off only to be told that the plane was full and that i was stuck with the seat i had been allocated which turned out to be in the middle of a 4 seat section. it was an a300 plane and very uncomfortable. in k.l i approached the transfer desk and was assured that i now had an exit seat to saigon. it turned out to be a very tight window seat nowhere near the exit. on coming back from hanoi again first in line at check in i was again assured that i had exit seats on both planes to sydney. again the hanoi flight turned out to be a tight window seat nowhere near the exit. approached the transfer desk in k.l again to be told no exit or aisle seats available except the youngish lady next to this fellow interrupted to point out that there was an aisle seat available and then proceeded to give it to me. why is it that this is a blatant load of lies prior to this ive flown with malaysia a number of times and always had good service but this experience coupled with very poor seating on the a300 planes has now put me right off. 95 mh142 sydneykl. 245 mh141 klsydney. malaysia airlines used to be very good but this is no longer the case. on a return flight sydneyklsydney service was perfunctory verging on rude. the meals a brunch and a small snack during an 8 hours flight were poor barely edible and very little choice and drinks were offered grudgingly. no wonder they have trouble fillingup their flights. we will definitely give them a miss in future. my experience today was the worst i have had on an airline for a very long time. staff sloppy and work shy. food was uneatable toilets disgusting with water on floor and no hand towels. seat very uncomfortable inflight entertainment system turned on for whole flight but headphones distributed 30 minutes after take off and collected an hour before arrival. i was shocked to see the plane land with several window shades down and many seats in a recline position. the staff spent the last hour of the flight packing everything away and not doing pre landing checks. the golden lounge in kuala lumpur is worn out and dirty. we traveled on sunday 16 august from lhr to bali via kuala lumpur. at check in we were advised by malysian staff that the flight was on time. however when we got through security it was on the board as being delayed 2 hours. then it was changed to a 18.30 take off instead of midday. no one made an announcement to say or any reason given as to why. passengers were passed from one counter to another to try and find what was happening and what would happen about connection flights. sadly none of this was addressed at lhr. finally the flight took off at 18.50 6 hours 50 mins later than scheduled. the plane was dirty food left on seats trays not wiped down traces of drinks and food on them. no hot towels were given during the duration of the flight 13 hrs or travels bags provided. food was also very limited we were given one hot meals during the first 2 hrs of the flight then nothing else until 2hrs before landing. drinks were brought round twice with meals but no one informed you that you could go to the galley and get drinks or snacks during the flight. the seats are very uncomfortable for the length of flight. onboard entertainment is not very up to date. not looking forward to my return trip to the uk. business class dps to kul due to very good malaysia airlines experiences in the past years. happy to say that they have kept it up and the boeing 777 business class cabin is very roomy for a short 2Â½ hr flight plus very clean. the senior crew were great and the meals good. very good old school experience with malaysia airlines. keep up the great work i travelled with my 20 month old son for which i paid for a separate seat. the cabin stewards were unhelpful unfriendly and showed no interest whatsoever in me or my son. there was no childrens food available. they would not allow me to put my childs antibiotics in the fridge. the steward on the first leg of the flight was rude and offhand. on the second flight staff gave the impression we were a nuisance. the food is generally of a poor standard and my child is not a fussy eater but the snacks were very unhealthy. the first flight from auckland to kl had not been cleaned properly. selection of childrens tv was very limited. worst seat i have had in business class over last 30 years of regular travel. the cushion was so thin and worn you could feel the metal of the frame digging into you. there is a large wedge cushion that is to be used when you lower the seat into an angled bed so i sat on this cushion when not lying down. but then when lying down the metal frame was very noticeable again when using the cushion at your feet. for the price it was a disgrace in term of comfort. they say the worst business class is better than any economy but i have to say this came close im sure some good airlines economy would have been as comfortable. i know malaysia airlines are looking to change but they need to i felt robbed in terms of value for money. i thought i would fly malaysia airlines to support them given their current woes. rewarded with a lost bag. i didnt have anything for a couple of days but worse was no one from the airline contacted me to offer any assistance. i did have a phone number for their baggage department but like every other airline that loses a bag none of their team answered the phone. they do send you sms messages but they provide very little information that you can verify with anyone. the plane was tired with two toilets in need of repair. on the way back to sydney i was staggered by the time taken to check in. their systems for check in are very very slow. the plane was a tired one not clean and one toilet wasnt flushing. crew was ok but they wake you to serve breakfast which is a bread roll with cheese in it hardly worth waking for. i understand why they are in administration. i took malaysia airlines flight from taipei to amsterdam. the attitude of flight attendants was not nice. one of them was so impatient when passengers asked for a cup of water. besides my luggage was delayed for a day. and on 28 august i came back from amsterdam to taipei. due to technical problems the flight was delayed at schipol airport for three hours. so when we arrived at kuala lumpur airport many passengers missed their original flights. we waited for another three more hours for lining up to get new boarding pass. the ground staff arranged me to china airlines since there was no flight to taipei by malaysia airlines on that day. when i got to the gate of china airlines i was not allowed to board. they told me they didnt get any information from malaysia airlines and i was not on the list. then i went to ask the ground staff of malaysia airlines. she called china airlines to confirm the situation. after the call she told me i should be ok to board  she didnt know the reason why china airlines couldnt let me get in.  then she arranged the flight for me next day and hotel in the airport for a night. she didnt try to communicate with the staff of china airlines. malaysia airlines attitude is awful.  the initial flight was an hour late taking off. when i arrived in perth my luggage had been left in kl i was not reunited with my luggage until 25 hours later. on my return the flight i was delayed 5.5 hours therefore i missed my coach to take me home. at no point was there explanation or apology. flew with my wife and 3 kids. having flown the a380 on ek qr and qf was really looking forward to flying the malaysian version. however on entering the aircraft was disappointed to see a shabby and worn interior. the service was mechanical and the food was uninspiring. if you are flying this airline do not expect any of the extra trimmings such as toys for the kids or amenity kits as it has all become very basic in view of their financial troubles. the ife was acceptable the state of the toilets were not. the flight was a couple of hours late taking off and we missed our connection to kuantan. on the positive side this was handled quite well and we were put on the next flight with minimal hassle. malaysia airlines was the worst experience of an airline.  our inbound flight was rescheduled and one piece of luggage was lost. our outbound flight to kuala lumpur was delayed 8 hours and our onward flight was delayed 24 hours.  all our luggage was missing on the return flight and we were stuck in kuala lumpur 24 hours and malaysia airlines refused to provide adequate food. just 3 towards our food. i had to spend about 200 covering delays. i raised a complaint and have heard nothing to date.  we were supposed to fly malaysia airlines from penang to paris in an a380 until they decided to downgrade the plane last minute and changed it to their ancient and dirty boeing 777200. would like to change airlines at that time but it was too late and if we were to know they are using this aircraft we would not have chosen malaysia airlines. the boeing 777 that we took for both flights were terribly old and seats were soiled and fatigued. the seat recline would require you to use some strength to push it down maybe due to the stiffness of the gears. some of the seat fabrics were faded or torn. for sleeping we were given an old pillow with an extremely thin  blanket that didnt help provide much comfort for the entire trip. ife is a serious joke. it still use an ultra low resolution 7 inch lcd screen remnant of the 1990s that can barely display a good movie decently without straining your eyes. its much better to watch with our ipad or phone as was really a horrible experience to watch with their ife. the movies were not updated although its stated in the september movie catalogue. it was still showing old movies from the previous month. food in malaysia airlines used to be great compared to many other airlines. now i would say its a step below other lower rated airlines. meal portions are smaller with lower value food servings. choices for drinks both alcohol and non alcoholic were limited compared to years ago. in between snack for a long haul flight from kul to cdg is a packet of peanuts and tasteless pizza sticks. we saw many passengers just left it there and opted for their own food instead. when it comes to the cabin staff there is nothing much to really fancy upon even though malaysia airlines has always promoted their excellent cabin crew service. the service is okay for an asian airline but there is nothing worth commending. we werent expecting first or business class service from them but it seems that with a mediocre service there was nothing much to shine for this airline. malaysia airlines has changed a lot in recent years and sadly its not for the better. poor management inability to stay in the latest trends and lack of motivation from their staff has certainly taken its toll on this airline. once a great and favourite airline of asia has now totally lost its touch. would not recommend it for long haul if its their boeing 777s. i have been flying with malaysia airlines for the last 10 years  travelling to asia every year. my return flight from kl to adelaide was cancelled they put me up in a hotel overnight empresssepang but i was travelling alone and did not feel comfortable there with bikes racing in the streets and youths yelling all night. i left at 8am and went back to the airport where my flight was due to leave at 1020 that night. i have a frequent flyer card albeit a blue card and asked if i could sit in their lounge as i had 14 hours to wait for my flight. they informed me i was only flying economy and did not qualify to use their lounge. i would have thought they would look after loyal customers but this does not seem to be the case. i have seen a steady decline in malaysia airlines service over the last 5 years. i recently flew malaysia airlines from tasmania to yangon and after the return flight was cancelled twice with no explanation i was told at the airport that i would need to book the last leg of the trip myself as it was with a different airline despite the flight being on the same ticket. i ended up buying another ticket based on this information only to find out later that it wasnt my responsibility. malaysia airlines refused to reimburse me the money and when i requested on occasions that my complaint be reviewed by a manager they ignored my emails. there were quite a few other problems i had with them  including no vegetarian meal served on the flight despite having notified them of this requirement when i bought the ticket misinformation and outright lies told to me by staff complete confusion in some instances and a refusal to reply to any correspondence. the customer service is ridiculously bad and i have no idea how they stay in business. i wanted to fly malaysia airlines on the 26oct from dubai to kuching. flight was cancelled. check in people only showed up 1 hour before. no information finally booked us in a hotel and told us with no other choice you are booked one day later. this is budget airline style when they do not have enough passenger they move you on the next flight. for eu departure they have to pay 600 euro beside the hotel. but africa and others there is no consumer law practised. therefore they take advantage and handle you like cargo. after 18 years of flying with malaysia airlines i have now given up and fly singapore airlines instead. a very bad experience indeed with a very old 1015 years dirty and noisy boeing 777 instead of the a330  on which i booked and which was withdrawn some 34 weeks before travelling. there were little inserts to make beds and the state of the seats was poor. the staff came to me to apologise for the state of the aircraft but i will fly for a few hundred dollars more with singapore airlines. there was paper stuffed in the side of the washbasin in the plane as there was a big hole and staff informed me to please not remove it interior of plane looked very bad indeed. airport lounge in kuala lumpur was a total disappointment with food less than average and service non existent. flight stewardess took my order for food and drink but i did not get my meal while the other passengers who ordered got theirs. she said shell check when she was the one who took the order. by the time she came back to me the plane was descending and she offered me a bottle of water. another steward was chatting with a passenger at 2f the whole trip and there were less than 18 passengers total. my checkin luggage with priority tag came out last how many chances do malaysia airlines need to compete with other low budget airlines kuala lumpur to mumbai in business class. i had last flown with malaysia airlines in february 2015 in business and had a good if not outstanding experience. i was keen on seeing the new malaysia airlines and opted for mh with the mhupgrade program and was happy to see my offer being accepted. but the new malaysia airlines was such a disappointment. they changed the equipment from boeing 777 to boeing 737 at the last minute. the aircraft was ancient with business class seats which seemed straight out of the 90s so much for the new airline. just one stewardess to cater to a full business class cabin the menu choices and food presentation seemed like economy class in singapore airlines or cathay pacific. the quality of food was pathetic and i just ate the bread and left everything else. of course the stewardess forgot to get my meal and drinks and only remembered after i reminded her. the seats were so uncomfortable would rather have flown airasia and paid more for an exit row seat. if this is the new malaysia airlines then this is bang up job indeed. never again will i subject myself to this torture. worst airline ever. i boarded from sydney with final destination as mumbai. they gave me boarding pass from sydney to kuala lumpur but didnt gave me from kuala lumpur to mumbai. at the check in they told your seat from kuala lumpur to mumbai is confirmed but due to some reason i cant print boarding pass. your pass will be ready at the gate when you reach kuala lumpur i confirmed it twice. she also gave me receipt of my luggage to my final destination. at kuala lumpur they said that flight is overbooked and we can offer you a flight only after 24 hours. they kept me 24 hours at hotel. this is todays issue and i am still in kuala lumpur. 12 more hours to go. i chose malaysia airlines as it is a one world alliance carrier with daylight flights out of and especially inbound into australia. convenience of schedule so i could get some work done was one of the main reasons to choose malaysia airlines. however the service on the sydneykl leg was dreadful with no eye contact from cabin crew and snappy responses to passengers around me. the food on the klbangkok shorter regional flights was much better than the food on the longer sydneykuala lumpur and return flights but thats not saying much. some of the worst airline wine i have ever had if you could get it and in fact was not offered at all on the lunchtime flight between kl and sydney. the exceptions to this dismal performance was one excellent flight attendant on the klsydney leg who did the best she could and given that im a one world emerald passenger qantas platinum i had access to the malaysia airlines first class lounge in kl which was superb. the lounge malaysia airlines utilises in bangkok is awful. the malaysia airlines business class lounge in kuala lumpur gave a fair warning that this was not a business class that could compete with many of its regional competitors the lounge itself was full of trip hazards  little steps everywhere and slippery floors where there wasnt carpet which badly needed a cleaning. there were lots of staff in the lounge but they were more intent on chatting to each other rather than on delivering customer service except the very efficient crockery collector who whisked away everything the moment you put it on the table but the crockery distributor wasnt equally efficient at most of the self service distribution points there were no glasses plates or cutlery. this might have been a good thing as the food available looked tired and unapprtising and below quality of the food available at the commercial outlets at the airport. the plane was clean and new and the business class seats spacious and still working. the cabin staff werent particularly welcoming and failed to offer the assistance expected in business class. the food was of the same mediocre standard as in the lounge and the food service delivery totally chaotic my sisterinlaw had to ask three times for a glass of water i requested a glass of wine when my main course was delivered and repeated the request a further two times to have the wine delivered after my meal leftovers were cleared away. my wife had the presence of mind to look at the meals being delivered and requested just the fruit salad that she saw was being delivered to passengers in the other aisle that aisle was being looked after by the senior steward and a friendly efficient flight attendant. fruit salad she was informed was not available until the serving of the second course but eventually another attendant asked why she wasnt eating and my wife repeated her request and was quickly served a bowl of the fruit salad. when the second course was served my wife was presented with another bowl of the coveted fruit salad along with all the other accompaniments which comprised the second course none of which she wanted to eat. as i sipped my glass of wine i was offered a basket of bread rolls which had been offered to the passengers in the other aisle at the start of the meal i declined but assume that they were the most appertising part of the meal as passengers in the other aisle appeared to eat them. business class on malaysia airlines is beneath the standard of business class on singapore airlines thai jal cathay pacific or qantas. kuala lumpur to london heathrow. as with the outbound flight this flight was delayed. we were almost 3 hours delayed arriving into london although this was never mentioned by anyone including the pilot during the inflight announcements. malaysia airlines seems to operate a if you dont tell them it isnt happening policy. in addition to the delay the service was terrible. ife yet again had to be rebooted just after the system was started. the food was very poor. clearly mas is trying to get you to buy into their newest gimmick to buy upgraded economy meals. our flight attendant was one of the rudest and least interested people i have met recently. one toilet was marked as unusable the entire flight although the cabin crew didnt seem to have trouble using it. i dont know if the toilets were cleaned during the 15 hour flight. in london it took ages for the bags to arrive and mine didnt same as on the outbound. i had a 4 hour connection so that cant be the issue. after complaining about the previous flight i finally got an answer via email and was told delays are due to uk air traffic control. shame on you malaysia airlines for not taking responsibility. in the competitive business class segment i would suggest that the apparent 1 jan 2016 executive decision to remove wine and alcoholic beverages from business class is another nail in the coffin for malaysia airlines. i am a business traveler with high status on malaysia airlines enrich program one world and flying blue klm. last night on a return flight jakarta to kuala lumpur i was told no wine with meal as the flight is shorter than three hours. its difficult to see how this cost saving is going to win business class clientele. it may seem a minor issue to senior management but as a consumer and as a business owner perception is consumer reality. perception is that malaysia airlines isnt interested in maintaining their business clients. from now on i will be flying only klm or ga business class to jkt a flight i do 35 times a year return cycles. if i had a choice i would not use mh either on my flights to mnl.mh perth to london via kuala lumpur and never again with malaysia airlines. the food was inedible beef served with rice was all fat and gristle no seasoning packets drinks poured from bottles instead of small cans etc the wine tasted watered down no gin available. the inflight entertainment was great on the 5 hour flight from perth to kuala lumpur then on the 14 hour flight to london it was very limited none of the selection was available as the previous shorter flight which surprised us on a bigger plane and longer flight. as we had two delays we lost our connection to london this was 2 days ago and still we have no luggage. if i travel to australia again we would not fly malaysia airlines. malaysia airlines from london to ko samui via kuala lumpur return. we took off late and the cabin crew were not very friendly. they ran out of red wine when we asked for a gin and tonic we were told none left. minutes later the same steward gave a gin and tonic to another passenger so we made the point of asking again. no tonic left we only just made our connection but our baggage didnt until 11pm that evening when it was finally delivered to our hotel. we were there at 10am apparently this is a regular occurrence. too short a transfer time in kuala lumpur. one hot meal in 12 hours on the flight and people with children were complaining. our return flight was more friendly but they ran out of section of meals. no fruit was offered. not sure i would travel with them again by choice. this was my first time with malaysia airlines from taipei to kuala lumpur on 5th jan 2016. it was such a small plane for international flight which takes 4hrs 55mins. and the space of the seat is the same as airasia budget airline. i felt so uncomfortable when i paid for more compare with budget airline. the cabin crew were not so helpful   when i wanted to place my hand carry bag into the compartment and one of the cabin crew just stand there and didnt even help to find space for me. i have to remove the bags of blanket in the compartment and then have some space there. there was dirt around the seat and the armrest on my seat 29d was broken. the experience throughout the whole journey made me feel like i was on a budget airline. kansai to penang via kuala lumpur on malaysia airlines. got me there and back okay. first aircraft kixkul was rather old service average. got my wine after id finished my meal too many cabin announcements each time in three languages. on the flight back kulkix the seatbelt sign was on for most of the flight so i couldnt get a coffee with my breakfast and the breakfast was awful. cabin was very hot considering this flight was returning to a cold country and everyone was already in their winter clothes. never again will i fly with malaysia airlines. travelling sydney to colombo via kuala lumpur  departing flight delayed 9 hours. 2 hour check in process at sydney airport at 5am because of ticketing problems not our fault and same for the return. once onboard the staff are shuffling around passengers from seat to seat to accomodate overbooking. the only saving grace was that on the journey to sri lanka from kl we were placed on a sri lankan airlines flight which was the opposite experience to malaysian. 2 suitcases left in kl on the return journey to sydney just topped off a more than mediocre performance. staff in the majority were unhelpful but did come across one individual who seemed slightly interested in their job. food disgraceful even by airline standards served curry for breakfast at 9am on departing flight only presume it was the curry from what should have been the original evening departure. departed sri lanka at 1am and served curry at 2am followed by a frozen egg roll at 7pm just before arriving at sydney absolutely zero thought given catering i have never seen so many food trays returned untouched. water pretty much nonexistent on all legs of the journey unless of course you wanted to walk to the galley and help yourself. aircraft in very poor condition seat covers coming off entertainment units not working tape holding things together in the bathrooms not cleaned at all during any of the flights. put simply a number of major errors and a whole load of small things have contributed to our party of 11 people declaring that malaysia airlines are completely rejected from our future travels and as a group we travel internationally multiple times year both for holidays and work. i travelled with malaysia airlines many years ago and do not remember this level of disappointment it is a shame and as a national carrier they should be disgraced with their performance. dhaka to kuala lumpur with malaysia airlines. no priority boarding for business class passengers. the entrÃ©e in menu stated satay chickenbeef but it was not served during meal service. when asked for the satay we were told that the caterer did not provide it. the seat recliner was not working properly so i had to sit up right. we have been loyal customer of malaysia airlines for past 15 years but their services have been going downhill for past two years. we booked this malaysia airlines flight from penang to melbourne via kuala lumpur months ahead with our seats paid for. little did we know that wed be left stranded at kuala lumpur airport their sorry excuse was that the flight was full which was rubbish considering the fact that the seats were already booked. now we have to either wait for another flight tonight via sydney to melbourne or fly the next day. worst of all they cant even confirm a hotel room for us.  im seriously disappointed with their lack of customer care and what little amount was put into the organisation of the flights. thoroughly a waste of both time and money. never again will i fly with malaysia airlines.  kuala lumpur to ho chi minh city on malaysia airlines mh 758. an old aircraft that was quite tatty and seat belts not long enough for large customers. a light meal served i ordered the pot roast beef brisket and i was unable to cut it. no salt and pepper supplied. no alcohol served on malaysia airlines flights under 3 hours.  kuala lumpur to london. the last time i used mh was 2010 and i thought of giving malaysia airlines another chance. unfortunately the nightmares started on the time i boarded. i requested to have sandwiches since i was feeling hungry after 8 hours in flight. unfortunately the male cabin crew informed me they do not provide snack like sandwiches. then i asked for any possibility to have peanuts but was told not it is not available. the crew asked me to wait for the next meal. next my luggage is damaged. it is an up hill struggle to get response from malaysia airlines. email is also send to management to follow but no reply. does malaysia airlines understand the philosophy of business concept.  kuala lumpur to seoul incheon with malaysia airlines. very cramped economy class seats for long haul flight. cabin staff woke people up during a night flight to ask if they wanted food. rather than use the tannoy to announce the food choices to the whole plane they chose to shout to the plane serve a few customers shout again and keep repeating this process. small meal had no options fish sandwich or nothing. not good if you dont eat fish the stewardess seemed amazed that people dont eat fish. i asked at checkin and was told i could not notify them of my dietary requirements. kuala lumpur to bangkok. flights about on time the only good thing. aircraft were old and tired. ife was not functional in my row on return no ife at all. service was poor at economy no blankets no pillows. they served coffee only up to the middle seats. timing schedhule terrible arrived 1.00am on klia just on time to miss all transports and pay taxi to kl. do yourself a favour and book a budget airline. malaysia offered no better service to pay i just paid more for no reason. was booked and checked in for 1130 pm flight from kuala lumpur to tokyo narita on dec 10 2015. delayed until 1 am next day. then finally delayed until 930 am. talked to duty manager. totally unaware of delay information was in flight information board. no accommodation provided so had to sleep in the lounge. arrived later than my boarding time but managed to connect because flight was also delayed. based on malaysia airlines letter emailed them on dec 12. automated response then dead. wrote on malaysia airlines facebook. responded by asking for info then dead. wrote to coo no response. malaysia airlines is an airline that is prone to long delays and does not respond to requests for compensation. adelaide to kuala lumpur. cabin crew was non existent after meal service. initial drink service was water oj or apple juice. when they ran out i was forced an apple juice. i declined and asked for a gin and tonic. then came a tray of beers. again all i wanted was a gt. then finally one was dumped as if to say something. meal service ran out of chicken so had to endure a fish option. no worries. second gt took 30 minutes. came with no ice and a dash of tonic. after clearances the crew was not to be seen. passengers were walking to the back galley for self service. i just wanted a glass of water after 3 hours of non existence service. water seemed to be a problem so i asked for a coffee. 4 crew standing and 2 sitting dont seemed to be interested.  bangkok to kuala lumpur. while the seats were reasonably spacious the configuration is 222 which means you have to move to enable the window passenger access to toilets etc. no screen provided for the 2.25 hour flight so no entertainment and not even an alcoholic drink provided. they did offer instant coffee or tea with tea bags. meal was ordinary and all in all a very disappointing flight. auckland to london heathrow via kuala lumpur. having flown similar routes to australasia on 4 previous occasions i have a benchmark by which i can judge others. malaysia airlines was my worst experience to date. the cabin crew were efficient at best but lacked any personal attributes. no smiles or personal interaction. the males were particularly surlyarrogant. the food was poor lacking choice and imagination similar meals being served for lunch and dinner. noodles rice and chicken seemed to be the mainstay. onboard entertainment was very american based eg comedy tv was all american series which otherwise would never make it outside of the usa. films were nearly all american. the outward flight from london left at 2115 which led to a sunrise some 45 hours later. during this dark period a dinner was served and when finished the cabin staff asked for all window shades to be closed and the cabin lighting was switched off. fine for a few hours shut eye but the cabin remained in darkness most of the daylight hours and was not lit until 23 hours before arrival in kl. whilst i realise that many people would sleep my preference is to get into local times as soon as possible and would have preferred the cabin to be in the afternoon mode. during this enforced darkness the cabin crew were noticeable by their absence. our return flight departure from kuala lumpur was delayed by 30 minutes but our arrival in heathrow was 60 minutes late. at no point was any apology or explanation given by the flight crew. the delay caused great anxiety due to the need to catch onward transport. in the event i caught my coach with just two minutes to spare. kuala lumpur to bangkok with malaysia airlines in business class. horrible old aircraft e.g dirty old seats ceiling fixed with adhesive tape. rather unfriendly flight crew. onboard food tasted and presented badly. no welcome drink and no excuse for delay. no personal inflight entertainment system. based on this one experience cant recommend this airline.    kota bharu to kuala lumpur. malaysian airlines flight mh1397 kota bharu to kuala lumpur scheduled to depart 1610 still here at 2230. we were given one announcement 2 hours into the delay saying there was a mechanical fault obviously this happens and is understandable what isnt is how it has been handled. we had to seek out information about when the new departure time was the only person manning the malaysia airlines office said the aircraft would depart at midnight that was an estimate made 4 hours ago he has now gone home while we are all still stranded. we havent seen anyone work on the aircraft for the past 3 hours and its been parked with its cargo door open abandoned the whole time there is not one malaysia airlines representative in the terminal and at the moment we are supposed to leave in an hour and a half thats what we were told 4 hours ago. no apologies or reimbursement has been offered for missing connecting flights regardless of carrier or to put us up in a hotel or pay for food. this has been a massive failure in both organisation planning and customer service. you cannot claim to be a premium carrier when your contingency plans are worse than any budget airline.    kuala lumpur to london. the airport was an absolute joke. flight was leaving at 1050am. we arrived at the airport at 800am went straight to check in  that took about 40 minutes. after that we headed to security and were in line for almost an hour. the queue was ridiculous. a few people ahead of us had issues with their visaspassport and i guess the security officer had no idea what to do. there was no sense of urgency. then the computers froze up for about 10 minutes. our flight started to board and my partner went to speak to someone who told us its fine just keep waiting. after the first security check there was another for luggage. absolutely no one seemed to care. we ran to the gate and obviously late  the woman was horrible. i explained the situation and her response  you should know its peak time and you should get to the airport early. the plane was fairly empty and i saw luggage being taken off which makes me believe people missed that flight. there was a family right at the end of one of the security lines going to london  who had gone up to speak to staff working there but was refused fast track. the plane food was disgusting and rarely was waterdrinks offered. food was served after departure and then 2 hours before landing. i wouldnt travel on malaysia airlines again. \\r\\r\\n    the worst checkin service from malaysia airlines. despite having boarding cards we faced a 2 hour wait in a chaotic queue just for bag drop despite having been checked in online. travelling as a couple they we unable to assign adjoining seats. then took the correct boarding cards and reissued to my wife with wrong name so we were turned back by passport security.    kuala lumpur to singapore with malaysia airlines. lousy service with lousy update information and lousy performance of staff check in. was flying mh607 flight scheduled at 725pm. passengers started to queue up at check in gate as screen as reflected gate will be open at 625pm. gate staff was not helpful in updating customers and a whole group of gate staff was sitting at the by the window chatting away and laughing away. even after the flight was delayed it took them until 650pm to help passengers with their respective queries. totally unexpected that malaysia airlines staff will have such a performance attitude. disappointed by everything especially the gate staff.   malaysia airlines has reached a new low. although the airline had to made a lot of budget cuts over the years i did not expect such disappointing service throughout my flight from jakarta to hanoi via kuala lumpur. the plane was filthy and not properly cleaned prior to flight. windows are dusty dried food  drink splatters on foldable table leather seats are dirty with spots and to top it off flight attendants were unpleasant no smile and unwelcoming. overall budget cuts are understandable but for a national carrier charging premium prices basic cleanliness and service should not be compromised. i have experienced much better flights flying with budget airlines.    kuala lumpur to taipei. platinum member with malaysia airlines. year on year the quality of service and cabin design is rather disappointing and still using a narrow body 737 for middistance flight. the cabin is small and feeling of lack of leg room space and no comfort for flight of over 3 hours. i found dirt inside the food tray storage and that including the business class seat. im platinum member with mh in all my flight most of the cabin crew do not pay any attention or acknowledge to me however if i fly with cx or qr the purser will personally come over and give a warm greeting  etc.\\r\\r\\n london to penang via kuala lumpur. had 4 flights with malaysia airlines in 3 weeks not one of them took off on time the delays were between 40 minutes and 2 hours and each time we were boarded onto the plane only to sit there and wait all this time. so on the flight out of london we had been on the plane almost 3 hours before we were offered a drink. on all flights i found the staff unhelpful and uninformative. they offered no advice about missed connections on the way out and on the way back my tv stopped working 3 hours before we landed i informed the crew and they didnt do anything at all. there was a huge mess up with seating on the way back despite booking my seats online well in advance upon check in they tried to put me be my husband on opposite sides of the plane. similar things had clearly happened to other people as it was mayhem on board with people trying to move around families being split up etc and the staff were less than useless. getting a drink on an malaysia airlines flight is almost impossible they came around with a tray of water or juice 3 times in a 14 hour flight and only did a proper drinks cart once. they dont put a menu out so at meal time you get a choice of chicken or fish and havent got a clue what comes with them its like feeding time at the zoo the staff are so unorganised never again worst airline ive flown long haul with    kuala lumpur to beijing. flight was full. unfortunate to have a grumpy cabin crew served us during the flight. my friend was scolded for not switching off his phone where it could be adviced politely. the entire flight the cabin crew refuse to give a smile. i have no idea what gone wrong with mas now. they used to have one of the greatest cabin crew years ago. and now theres nothing that they can be impressed for. an almost outdated aircraft average ife interface with average content average legroom and seat comfort dirty cabin and lavatory and to top it up a cabin crew who looks very experienced.     at the time of booking with malaysian airlines and unlike other oneworld alliance partners it is not possible to ascertain the fare class being booked and therefore the miles and points to be awarded to your frequent flyer program. i made a seamless round trip reservation from singapore to london with a stopover in kuala lumpar. at the check in singapore when i was given my boarding passes for both legs i asked if my miles had been credited and was assured that that was the case. the same scenario applied to my return trip. upon my return and having retained the relevant boarding passes i made various online checks to my account to see if the miles and cathay pacific points had been credited to my account. on 080716 the miles corresponding to the short leg from singapore to kuala lumpar were credited but since then there has been no activity. i made an initial enquiry with malaysian airlines on 290716 and subsequent follow up on 190816 to which i have received zero response. on 190816 i contacted cathay pacific in relation to the missing miles. i received a call from hong kong less than two hours after having sent a fax. i was informed that they would be following up with malaysia airlines with regards to the missing air miles for the kuala lumpar to singapore leg but as the fare class indicated on the kuala lumpar to london and return boarding passes was different to the short singapore to kl leg i was not entitled to any air miles. i have since contacted malaysia airlines yet again but to no avail. for passengers looking to accrue air miles and points if applicable in order to maintain their tier status check carefully when booking with malaysia airlines as there is no indication when booking as to any entitlement. moreover the fare class is not even stated on the travel itinerary receipt. i should also add that the price i paid for my return ticket from singapore to london was no cheaper than those offered by other one world partners yet they all offer air miles. as for the actual flights i was not impressed with this carrier. the service was lacklustre the food average and the a380 craft were showing their age. it also proved difficult to be served an alcoholic drink. the connecting flight from kuala lumpur to singapore left two hours after the scheduled departure.    now i totally understand why mh has lost its 5star rating. we flew business class from kuala lumpur to denpasar on mh715. equipment is an old boeing 737800 which is totally acceptable for a short 3hour flight however the cabin was filthy and shortly after boarding.  having flown with qatar airways and cathay pacific the previous day malaysia airlines food service and hard product is nowhere near in comparison which was a huge let down. the nearly inedible breakfast was served in a single tray by flight attendants who pretty much disappeared after putting the tray down with the exception of one flight attendant who was chatting with what i can understand a colleague seated right across the aisle with her fiance getting married in bali. the conversation started as soon as we boarded and continued during meal service and not once i noticed this flight attendant serving other passengers except chatting to her colleague while continually topping up their alcoholic drinks. meanwhile we and other passengers have to ask for a coffee or juice as not once either of these were offered. from the pointofview of a revenue passenger this it totally unacceptable. we were looking forward to a great flight with mh but had very negative views of the airline after this unpleasant experience. london heathrow to denpasar bali via kuala lumpur. flight to kuala lumpur the food was not good malaysia airline lost all five bags for stop over  next day fly on to bali we found three bags out of five bags made a report of two missing bags and one damaged bag. after 83 days we still have not received the two lost bags.  bali to phuket flight okay  phuket to kl they lost three bags even the one we replaced  other two where dripping wet and we had to wash our cloths in hotel. stopover for two nights and we fly back to london  the food on the plane for the return journey was great but the staff were rude and three tvs where not working correctly and two seats where broken i spoke to the head steward of first class and told him that i was going to make a complaint  sent a letter by recorded delivery to the ceo of malaysia airlines no reply for 50 days. i have phoned them and get the run around no one is willing to help send emails no reply. you would think by now that you would get a reply even if it was a standard letter by saying that they are looking in to your complaint  customer care is very bad i think and they dont care. singapore to narita via kuala lumpur with malaysia airlines. cabin crew service non existent. on the flight from kl to sg one staff member was chewing gum the entire time. i think communication is an issue for most of the cabin crew. flight from narita to kuala lumpur my seat couldnt be reclined. however the food is amazing so for the price paid there are no complaints about this..   a tired aircraft a380 london to kuala lumpur despite all the grandeur associated with its heritage. the carpet in business class was threadbare in places leaving the undercover exposed. doors to seat side cabinets didnt close. the seat itself was dirty and clearly a thorough cleaning of the surrounds had not taken place because when i fully reclined the seat a plastic bag fell out and so too a ripped up customs declaration form along with some other debris. food choices were limited and on the kl to melbourne leg they had already run out of one of the main course before they got to me. despite being in business class. my business class seat on the kl to melbourne leg was in the middle row leaving a ridiculously tight fit for my legs once the seat had been fully reclined to a bed. in order to exit the bed you had to bring the seat back to the upright position in order to be able to swivel your legs out from the little nook in which they sat when lying down. entertainment choices were sparse and the selection of latest releases was hilariously small. staff were earnest in their attempts to offer a professional service but there were mishaps and mistakes. the check ins at both london and melbourne was not with out incident. london took over 50 minutes for business class which must be some sort of record. in melbourne on the return leg i was told i am logging off as my shift has ended so try the next counter. thats a first in my many years of travelling for business. the lounges in melbourne and london offer the bare necessities whilst the kl lounge was more befitting that of hq as it should be. i can see why they offer fares at a discount to the major airlines. they need to in order to attract the clientele and your experience is a discounted one.    london to kuala lumpur my first time back on mas for over 5 years. i know they have had difficulty but they appear to have completely lost the plot now. the a380 was tatty cabin was worn in many places seats were dirty and staff did nothing to maintain the bathrooms throughout the flight. in fact the staff all seemed totally depressed and unhappy. the satay was the only redeeming feature and despite what i had read about the new management turning the airline round they just seemed to have slipped further down the scale. now trying to changing return to another airline subject to fare differences.    kuala lumpur to melbourne. i decided to upgrade myself to business 1 day before departure with cash. i called the call center and after spending more than 30 minutes communicating with the agent i was informed that i could not upgrade because my fare class did not allow it. i tried again during checkin and i was told that it was possible to upgrade but i would only be given economy class meal. this was emphasized several times by the ground crew. i found this rule to be utterly ridiculous as i was paying the full cash amount to upgrade. besides there were 4 options for the main dish so why bother getting an economy class meal instead of giving me whatever options left from business class. the problem was not the meal itself i could not care less if the meal is from business or economy. the problem was i felt singled out from the service and it really ruined the whole business class experience. lounge was rather disappointing in terms of the food option and bathroom cleanliness. onboard the cabin crew was friendly and attentive. however i did notice that i was not addressed by name whereas the passengers around me were. and i was also not offered any drinks when i woke up whereas the passengers around me were offered coffee when the cabin crew noticed they had just woken up. overall i found malaysia airlines to be very disappointing in the service aspect. my money will definitely go to other airlines as they will give me the full treatment as a full paying business passenger whether i purchased the ticket up front or decided to upgrade at the last minute.    the plane was relatively new and clean and boarding at ho chi minh was rather efficient. the positive stops there. the crew onboard were rushing through service to retire early onboard the flight with one round of drinks served. the meal was mediocre at best and has been one of the cost cutting measures by the airline. entertainment selection was mediocre at best and the controls work rather intermittently or rather a tad slow. the seat pitch was horrendous and comparable to those of a budget carrier it just felt tight jetstar pacific new aircraft has better seat pitch than them ground staff at klia were more interested in their own conversations than serving the passengers and it seems rather unprofessional. upon landing we had to wait for another gate as the gate that it was supposed to park at was still occupied by another mh aircraft. planning as such should be done beforehand to ensure that such issues do not occur as there were many other available parking bays at klia.     i have always been a loyal customer of malaysia airlines and supported them as much as i can. there has been an unfortunate drop in quality in the whole travel experience with malaysia airlines. on my flight from auckland to kuala lumpur i found the crew unfriendly and perfunctory. at times i found them condescending towards passengers. a request for a hot drink by my neighbour was met by a curt the seatbelt sign is on and an announcement has already been made rather than a polite declination. the crew seemed more interested in talking amongst each other in the galley rather than checking on passengers they were usually only seen around meal times. the toilet was in an unacceptable state from the start of the flight. the bits under the sink were broken and held together by duct tape. the floor was sticky the whole time. i dont think it was cleaned throughout the flight. the good thing about the flight was that the pilot was professional and communicated well to all the passengers. our plane had a technical glitch and we had to wait on the tarmac for 2.5 hours. he updated us very regularly and kept us at ease. other plus points were the cheap fares and that the check in process was a breeze using the app. i will keep flying with them because they are my only direct option but i hope there will be an improvement in terms of crew friendliness and aircraft cleanliness.    kansai to kuala lumpur return on full new year flights. everything just ok sometime bordering on mediocre. for example how can you sit in row 12 and be served your food last by which time of course the choices had run out and it was chicken or nothing. flights on time airplane cabin clean but toilet not so clean  and no paper. staff ok. very generous baggage allowance if this is important to you. klia is showing its age now. klia2  which air asia use  is much better. immigration took 30 minutes with half of the desks closed arrived at 1700 on a friday. baggage had been removed and placed next to a different carousel so was difficult to find. recommended if you can get a cheap ticket. always compare with air asia.    sydney to kuala lumpur sleeper service on a330 with the newish lieflat beds. many of my colleagues say that malaysia airlines is a shadow of its former 5star status and this is not untrue based on my experience. nevertheless with a very competitive pricetag an industrystandard but no fireworks lieflat bed what more could i want the inflight entertainment system was substantial and responsive although the screen was a little small. the service is courteous but perfunctory for some and somewhat indifferent in others  even in business class. meals were acceptable and the signature satay sticks were served before dinner. the flight arrived approximately one hour late.    melbourne to delhi via kuala lumpur. very poor service airplane was okay but food was not served well. lost luggage at delhi. i have wasted my so much time and i missed my train to punjab. i have been calling to find out about my luggage which was promised to deliver to address phone ringing but never been answered. i would never travel again with this airline.    ticket purchased june 2017 through travel agent. travelling london to ho chi minh return via kuala lumpur december 2017. upper deck seats 33 h & k confirmed on eticket issued by malaysia airlines. arrive checkin lhr 0610 hours thursday 7 december 2017. arrogan staff  at desk didnt want to check ticket. issued boarding passes seats 77 ab lower cabin. no. our seats were confirmed on ticket. confirmed on ticket does not mean confirmed on plane says the staff. let me speak to your supervisor. i am supervisor she says.  mistake is by your travel agent. i dont work for malaysia airlines. i dont know how their booking system works. your seats are 77b or maybe you dont want to fly confirmed on ticket does not mean confirmed.  i will put you in two other seats on upper deck she says. board aircraft. allocated seats located against rear bulkhead next to toilets and do not fully recline. they are so popular that the row of four are all empty. staff appears on board plane just before takeoff. seats 31 hk the two in front of row 33 at the emergency exit with plenty of legroom im 6ft tall are available. no i said not politely. spend next 13 hours upright listening to flush of toilets smell coming therefrom and back of seat in front inches from my nose. flight 45 minutes late into kul. rush to get connection to sgn. confirmed seats on this flight also changed at lhr. plane boeing 737800 cramped and tired looking. food awful. no beer. arrived ho chi minh but bags didnt. what an awful company. deeply regret have tickets with them for return journey but after that can confirm will never use again and unlike them my confirm means confirm.    kuala lumpur to hong kong. business class queuing like night market process of check in can take forever. staff station at counter supposed remain at station but went missing for more than 10 minutes. helpers doing luggage tagging was not proactive. overall staff working speed like a snail.    bangkok to kuala lumpur. was looking forward being on one of the first flights of their gorgeous new a350. the hardware was great but what a disaster otherwise. flight took off 1h 40 minutes late no explanation or apology on the ground or on the plane it was appalling. food now even on international flight of 2hrs and above is a cardboard box kind of meal without an appetizer or desert. its basically like a low cost carrier. staff not very friendly.   both of my return flight were cancelled by malaysia airlines since they reduced their daily flight to kathmandu to once a day. no apology no offer to refund the ticket. this cut my short trip by over 16h and i had to endure a dreadful overnight flight on a plane with a 30 seatpitch. i have been flying mh for over 30 years and thought things couldnt get any worse but they did it old and outdated 737800 with poor seat pitch and entertainment box under the seat in front. robotic and not very friendly flight attendants. the only good about flaying with mh were the hearty curries they served. overall not again.   sydney to manila via kuala lumpur. airplane was old but okay. food was okay staff were terrible. i asked for milk for my baby and the flight attendant said sorry we dont have enough on the flight. i couldnt believe we were refused milk for our child aboard a supposedly full service aircraft.   flew malaysia airlines from kuala lumpur to kota kinabalu. cabin was extremely hot. either the aircraft air conditioning system was not functioning well or the airline wants to save costs on not handing out blankets and pillows which they did in the past. i noticed not only on this trip but on several trips as well. please fix the air conditioning. very uncomfortable. lots of passengers with huge and heavy pieces of luggage who kept trying to force them into the overhead compartment. not nice.   my wife and i flew sydney to kuching via kuala lumpar with malaysian airlines on 26 december 2017 business class  mh122 with four days stopover in kuala lumpar. we have travelled to malaysia with mh more often than i would care to remember and we have always been very happy with the service provided. however sadly not on this occasion we were very disappointed. the standard has certainly dropped. fa gave us the impression that they would rather be somewhere else even though they try hard to be pleasant. i preordered our meal through book the cook and the meal was of poor standard and the menu has been reduced to only four choices and to rub salt into the wound i was only given a spoon with my meal. the wine at meal time was only served on request. the return journey to sydney was no better. malaysia is our favourite destination and we hope to visit malaysia as often as we can but next time it will be with sia. the only bright aspect of our flight was the use of the qantas lounge. outstanding    kuala lumpur to phuket. checked in at sentral and took the klia ekspres to the klia airport. to me this is an excellent mode to start the journey. none of the hassles of long and challenging queues at klia checkin desks. boarding straightforward boarding process in klia. there are not that many passengers so it is quick. flight it appeared to be a new aircraft judging from the shine and design of the overhead lockers. on sitting down i opened the tray and out fell on a halfeaten cake in a paper cup. i called the cabin crew who took it from me and walked away without an apology. i had to call her back to arrange for the tray to be cleaned. she behaved that she was doing me a favour clearing up this mess. as this was the 1st flight of the day for the plane. obviously the interiors were not cleaned properly. i find this unacceptable and the standards of the airline deteriorated recently. the flight was uneventful. the meal served was reasonably tasty for a regional flight. arrival the luggage arrived soon after disembarkation from the plane.    kuala lumpur to melbourne. unsatisfactory condition of plane and food. when i sat down in the seat i could smell urine. as the plane was full i decided not to move. there was also a smell of urine when i opened the toilet door. we were offered meat or fish. i asked for meat. the reply was we have run out of meat and there is only fish. why offer a choice when there is no choice. the fish was cooked in a batter. this had adsorbed the gravy and the dish was dry and tasteless.  i complained to the cabin crew and they gave me the address of customer service. when i got home i wrote to customer service to describe the poor quality of food and the poor maintenance of the airplane. after a long process of establishing my identity the reply came back please complain this to the cabin crew. i had complained to the cabin crew who asked me to complain to customer services. when i take it up with customer services they ask me to complain to the cabin crew. this is a ridiculous situation of passing the buck.    london to kuala lumpur. staff struggling to cope with an almost full flight. they appeared rushed even though it was a 12 hour flight. there was an old lady who appeared to be lost. she was wondering up and down the aisles looking for her seat. she could not remember where it was. i did not see staff helping her or reseating her to somewhere near the galley where they could keep an eye on her. later i saw her trying to open the toilet door. i had to help her open the door.  in my opinion i do not think it is a satisfactory situation of passenger care.    red eye flight kuala lumpur  sydney 16 feb seat 16a upper deck. golden lounge was undergoing renovation so we were directed to the regional lounge which was small and cramped and very hot. boarding gate was woefully inadequate for a large aircraft. there was no aerobridge to the upper floor so we climbed the stairs inside the plane which would not work well for people with mobility problems. the cabin was dated and scruffy and about 30 occupied. staff were disinterested in their passengers and were in a hurry to get the dinner service over. no menus were offered until i asked. drinks were given out begrudgingly. once dinner was over no offer of dessert instead the table linen was whisked away. lights out and i turned down the bed which proved hard and uncomfortable. the gaps in the seat made it hard to sleep on despite the thin mattress given out. breakfast was offered and my choice was not available despite it being a relatively empty cabin. i had the chinese dim sum which was dry and overcooked. i used my enrich miles to upgrade my ticket but based on what i received i would not purchase a business class ticket with this carrier. using the enrich miles was also difficult as they make it almost impossible to upgrade due to all sorts of conditions. staff were efficient but not friendly and never smiled.   adelaide  kuala lumpur on 25 feb in y class. check in at adelaide was slow as check in staff were engaging in conversations with passengers. this is a nice touch but it just slows people down. once on board everything worked well. staff were efficient and responded to requests quite promptly but were clearly disinterested in their passengers and never smiled once during the flight. i wonder if the morale of malaysia airlines cabin crew is deteriorating the food was good and adequate but the in flight entertainment is not extensive. the flight left and arrived bang on time. uneventful and everything went off well.    singapore to seoul via kuala lumpur. flight from singapore to kuala lumpur delayed by 2.5hrs. passengers who had connecting flights or meetings begged the staff at the mh transit counter to put them on a singapore airlines code sharing flight which was refused. i was lucky enough that i had 4hr layover in kuala lumpur. flight to kl was on a rather tired looking boeing 737. fas were rather robotic and not overly friendly. golden lounge in kl was still under renovation despite different information given on the mh website claiming that it opened on the 20th  february. replacement lounge shockingly basic. service on the long flight was similar as on the short flight. food and seat was decent. flight arrived on time ife poor. mh has been constantly on the decline over the last few years but this was the new low point due to the handling with the delay and the not very friendly staff.    tokyo to kuala lumpur. mh89 from tokyo to kl connecting to singapore was delayed once we arrived in kuala lumpur we only had 15 mins to run and transfer to our connecting gate only to be told that our flight has been changed to midnight there were so many things wrong with the airline.  there was no one waiting for us at the arrival gate to inform us about the transfer process and the staff at the transfer counter did not apologize and give attitude. the meal coupon is only 7 dollars     sydney to ho chin minh city via kuala lumpur. the staff was not professional and toilet was gross. the seat back table had a food stain on it. the blanket had pretty low quality and was thin and couldnt keep me warm enough.    kuala lumpur to bangkok. today the plane has technical issues forcing and passengers have to deplane and change gates. only to wait at the new gate because no security is in place this is over and above the usual technical issues of headphone sockets partially working. ive flown them for years and they are getting worse. ive not had a flight that leaves on time in the past year. if youre not flying for business they are cheap and thats likely the only good thing. otherwise if you have to rely on mas to be on time and clean my suggestion is look elsewhere. old tired planes lack of cleanliness and generally all round a poor experience.   mh004 kuala lumpur to london heathrow. economy cabin. seats narrow thin and lack depth so no support under lower thigh. armrests narrow and very hard. installed very close to seat in front which if reclined means a screen literally in your face. if over 1.8m tall your knees will be pressed against seatback in front. all together very uncomfortable. i have seen a lot of hype about the awesome a350 cabin. donât fall for it. malaysia airlines has modelled its economy cabin for maximum revenue not passenger comfort. cabin crew  like some planes they looked worn out and tired. robotic and clearly intent on performing their work to maximise their nonpassenger contact and sleeping time. rushed through cabin not giving opportunity to ask for service. no pleasantness or genuine smiles. cabin was left completely unattended for part of flight and with only one crew for much of flight. no cabin service. help yourself from galley. only water and biscuits available. some very irritating behaviour male crew especially. i find it offensive to be served by someone who thinks he is on a stage in the role of a drag queen. seat belt sign switched on during meal service but no turbulence. hot drink service suspended. you can get a hot drink after your meal but not with it. says it all about quality of mas today. entertainment system broke down late into flight. toilets very small and not cleaned often enough but then you cant clean a toilet if you are sleeping. food ok. not a word from the captain for whole of flight. plenty of better airlines fly into kul. have used mas for last 30 years through good times and bad but no more.    we flew long haul from auckland to kuala lumpur and then onto koh samui. would be very reluctant to fly malaysia airlines again. first issue was online checkin  we had booked seats 2 months prior and paid for them when we went to checkin we were given really bad seats at the back of the plane. when we called they said there was nothing they could do. we then asked for a refund after some arguments they said they would process it and we would get it in 3 months time second issue at checkin it took over an hour to drop our bags off. the flight was  delayed by about 1.5 hours so left at 2am. the plane was old food very average the toilet i used was not clean old screens with limited entertainment. there was quite a bit of leg room in economy and the seat configuration was 242 so was nice to sit just with my husband. we got a super good deal on our flights but should have paid the couple of hundred more to go on another airline.    melbourne to kuala lumpur. very bad service especially the lady who served our row asked for water she told me to wait as the service will start in 20min and never came back to me. we were never asked for tea or coffee until the row before us was asked  this happened not just once twice when they serviced drinks. the entertainment system was not working for my husband we reported to staff but she never bother she just looked and walked off. i have traveled with malaysia airlines before never came across service like this  its the service industry she is not giving out of her pocket.    flying malaysian airlines from jakarta to kuala lumpur was like flying a budget airline with worse service at a more expensive price. the flight was late with no reason given. the aircraft had no entertainment. most of the food and drinks had run out by the time the cart reached me. the staff didnt seem happy to be there. this is the last time i am flying malaysian airlines.    perth to manila via kuala lumpur. very disappointed with malaysia airlines. both flights are delayed at least 1 hour. my luggage had also been damaged. entertainment from manila to kuala lumpur is not working. flight from perth to manila was fine no issues but it was not as expected. flight back from mnl to per had been a frustration. overall very disappointed.   the bag drop off experience at kl airport was chaotic we had done online checkin which left us to drop our bags off. some people already had tags with them but there werent any machines in the terminal to print them out  so we asked for assistance. the malaysia airlines assistant was alone and crawling under requests she advised we only had to queue but was not convincing at all in her advice. during the flight my boyfriend and i were instructed in a very directive way to sit down whilst stretching our legs at the back of the flight because the back of the plane was for crew only. this was pretty strange as every other flight weve ever flown has allowed people to walk up and down and stretch their legs if needed even at the back of the plane. the thing that was most offputting was the way we were spoken to which id describe as being outright rude. we incurred an hours delay for take off on the 1st leg and 30 min on the return leg. we had breakfast omelette fruit juice fruits and yogurt at 1pm kl time when we expected lunch. we were also told that we had no option as they were out of any other options. other passengers also complained about this fact. after breakfast i went to ask for some peanuts but i was told no later by one of the stewardesses  whom im assuming was the chief stewardess. first of all we did not have a choice for lunch and then to be declined a little snack after when mas fares are higher than other carriers who also serve more food is disappointing. we found the cabin crew to be really direct and lacked good customer service skills. its a shame as weve flown with mas before and have always thought that they were a great airline. were more than disappointed flying with them this time around from lhrkul and back again. the plane was a a350 kl0004 on wednesday april 12th 2018 departing 09.50 am from kl to lhr we have decided never to fly with mas again. the experience is a disappointment and truly a shame for such an airline company with high potential. we will go back to flying with emirates or etihad in the future as they are more affordable and as a customer you come away feeling as you have been treated like a customer vs. being cattle.    langkawi to phuket via kuala lumpur. on our way to langkawi the flight was delayed 45 mins and the flight back to kuala lumpur which was a connection to phuket was delayed 45 mins and  we missed our connecting flight. worst customer service booked us another flight that departs 5 hrs later and gave us lunch vouchers for 20 myr which is 5.  spoke to their representative at the counter to book us another flight on another airline but zero customer service.    canberra to kuching via kuala lumpur. flight delayed over 2 hours and miss connection flight. given a complimentary hotel and coach when finally arrived at klia wait in very long line to find out what happened and then having to wait for transport. the flight landed around 10pm but still waiting on level 1 gate 2 for my transport to hotel almost 12.45 am now apparently they want to wait for everyone or enough people to registered at the counter before taking us to hotel. the pick up time at hotel tomorrow is 5 am.   worst airline for long haul it was just horrible. i sat in the front seat right behind business class it was a midnight flight and i clearly had my expectations too high. business class from my view was great dimmed light and all but economy was the worst the whole long midnight flight was with the light on it was so bright i couldnt sleep. the manager a lady stewardess was so scary she was so loud and rude the lady sat next to me put her phone on airplane mode and she was i believe browsing her photos in her album and this manager shouted at her to put it off and said i say off not airplane mode to her a few times my neighbour looked korean and i think her english wasnt that good but as a stewardess you dont have to shout so many times. i didnt want to have supper early in the morning at 2 am and the flight attendant insisted i must put my seat upstraight even when i needed my sleep.    flight was supposed to be at 1145am on 21718. we were told at approximately 1032am that the flight was retimed fancy way of saying delayed i suppose to 140pm. just under 2 hours. it is now 249pm and i have been sitting in the aircraft for the last 1.5 hours and it hasnt moved. no concession of any sort given to passengers. you say its an under two hour delay but in actual fact it is more than 3 hours. this is very frustrating and shame on you for allowing such delays like this. to make matters worse you dont provide ear phones for us to watch movies. we cant order drinks because its a short flight apparently. overall a bad experience.    denpasar to phuket via kuala lumpur. plane was an hour late leaving denpasar not a huge issue except malaysia airlines sell a ticket with only 50 min layover in kl. as a result bags were left in kl as they could not transfer to new flight due to the late arrival. definitely need to rethink their ticket sales and or scheduling on this route. slow service and no alcohol and certainly not up to the standard of a oneworld airline. essentially once a full service airline now trading as a budget carrier.    sydney to mumbai via kuala lumpur. they are the worst international airline i have traveled. the staff dont serve food when requested not even to kids it is only at their own set time. no water extra blanket alcohol not even extra peanuts was served throughout the duration of the flight from sydneykl and klmumbai. the food was an excuse for vegetarian food. they turn off the call lights over the seat and pretend you dont exist. i had to go to the pantry to help myself to some water.  we were also cramped in to a tiny boeing 737800 from kl to mumbai with unfriendly staff. the flight was standing on the runway for 1 hour after boarding us and the airconditioning was off and they let us sweat it out.    to the credit of malayasia airlines they are by far the worst international airline i have travelled. the staff were very rude. they dont serve food when requested not even to kids. no water extra blanket alcohol not even extra peanuts was ever served throughout the duration of the flight from sydneykl and klmumbai. the food was an excuse for vegetarian food. they turn off the call lights over the seat and pretend you dont exist. i had to go to the pantry to help myself to some water. two of them even shouted at a passenger behind me for asking for alcohol saying we are not running away we will give it to you after you finish your dinner. we were also cramped in to a tiny domestic aircraft a320 from kl to mumbai with a bunch of really unfriendly staff. the flight was standing on the runway for 1 hour after boarding us and for the entire time the airconditioning was turned off and they let us sweat it out. would never recommend this airlines to anyone.   it was indeed an unpleasant experience with malaysia airlines flying from delhi to singapore via kuala lumpur. the seating system allows some upgrade passenger to select the same seat as mine. neither the staff at checkin counter nor booking system were aware of this. it is only when someone challenges me while i am still seated did i realise that the seat had been double assigned. as i am travelling with a companion we would like to be seated together. however the upgraded passenger insists on the paid upgraded seat with rising their voice demanding the right to his paid seat from the ground staff. i was made to stand for 15 minutes watching this drama. the chief fa was just careless. eventually one this was settled i had been reassigned another seat. unprofessional ground staff crew members checkin system.    adelaide to shanghai via kuala lumpur. very disappointed with the whole flight. pretty much nonexistence service. due to an allergy had ordered a seafood meal. this was most disgusting. scrambled eggs a piece of white fish and a hash brown. missed coffee service. had to call. then after a long period i went on to order a drink. when i rang for service the flight attendants response was a yes as if why are you bothering us. west coast of australia and i was informed no more service as the bar in now closed. with over 4 hours of flight this is not normal.  snack time and again i got no beverage service  passengers received an ice cream. not me. part 2 delayed. give a mr20 dinner voucher for dinner that cost almost two times as much for something decent. new schedule time is 5 hour delay. smart as international flight rules state a free overnight accommodation over 5 hours.    nairobi to washington via amsterdam. i had a very bad experience flying klm. i bought my round trip tickets from the klm official website to fly from dulles airport to nairobi and back. im a green card holder but my 2 children that flew with me ages 3 and 11 are american citizens. flying into kenya had 1 connection stop at paris cdg which went fine. our return flight had 2 connections paris and amsterdam which to my greatest shock is not okay with a green card but is ok with an american passport. i requested to have my children fly as unaccompanied minors while i reschedule my flight at extra fees bit i was denied that. all i was told is to exit the airport go home until i could raise enough money to buy new tickets with 1 connection in europe or reschedule our flight at 817 each to fly the next morning. so i had to pay an additional 1634 for my children that were in time and didnt need visas to make 2 connections in europe.    budapest to amsterdam. today klm lost a customer ill mever flight with klm again. thestaff was very rude and forced us to check in our hand luggage while we specifically upgraded to seat in the fronts as premium economy in order to be sure to catch our connection. the flight was late 45 minutes so we made sure to be at the gate early in order to get in as soon as possible. we who were on time have been punished to check our luggage while everyone who arrived late could keep their luggage. klms policy to punish people on time and to reward late on is very unfair.    i am never booking a flight with klmair france again i travelled with my 5 year old son for the first time. they booked us on seats two rows apart. i called them several times but they could do nothing and told me to handle it myself on the airport just be sure to be at least 4 hours in advance also the booked food i have a gluten allergy were not served. even when i showed them the details of the booking where you could see the preferences they could not do anything. so no food for 11 hours and no apologies. in the end i send an email with the details and the only thing i received was a summary of my complaint and we hope that you fly with us again no never flew with klm to lima on via panama and direct flight back. flight to panama was operated by boeing 777200. quite an old one with screens 10Ã15cm or so. seat space quite narrow.  the crew was quite helpful. good experience was to fly on the second leg with copa airlines  just 3.5 hours flight but big touchscreens very polite crew and comfortable seats. flight from lima operated by quite new boeing 777300. bigger screen and better choice of entertainment but the seats were very uncomfortable even for a person like me just 1.7m height. almost no reclining. vegetarian meal ordered  terrible.  klm is reliable but the price they ask for their services is quite high for what you get. ill definitely avoid them for flying to asia as they are obviously still far away from service level of middle east carriers and when flying over the atlantic will try some other options. barcelona to edmonton via amsterdam. our klm flight was cancelled due to fog in amsterdam. no other flight that day was cancelled. we were put up in an airport hotel far from barcelona. the hotel walls were so thin i could hear the person in the next room coughing all night. the next day klm rebooked us on a inferior airline and when i wrote klm about it they said they wanted to get me home to my loved ones. my loved ones were with me. we chose klm for their reputation and it was a direct flight home. we nearly missed our connection in toronto with the redirected flight home. we never would have booked the airlines we were put on. worst long flight. as you enter the plane you can smell that its very old a good to start a very long flight. entertainment system is very old and screens need replacement they dont have usb plug to recharge your phone or tablet. food is terrible me nor my partner could eat the main course single option was provided.. they left us with trash on our trays for 3 hours making it very difficult to move and did not clean the toilets during the flight. they say they will have renovated plane interiors by 2016 i would not recommend flying with them before that. chicago to amsterdam with klm. overall from checking in to landing it was a poor experience. the food was awful and condescending cabin crew. as an airline klm have continued to go downhill for the last ten years and they are now a long haul budget airline with full fares. if flying to the usa try delta.    chicago to nairobi return via amsterdam. many times there are 2 or 3 adjoining empty seats which would allow a tired customer to lay down and get some well deserved shut eye except you cant lie down because the armrest only folds up about half way 45 degrees. this stupid armrest design is obviously been chosen to prevent passengers to lie down. most airlines flying this aircraft have fully foldable armrest. i flew on emerates on the same route last month and was happy to see foldable armrests. in another matter i was told at the gate the nairobi to amsterdam flight was completely full but there was one seat available in business and i might be lucky to get upgraded. i was seated in one of the best economy comfort seats 17c. great after take off the stewardess approached me saying she can offer me a more comfortable seat. having flown extensively with klm over many years this normally means an upgrade to business. i took my stuff and followed her only to be shown a seat behind the bulkhead which had absolutely no foot or wiggle room. it was one of the worst seats on the plane with a crying baby right next to me. when i tried to get my great 17c seat back it was already occupied. i spend the rest of the flight of about 7 hours standing up and walking around. needless to say i am an extremely unhappy camper.    our flight was delayed from paris to amsterdam and when we arrived in amsterdam our connecting flight to manila had us so we had to spend an extra night in amsterdam.  the customer assistant made a comment that we should have just taken an earlier flight if we had an important thing to do the next day. how unsympathetic then we were told to get a voucher for the hotel where we would be staying at and had to wait for a shuttle in the cold which took almost an hour. when we arrived at the hotel we found out that it was under renovation and didnt even have the proper amenities for a hotel. to make things even worse when we arrived in manila 1 of our checked in bags was missing such an incompetent airline i will never fly with them again. san paulo to manchester via amsterdam. the boeing 777200 was the new klm business class. still light years away from many modern airline business class seating cxekey etc. however the seat is much better than the previous klm product and the headset even plugs in at shoulder level rather than low down in a corner. marginally improved personal space than the old style. onboard service pretty poor food and drink limited. hot towels were cold hot rolls were cold even the coffee was cold. many items missing from meal tray. food trolley prepared far too much in advance of service. given that the service outbound was fantastic this inbound leg to ams has very disappointing. the new amenity pack was still basic but contents are of poorer quality than the old. the socks already unravelling & the toothbrush bristles fell apart when used. hardly premium product for premium class. the crew on the short flight to manchester were friendly and helpful for the short connecting flight.    london to amsterdam. appalled by klm chaos at heathrow this evening with an overbooked flight at 20.25. later on the flight not allowed to bring on any trolley bags unless gold or platinum members  checked their luggage policy and am allowed hand luggage of the size i have. get on board and empty lockers amsterdam to toronto with klm. i got to the airport for a 945 am flight only to find out that the plane has been overbooked and there are no seats for my family. we are then informed that we have been changed to a flight at 245pm and now have to travel indirect to toronto via montreal. we speak to the supervisor at the ticket desk and he tells us that after we pass through security there will be some meal vouchers waiting for us at the information desk. when we arrive at the klm desk they kindly let us know that our names are nowhere to be found on the compensation list. after about 1 hour of hassling over the vouchers we give up. our family should have been back in toronto early afternoon but instead we will be arriving well into the night. thanks a lot klm for all your courteous service.   sao paulo to amsterdam and a poor experience with klm and their new ergonomically designed seats. sitting in the window seat i felt pressed to the wall by the passenger next to me a normally built man. whatever position i sat resulted in contact with the passenger next to me. this was never a problem with the old comfortable seats. they had plenty of space for normally built passengers. i attempted to sleep by standing for a couple of hours by the restrooms but was not allowed by the flight attendant. the toilet seat was actually more comfortable than the ergonomically designed seat. i was also told that the seat widths are the same as earlier on klm which seems to be incorrect after reading the reviews on this site where so many others are complaining about the narrow seat width.    kuala lumpur to berlin via amsterdam. inflight service average. attendants not that friendly. food as expected for economy but the omelette for breakfast was dry and a little tasteless and coffee seemed very low quality. please supply milk instead of powdered creamer. entertainment options acceptable. easy to checkin online. no problems there. premium economy seat had great legroom and recline. but you have to share the underseat space with the person next to you. so that is annoying. who gets to put their bag there i would use them again if the price was right. london to istanbul via amsterdam. one of the worst flying experiences i have bad. the staff at heathrow were very rude the ticket was sold without making it clear there was no luggage allowance so we had to pay extra. they had only two staff at the airport so we had to queue for a long time to get this done. the plane was delayed by 3 hours so we lost the connection. klm also lost the luggage which we had to pay more for in all i found their staff to be extremely rude the service on the aircraft was appalling and they are unable to fly even 100 miles without having a several hour delay.    we have flown klm twice from singapore to bali return. we paid extra for comfort seats but what a joke. the seats were offset so my tv screen was halfway between mine and the next seat i was window. my husband was middle. the aisle seat had an armrest tv and tray because there were only 2 seats infront of us. my husbands tv was overlapping her space and his tray hit hers. more importantly her tv totally blocked the row. it was a nightmare. on the 13th we flew back. had paid extra for comfort and were seated several rows back so didnt get them. never again. amssin the food was inedible breakfast was as poor. non working ife. i was travelling with my son and wife and one ife was broken while the other one would not respond to the remote control. klm is the worst choice on europeasia route. manams 19 april. flight departed man almost 2 hours late due to late inbound arrival should have had 2.5 hrs to connect at ams but by the time we deplaned had just 40 minutes to get from one end of schipol to the other. my onward flight had already boarded but was waiting for the 3 passengers from the man delayed flight  otherwise it would have meant staying in ams overnight. food on board was awful a piece of cake and a very weak coffee. march 15th and 26th canada  amsterdam  germany and return. staff kind and attentive many smiles and polite at all times. the food offered is below standard. im not picky when it comes to airline food but even i was not able to enjoy any of it. all the food served was cold or undercooked. other than that very smooth flights. amsbkk. i have flown this route multiple times and with a few exceptions i find the flight klm crew rather rude and disinterested. on the website when i bought the ticket i had ordered a childs meal for my 10year old and this had not come through. the flight attendant rebuffed me by a range of arguments ranging from you should ask at the checkin counter to he is too old for a childs meal. none of which answered my simple question how and why my request had not come through. ife did not work properly. generally seats are small but ife screens are too small. the whole experience this one and previous ones shows klm is not interested in the passengercustomer at all. it seems for klm crew the passenger is merely an obstacle to a good salary and lots of free time in exotic locations than a purpose to serve. flew mnlamsmad  bcnamsmnl. the stewardess  steward just do what they need to do and seems that they do not care about the service theyre giving. food is horrible its so expensive. seat pitch is okay but on their long haul 777s legroom is not enough. im elite member flying blue and fly to rio de janeiro from 4 to 5 times a year. i have determined that the value of the trip will depends very much on the cabin crew who are just on the flight. on my second last flight klm 705 on april 10 the cabin crew were excellent whereupon klm 705 june 16 cabin staff were of a very low level. some staff will do everything so the guest will enjoy the journey while another crew sees the guest mostly as a distraction to their work. aircrafts are ok but no more a major upgrade is necessary but what really makes the experience of klm worthy as a choice is cabin crew. when you then met with such a low level that the recent trip was to the reelection of airlines to be something relevant. i flew twice with klm from hamburg to cape town via amsterdam. first time the return flight to hamburg was delayed and we were stuck in amsterdam for 10 hours without any service not even a cup of tea or information. the 2nd time i flew with klm was the first time i have ever got hungry on a flight between 6am and 2pm we only got one dry cookie on the flight to amsterdam and a small bag of nuts on the following flight to cape town. first real meal was at 2 pm on the flight back breakfast and the first hot beverages came at 11.30am time of departure location which is really late when you are awake since 5am. dxbamscgn return flight. chaotic checkin at dxb airport. my reservation reference had been lost and ground staff were unable to retrieve it. i had to go down to the klm airport office and resolve it. crown lounge is pitiful no food service no quiet zone no showers. sky priority boarding has been not respected we were all mixed. aircraft operated was an old tired airbus 330200 we were packed like sardines and the temperature was extremely hot with no individual air setting. seats awfully cramped. ife was not working and was never reset. light remained off during all flights a night flight no earplugs nor eye mask available. food was a tiny cheese sandwich as a snack after take off and a delicious breakfast with only one option served by the most inefficient and rude crew ive seen. return flight was similar same equipment same food same rude cabin crew. worse still is schiphol terminal unhelpful ground staff. no way to access to the lounge even with a premium economy ticket. amscgn flight delayed. london  bangkok with a lengthy transfer in amsterdam. the staff were atrocious the food average and the ife appalling with screens that were useless. one of the poorest flights i have experienced. will not fly with this airline again if avoidable. we were booked 3 months in advance johannesburg to amsterdam. arriving at the airport 3 hours ahead of takeoff we were told that the flight was overbooked and we were on standby. this was the first leg of a flight to barcelona for an important business trip. there would have been serious losses to ourselves had we not been able to travel. no airline has ever done this to us before. some pleading with the staff got us on to the flight but seated a couple of rows apart. i would never trust klm with a flight booking ever again. i would arrange my travel plans to specifically avoid travelling with them. deliberately overbooked flight from amsterdam to vancouver. would not allow on line checkin said have to check in at airport which i now believe meant they were overbooked. would not acknowledge this at point of departure vienna where alternate routings were available. it seemed that the persons bumped all had carry on luggage only  a coincidence or does klm select by whether they have to get luggage off the plane after the flight left without us it took klm nearly 5 hours to get us an alternate flight now departing the following day. staff were somewhat apologetic about the long time dealing with this. klm understaffed the people dealing with overbooking and there were so many overbooked flights they could not manage. they gave us different information one person saying they would assist us to upgrade on return next person saying first had no authority. i will never fly klm again. flight 743 yesterday august 31 from amsterdam to lima. i was in the business class and have never experienced such uncomfortable seats impossible to lie down normally the bottom of the seat is slanted down so your feet are way down and you can slide  moreover it is so narrow that one arm falls in the alley. during the flight i pointed out to the flight attendant in the business class that there was no more toilet paper and she thanked me and put a new roll you would think she could check the other bathroom no. some time later i was in that one no toilet paper either both rolls empty. this is not acceptable. not once did any of the cabin staff make any effort to communicate during the flight with the passengers. they just did what needed to be done and finished except check the lavatories. glad i am going back with air france. in general i find the service of klm terrible. on my last trip from birmingham england to amsterdam a stewardess just before we should have begun to taxi for take off came down the isle and said that i was too heavy to sit in an exit row seat and will need to change seats. i am not too heavy the stewardess had called the incorrect name. the other person in the exit row was not much heavier than myself though. the stewardess was followed by the co pilot who said that we all had to be very quick because klm was loosing a lot of money waiting. they should not have asked us to leave our seats and they also should not have waited for just before takeoff to do so. i am 6 ft 190lbs. i do not like their seats on their long haul planes. they give me a back ache as it seams that they have a type of lumbar support which i find too low. i have used klm many times and only a handful of flights were decent. during my last flight klm lost my economy premium  extra booking and thus i was placed in economy. this was however not nearly my largest annoyance with klm. the largest annoyance by far is the staff service which on average is quite appalling. staff are unfriendly and inattentive at best and if youre unlucky outright rude. the call attendant buttonlight over your head never even mind pushing it its only there for show at klm. appalling service both on and off the air planes. unfortunately i live in the netherlands so ill probably fly with them again soon. not looking forward to it. amsman 188. the return trip was even more disappointing. i hadnt realised that klm is now all self service including baggage drop off and nobody knew what they were doing klm staff were few and far between and when i did find one was spoken to in a very unhelpful and abrupt manner. again my seats were changed and very poor level of service on board. will avoid for another 15 years manams 158. after a series of poor flights i hadnt flown klm for 15 years giving them another chance proved to be a mistake check in was chaos and involved a 30 min wait. on their website they make a big thing about seat selection at time of booking yet on both sectors my seats were changed without apology or explanation. although the cabin crew were friendly service is the bare minimum  a drink and 4 tiny biscuits not even a newspaper. very poor overall for a national carrier. i flew from nyc to amsterdam and back to nyc in full planes that had such tight seating that it made it very uncomfortable. klm is squeezing every tiny last bit of space from the cabin. the little entertainment screens are so small and of such low resolution that they are unpleasant to watch. the earphones are the cheapest of the cheap and useless. in both trips the bathrooms were smelly and unclean from the start. not flying again with them. flew brussels  amsterdam  bonaire in business. leg bruams was short and ok. the leg amsbon was mediocre. nothing fancy old plane. they advertise to redecorating the planes but this was still not done. service is very cold you have the impression that you have to do them a favor and not the other way around. food quality was very basic and same for quality of wine. last year when we flew the same routing there was not enough food for business class passengers as it was a late flight. feel that they reduce on everything. if there was another airline who flew straight to bonaire i would certainly not fly klm anymore. amscuracao 25th november kl 785. pleasant way to get there well taken care of on board. pity that the flight attendant on our aisle wasnt so nice like the rest of the crew. why not change your job if you dont like dealing with people no smile not even a look at you when taking meal orders. mctamsmct. this has been by far the worst longhaul flight i have had. grotty crown lounge at mct airport disorganised and unhelpful ground staff. aircraft was an old airbus a330200 very cramped seats. no amenity kit for a night flight no special food for premium economy pitch size is nearly the same as regular economy. our flight arrived 1 hour late at ams with no apology. return was horrible. incredibly rude ground staff at schiphol access to lounge has been denied to me despite of sky priority access and premium economy ticket. security staff ignorant and incompetent. i could say the same about cabin crew impolite. same a330200 we were packed like sardines. food inedible and served cold. my ife was not working and was never reset. my luggage was missing at mct and only came 2 days after with no apology. never again. i fly about 60 times a year with klm. service seems to get less and less to a point where it is unacceptable. last flight was on 712 amssha. after boarding in ams they left us in the plane for about 3 hours during aircraft repair before we left off. no catering during these hours except for one glass of water and a cookie. cabin crew was plain rude and uninterested during the whole flight. makes you wonder whether it is a good policy to put your older staff in the front of the plane. i flew the 737800 from amsterdam to venice in economy class. the dutch airline may not have the latest in product equipment the planes can be rather old however i love their use of technology and pr to create a wonderful flying experience. checking in in amsterdam on my flight to venice was easy and totally automated. no more humanoids to deal with including baggage dropoff. online checkin is also very efficient clearly outlining the steps with various additional options given including a last minute upgrade for a fee. the service can be jarring the meal rather simple and the seat very tight although i have to say that i do like the seats recline angle which is not as straightup as usual in takeofflanding mode but perhaps klm makes up for some of this with clever use of technology and marketing. kl0438 19th december. i paid a large premium to travel business class from abu dhabi to luxembourg via amsterdam in december. despite being told that beds were flat they were anything but with beds reclining only to an angle that left you slipping down. plane was old seats uncomfortable food inedible. my wife and kids flew economy a few days earlier and tell me this was an even worse experience. luggage allowance is also useless. on the way back despite having 5 of of us travelling and only 4 bags we were told wed have to pay a 75 euro premium for being slightly over on a couple of bags. we were still way below total weight allowance. kl1477 on feb 26th. after having issues with the booking the klm customer service support staff were very slow to respond certainly not within 24 hrs as claimed and the responses were unhelpful. the actual flight was ok and close to on time slightly delayed in flight beveragesnack service was good. however the klm website stopped recognizing my frequent flyer code and all partner airline codes from what klm tells me and i have not been able to select my seats for 1.5 years since they had a website change in nov 2012. to select a seat i must contact klm directly for each flight which has proven problematic repeatedly. i found the customer support to be something that needs improvement both with the level of service and the consistency. first and last time flying klm. terrible outbound and inbound experience. 8 day round trip. outbound flight from heathrow cancelled and i had to be rebooked onto an alternative airline with a 12 hour delay. due to fly out on 150212 on flight kl1000. due to fly back on kl523 leaving lusaka on 250214 inbound flight grounded in lusaka lusakaams for 24 hours poor communication from staff. i had paid for economy comfort seats lost them at connection in ams. terrible food service ams to lhr  only egg sandwich served. my daughter doesnt eat egg and when asked for a biscuit or something else we were completely ignored. supposed to connect from ams to lhr on flight kl1017 on 250214 but ended up on flight kl1007 on 260224. absolutely awful experience start to finish. amsarn. checkin went smoothly and the check in agent was polite helpful and friendly. big plus for the crown lounge. the food was nice although there were only two things to choose from. plenty of drinks though. i know it was a 2hour flight so i didnt expect much but the service onboard was so so. nothing special. i got my drinks and my meal nothing more. and please if you only serve cava on short haul flights then dont call it champagne please. i had some issues when i booked my flight. klm promised to get back to me but they never did. although i really enjoyed the lounge at ams but because of issues during booking process the customer service the service onboard in the class i was traveling in i will try to avoid klm in the future. bcnamsgig rio de janeiro march 10th. had to fly klm because no other option was left. in fact i did not expect anything but a bad flight. klm went beyond its fame just a horrific experience. bcnams was delayed no explanation. ground staff and cabin crew were both rude and ignorant no lounge invitation despite of premium economy ticket no respect of priority boarding. bcnams was full of noisy chinese passengers who left the plane extremely dirty after 30 minutes of flight. breakfast was a single edam cheese sandwich no other choice so i could not eat at all. transfer at ams was extremely short and we had to run. ground staff at schiphol are just goodfornothings. amsgig old tired boeing 777200. my premium economy ticket has been not taken into consideration and i found myself in economy in the middle of the plane. only one choice for meal again small portions food inedible. snack served prior to landing was laughable pizza or crisps and when the trolley came to my row no pizza available. cabin crew rude and impolite they spent all the time playing with their phones in the galley. plane landed late at gig luggage delivery took 1hr. never again. 2 days ago we took a flight from panama to amsterdam with klm what a terrible experience half of the employees appeared bored. the highlight was the situation when employees began discharging passengers who were waiting at the gate and forced us to pass the security check again. no more klm amsman april 2014. this was the last flight of an 8 flight holiday and was by far the worst of all. the flight was delayed because of the inefficient security checks at the gate which took nearly an hour and a half to clear the flight making the plane 30 mins late. another flight was allocated the same gate going to anatalya so confusion reigned throughout plane was cramped worse than a charter flight staff were surly and service was slow and we were still finishing our snack on final approach. when will short haul operators remove the tilt back buttons on short haul flights it just makes for extra discomfort on an already cramped seating. terrible experience and we havent even gotten to the airport yet. we had assigned seats. when i checked in online one of our seats was changed to the back of the plane. we paid for upgrade to economy comfort in the front of the plane. klm changed the seats  no explanation no effort to make the change. we are going to have a great time at the airport tomorrow. we bought tickets to fly round trip to amsterdam from oslo. my husband inadvertently pressed the wrong day for return but immediately called them within 5 minutes. they changed the date but made us pay 270 euros for the change refusing to consider an honest mistake. we received an email saying our day was changed. on the day of return we arrive at the airport and after waiting in line for 30 minutes we were told that we dont have a booking. we had to then go to another line to purchase our ticket and had to pay the difference of 270 euros again. we were told at that counter that we dont have to pay for our luggage as we are delta frequent flyers but the lady at the luggage drop off refused to listen and made us pay 30 euros but after paying it our bag was returned due to an error so we went to another full service counter with our baggage where we were told we shouldnt have to pay for luggage. so now we have to claim the 30 euros online. so frustrated and disappointed with klm. the ground staff were trying be helpful but were disconnected from each other. klm 1845 from amsterdam to vienna on of july. we had booked the flight over a month before the flight departure date. upon online checkin one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear. we had to ring up customer support as the online check in gave no other seating options and asked to change this so that we could sit together. we were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. we were also told if we got to the airport early the checkin staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. we arrived at airport checkin more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. we were also told that we had to pay 30 euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online but we couldnt do it online or else we wouldnt have been able to change our seats at the airport. we discussed our experience with the lady at the checkin desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. so we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 euro per suitcase. we then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 euro each to sit in an economy comfort seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. long story short this two hour flight cost us 900 aud up front to be seated nowhere near each other. when we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra 120 aud. would never ever fly again nor recommend to anybody else. booked flights from abu dhabi to glasgow on three separate dates in july for family of four. experienced problems with each flight on the 8th daughter missed connection to glasgow due to flight delay from abu dhabi as a result spent 6 hours in amsterdam airport and as compensation was given â¬10 on the 17th luggage failed to make the connection again due to flight delay and today the 25th my wife failed to make the connection again due to flight delay and was sent via birmingham to glasgow on the last flybe flight further delayed by one hour resulting in a total travel time of over 17 hours. the luggage was received the next afternoon however klm could not advise delivery time therefore day wasted waiting in hotel room. klm support found to be very poor particularly the dubai call center and on line check in facilities. why offer flights when the connection cannot be made amssfo. was keen to take this flight because of the unusual schedule leaves ams at 09.50 not uncivilised but with a ten hour flight time and an eight hour time difference it lands in sfo at 11.45. wake up in europe and be on the pacific coast before noon i tracked the punctuality of the flight in the two days before my own and it was five hours late and four hours late respectively so i should have been relieved that we were taxiing only one hour late although my dream of a morning arrival in california was dashed. the reason given was late arrival of the inbound aircraft but with all the flight tracking apps these days airlines are going to have to be more creative with their excuses  our aircraft had arrived from paramaribo hours earlier and on schedule. new business class seat on klm is pretty good note that only window seats have a little shelf next to the headrest so i had room for books ipod et al but not sure what aisle pax are supposed to do with their stuff. food was excellent was sorry they didnt have a spare as i would have eaten it up despite being quite full. only downside was the crew were not very friendly overall and one in particular was extremely unhappy to be there a lot of hostility on show which is inappropriate given what biz class pax have paid. landed half an hour late still one of the first international arrivals of the day so immigration took only a couple of minutes and bags were delivered promptly. i would take this flight again but hope for a happier crew next time. my recent july 2014 flight from johannesburg to amsterdam on klm was one of the worst flights. i had a terribly uncomfortable seat 15a in what klm ironically calls economy comfort class and for which it even charges a premium economy price. the slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff i have ever seen on a flight. there were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. the crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if i had not asked them to turn them off. the cramped seat made sleeping impossible the food was average to poor and served without salt pepper or utensils which i had to request separately. departure was delayed the arrival late although not too late and nobody was on hand to provide connecting flight information. definitely to be avoided. dreadful experience. 28th july. 3 hours on the tarmac at glasgow because schiphol airport was closed due to weather conditions. yet they still flew us into the chaos knowing that we had missed our connecting flight and that all flights out of amsterdam were cancelled or delayed. long story cut short 200000 cases lying in the hold in amsterdam klm staff rude and not enough of them to deal with the amount of people requiring flights. stood for 8 hours in queues along with hundreds of others with only a bottle of water given to us free of charge they told us to find our own hotel rooms for the night and they would refund the cost first night of our holiday lost luggage then lost for 4 days holiday to lake como completely ruined. no customer service whatsoever 25 voucher given to us with our lost luggage for our next flight with klm no thanks klm we will use other airlines. never again will we fly through schiphol or use klm. lhramsdxb in business class. by far the best part of the flight was the skyteam lounge at hrow t4 amsterdams lounge was tired unwelcoming huge queue to enter and poor selection of refreshments. schiphol is undergoing a major refit avoid until completed very old aircraft with equally tired crew who did the minimum to service a full flight. i can only imagine that the klm cabin crew are on fantastic salaries otherwise why would they want to be there it certainly had nothing to do with wanting to provide any level of service. food average frequent beverage service and on schedule arrival. as a fb platinum for life member i have tried to remain loyal although with so many airlines flying into the me region now i will certainly shop around. whats the point of being loyal if there is absolutely zero interest from klm when giving them your business having booked a series of longhaul business class flights with klm i searched their website and their terms and conditions just to make sure that in line with all other airlines they allow the inflight use of cpap machines cpap  continuous positive airway pressure  a small air pump that prevents sleep apnoea. as they provide power sockets to their longhaul business class seats i assumed that this would be no problem but believe it or not klm will not allow passengers to connect medical equipment to their power sockets klm allow passengers to connect anything else to their power sockets computers tablets dvd players phone chargers electric razors etc but not medical equipment. i have told klm that my little cpap machine is electrically tested and internationally certified for aircraft use  but still they say no. when asked why they refuse to answer. what a disgraceful disgusting policy and what an arrogant attitude flight from toronto to amsterdam was delayed 4 hours. the 20 voucher that was given for the delayed was invalid throughout the airport and klm staff was rude and refused an explanation when asked. flight from amsterdam to toronto was once again delayed and the entertainment screen in approximately half of the seats including mine did not work. not a good experience and will not travel again with klm. manchestermanila return 031014 and returned 191014. flights delayed after stop over in taiwan going to manila and from taiwan going back to amsterdam. had to disembark twice in taiwan as transit passengers. air conditioning system not working properly on the ground going back to amsterdam. so hot and inconvenient with no proper updated announcement as to whats going on. very cheap and inconvenient earphones. very limited inflight entertainment choices. no inflight menu selection food so so and the cabin crews just shove the trays in front of you  not very hospitable. poor handling of ground staff about transfer and connecting flights due to delays. messy chaotic and tiring flights. first time to fly klm and the experience puts me off using their service again. overall experience not enjoyable and wont recommend it. needs improvement. my wife and i flew from singapore to bali on 23rd december 2014  never again. first problem was with an officious male steward who although i knew where my seat was insisted on looking at our tickets telling me that was why he was stood there and then proceeded to direct us to the starboard side of the plane rather than the port side where our seats a  b were which resulted in us having to walk on down the plane on the wrong side and then cut through and then try to walk back up the plane against the flow of passengers to get to our seats. second problem was on our return flight to singapore on the evening of the 27th all the passengers were hanging around for hours at bali airport as there was a problem with the plane. not a problem until we heard that the flight was cancelled and that we would be moved to hotels. no one who could speak english or dutch was available to liaise with the passengers to advise us of the arrangements. the crowd sort of drifted towards the exit but no one came to tell us about reclaiming our baggage or times of the buses etc. we then drifted towards to baggage reclaim hall down some service steps and then had to find where the cases were coming in. we then drifted towards the exit and then the fun started. the buses turned up again with no explanation and we were trampled on by the dutch in their efforts to get on the buses. we eventually got on to a bus. but had to stand with our luggage dumped along the aisles. we then were again trampled on by them in their effort to get into the hotel so we stood back to let them fight it out. we then eventually got our room but no mention of how we were getting back to the airport the following day. we did get a phone call from klm telling us we needed to be at the airport first thing in the morning to get a flight with silk air. we got a taxi back and thankfully the flight went ok no thanks to the very poor communication skills shown by klm. problems arise and safety is of course paramount but if there was some one there who could lead the tired passengers through the situation and keep them informed the matter would have been far less traumatic instead it was the blind leading the blind. bos to bhx via ams. we booked in advance but were informed a couple days later that the second leg of our journey was cancelled and that we were rebooked on a much later flight. a sensible connection was available but we were told that it was impossible to make. when we took the flight we made it to earlier connection with plenty of time to spare but were told it was now impossible to transfer. even with an eighthour layover it was impossible to transfer to another other flights because of our baggage. the transfer desk was extraordinarily curt impossible and no were all we got. our rebooked flight gave us separate seats and we were offered the option to change for â¬10. shoddy treatment all in all. flying from hannover germany via amsterdam to sydney australia and had booked a cityhopper flight to amsterdam a day prior to the intercontinental flight to spend a day in holland for business as well as personal. that flight kl1904 hajams got cancelled no early info no reason given and the way the klm staff incl. agent in hannover handled information assistance rebooking was terrible. unfriendly not knowledgeable uninterested  passengers were treated with a dont know cant do take it or leave it attitude. this is being continued at amsterdam airport where no interest or customer focus is shown ie. by lounge staff when after all i am a day late having missed all appointments in holland. klm is cheap and nasty. if nothing goes wrong quite acceptable but customer service leaves a lot to desire that includes their website and phone service. taipei to amsterdam. i am quite familiar with that flight and i already know the defects old air plane etc. but i chose it nonetheless because of the convenient schedule. on my last trip the impression is that the company was saving money on every aspect. the food was shameful. the main dinner dish was pieces of chicken in a brown sauce with some peanuts in it. the breakfast made even less sense  the main food was one square omelette with one bacon slice served with two pieces of cheese and one stale croissant. the inflight entertainment  control did not work and this meant no reading light throughout the whole trip no possibility to call the cabin attendants even to get a glass of water i had to jump over my neighbour. all this on top of the old airplane lack of privacy and an extremely uncomfortable sleeping position as the seat is not horizontal every time you turn then you have to climb up the seat again. the ticket cost 5000eur return i would not recommend it  a shame klm fell so low. kl808 7 jan 2015. kl807 25 dec 2014. i have been flying klm rather regularly now since i need to maintain my flying blue membership. sadly i still miss my miles and more days especially flying lufthansa. like lufthansa klm is indeed reliable. but it is bland  or blander if one doesnt think highly of lufthansa. my last flight with klm  long haul to mnl and back to ams was ok but the business class seats were the old ones. service was rather poor as the flight attendants designated to and fro tpe both failed to deliver on my request for a drink and when followed up would say that they can no longer serve any drink. the lounge in mnl is awful. and the stop in tpe wastes passengers time. tlvamstlv within 48 hours so was hoping for nice comfortable flights. both flights in economy comfort but seat as hard as all other seats. food lousy as always with klm. crew rude treating some passengers as cattle. klm not for me anymore that is sure now. booked flights with klm for our honeymoon 5 months in advance including reserving seats. when we came to check in we found our seats had been changed and we had been seated far apart on all 3 flights from cancun to leeds. we had not been contacted to tell us of this and so were stuck without any option and no time to alter the flight. spent hours on phone to their customer service team but completely unable to help. eventually had to pay additional fare on one of our flights to sit next to my wife on our honeymoon despite us previously booking seats next to each other. no apologies no suggestion that they would refund the additional fee paid. the outward bound flight from amsterdam to la was on a 747 that is in serious need of updating. uncomfortable rock solid and narrow seats with very little leg room. they ran out of one of the dinner options before they got to our seat no apologies or explanations just put in on our table and said here is your dinner didnt even say what it was. as it turns out it was bland and terrible. stewardess became quite stroppy when complained at lack of choice of meals and made it seam like she was performing heroic acts to try and get an alternative meal. inflight entertainment has much less choice than competitors and the technology is dated and slow with poor picture quality. thoroughly unimpressed throughout and would not use again. changes in service are sometimes unavoidable but poor manners and customer service is unacceptable. rio to ams in ecocomfort. klm asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. got seat 14a last seat in the economy comfort section which on klm is not cordoned off from ordinary eco section. i usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. this seat and i trust 14k as well suffers from a major design flaw. it misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. trying to fill the void with a pillow wont help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. moreover probably due to being in the last row in the ecocomfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the economy seat behind. my clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. the fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. he saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while i was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. as if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly klm unworthy. flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. food itself was very much inedible. the flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. all in all one of the worst experiences i have had with klm. an inferior seat compounded by a dismal service. we came home may 22nd 2015 flight kl 695. we paid extra to have two seats only side by side with more leg room we ended up with three seats and were very crowded. service was terrible put my light on for a coffee  4 hours later still no one wanted to see how long it would take to get service. food was awful the whole experience with klm was terrible i understand westjet will be starting flights soon from canada to amsterdam i strongly recommend you check them out. absolute chaos at checkin. many passengers connecting to china and all with a full trolley of baggage and more to check in. not all desks were staffed and the agent controlling access seemed to have lost heart and surrendered. it was a hot day and the aircraft was stuffed full of people so boarding was highly stressful. it was not great for anybody when stressed kids made their presence known. the cabin crew were of little assistance seemingly just wanting to get home. i too wanted to be off this very badly managed flight. in contrast my onward flight to aberdeen was tranquil. i guess its all down to klm management of pressure. reserved and paid extra for an economycomfort seat with extra leg space 3 months before the flight. 3 minutes before boarding i was called to the boarding desk and was told that my seat was double booked they put me in a cheaper economy seat and was told i should ask for a refund myself after landing. the boarding was chaotic and took a long time as it appeared more passengers had to change seats. the seat i was put in was the most cramped one on the plane. once aboard the plane i told the purser about the situation she refused to believe me and went out of her way to deny i even paid for an economycomfort seat. a nasty experience that ruined the positive holiday mood i was in. food was so so the classic choice between pasta and chickenrice. other cabin crew was friendly and helpful. toilets were kept tidy and clean. inflight entertainment somewhat outdated. paid for upgrade to business  it was somewhat disappointing. the new lie flat seats are great but service was under par. the welcome drink took a while to arrive wasnt offered coat service. my carry on didnt fit in bin upper deck small bins the flight attendent sent me to her colleagues in the back but they were too busy so i left the suitcase in the aisle and it took about 30 minutes for someone to take care of it  not a very friendly experience in general. no particular attention to passengers asking about drinks and serving wasnt good  food served with foil cover labeled remove before serving etc. i felt like i was in economy premium rather than business. what mattered was the lie flat and the ability to sleep but at this price even for a discounted upgrade its not worth it. used to be my favorite as far as we consider this airline as fairly cheap but delivering what you paid for. but unfortunately prices are now as expensive as the best middle east or asian airlines. food is awful no comment about the wines  the new seats are extremly unconfortable and seem to have been designed for short people. this airline policy is applicable for couples with no children. only one guest is allowed strict rule with no exception.  berlin to ams was painfree a short hop in premium economy. changing in ams on a weekday morning was okay too. cabin of the a330 is extremely outdated and tired i presume many airlines that fly to africa use their oldest clappedout planes. the seat was not very comfortable the screen for entertainment was tiny perhaps 10 cm across. other than more legroom there are no perks in premium economy. service was perfunctory which is what i am used from klm. what was really annoying was a medical emergency which led us to divert to luxor. as a doctor i offered my help but it appears the decision had already been made and we stopped in luxor for about 4 hours to offload a passenger. this went on for 2 hours then a further two hours wait to get permission to continue. at 1 am we were in dar es salaam stuck in an unknown city in the middle of the night with no assistance from klm whatsoever. return leg from business trip comfort economy again. this was a night flight which departed late. departure procedures in dar es salaam a complete shambles about 90 minute queueing to leave the country before that queuing outside the airport to enter then another queue to checkin you will need to be at the airport at least 2 hours in advance. no decicated queues for frequent flyers or comfort economy. once onboard the seats showed their age and lack of comfort on a night flight. inflight entertainment system is very old with ancient games tiny screens not easy to operate. choice of films is not too bad. the food was simply put inedible. hardly any drinks service on the night flight  or maybe i missed them as i was trying to sleep. sleeping is barely possible as the seats in comfort economy are still narrow even though the legroom is okay. the cabin is noisy. cabin crew impoite even rude at times  did not feel welcome. once in amsterdam we learnt that both our connecting flights to different airports in different countries had been cancelled. no help from ground staff whatsoever. we finally managed to change our bookings on the selfservice machines and were compensated with a paltry food voucher for 5 euro and 15 euro for a 3 hour and a 7 hour delay respectively. finally flight to berlin was late and chockablock full. after a sleepless night and five hour wait i had to sit with bits of hand luggage on my lap because only one piece of luggage was allowed in the overhead bins. i am not going to fly klm again if i can avoid it.  i had a pleasant stay onboard this klm flight. i flew economy comfort the extra legroom was really nice. the cabin crew wasnt very nice. they even were very rude to the passenger sitting next to me. the food onboard was a sandwich with scrambled eggs it was okay. the aircraft arrived exactly on time even though we had a 20 minutes delay at barcelona. klm provides a budget product at a full service price. you now have to pay additional for all hold baggage. pay for seat allocation  except the centre seat. no inflight entertainment on 3.15 hour flight. typical indifferent service. food and wine cheap and nasty. it would be helpful to include klm luggage allowance on the email flight overview they send you. it took half an hour at the desk as i was told my 29kg bag was overweight but if i split it in 2 bags i was hugely under my allowance of 2 x 23k. this is madness and there is nowhere in norwich airport to buy another bag which would have cost less than the 73 charge by klm. this is in conjunction with the klm review from d houghton canada on 2nd october. i was on that flight and in that line too. it was ridiculous and uncalled for. it was nearly 6 hours in line before we were scheduled from milan on united airlines. i asked hours earlier if they could schedule us on another airline and was told no it must be a klm flight. we were told we had seats on the milan flight and when we got there we were on standby. the woman who helped us at united in milan was kind and got us seats. in the 14 hours we were at florence airport we were given one voucher for a sandwich. after we got our booking for milan we had to find and pay our own way and find a hotel. florence airport only allows one hour of free wifi which we had used early that morning so we had to pay for that too. it was 1130pm by the time we got to our hotel in milan and cost about 500 euros. i wonder if klm really will reimburse us. when i booked this klm flight the plane which was due to operate this route for my travel day had the new business class seats. unfortunately klm changed the plane a few weeks before the flight i was booked on. i ended up with the old seats which seem to be at least 20 years old. they are very unconfortable in almost all positions and when you lay down you have the face of your neighbour from behind above yours. the service was lousy and one of the steewardess was very arrogant. food was below average for plane food and dessert was inedible. wine offering was also very poor. for my next flight in business i will chose air france which has a much better product even if both airlines belong to the same group. london to bangkok via amsterdam with klm.  my inflight entertainment system did not work for 7 hours of the flight  i was not the only customer with issues but staff were uninterested. i pressed the call button and it was not answered. were nowhere to be seen after the meal service and lights were left on for an excessive amount of time. they were off for only 3 hours of a night flight that lasted over 10 hours. we were told that landing cards for thailand would be handed out 6 hours into the flight. i stayed awake to make sure i received one and they were finally handed out 1 hour after the announcement was made. we were woken up to be given snacks in the middle of the night. it was already difficult enough to sleep. there were no eye masks to hide the bright lights. lights were turned on to full 2.5 hours before landing with no graduation to allow eyes to adjust. food trays were not taken away for over an hour which exacerbated the difficulty in sleeping. the food tasted good however special lactoovo vegetarian meal. we were delayed because of klm cargo that needed to get on the plane. this apparently needed to delay our arrival by almost half an hour gate to gate with no explanation why this had not happened earlier instead of at takeoff time. some staff seemed to speak poor english. the return day flight was rather pleasant with friendly thoughful staff and good food. flew to venice notionally with alitalia. by some trick of code sharing the flight out was air france and the return flight was klm. one piece of checked in baggage free on the outward flight. on the return flight there was no checkedin baggage allowance and i was forced to pay in order to get my baggage home. no advance warning about this either from expedia or klm. how can this shameless ripoff be allowed to happen. no more klm filghts for me we a family of 4 traveled with klm from dÃ¼sseldorf to bordeaux via amsterdam. all of the passengers that connected from dÃ¼sseldorf found klmair france had not put the dÃ¼sseldorf luggage on the bordeaux bound plane. the baggage claim customer service said knowingly that happens all the time. it took 8 hours for the luggage to be delivered to the airport in bordeaux. it then took klm 5 days to deliver the luggage to the place we were staying two hours away. i called begging for my luggage every day and even offered to come to the airport but they would not allow it. our vacation was a long one lasting a full 3 weeks. i got back to germany and sent paperwork to klm for 200â¬ of reimbursement for the clothes and toiletries we needed to buy in the 5 days that the luggage was not delivered. klm responded saying that they did not receive the claim within 21 days of the luggage being lost so they simply did not care and would not do anything for the horrible experience they put my family through. given the choice pay the extra 10 euro and fly with a better airline otherwise take the train. you may be happier walking instead of klm abu dhabi to amsterdam with klm and a third of the footwell is taken up with the entertainment box that does not work. by the time they got to my seat for the light snack and breakfast there was no choice  i mentioned i had not been given a choice the cabin staff said she would go check in the back. ten minutes later still no food so i approach the cabin staff only to be told she thought i was rude i then explain i have as much right to seat with full access a entertainment system that works and a meal choice at least one out of two. she changed her approach when i asked for a complaint form. chief purser appears to ask if everything is ok i have to go online to complain. been flying with klm for 18 years but the worst flight i have had. i left my ipad in the seat back and remembered immediately as i left security. went to klm check in clerk who was completely unhelpful. she asked for my flight info and instructed me to stand to the side. she made a phone call and told me to wait. no other info was provided. after an hour of standing in view of her i asked for an update. she picked up the phone made a call and said im sorry sir. your ipad is lost. theres nothing i can do. no other info was provided. it took 4 days of trying to contact klm to figure out i should have logged a missing item report with schiphol lost and found. when complaining to klm about their failure to inform me of this they just quoted their policy and indicated they did everything the policy requires. i am a platinum level customer. that just changed. so long klm learn to how to go above and beyond minimum requirements of your policy and you will keep customers.    amsterdam to abu dhabi. checked in online a day prior to departure and arrived more than 2 hours prior to departure as advised by klm. but queues at klm bags drop off were chaotic and a complete disaster. despite asking various klm staff for assistance we had to wait so long in queues that we arrived late at the gate. klm staff had more pleasure in telling us that they were going to take us off the passenger list and offload our bags from the aircraft. had to reschedule flight which cost of eur3000  klm doesnt care of course. they dont even want to investigate what happened. appalling service and total lack of taking responsibility.    rome to hong kong via amsterdam. overall a good company however food on board is really bad. klm is providing unhealthy snacks and little or no options for vegetarians only two meals available which were both meat based. on the way to hong kong i couldnt order a vegetarian meal and i was given just a cold cheese sandwich. seats are not really confortable compared to other airlines and temperature onboard is always a way too cold.   i was surprised when i saw klm flew from jakarta to kuala lumpur and decided to book a round trip ticket. the ticket prices were very reasonable even below garuda for that route. however the boarding process was slow and chaotic because the boarding lounge was too small. around 20 mins after take off the crew served small pie which was quite tasty and beverages. however after that they disappeared until landing. i had to walk to the pantry to ask for some water. i was shocked when i saw the fas just doing nothing in the back while a lot of passangers needed help in the front. the entertainment system was old but adequate for short flight.    good sandwich on the cdgams leg with friendly crew. the amsist leg which is 3h20 long was not agreeable. just a small sandwich and one serve of drinks for the whole flight. no ife whatsoever. klm needs to install on board entertainment on flights longer than 3h such as wifi or ife. overall disappointing flight.   stockholm to new york jfk via amsterdam. missed the flight to jfk from amsterdam because the klm connection was delayed due to weather. klm could not have been less helpful. declined to give us so much as a tooth brush. basically said they had no responsibility. fortunately wed used a travel agency that did rebook us but we had to pay for 1 night in a hotel without any luggage of course we will never fly klm again  a truly horrible experience. i flew from miami to doha via amsterdam in business class with klm. flight departs close to midnight. inflight service begins with flight attendant question of do you want to eat or not no menus no idea what is offered. service is grumpy and abrupt with no warmth or welcome. this continues on the next flight to doha and in fact on the return trip to miami. all beverages are onetime only  refills are begrudgingly provided on request. seats are most uncomfortable video is provided on a tiny grainy fuzzy screen and crew really does not care for or about the passenger. on the last leg amsmia business fills up inflight with family friends and coworkers who get the care and attention of the crew. i could tolerate this and have on their shorter intraeurope flights but these 4 flights were beyond bad. longhaul on klm never again.    geneva to amsterdam. klm is without a doubt one of the least friendly airlines i have flown and the customer service is appalling. the staff were rude and not understanding at all. when there was an issue on their side where they had not issued me a ticket and i sent a complaint in having to pay 75chf to change my flight they rudely responded that it was my fault that i did not possess the correct documentation to fly. this completely shocked me as it is impossible to carry documentation which has not been issued to you as our plane was delayed due to weather conditions many people were missing their transfer and tried to approach the cabin staff who cut them off and told them to see the person who would be waiting at the gate. this is not the way to treat clearly concerned customers flying home for the christmas season. if you have a choice avoid klm. the service is subpar the staff are unfriendly and should anything go wrong the customer support is not understanding at all.    belfast to manila via amsterdam. flight ok. i was travelling with 18 months daughter and during my journey as any other mother on her own with baby needed help with getting on board. i was struggling with buggy to bring with me and so ive asked staff for help. no staff helped me they all looked at me and not even smallest gesture in my direction. then some gentleman helped me carrying buggy in which i am very grateful. i thought it was one off maybe they really didnt hear me. but on my return to amsterdam few weeks later i needed a help again only to bring my buggy down to the bus. and again i asked staff if they could they help me out just to bring it down the stairs. response was they dont deal with this kind of requests and she walked away. bus driver heard that and stopped engine and came to help me out. again lovely gesture from stranger. i hope some mothers will have opportunity to read this and reflect on perhaps changing airlines to another.    singapore to denpasar bali. seats configured 3x4x3 for boeing 777 is crowded. service also not nice i asked for a coca cola but i think they almost run out so the crew asked me back why i dont know everyone asking for coca cola  i put my drone inside a hard shell case then put inside the rimowa metal luggage but still break the controller try to request for repair but after sent a email then no response. i wont fly klm any more.    stuttgart to lisbon via amsterdam. booked thi9s as klm they chose transavia. paid for klm transavia although a daughter of klm acknowledges absolutely nothing of klm. sardine seating plan. absolutely everything extra for a charge. no priority boarding which means the last 50 get to check in all hand luggage. beware of klm.    dusseldorf to kilimanjaro via amsterdam. klm never again. first flight in dÃ¼sseldorf delayed time for stopover in amsterdam 1 hour planned by klm missed connecting flight in amsterdam waiting time on transfer desks 2 hours waiting time in amsterdam 9 hours without getting any vouchers for drinks or food next flight with additional stopover in nairobi arriving kilmanjaro 12 hours delayed and missing our luggage this is our third and our last failing flight operated by klm without luggage and it is always klm. it seams there is a precious big chance of that happening when you book klm. we are travelling a lot and we had never problems with flights or airlines except klm. certainly klm is not responsible  because of weather etc.    mexico to amsterdam via paris. what a disappointment flying with klm. they have a policy now to not put family and couples next to each other automatically so you will be forced to pay extra per seat during check in. in addition our flight back was delayed which resulted in us missing our connecting flight and having to wait 6 more hours. to top it up just when the nightmare is over one luggage went missing and still missing at this time. very frustrating. no more klm for us ever again. book at your risk.    amsterdam to washington. i had no other choice but flying with klm. it doesnt seem to have other options from brussels on fridays. it was such a bad experience  the meal. despite a paid meal i didnt know what i was eating. the tv screen is so small or the way info are displayed that i needed the support of the person beside me to be able to use it. no question to ask the help of the cabin crew they are too busy to help. after the duty free service crew is very active to do it the crew disappeared you need to chase them if you need anything. they dont serve anything like water during the whle flight after services.\\r\\r\\n    terrible customer service i had a ticket from ibiza to amsterdam and a separate ticket from amsterdam to oslo the same night. without contacting me they sent me an email the same morning informing me that my ticket was rescheduled for the day after due to overbooking. they did not even ask if it was ok and just cancelled the ticket making me lose my flight from amsterdam to oslo. so i had to buy a new ticket from amsterdam to oslo. if you overbook please ask the customer before canceling a ticket. and please be respectful when you speak with your customers.    amsterdam to montreal. with 8 hours delay the klm staff were exceptionally unhelpful telling a customer that they cant make the airport more comfortable or the plane arrive on time but she can guarantee hell sleep on the flight and asked him to move so she can serve another customer just to tell them the same thing. nothing was offered for the delay except a tenner for food. and they announced the delay by 2 hour increments instead of allowing passengers to make other plans or even catch some sleep. i wouldnt recommend klm and wont be travelling with them again.    amsterdam to abu dhabi. i did not have a pleasant experience with klm . i booked a flight with etihad and didnt realise that one of the flights was with klm until day of departure which i didnt think was going to be a problem. first of all the seats were not comfortable compared to other airlines ive flown with. you cant pull the arm rest up to get it out of the way.  i requested a vegan meal which did not go through to them so i was left with no options on the flight for food  the flight attendant just offered me an apple when i brought it to their attention  this was a mistake of the airline. i accidentally left a jumper on the plane and contacted klm immediately. they were quite hard to get a hold of  i waited on the phone for ages before giving up and messaging them through facebook which they have finally responded slowly. in regards the the jumper they told me to contact abu dhabi airport and when i did abu dhabi told me it was the responsibility of the airline if i left it on their plane. klm said that if they found anything they would give it to the lost and found at the airport  abu dhabi found nothing so they obviously did not hand anything in to the lost and found.     flew klm from sao paulo to amsterdam. very poor service. seats are terrible as is the food. very little food as well i think there was less than 70 grams of protein in my fish dish. the placed some water and snacks in the galley but when it is all taken they arrogantly dont replace it so you need to ask. they seem more interested in chatting among themselves. really bad. the website is bad as well and they dont inform you adequately about how many points you will make and always offer the worst ones for this which only gives you 25. all in all bad. but punctuality is good and amsterdam as a transit airport is efficient and hassle free.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    flew klm from paris to aalborg via amsterdam. 3 out of 4 flights in a row were delayed. the captain explicitly promised that the connecting flights were notified and that everyone would make their flights. we ran all that we could and arrived at the gate after five minutes. the doors had closed two minutes prior and we were refused entry to the flight despite staff still visibly boarding. according to staff the captain had said one thing to passengers and reported another to staff. apparantly this happens several times every day. incredibly frustrating being lied to    flew amsterdam to belfast. both klmflights operated by an ageing cityjet avro rj85 to and from belfast city were delayed by 2hrs. both delays  on different tailnumbers  were caused because of technical problems which had to be signed ok to fly by calledin engineers. very unprofessional cabinservice far below klmstandards. no transfer assistance upon delayed arrival in ams consequently connecting flight was missed by a few minutes and overnight stay became necessary.    okay let us take the good things first even on the short trip from dÃ¼sseldorf to amsterdam you were served something free of charge even though it was just water and crackers. now to the bad thing. klm will let you choose a seat but if you want an emergency exit seat you have to pay extra. on almost all other airlines you an choose an emergency row seat when you are lucky enough to be one of the first to check in. but on klm no way. if you do not want to pay extra then you are stuck in the seats with less than 30 inch seat pitch. now i am 196 cm tall where most of my height is in the legs so a 30 inch seat pitch is just far too little. klm wont even let you move after the freight has started unless you pay. on most other airlines i have never complained about this because i had a chance to choose an emergency row seat but i am a really strong believer in the fact that i should not pay more to have the same kind of comfort as a person only being 170 cm. so dear klm drop this policy and maybe people will like you a little bit more.    calgary to amsterdam. the seat in business class are very uncomfortable. not fully lay flat and no privacy having another passenger near to me. every time he went to toilet i had to modify seat position and wake up in the night. very bad food service. my seat was number 2 and flying dutchman cocktail was already finished. the lady did not apologise for that. i skipped dinner because of the smell of cheese of alfredo pasta that permeate the cabin for a long time. i had breakfast. film selection is ridiculous  add few titles more. bus at the arrival instead of the finger. definitely not a business class service you expect.    cape town to amsterdam and back with klm. first time flying with klm. usually fly emirates but klm offered a direct flight. was very disappointed with the inflight service. first impressions were good but as the 11 hour long flight progressed service got worse. to get the attention of the flight attendant is impossible unless you walk to the back of the aircraft. the button to get attention means nothing as they either keep switching it off at the back or ignore it. the attendants were a bit rude when asking for more alcoholic beverages. food was average. inflight entertainment was okay. a few new movies. no structure to the series that they have. overall very average. wouldnt fly klm again.    barcelona to lima via amsterdam. the overall experience with klm was a nightmare. we arrived at the airport in barcelona and transavia was not able to print our boarding cards for the second flight amsterdam  lima. due to bad weather we had to sit for 90 minutes in the aircraft waiting to take off. due to the delay we had 15 minutes to make it to the second flight in amsterdam but since we had no boarding cards we had to rush in to the transfer desk. at that point the schiphol airport was already a completely chaos. queues everywhere. not info at all where should you start queueing and so on. we lost our flight and had to wait in line for 8 hours to get a rebooking. klm told us that the next flight the following day was full but we could fly via bogotÃ¡ to lima. we didnt want to do another connection but klm said that they would only cover the hotel for one night august in amsterdam not a lot of budget options to stay overnight. our agent in schiphol was extremely rude. i can understand that she had an awful day but waiting in line for 8 hours is neither fun. we ended up accepting the flight via bogotÃ¡ and headed to a hotel we booked klm hotels were all booked out but klm explained that they will cover the hotel expenses afterwards. the following day we took the flight and landed in lima without luggage. nobody knew where it was. when contacting klm they said that they were not responsible for our accommodation but transavia and that regarding our baggage we had to contact avianca the airline which brought us from bogotÃ¡. 64 hours later plus an overnight in amsterdam with our luggage locked at the airport we just received our bags. i can understand bad weather. i can understand chaos and delays. but i wont accept irresponsibility and bad manners. to me it seems as they just want to clean their hands as soon as possible even if you buy the tickets from them.    flew amsterdam to copenhagen. even though klm is said to be a premium airline service doesnt meet expectations. also regarding the sustainability of the airline you cant even get snacks without meat on their short flights. unfriendly staff. would not recommend flying with them.    johannesburg to amsterdam. i was on an 11 hour flight with a transfer to another 9 hour flight. the seats are tiny so much so that if anyone sits next to you that has any mass whatsoever they are laying on you and or in your seat. we make it to amsterdam where we have a layover and head to the klm lounge where my wife has a membership. im flying with her and at the lounge they advise us that no guests are allowed despite being married and a member of the lounge service. customer service wouldnt budge on this. im confused and letting everyone i know to avoid this provider at all possible.    klm has one flight a day from denpasar to singapore. on sep 1st due to a technical fault they delayed and then subsequently cancelled the flight the next day. my experience was horrendous. we were dropped at a dps hotel at 2am and told to be ready to fly tomorrow. that was the last i saw or heard from klm staff. for 2 days i was left without any information food vouchers or a rebooked flight. the hotel did their best to provide support but they werent even in contact with klm for most of the time. i received a letter 2 days later saying that the ground crew would assist they never did. it said they would contact me via phone or email with my rebooked flight they never did. it took 3 nights in a hotel before klm rebooked me onto a new flight even though there are 15 flights a day on that route. i still havent heard from anyone at klm and any attempts at speaking to someone who is responsible for the welfare of the passengers on that failed flight falls on deaf ears. i couldnt imagine an organisation demonstrating such arrogance and a lack of care but i have now seen it with klm. if they are cheap and you can afford to take the risk of being left in a hotel for 3 days with no help or information then go ahead and fly however after experiencing how klm deal with delays and cancellations you would be far safer to fly a low cost carrier especially on interasia routes.    glasgow to sofia via amsterdam. the flight left glasgow and arrived in amsterdam on time. then it went downhill. the next flight was 2 hours late. i had to ask the staff at the airport which were no great help and after 40mins didnt know when the plane was even landing as the screen had not been updated. eventually the plane arrived. klm was using bulgarian air. the seats on board were very tight together. i had paid for a little extra room but didnt get any the plane was dirty no toilet roll in the toilets and the passenger safety leaflet was stuck together with chewing gum. none of the cabin crew could speak english. all the emergency instructions on the plane were in english. the cabin crew did not instruct the passengers on how to open the doors over the wings in case of emergency. cabin crew didnt give instruction on life vest or oxygen mask proceedure. throughout flight the cockpit door was left open for long periods of time.  cabin crew tried to hide this fact by closing the curtain. in this day and age this is shocking. flight was so bad i booked a return trip from sofia to london on qatar with ba. the return from klm i threw in the bin. would i use klm again  dont know    hannover to jakarta via amsterdam and kuala lumpur. at first someone sat on my seat and had my seat number.  thank god there was a seat empty so that the other passenger could sit during the flight. my flight was delayed for almost an hour. and then another poor service from klm airport crew was that i had to put my hand luggage in the luggage compartment of the aircraft. i was told that i could pick it in amsterdam schipol airport. but it was so complicated and took three to four hours for me to get that. so i gave up and they said that it would be safely send with the other luggage the 23kg suitcase to my final destination. in jakarta after two hours waiting my hand luggage didnt show up. so i filed a report and after three days it was sent to the airport but in a very poor condition. the handle and lock are severely broken. today is the 21st day after my arrival and i have received only one email that asked me to give the luggage details which i replied as soon as i could. but until now not even a single mail or call have i received. klm should be able to handle baggage properly and not disappoint passenger like this. i have bought the ticket for round trip and hope this is my last flight with klm. i would definitely prefer to pay more for more comfort and baggage safety.    amsterdam to bangkok via paris. very disappointed. after the flight from amsterdam was delayed for 1h30m we took off to paris to transfer to the air france flight to bangkok i had to run my ass off to make it just in time for boarding. once in the plane there was a guy next to me taking up half my chair and half on the other side cos of his huge size. after 12 painful hours i arrived in bangkok. but my suitcase did not. it should have arrived today but now they say it will probably be tomorrow. my holiday is on a hold right now because everything i need is in my suitcase also this forces me to buy clothes and other things i need in daily life. there was no choice in meals. in flight entertainment seemed like it came from the stoneage. and poor service on board.    manchester to antananarivo via amsterdam. my new husband lost his passport 2 days before our wedding 5 days before flying to madagascar. after a\\xa0 passport office appointment they said it would likely be done by montues when we were meant to be flying monday. on monday we were home waiting for the post hoping the passport would arrive before our evening flight that we booked with lastminute.com spoiler alert it didnt. first thing we rang lastminute.com\\xa0 to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didnt arrive after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring klm . so we rang klm and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldnt be a problem to change and they would email the details through so we waited a while. then rang klm again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again then they of course didnt. then rang klm again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and klm and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction. now we treated ourselves with an expensive holiday for our once in a lifetime honeymoon but we are by no means able to just throw money away and as noone would help after 6 solid hours of ringing people we drove to manchester airport to see if anyone on a desk there would help. turns out as i stand there making a fool out of myself sobbing my eyes out at the klm desk they wont help us either and told us to ring the klm number. so i had to make a decision as we were unable to see if our flights could be changed to another day for a reasonable cost and in a panic of not being able to afford new flights for both of us i checked in myself and left him behind to sort this mess in the end he just had to buy completely new flights which also meant he couldnt fly back with me. i appreciate this whole mess was caused by a stupid mistake of my husbands but seriously how hard is it to talk to someone about a change of flight . and even if it isnt something you can help with how hard is it to not lie and say you will help but then dont or even how hard is it to treat people with a little empathy and kindness. every single person i have had to deal with from klm from the phone helpdesk check in desk and flight attendants were rude and looked like the last thing they wanted to do was do their job properly. and on the way back our bags were lost and every person dealing with that was equally unhelpful and rude.    flew amsterdam to abu dhabi with klm. seat quite narrow certainly with passenger of size sitting next to me. seat very uncomfortable after a few hours lack of support. metal entertainment box under seat in front of me takes away 15 of leg space. entertainment system stems from 20th century and is completely outdated. didnt work for the first hour of the flight resolution worse than a 10 year old phone. no response from flight attendant to service call. food quality poor bland and boring. i am a proud dutchman but why would you still fly klm when you get a better service for a lower price at asian and me airlines. on the bright side pilots are well trained and did a super smooth landing.    singapore to munich via amsterdam. i am really disappointed about yesterdays behaviour of klm. i was supposed to fly out from singapore at 130 on december 1st. on november 30st around 7pm so just a few hours before the flight i checked my email i was lucky because i checked them already a few hours before and didnt see any klm email and saw a mail by klm saying that my flight has been cancelled and that i have been booked on a flight at 1.35pm on december 1st so what is this even legal my husband booked on the same flight called klm and because we had to be home within noon on december 1st they booked us on a emirates flight via dubai on 9pm on november 30st. we almost didnt make it to the check in couldnt get seats next to each other anymore. so how is this working they just send a mail hoping people are just accepting the change how about plans unbooked hotels etc  if i hadnt checked my mails where we supposed to sleep on the airport how about plans when getting home this is completely unprofessional and unacceptable    warsaw to accra via amsterdam. the plane from warsaw was late so i had to hurry up to catch my flight to ghana in amsterdam. very short time for transfer. during boarding to accra i told the staff that its very important to fly with my luggage and asked them to reassure its packed to the plane. they replied me they would do it for me. i boarded the plane with trusting them. they delayed my luggage 4 bags 23 kg each. i did not know when i would get it back so had to book the hotel in accra instead of going by the car directly to kumasi after landing. i went to ghana during my time off from work. delaying my luggage ruined my trip the third day i had to buy some aids to be able to start my work with kids. meantime i had to struggle with organizing picking my luggage up from the airport as i was in kumasi when it finally arrived. they did not organized delivery to kumasi. i involve few people to help me with my challenge. they called the airport every few hours they were looking for somebody we can trust to pick my luggage up. i paid for the man who came at the airport to do that instead of me he passed the bags to the bus to kumasi i also paid for the taxi to the place i stayed near kumasi. etc. i had to buy items like clothes shoes cosmetics drops etc. i had to buy to use as i landed just in pair of jeans trainers and jacket. i did not know when my luggage would be with me. i wrote a letter of complaint to klm. attached about 10 invoices for the items i had to buy. klm replied me after one week. they decide to pay me only 100 eur compensation. for delaying 4 bags i had to organize by myself picking the bags up and delivery to different city and paid a lot for that. i did not agree with their decision. but they are not going to change their mind. its very sad and unfair how they treated me in a very challenging situation. no empathy. no sense of responsibility. i learnt the lesson. never again with klm   birmingham to tallin via amsterdam. the first leg of the trip from birmingham to amsterdam which was on klms own plane was fine. however the second leg of the journey from amsterdam to tallinn which was on airbaltic and was dreadful. staff were miserable. on the two hour flight from amsterdam to tallinn they did not even offer a glass of water free of charge. on the 55 minute flight from birmingham to amsterdam we were well looked after. the airbaltic aircraft was old noisy and cold too. next time i will find another route to tallinn just to avoid airbaltic. no complaint about the service on klms own planes. the problem was with airbaltic that klm use for their passengers from amsterdam to tallinn.    houston to brussels via amsterdam. if things go wrong you face an upward battle against limited options flights limited resources costumer services customer assistance. i paid 1700 euro for a comfort seat and they left me stranded in amsterdam. no duty of care to be sure that i reach my final destination from the klm side. out the door the eu legal requirements.  the plane out of houston has an issue klm needs to get it fixed. paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure. staff at the gate scare people away which see the issues coming because of their prior experiences. before we fly they have to get some drunken passengers of the plane including the one sitting next to me. not even a sorry sir. service degree as in nineties ac dripping cold all night no new water bottle  i will fill it up for you sir really in comfort. inflight entertainment system bad no subtitle breaks down and restarts issues etc. we get to amsterdam. the whole 747 with connecting issues floods the service desk. they get annoyed by the passengers frustration this situation ends up being hostile at the desk. the staff is well aware that due to end of holiday week klm basically has no options  to offer passengers. air france is full klm flights are full speed train are full see later train desk told me. they give me a regular train ticket. while waiting the same women as at the gate reiterates her problem of meeting her connection to the river cruise in basel. i suggest to call lufthansa desk immediately as the only option to meet her deadline. the service women all get hostile towards me. while the train ticket system breaksdown again i notice the klm assistance going in the lufthansa option eventually. i get a train ticket no date no hour only a destination. the service assistant write down the departure time of the train by hand. insists seat is numbered and i need to make it on time. i file a claim for my luggage and hope to meet my train. no train that fits departure time on screen. queue to the train desk  no this is a train ticket but one for any train. no sir thalys is full  to brussels. no regular train service only this weekend works on the line. i find the service desk in terminal 2 have the 24 h desk of the travel agency speak to the klm rep. travel agency insist klm book me on the 8pm flight in business klm refuses on grounds that there is awaiting list of economy passengers. with no drivers license im with one option left  4 hours  trip of 4 trains replacement bus service and taxi to brussels airport. so instead of the 10 hours klm i arrive 21 hours at the airport not thanks to klm though.    amsterdam to nairobi. took my carry on bag promising a dozen times that the bag would be waiting for me at the door of the airplane when i arrived in nairobi. i told them several times that my bag would be stolen or lost and please do not take it that i was allowed my carry on. but they refused to let me on without it. got to nairobi the man outside the door of the plane yelled at me when i asked very politely for my bag. i explained i was told it would be at the door. i was yelled at again and told to pick it up with the rest of my bags. three hours of waiting for that bag and of course no bag. we had to delay our trip to go to back to the airport the next day to search for it again. when it was retrieved of course things were missing from my bag. never will fly this airline again.    im studying abroad in holland and won a scholarship from school which paid for my round trip from lax to ams and back. i left in early august and now sitting at the airport waiting to go back to lax now december 18. come to my surprise that klm has cancelled my flight because they listed me as a noshow on my flight from lax to ams. my question is the how do you think i got here anyhow i arrived 3 hours early and i still did not make my plan flight and now klm has to buy me another ticket out. the worst part is the service. im not one to complain and make a scene. i know mistakes happen but a smile goes a long way especially for a customer whos patient. but anyways klm did purchase me a new flight and thats it. i got nothing else from it. so basically never again with klm or delta because apparently they cant keep track of the passengers or give decent service.    kuwait to toronto return via amsterdam. in july 2017 i found a good deal with klm and went for it.  i was not able to check online and get my free preferred aisle seat. my luggage was not delivered in toronto. i received it 24hrs later with items broken. amsterdam to toronto flight entertainment system was broken in the whole plane. every time i called the call center i was on hold for approximately 1 hour. when i emailed them with my complaint about check in i received a reply after 3 weeks stating  please ask one of our agent at the check in counter to help you. today is my flight from toronto back to kuwait and i was not able to check in online again receiving this message unfortunately you can not check in with this booking. please check in at the airport desk.  called the customer service and after 1 hour hold this was their answer sorry we dont know why this is happening please check in at the airport.    amsterdam to san francisco. its my worst flying experience so far. we were travelling with my 1 year old daughter. the staff was extremely rude. they were never ready to go out of their way to help. when one of their air hostess was roaming around with a tray with juice on asking which juice it was she replied  i have only 2 hands and i am carrying the tray. this was  rude and uncalled for. the food was substandard and i paid for their wifi but the wifi just did not work and i lost my money. when my baby was playing with toys and making a bit of noise  the air hostess was making faces at the baby. they did not even have good baby food. i am extremely disappointed with my experience and would never fly klm again.    london to dresden via amsterdam. bad horrible experience with rude unprofessional staff. i flew yesterday with my 2 little children. first the plane was delayed over an hour and 15 mins from london  the next plane from amsterdam to dresden i had 20 mins to run with my little ones in such a big airport. no one helped and the staff very rude and we didnt get any assistance. really upset about it. we arrived to out final destination the bags didnt arrive. waiting then i asked been told they will be delivered the next day evening. 3 bags lost calling every 10 mins the airline seems to talk to the wall they dont know any thing. still waiting until now didnt get my bags.     amsterdam to bergen. klm lost our bags at amsterdam and have failed to return them us. the bags got into the airport 20 minutes from our hotel last night and 24 hours later still have not arrived at our hotel. we have been calling klm every 10 minutes since 8am this morning and every time we get a new person and they tell us theres nothing they can do. we leave on a 12day cruise in an hour with only the clothes on our backs. every time we call klm they just tell us to go out and buy more clothes. no sympathy or apologies. and its not that simple. we have suitcases full of expensive snow gear for our winter getaway. we cant replace it easily. and by now the shops are shut where we are and we cant even get more underwear. every person at klm has been rude unprofessional and unhelpful. i would never fly with this company again. outrageous service. on top of that ethihadklm lost our gluten free order for food and we went for 27 hours without food on our flights from melbourne. i dont know who is running these airlines but they have not got it together.   terrible service. long haul flight from london to taipei was cancelled the day before. klm made no attempt to notify me or transfer me to another flight. no refund was given as they claimed that it was not their fault. was forced to book a different flight to taipei out of my own pocket because klm did not offer an alternative flight.    kilimanjaro to birmingham via amsterdam. it is a nightmare to contact and speak to a human being with klm  almost impossible. i lost my baggage since a month. they sent me back an email to contact back klm but nobody picks up the phone for many minutes often it goes dead. they have all glossy social media on the website but you only receive standard replies  nothing useful no one cares. uk customer care do not care for anyone calling as they do not pickup the phone  simple. next time you book the flights just dial the number and experience yourself. use those airline who will care for you in case of any uncertainty. klm is not one of them as per my experience. i am a regular traveler and experiencing the poorest response from a giant airline on lost baggage. very poor customer care.     new york to geneva via amsterdam. worst flight ever. we booked seats in advance for more space at exit. klm agent did not mention my seat was in front of exit. therefore no gain. the food on klm is the worst i had. headphones given could not deliver stereo.  a passenger vomited. he tried to reach the toilets but couldnt make it. however we tried to reach attendant during 10 minutes until he realized we were searching for them. and another 7 minutes to decide how to clean unbelievable.     dammam to amsterdam. watch out if you pay for an upgrade and are unlucky enough to either get downgraded or have a cancelled flights. you may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on klms app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 euros to 500 euros. a word of warning if you do. 1 if you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 euros to 500 euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled klm will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. you have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end you will be told the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight. but when i logged on to klms website or app i notice that the upgraded seats are still available. only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. if like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. because and i quote a customer services rep on the phone it is klms policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class. klm has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around 100 more for the same flight the next day. and now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. all in all klm are  not customer focused and are only focused on your money making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. whilst flying out of dammam we have had our flight delayed above flight due to fog we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information hotel transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. it took klm 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport and still we were not given any information. we were told by the klm business lounge rep  i will cancel your exit stamp and you can go and sort yourself out until the next flight. and with that we were escorted through passport control which took 2 hours and dumped back in the departures area of the airport landslide.     los angeles to amsterdam on boeing 747400. entertainment is a joke no good collection no touch screen and they provide a dollar store ear plug and not head phone. the staff are so resistant about serving you an extra drink if you ask one. during boarding the plane one  person said i have redo checkin as the machine seems to be not recognizing my boarding pass when i went to get it redone the other person after standing in line again said its already checked in. the overhead had no space for my luggage.   i travel a lot with work and this was my first time with klm flying from milan to billund via amsterdam. never have i experienced such a bad airline. not on time unprofessional staff and just poor in general. the plane was dirty and old. they were 55 minutes delayed on my flight with no explanation and no help to make my connection flight.    los angeles to amsterdam. jan 18 2018. i am sitting on my seat in flight kl0602 departing for ams from lax and i dont need a minute longer to wait to give a review based on my experience so far. i literally had to yell at two people who were forcefully trying to fit their bags over my laptop in the overhead compartment. after the third person attempting the same thing i had to pull my laptop out. this is ridiculous the staff are not even paying attention.   the worst airline i have ever flown with they might seem value for money but i would rather pay more as the service i received was appalling. first of all was advised there were no seats for me when i was boarding so had to go back and sit down and wait for another flight which was very inconvient to me then i was brought last onto the plane because someone didnt show. we werent even put on a klm flight it was city jet and was tiny you just about fitted on the seat thats how uncomfortable it was. in comparison to it easyjet seats etc are huge then i had to climb over people to get to my seat. there was no room for my bag had to have it on my knee. when i attracted the attention of the flight attendant and asked him to put my bag somewhere he said that i was supposed to tell them if i had a bag. they knew i had a bag because i carried it on the flight. they also walked passed me numerous times and saw it on my knee. appalling customer service on top of everything else that happened. my feet are now on my bag the heat is atrocious and the room is ridiculous. ive flown with other airlines and never again would i fly with klm.    i purchased 4 tickets online. we were due to fly from lhr to ams by klm on 18th january but due to unfavourable wind conditions as notified by klm that flight was cancelled and we were subsequently rebooked by klm on ba. however when we checked in at lhr t5 we were informed that we had no allowance for checked in baggage despite having purchased such allowance for 2 pieces at the time of purchase of our tickets. as a consequence i had to repurchase baggage allowance. i subsequently emailed both klm and the travel agency through which i purchased our tickets to have my baggage allowance refunded. however despite my persistence and an exchange of emails i have been told by klm to claim my refund from the travel agency whilst that travel agency told me to claim from klm it is obvious that either one is lying i am very disappointed to say the least. i have been fobbed off by both klm and the travel agency both of which deny their responsibility to a paying customer. i expected much better from klm a supposedly reputable premier airline. but klm is unethical and unprofessional ignoring my latest email.     we booked klm flights together from malaga to panama via amsterdam. we paid 1487.76 euros for the two tickets. unfortunately i could not get back to malaga in time to check in so decided to go straight to amsterdam and meet my partner there to catch the next leg of the flight. my partner  checked in at malaga as planned and informed the representative at the check in counter that i couldnt get back to malaga so was going to meet her in amsterdam. my partner asked if the rep could arrange for our seats to be together for the amsterdam to panama flight. the rep advised it was best to both check in again together at amsterdam. once at amsterdam check in desk the representative advised there is a problem and they need to go to the ticket desk. the ticket desk assistant tells me i will have to pay a 500 euro penalty for missing the first flight. even though i felt like he was being held to ransom i had little choice but to pay the 500 euro penalty if i wanted to continue on the holiday. it took the ticket desk assistant at amsterdam 10 minutes to carry out some admin and issue a new ticket. how can klm justify 500 euros for this it wasnt like we just no showed. my partner checked in as scheduled and informed klm at the check in desk at malaga the situation. why was nothing about penalties mentioned then so disappointed at klms computer says no attitude and their failure to see the customers point of view. companies that hide behind ts & cs can not be trusted in my opinion. its easy to be smiley and helpful when things are running to plan it takes a real customer focused company to actually look into customers problems and come up with win win solutions. if youre flying klm make sure you read the terms and conditions and dont expect any help if things go wrong.   flew amsterdam to atlanta. i upgraded to business class at check in for a reduced price but to be honest i wish i hadnt bothered. klms business class product is inferior to that of other airlines ive flown with e.g. ba emirates malaysia qatar singapore and worse than it used to be. the amenity kit was terrible and nothing more than you get with some airlines in economy socks eye mask toothbrush tiny toothpaste. the food was no better than most economy food ive had. some flight attendants werent as friendly as they should be in business class didnt smile much and didnt act like they were happy to serve you. it wasnt a personalised service as it is on emirates and qatar. tip save your money and upgrade with another airline instead.   london to abu dhabi via amsterdam. klm provides the worst service i have ever experienced in my life. it started at london city airport where there was only one person dealing with checkinbag dropoff. despite the fact i came much earlier i did not manage to drop off my luggage on time. when i asked someone from the staff about my concern i was ensured there was still enough time. when i landed in abu dhabi 20 hours later long transfer it turned out my luggage was lost. when i talked to the airline it was told it was not loaded in amsterdam. 2 days later i found out it was not loaded in london. it took them 4 day to get my luggage to be delivered. another problem with the airline was service on the plane. no food choice. when asked for a drink i was told the bar was closed while someone behind me was served by another person.    prague to moscow svo via amsterdam. buy klm  get transavia for free. for my trip from prague to moscow march 14th i had to make a quick stop in amsterdam and therefore booked kl1356kl3178 flights. however before the flight i got informed that amsterdam lag will be operated by transavia. as a consequence no comfortable seats available. such a change makes a big difference given ridiculously small seat pitch at transavia. if you value a basic level of comfort you would avoid transavia. unfortunately i was given no choice. during my online checkin at klm websites i was also invited to choose seat for free. just to learn such a choice is in fact not available for me given moscow lag is operated by aeroflot. puzzled i asked why it cannot be done given both klm and aeroflot are members of skyteam alliance. i learned that this is due to the fact that the respective systems are not interconnected as yet and choose your seat therefore no option. expression as yet sounds real pathetic given klm is member of skyteam for already 14 years and aeroflot for 12 years. management of sky alliance must be real preoccupied by other issues if there was no time to implement such a simple feature like seat selection. in a summary my klm flight was no klm flight. and as a skyteam eliteplus customer i was not given a chance to choose my seat.     amsterdam to luxembourg. they forced me to stow my small bag under the seat just because half of the passengers travel with max cabin size luggage. so because i travel light i am forced impolitely to be kicking my bag. brilliant logic. the plastic yogurt like cups with water makes you feel like drinking from garbage. seriously unpleasant experience.    birmingham to entebbe via amsterdam. worst service on check in and aftersales i have ever received from any airline. i took an upgrade to business class advertised on the website as allowing cabin baggage of 18kg and check in of 32kg per bag for 2 pieces. my bags were 27kg each but they declined to take them. also they declined to reverse the upgrade. i dropped off valuable excess luggage to fit in 23kg allowance for economy class and travelled economy but after sales service still refused to refund my upgrade. on the flight i received no business class service as cabin crew told me it was not prebooked for me. very disappointed i will never use or recommend their airline to anyone again.    i had an international flight from tehran to los angeles via amsterdam but my second flight canceled. they sent us to boston for 11 hours stop there and then on united airlines to la. i had to carry all my luggage in airport there was no connection flight to carry my luggage. it was awful hospitality during the flight to los angeles because we have to send with better flight because our flight was international. long and so low class flight with poor condition in airplane. no working the tv front of the chair and so old. i asked for another blanket they didnt have extra.    calgary to bangalore via amsterdam. the seat has a broken head support and when i mentioned that there was no help provided. i had to travel a long flight of approx 9 hours without proper head support. staff are not friendly at all they wont respond well.  i would never prefer this flight until this is my last option. air canada is  good with friendly staff and the give the best service in terms of seating and comfort and provide fine food.    klm is the worst airline i have ever had opportunity to fly with. horrible service from the beginning to the very end. they lost my sons luggage twice. when missed connecting flight on my way back was forced to pay for a new ticket. i was told that if i decide to fly with another airline some of them were 3 times cheaper i would have to pay 200 euro to get my luggage back for the luggage that was lost anyway. service on the plane was below any standard. lady who was serving us obviously had a bad day and she was extremely rude. she was shouting at people. not enough food so never got what i wanted to. when asked for a drink i was told the bar was closed while someone behind me was served by other person.   flew klm from amsterdam to nice. just shocking how rude and unhelpful the airline staff are at the airport. no such thing as customer service. several times now i have been overly disappointed in the service by this arline and their staff.    madrid to amsterdam. medical equipment that is essential for me was refused to be allowed as carry on. i showed doctor letters explaining the necessity of the equipment. they threatened to not let me on the plane unless i agreed to let them put it in the hold with other luggage. eventually this was my only option with compliance and management contact being refused. this is especially disappointing of an allegedly high class airline.     tokyo narita to sochi russia via moscow sheremetyevo. checkin staff in tokyo was pleasant and helpful. the  a330 from tokyo to moscow had an average interior seatback entertainment was average. onboard food was terrible i wish id taken more snacks with me before boarding. flight attendants seemed pleasant. lavatory was dirty. upon arrival at moscow sheremetyevo i was completing the international to domestic transfer process when an aeroflot staff walked up to me grabbed my boarding pass with baggage tags attached and ripped them up. i was told that because i was traveling with a musical instrument violin i could not board the next flight with anything else other than the violin i also had a computer camera and ipad in a personal bag. they threatened to cancel my onward journey if i didnt pay 7500 rubles to check my empty personal bag.  why wasnt this rule enforced at checkin i would have dealt with it then without the threats and disrespect from employees in moscow. it was by far the worst experience ive ever had in over 15 years of traveling frequently for work.    horrible service and behavior of ground staff. i was returning from helsinki to new delhi via moscow. i was supposed to get two boarding passes from helsinki airport which they were unable to provide as according to them the flights from moscow to india was overbooked and they could not provide the boarding pass. as the layover time at moscow was only for 2 hours i was a little bothered. but with no option left i reached moscow and ran to the ground staff for the next boarding pass which they said i would not get as the flight is overbooked. so they were providing me a flight which was in the evening or the next day. i had connecting flight scheduled from delhi to bangalore but they said nothing can be done. after a lot of arguments finally they allowed me to board the flight i started waiting in front of the gate assigned for boarding. boarding time as mentioned in the boarding pass started but there was no staff from the aeroflot at the desk. suddenly one of the fellow passenger came to our rescue saying she heard someone say there has been a gate change. at the gate only 78 people were waiting to board the flight. so it was like do panic again and run for information here and there and finally find out the proper gate from where the real boarding was happening and majority of the passengers were standing. after getting into flight i realized it was without any inflight entertainment and the journey was for 7 hours. regarding the toilets 2 of them were spared for the economy class people and rest were for business class.  the worst trip i had in my life. our plane was not in order after 3 hour waiting within the plane without electricity acon and water we were told to leave the aircraft. our flight su 2461 from paris to moscow has been cancelled. it was night time and cdg airport had been closed. two hours later we were back to the departure hall through customs receiving baggage back etc. it was 2.30am. they gave us a hotel until 8am. we were told that aeroflot would send another plane the next morning to pick up all passengers. but as usual it was too expensive for aeroflot. instead of another plane they started to checkin passengers on free seats for other aeroflot flights. it was 7 hours of chaos. no one from aeroflot was there no order no food no water. at the end we were checked in with 13hr delay but our baggage was left in cdg. we received it end of next day only. no simple sorry from aeroflot no compensation etc. will never use this airline in the future. the servers were very professional and efficient and the planes were good. our flight out of st. petersburg was a disaster due to the lack of communication and inattentive flight representatives. we were booked on a 6.30 am flight to moscow and were finally rebooked for a 2.40 pm flight. we were at the airport at 4 am and the plane left at 3 pm  thats 11 hrs in the airport. we missed our connection from moscow to ny finally arriving in orlando with no luggage. it was a nightmare. we traveled with them over this past summer and had a day delay and then when we finally got to moscow the connecting flight was difficult to find. they changed the gate at the last minute and didnt make an announcement. we unfortunately missed our flight because of this and they werent sympathetic at all. mind you we had a toddler with us and i was 7 months pregnant. it was awful. we had to pay for a new flight and didnt give us many options. i will not be flying with them again. su2584 su262 and su271. out april 4th back april 17th. preferably i would never use aeroflot again  expensive queues at every stage slow miserable long faced staff videos on board out of date food poor. rixsvopvg and back. from rix to svo it was a partner flight with air baltic. then came the horror of svopvg. i had no option to choose seats. i was asked in rix while checking in for seat preference and i said aisle. i did get one for rixsvo and for svopvg i got a 28th row which on their a330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. the seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. the food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. the bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. the dessert was surprisingly good though i had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. and now for the best part the service. apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop  bad cop principle as in both aisles weve seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. the bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. so imagine my surprise when on the return flight from shanghai to moscow i was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff still not smiling got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 343 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. the short flight svorix was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. to sum it all id say its a real hit and miss thing with aeroflot. stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 theyre great. if youre unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. the food probably depends on where they get it. the entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies tv shows and music. do not expect a good polite service on every flight. other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced. tlvsvo and svorix. tlvsvo was on a new a330. as is typical of the former ussr the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. no attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. inflight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from delta and similar airlines. despite tlvsvo being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. could not figure this out. svo was pleasant enough and svorix was an easy shorthop on a new 737. no service and no complaints. would take aeroflot again only if the price was significantly less than other european carriers. i fly from bangkok to copenhagen transit at moscow then same route on my way back. on my way back to thailand which is just 2 days ago on su270 i was not impressed with the cabin crew at all. their service was not helpful. while they were serving dinner i asked for something to drink the crew member just said one minute. at that time i thought that they were busy serving food so i waited i ended up having to eat my whole meal without any drink i myself would not fly with this airline again. me my wife and our daughter were flying swedenkievbangkok with aeroflot. i have really nothing positive to say except the low price. of course we understood that we would not get much because of that low price. however we did not see the crew at all during all the flights only when the food was ready which was at really strange times we and many others on the plane were very hungry. we were served lunch and dinner on the first flight then breakfast on the second. the food was horrible. the food we got for lunch and breakfast was exactly the same and we did not had anything to choose from. the tvscreens at all seats were not working but that was not a big deal for us. we will never fly with aeroflot again. flight from mad to shanghai with transfer in moscow. good airline in general terms. meals as other alternatives but no alcohol served. seats and leg room are ok. they offer space  seats located in the emergency exists and prices are reasonable. cabin crew no friendly enough from my point of view if i compare with other airlines to flight to china like ba finnair or af. the main difference is that they provide slippers and eye masks no offered by other airlines. cabin and toilets are clean enough. moscow airport is awful and really boring. distances between terminals and gates are too much long. flights arrived on time. entertainment system only in english and russian. music selection is ok. flight from amsterdam to tokyo narita via svo and back. first flight from ams to svo on codeshare flight with klm on b738. flight was ok. transit on svo from terminal e to d was a breeze. there were no lines at immigration or security check. as we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal d and e on airside 63 euros for 4 hours. flight from svo to nrt was on an a333. nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete ife. we had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. crew was attentive and quitte friendy. with one hour delay we arrived at nrt. the flight from nrt back to svo gave us however some mixed emotions. on an a333 but with a crew that wasnt as friendly as the flight to nrt. we got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. transit from terminal d to e on svo was a mess. at immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. flight from svo to ams on an a320 was better than the flight from nrt. aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. toilet was also in a poor state. the crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. in the end aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. if you dont have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is ok. at svo you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights. if we would fly again with this airline really depends on the price of the flights they offer. flew shanghai to paris via moscow. what a nightmare aircraft ancient still had ashtrays in the arm rests torn and dirty seat covers toilet unspeakable by midway through the flight and the stopover in moscow is always stressful. why do they make everyone disembark with all their hand luggage check the luggage through security when it hasnt been anywhere but on the aircraft since the previous security check and then make everyone get right back on the very same plane if you are seated at the back of the aircraft then you spend your whole lay over at moscow airport standing in a queue to get through security. the food was almost inedible and my chinese travelling companions played cards on the backs of the airline seats throughout most of the flight and all stood up to get their bags out of the overhead lockers when the pilot announced that we would be landing in three minutes the cabin crew went almost apoplectic. budsvephuket and back. short leg budsve a320200 seats are alright recaro seats meal was terrible. crew was ok. long leg svephuket 777300 kutuzov poor seats no leg room very unfriendly crew both way the worst meals ive ever had. however this was the cheapest and fastest flight to phuket from bud. bangkok to moscow 9 january 2015 flight 273. awful customer service experience. the aeroflot customer service team promised that they had found extra leg space seats as requested for my wife dislocated her knee. when on board we found that they were not only normal economy seats but in fact were exactly the same ones that we had reserved previously before her leg break. so not only was service unacceptable but also the staff seem to have  deliberately deceived us at the customer service and check in desks. i assume to move us on without having to do anything else. so they let the company down and of course passed the problem on to the flight attendants who also did nothing much to help. very poor indeed. 11th april su0260 moscowtokyo. 21st april su261 tokyomoscow. flew on a airbus a330 from tokyo to amsterdam through moscow. first time aeroflot but never again. a list of disappointments all announcements were in 3 languages russian english and japanese even the sales and priority rewards announcements. during the 9 hour flight we only got a cold drink once even during dinner we didnt get anything to drink other than coffee or tea afterwards. this was a day flight and i didnt sleep so i didnt miss anything im sure. 1.5 hour delay which is perfectly acceptable for me but dont let us board and tell us every 5 minutes that the delay will be an extra 5 minutes and in 3 languages again. the sign fasten seatbelts was lit for 34 of the flight but i didnt feel any turbulence at all seemed like the stewards didnt want people to stretch their legs. very outdated multimedia system no subtitles available. stewards refuse to speak english and explains everything in russian constantly. flew from dussvobkk. i am at a loss of words for the unfriendly staff. we had the feeling that they were annoyed about our presence in the plane. i have never experienced such unfriendly staff in my life. in addition 4 hours late without even explaining the delay. the inflightentertainment system itself was not bad. i would say slightly below average but still okay. the problem were the headphones. the headphones were so bad that you could not understand a word. so we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. at least no movie with sound. food was standard. neither good nor bad. i would not complain if the price would have been low. but it was pretty much the same as other airlines like emirates or etihad. 110 will never fly with aeroflot again. delhi to helsinki via moscow.the flight took off 3 hours late from delhi and no reason given with the result i missed my connecting flight moscow to helsinki. the staff of aeroflot in moscow were not helpful and just gave a boarding pass for a flight departing at 6.40 in the evening and reaching helsinki by 9.00 pm.  it was 11.00 pm by the time i reached lahti and a large taxi fare because of the delay. their customer redressal is poor. geneva to tokyo via moscow with aeroflot. my flight from geneva to moscow was 1.5 hours late when i had 1.5 hours transit in moscow meaning i landed when my connecting flight was about to take off. i knew about the very short transit therefore consulted the cabin attendant when i found out that the flight was delayed. to which i was told the connecting flight would wait for me and i would be guided to business class just before landing so that i could get off the flight early in which case the transit would be smooth and there will be ground staff assisting me the transit. all points was a total lie they could have and i do have experience with other flights that the departure time is delayed by 30 minutes or so for connecting passengers however no such arrangement was made. neither did they allow me to go to the front of the plane. rather i was moved twice to the rear end of the plane due to families wanting to sit together. on top of this none of the ground crew were there to help me at all. because of this i was forced into staying 24 hours in moscow in a hotel arranged by aeroflot. but this is the crazy part. you stay in an airport hotel in a special floor where there are security guards so you cannot leave the hotel. you cannot even go to the common area of the hotel without a security guard behind your back. basically you are treated as a prisoner  flight from moscow to los angeles was a disaster. i was flying alone with my 12 month old baby and it was very was uncomfortable. the gentleman sitting next to me was willing to move to another seat in order to give us more space however flight attendants said that other seats would cost extra. i couldnt even use my table because my baby had to be on my lap for the whole flight. they saw this but still gave me two trays of food one for me and one for baby i had to put them on floor and eat from there. return flight to london from bangkok via moscow. flight from bangkok delayed 3 hrs obviously late arriving to transit in moscow to pick up heathrow flight. really badly organised and horrendous in moscow  only 2 staff on international passport check and security bearing in mind nearly everybody had connecting flights. it was complete chaos with staff shouting out various connecting flights for people to come through in a very cramped area which i can only describe as a herding pen other flights arrived and travellers became aggressive towards each other as the situation was made worse by staff it was a stressful dash to the far end of the airport once through security. this airport isnt the worst i have been to but this was a bad experience. inflight food was ok no alcohol served and not much in the way of fluids  only small fizzy pop water or juice offered twice on a 9 hour flight. only consolation is that as im a nervous flyer the flights were smooth and turbulence free we were on a 10 hour flight from bangkok to moscow connecting to barcelona which took off on time but we somehow lost 1.5 hours in the air. then about 20 of us missed our various connections by about 10 mins.  we then were told wed have to stay overnight in a hotel. we waited around for 45 minutes with no information or wifi to tell loved ones not to pick us up in barcelona. we were finally escorted to a hotel with security guards and strict surveillance. we werent allowed to leave the second floor without an escort. on top of that everyone was rude and cold and only one man spoke english. the security guards spoke none except for the one who could yell go. the worst part is that they all made us share a room with a complete stranger even though several passengers tried to refuse. we also werent allowed to have our checked luggage so we had to sleep in a room with a stranger with next to nothing. we were then escorted to our flight the next morning though none of them spoke english and were incredibly rude and short. at passport control i was screamed at in russian for not showing my hotel voucher of which no one ever told us to keep or show to anyone after the hotel. finally another passenger translated for us and i was able to get through. the flight attendants also spoke minimal english and were far from kind. the entire experience was awful with no reprieve.    i flew with aeroflot from nice to tokyo return via moscow and it was horrible. i didnt expect it to be the best because it was not expensive but there is a minimum. the seats were uncomfortable and service wasnt good they serve the drinks and a long time later the meal and were slow to clear trays after you finish eating.  cherry on the cake they lost my luggage on the way back. meanwhile they didnt explain anything and were not nice at all. after 10 days i received my suitcase damaged and without the handle. not to mention how it was inside. they didnt take responsibility for anything and didnt even apologize.  i flew aeroflot from lax to and from moscow. i brought 2 luggage to the airport counter knowing that as a sky team premium member i would be able to check in one additional luggage on top of one allowed luggage. according to the counter attendant since aeroflot system shows that i am not a premium member i could not check in additional luggage. even though i presented with the korean air premium membership card they flatly denied to check in the luggage. i went to korean air counter and brought the manager to aeroflot counter then aeroflot demanded some kind of printout of my membership then they allowed. it took more than 2 hours to check in. when i tried to check in at moscow same thing was repeating all over. however this time i did not have korean air to back me up staff were rude and condescending. again it took more than 2 hours to check additional luggage i do not know how to prevent the same trouble in my future travel. at baggage drop i queued for 45 mins to check in my luggage. i had a small backpack and a cabin suitcase that were for hand carrying but they told me they could only allow one so i was forced to check in my cabin cases and pay for extra luggage. i didnt get to take valuables out because it was 40 mins before the departure time and i had to hurry to the gate. the flight from venice to moscow was delayed for around 30 minutes. luckily i got to my connecting flight just in time. however the flight from moscow to hong kong was delayed as well for 1 hour. luckily the plane still arrived in hong kong in time. i was happy when i stepped out from the cabin but later only to find out that i couldnt see my luggage at the baggage claim. i went to the counter to look for help but they told me they didnt receive any notifications from aeroflot about baggage misconnection and they couldnt even locate my luggage. the staff told me they were not from the airline so they couldnt help much and that they would send me back the luggage when they found it. i told them to send the luggage to a friends place because my family was not in hong kong to receive the luggage for me. i bought some winter wears and basic necessities before heading to china on the same day and kept all the required documents to send to the lost and claims department of the airline. however they refused to pay me back the expenses considering i had been in europe for 2 months with all my belongings only because i am from hong kong. when i picked up my luggage from my friend i found out that my hand luggage was opened by someone else. i would not fly this airline company again. berlin to bangkok via moscow and aeroflot has good planes very modern. the staff is unfriendly and service technique is weird. they dont give you toothbrushes on a long distance fight 10hrs or a of water. instead they are constantly busy and overwhelmed doing service and running after everyones wishes water coffee. this is annoying if you just want to sleep. so first they serve cold drinks then 15 min later they serve food. if you havent ordered anything specific you only get meat. the quality of the food is poor.  then they collect the glasses after that they collect the food and then they go with another hot drinks. its just chaotic and disturbing. toilets were good and big. stockholm to moscow with aeroflot and the ground service seemed okay at first but made an error regarding our luggage even though we asked specifically about it so we had to spend some time fixing that later with a different airline. flight attendants stood around bickering about something during the flight so i couldnt sleep. plane was delayed several hours airline would not help us with our connecting flight which we missed. we had to book a hotel room since next flight was a day later. airline wont confirm that they were delayed so paper work with getting reimbursement for the hotel room from job isnt working either. its not even aeroflot that has to pay for it  they just have to confirm that they were in fact late but they wont do it only upside is that the food was okay.  svolax nycsvo. both a330s interior looked run down and seats were dirty. toilets were not cleaned during the flight. the food almost the same as i had two days before on a svomucsvo. i booked a london to tokyo flight via moscow as it was the cheapest fare and the journey time was good. we booked vegetarian meals and confirmed these via the booking agent opodo. however when checking in it became apparent we had no vegetarian meal. the stewards on the first leg were great and rustled up a vegetarian meal for us they were good and i started to wonder what all the bad reviews were about. however during the next leg it was obvious  the staff never smiled and were not helpful with our vegetarian request. the inflight entertainment was not great a few new movies  it was a laugh to see movies from the 70s though. the return leg was not great we didnt even bother asking about the vegetarian meal as i couldnt face the stern expression on the steward. it was not a pleasant journey. aeroflot is much cheaper than other airline and i would recommend it as it did the trick we arrived safely. so if you are happy to forego smiling staff have a passion for old russian films and do not want vegetarian food you will love aeroflot amsterdam to hanoi via moscow. the first flight delayed an hour making me miss the connecting flight in moscow to hanoi. had to spend the night in the airport hotel. the next day i had to fly to beijing wait 5 hrs and finally catch my flight to vietnam. all in all i was delayed 34 hrs. onboard staff were not very friendly and their english pretty bad. the food was average and seats and inflight entertainment adequate for economy class. budsvokja roundtrip. aeroflot inflight service was fine although staff could have been better trained and their english command was poor. transfer in svo is the europe worst with the most confusing pointers impossibly slow passport control bizarre security check and no interest from staff to make the transfer more comfortable. flight from london to delhi via moscow was cancelled on the day of departure. they put me on an alternate flight on the same route that departed several hours later and included a 12 hour stop in moscow rather than a 3 hour one. i requested a vegetarian meal and had this verified prior to the initial cancellation of my flight. no one at aeroflot bothered to transfer this request to the replacement flight and that flight didnt carry any vegetarian meals. i received some meal tokens to spend in the airport however the value of the tokens was pathetic by any measure. the only eatery open was tgi fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which i ordered with a glass of orange juice. these two meagre items not only came to more than the amount i had in tokens but required me to pay several euros too the level of english of aeroflot staff is terrible for an international airline. fcodmesha. flight delay  3 hours on departure. missed connecting flight in moscow with consequently overnight in moscow. the food is very heavy and the crew unpleasant. its cheaper than other airlines but you get low quality service. our flight was late arriving in ho chi min for our flight to moscow with no apology from the crew. they let passengers onto the flight who had been drinking heavily and nothing was said or done to turn them away the crew were unhelpful and sullen the food was inedible. on arriving in moscow we thought we still had time to catch our next flight to london heathrow only to be told the flight had already left. when we arrived at the desk we were given tickets for the next day and told we would be in a hotel for the night. no apologies there was a lot of shrugging of shoulders and being told to sit over there. rude and very unhelpful. svocph. first time with aeroflot and would avoid in the future. surly and unpleasant cabin crew. very average food and almost incomprehensible announcements in english. fortunately the flight was only just over two hours. brusvopvg in economy. brusvo on a small airbus no inflight entertainment and the staffs ability to speak english was average with a smile every now and then. i got a small warm meal for the 3.5 hours flight. transfer at svo airport was below average. friendliness was unknown. svopvg on a brand new a330 with decent leg room and various movies and music on individual inflight entertainment system. i got 2 warm meals though only drinks during meals and not in between. pvgsvo  old boeing 767 no adaptive head rests small leg room very little seat recline and no individual inflight entertainment. on boarding i went to sleep so missed the menu card. during mealtime i asked what was provided and got an extremely rude answer. no smile tossing objects at me instead of handing over  very disappointed by service. in general i wouldnt recommend. lhrto dubai via moscow. moscow to dubai the planes were old with no inflight entertainment. my friend ordered vegetarian food before the flight however she ended up with no inflight meal both ways. if your flight is long haul then i would not recommend this airline. for shorter distances it is fine. general staff service was poor and none could speak other languages apart from russian. limited food and if you required a drink you needed to help yourself at the end of the aircraft. amsterdam to hanoi with a stop in moscow. delay in amsterdam because of overbooking and stranded in moscow. now one day later im still in moscow. aeroflot gave explanation. together with 10 other people we were guarded to a non visa area in a nearby hotel. we received no communication no new boarding pass and service is lacking. were not even allowed to leave our hotel room. no sign of aeroflot within the last 36 hours the hotel guard explains that lost passengers arrive here every day and that this is very common. the whole service is horrible but the worst part is that really nobody cares dont expect any service or any communication. we also didnt received our luggage although its still here at the airport. amssvo check in opens 2.5 hrs before long lines online check in was not possible. flight boarded on time it was a a321 instead of the scheduled a320 due to high volume booking as elite plus we were lucky to be upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. welcome drink amenity set and a 2x2 configuration. after take off received a nice hot lunch and a drink but the remaining 2 hours no service quite odd. for business seats for european business good service should be better. digi player was good for a 3.5 hr flight. london to moscow then moscow to shanghai. experienced a poor service throughout except for the food. at checkin i asked if i could request an aisle seat or one with extra legroom im 6ft 7ins i was told i had to pay 50 pounds if i wanted it. of course this made the journey very uncomfortable straight away as on both flights i was sat in between passengers. both aircrafts were very old especially for the long haul moscow to shanghai. entertainment consisted of a projector and white screen at the front of the cabin  the worst entertainment ive ever endured on a 9 hour flight. staff seemed slow and unresponsive at times however did serve regular drinks and the food was nice. in future i would rather pay a bit extra with other airlines. overall a poor service. lhrsvouln return. i have flown this route 6 times over the last couple of months. this is by far the fastest way to mongolia from london but am fed up by the last of customer service and inability to transit luggage through svo. the planes from lhr to svo are generally new and clean. onward from moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat. the food is always the same  just about edible in business class. out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times. going to give up with aeroflot and fly korean air via seoul now. via moscow might be quick but the total lack of customer service wears very thin after a while. madrid to beijing via moscow. i paid 457 euro with taxes included which was a great price. the plane going over was shabby looking inside with no ife. the food was just ok and the cabin crew never even smiled once or were standing at the door with leaving the plane. i say over all they need to improve on customer service and update the planes a little. budapestmoscowbeijing and shanghaimoscowbudapest. all flights were delayed about 2 hours without explanation. staff in budapest and moscow  very rude they dont speak english and whenever you ask something the answer is we dont know. pvgsvoams. got the lowest price available by a long way so wasnt expecting too much. the flight from pvgsvo was at 1.40am  the new planes apparently are on the earlier route so the plane was very spartan with shared tvs which showed one film throughout the whole journey. staff were so serious that it was quite comical does it hurt to smile. svoams was again on a very basic plane this time with no tvs at all but at least the staff were nicer despite very poor english. acceptable for a very cheap flight but i wouldnt choose them if there were other airlines at a similar price. pekfco return economy class. the peksvosvopek legs were served through old planes no ife uncomfortable seats ok food. transit through sheremetyevo airport was a bit of a nightmare it took a long time and staff was not friendly and helpful. the svofcofcosvo were much better as planes were newer ife available and staff friendlier. amssvohkg. first experience with a russian airline. aircraft new a320 and a330 reasonably on time. svo terminal f horrible more like a busy bus terminal. seat comfortable ptv with a limited choice. staff attitude ok didnt really expect too much in this part of the world. would fly them again as they offer a decent product for a low cost. istanbul to moscow on april 13. the airplane was quite old and of poor standard eg there is no seat light no visual display to follow the air blows from the seat and not from above. the crew were not well trained their way of addressing customers was not professional. the food they served as a lunch was well below standard. delay of more than 12 hours. rude and unhelpful staff in moscow lack of any kind of information post service inexistent. on the way back from mad to bkk first flight got delayed 2.5 hours so when we arrive in svo connection to bkk had already departed. instead of giving us a hotel they gave us a boarding pass to seoul we arrived to seoul without any idea of what to do next nobody say anything to us no information. there they gave us a boarding pass to bkk with korean airlines for 6 hours later. arrive into bangkok with more than 12 hours delay they inform us that our bags were still in moscow. the worst customer service. ive been flying aeroflot for several years into mongolia as there are no other convenient flights from europe. 90 of the time they either cant make the connection are delayed andor lose the luggage. i find it remarkable that i have to pay for this kind of service to fly for work  flights into mongolia are not cheap. los angeles to berlin via moscow. our first flight was delayed which caused us to miss our connecting flight. when we returned back to lax from moscow our flight was delayed by almost two hrs. thankfully our connecting flight was 5 hrs after so we didnt miss our connecting flight. it seems to me that they have many delays. so be mindful if you decide to purchase a ticket with them. the service was not the best food was mediocre and the inflight entertainment was decent. on their smaller flights you have to pay for food or drinks. in terms of price they are reasonable and you do get what you pay for.    prague to shanghai via moscow with aeroflot. the ticket was cheap and i got to my destination on time. no damage to my suitcase and a relatively short layover in moscow. however the customer service wasnt very good. the flight attendants came across as cold and the plane was obviously understaffed especially the svo to pvg leg and therefore it took the lone flight attendant forever to hand out meals and collect trays afterwards. the inflight entertainment had rather limited choices and there were no snacks available throughout the flight in the galley  only drinks. there were also fewer lavatories on aeroflots b777 compared to some other airlines. the layover in svo wasnt pleasant at all. there were only a handful of seats near the departure gate and no free wifi connection that would be actually working with my or my partners smartphone. the corridors there are pretty narrow and crowded. thankfully my layover was short. overall it was alright given the very low price i suppose but i will probably avoid flying with aeroflot for some time  the few bucks that i saved werent worth the discomfort. in general a pleasant journey with aeroflot. the positive sides were that the seats and the meals were good special diet meals like vegetarian gluten and lactose free were easy to order on their website. on the negative side the onboard entertainment system was not that good most of the documentaries were in russian and with no english translation and we didnÂ´t see any smiles from the flight crew. but as i said earlier the journey in general was pleasant. two way ticket from stockholm to bangkok were really cheap we paid about 3000 sek 312. so i think that you get what you pay for.    flew london heathrow to beijing via moscow. my only reason to write this review is to warn other skyteam members not to fly with aeroflot. from booking to flight aside from the planes being relatively new and a lower price than the poor standard chinese airlines there is no other reason to fly with them. despite being a platinum member i was unable to book any economy comfort seats nor even an exit seat they are all blocked for aeroflot members only  and on the london to moscow leg all the exit seats were empty and we were not allowed to move to them. on the 9.5 hour beijing leg there are no extra legroom seats as they are only available on the 777s so you are on an aircraft that most airlines use on medium haul with only 30 inches legroom  the cabin was crammed with people all over the place and as normal rather large people at that with legs in the aisles. checkin was supposed to start at 7.40 but we waited until 8am whilst listening to the staff stories about the night before whilst they drank their coffee the start of abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey. flight left 1 hour late and then at moscow was delayed again by 1.15 whilst they deiced the wings. the food was not only poor it was inedible and i had the same avml meal on both legs plus no alcohol at all and when questioned all i got was a curt we never have any reply. why on earth not there is no religious reason on flights to china and even china eastern has 2 bottles of red and white. lounges were typical eastern european absolutely packed and with no hot food whatsoever i managed to find some coleslaw and sweet bread plus some chilean wine to keep me going as id eaten nothing for over 6 hours. entertainment system was zero on the flight from london not even a communal tv nor any music and on the beijing flight it kept breaking down. at no time did any staff walk around with drinks there are no snacks available not even noodles and if you press your call button they do not answer. i can only assume that the reason to travel with them is the price it was a terrible experience from start to finish.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    stockholm to los angeles via moscow. i had a confirmed ticket but aeroflot refused to issue me a boarding pass svolax claiming the information was wrong in their reservation system. logically they should fix what is wrong on their system. aeroflot customer service sorry we cant help you you will have to buy a new ticket.  delta was nice enough to fix aeroflots dysfunction and get me on the flight. the flight svolax was delayed for two hours because they were waiting for transit passengers. on a 14 hour flight the ife did not work for the duration of the flight. they lost my baggage and delivered it 3 days later. then they kept sending several emails asking question when i claimed reimbursement and to this date i have yet to see a single rouble i dont mind aeroflot employees stony unsmiling demeanor but the lack of service is a dealbreaker.     flew aeroflot from london gatwick to sheremetyevo. at the checkin ground staff ignored my sky team gold card and did not give me the lounge invitation and fast track sticker. also they denied to give me first row economy seat due to full occupancy. the boarding started with 20 minutes delay. ground staff did not really care about business class and sky priority passengers. as ground staff told us the reason of delay was late arrival of an aircraft. as crew told us the reason of delay was slow work of ground staff. boarding was hectic and not well organised. i saw a vacant first row economy seat. i had a special meal booked but the cabin crew forgot about this. i had to remind them and they at first refused to provide it. after some time they finally found it and gave it to me. cabin crew were not friendly. you can not sit normally with your laptop computer when the passenger in front reclines their seat. we had about 40 minutes delay.\\r\\r\\n    aeroflot is based in russia where bad weather in winter is not uncommon and for pasengers to endure 12 hour delay overnight in moscow airport due to weather conditions is unacceptable. the worst way of dealing with delayed passengers offering them a 7eur voucher for making them miss their correspondance. overall very poor quality with no inflight entertainment from london to moscow.     i flew with my 9 yr old son from heathrow to shanghai via moscow. the flight from the london to moscow had no inflight entertainment or power sockets not great when flying with a 9yr old. the food was terrible and largely undedible. the staff were so rude. the flight from moscow to shanghai the food again is terrible the screen on my sons seat was broken as was the remote control my headphone socket was hanging off and only 1 ear produced sound. then on the return journey broken headphone sockets on both my sons and my seats bad food and rude staff. the connecting flight from moscow to london had a very old tv system but again no power and my sons headphone socket produced no sound. unbeliably bad especially in this day and age. i purchased this flight after reading reviews that they had significantly improved the flights and service over the years. dont believe it but they are as awful as ever.    moscow to yuzhno sakhalinsk. on check in at moscow the staff were rude and refused to check me in as one of my bags as it weighed 24kg instead of 23kg even though my 2nd check in luggage weighed 12kg. they told me to take 1kg out or pay 2000rur or they wouldnt let me fly. out of the 46kg i was entitled to take i only had 36kg and ended up having to take 1kg out of my luggage and hand carry it onboard. there was only 1 person scanning boarding passes for economy passengers with no help and no proper queue so all customers were just pushing to get to the desk to board. this was highly unorganised and not pleasant. we had to board on a bus even though we were flying on a full b777 while smaller a320s and b737s sat at the gate making the boarding process very uncomfortable . the plane was one of aeroflots oldest b777s. the usb charger was broken at my seat and one of the toilets was out of order. they hadnt changed the entertainment from april to may even though they provided the may entertainment guide. the food was terrible and they ran out of the food selection i wanted due to the way they were serving food back to front rows. for breakfast i got a buckwheat porridge however it wasnt a porridge at all just a tray full of cooked but dry buckwheat. they dont serve any alcohol on an 8hr flight  if you want some you have to pay for it and if you want a snack you also have to pay for it. overall aeroflot provided poor ground and air service and used an old plane for a long flight. i have flown aeroflot before and sometimes they can be ok but on this particular case they were poor.    ho chi minh to tel aviv via moscow. i ordered a special meal and on the first flight i got my meal but on the connection i was told that the meal was only booked for the first leg of the flight which was obviously a mistake by the airline. when i landed i spoke to aeroflot again to make sure that on the return flight everything is registered correctly and that i am registered to have a special meal they assured me that they would verify this. 1 day before the flight i called to speak to them again and the woman i spoke to was rude said i had not ordered a kosher meal and that they cannot fix it even though they have much time until the flight which i will take tomorrow.   aeroflot is the worst airline i have ever traveled. flew from delhi to stockholm via moscow. the airline crew is not at all helpful and arrogant. the toilets are not clean. my seat for a 6 hour long journey was not firm and kept moving. i asked the crew to change the seat and they made excuses that the flight was full. i tried to be as respectful to the crew as possible. when transiting through moscow for europe  the short european sector they will just give a very poor snack which most often cold and nonvegetarian. very bad experience overall.    atyrau to rome via moscow. they gave me a hand written boarding ticket and a tagged my luggage with just a slip with fco written on it . i questioned where is the electronic tag how is my bag going to get to rome  it fine they said dont worry. when i got to moscow i had to get a boarding pass for next flight to rome and aeroflot said they have no record of any luggage for me i explained what the aeroflot staff in kazakhstan said and they said we dont know if your luggage will be on the connecting flight or not. arrived in rome no luggage i have contacted aeroflot in rome and moscow and they could not care less about my luggage second day now and no response from their lost luggage department. i have my trip in tatters i need to fly to croatia and i have no luggage and no idea if it will be found. unbelievably shocking service.     bangkok to moscow. i selected a window seat and once i got to check in the lady said she was changing my seat i asked is it by a window to which she replied yes. once on the plane i wasnt given a window seat so this was the first of my frustrations. the plane was old the screen was broken and not stay in an upright position. i found the staff not helpful at all. on the way home i bought a picture and aeroflot charges me 100 dollars to fly my picture.  i will never fly again with aeroflot.    london to tokyo via moscow this month. the airline did not load my luggage on to the connecting flight in moscow not once but twice  on both my outward and return journeys. i flew to tokyo from heathrow with a stopover in moscow. unfortunately the first leg of the flight was delayed by an hour or so with no reason given. as a result i was rushed through the airport in moscow and was frantically ushered on to my connection. when i arrived in tokyo narita i was informed that my case was still in moscow. it was two days before i received it at the address i was staying at. i did consider the idea that this could happen again on my return journey three weeks later but surely not oh yes it could. this time there were no delays yet when i returned to london i was told that my bag was still in moscow and could take a day or two to be delivered to me. i was given a number to call that looked suspiciously like a mobile number and told that they could not guarantee when i got my bag back. early the next morning i tried to call to find out where my bag was. the number given went straight to voicemail. i tried to call it several times but still nothing. i then tried to call the baggage customer helplines. all three numbers were busy and i didnt succeed in getting through to anyone over a five hour period. calling the baggage handler responsible for aeroflot at heathrow was also useless and they passed me another mobile number that also didnt answer. i then tried calling the aeroflot desk at heathrow and was grateful to speak to a human being. the lady was very kind and eventually called me back to say that she had found my bag and i could come in to collect it myself. i will never fly with this airline again. it seems there are lots of similar cases of this kind of thing happening in moscow svo airport.     rome to moscow. the only good thing is the food and the flights leave on time. nobody smiles at me. no tv or radio on this short flight. they provided russian newspaper.  they lost our luggage. and its our 2nd day without our bags.    moscow to rome. i was not lucky because i had a huge man next to my seat 9d. his left arm and shoulder were pushing me constantly toward the other side of my seat i was very uncomfortable. i moved to one of the free seats of row 8 exit doors row were 4 of the 6 seats were free. a crew attendant came immediately and ordered me to move back to my assigned seat because all seats of row 8 were already taken. lie we were already flying for more than half hour i explained the reason of my change and i asked for another seat. the only one available was in the last row where seats dont recline and are uncomfortable. i expressed my disappointment but it didnt change their attitude justifying it with aeroflot policy. i also offered to pay for the change with no result.     heathrow to hanoi return via moscow. when we were queuing to board the plane we were called to one side and told the flight had been overbooked and as we had the longest connection time in moscow we had to wait until the flight the following morning. we were put in a nearby hotel and went back to heathrow in the morning and got on the next flight. on aeroflot flights theres minimal drinks on offer water orange juice or wine out of a paper cup. the food is okay and the seat comfort average. when we landed in hanoi we found out our bags had not come on the flight with us but the staff did not know where they were nor could they tell us how long they would take to reach us. this is a huge problem when youre travelling around vietnam for a month and in two days would be 1000 miles away from hanoi where the bags would be delivered. we were given a number to call to check on the status of our bags but every time we phoned we were not given any information. a week later we were told our bags had been found. we arranged for them to be sent to hoi an where we picked them up. absolutely no compensation from the airline not even an apology. on our return flight our flight was delayed by 5 hours which meant we missed our connection. this would have been okay if aeroflot arranged a hotel for us until the next flight the following morning. but instead we had to fight our way literally through queues at moscow airport with hundreds of other delayed aeroflot passengers to get our connecting flight booked which was a 7am flight the next day. we were then told another rep would arrange our accommodation at midnight the time now was 9pm. by midnight there was no sign of any rep. other frustrated passengers started demanding information from the staff that were around but it was no use. at 3am we gave up and went to the gate to wait for 4 hours. the gates were full of hundreds of passengers including babies and children on airbeds they were handing out of a room at the end of the terminal. we queued for a further hour to get an airbed. by 4am we were on an airbed and had a couple of hours lay down in the cold airport before our flight to heathrow. we tried to get good value for our food vouchers and were able to get a tea croissant and egg it was a nightmare to fly with aeroflot.    baku to berlin return via moscow. it was my first and most probably last experience with aeroflot. on the way to berlin everything went smoothly. edible food not smiling crew etc. but first thing ive noticed in the cabin was nonexistence of the ife system. not even business class passengers had personal screens. especially red eye flights are unbearably boring without ife. i was expecting to come back home in the same way but no i supposed to leave berlin on 1st of december 11 pm and but our flight was delayed for 18 hours at first. it was due to bad weather in moscow according to the airline representative. after a long night at the schoenefeld airport were given a hotel room. my rebooked flight for the next day december 2 1700 was delayed for another 4 hours. when we finally made to moscow svo december 3 0045 i found out that my connecting flight already departed. i approached to customer service desk with other passengers from the same flight. got a meal voucher and hotel room again. i had to wait 15 hours for the next flight. finally after 2 days i was able to reach my final destination. but aeroflots trouble was far from over. at that point my luggage was missing. i had to wait 2 more days for missing bag. however when i got it the luggage was awfully dameged. two wheels were ripped off along with other damages.   flew aeroflot from moscow to astana. ground services poor business lounge at svo with low class selection of food and beverages and it was overcrowded. seat was ok. cabin crew in general were welcoming however did not follow the safety rules by allowing passenger from seat 2a to move across the cabin while aircraft was taxing to the gate which threatens the safety of other passengers. baggage handling of this airline is always a mess.    vienna to delhi via moscow. one of the worst airlines i travelled. they can delay flight or cancel the flight without any information then they  leave u on your own not provide any accomodation or food no representative there to assist you.     moscow to paris. a week prior to my flight the company changed the rules for carryon luggage dimensions allowed on board so that my swissgear luggage small case promoted as meeting any airline carry on luggage requirements that i had with me was no longer meeting their requirements for 1 centimeter and they asked me to pay 100 euros to have it checked in. i have never had any problems with any airline that checked this case in as a carry on even with lowcost like westjet. avoid this airline if you dont want to feel frustrated. worst experience ever.    tel aviv to moscow in economy class. ive flown with aeroflot four times.  on the good side the fleet is new boarding experience is ok.  in aeroflot economy class for some reason the drinks come 30 min after food. the flight attendants remove dirty trays only after the drink service. so first you sit for 30 min waiting for coffee for you desert and after another 30 min with dirty tray.  the food in economy has plastic taste to me on flights ive flown there is no inflight entertainment no inflight wifi.  sheremetyevo airport is small difficult to navigate try to get from the arrivals hall to the departures hall in terminal d bad traffic.   phuket to moscow. i am a ruby member of oneworld and a silver member of sky team. that means at least that i have taken many flights in my life and this flight was the worst ever. on board service was awful and profesionalism of cabin crew nonexistent. they served us in premium economy lunch and without serving any kind of drinks. the all staff disappeared for more than 40 minutes. after serving the meal they never came back to serve drinks. we had to eat without any kind of drink not even water. moreover after 40 minutes without any kind of service most people on premium economy decided to take the trays to the galley. can you imagine 30 people piling trays in the small galley it was a very long trip and no bottle of water was served during flight. worst flight experience ever.    paris to shanghai via moscow. our flight was 2hours delayed in paris therefore we couldnt have the transfer in moscow. they offer us to stay one night in the novotel nearby the airport. a driver were supposed to come at 10pm to pick us up. he came at the end at 1135pm the hotel was 5 minutes away from the airport. the staff was so incompetent and unpleasant. there were rude to us they did not tell a word about anything they did not communicate at all. every time we had a request they answered wait a moment. we wait til midnight once at the novotel hotel and it was a joke. they took us through the garbage local and then we had to queue because the scanned our passport before getting into our rooms. they knocked in our doors the all night and wake us up at 5am calling on the phone and knock our doors. no customer service at all they were horrible.     helsinki to tel aviv via moscow. the flight from moscow to tel aviv left at midnight. the flight wasnt completely full but the service took forever it took crew 3.5 hours to complete the service. the total flight was only 4.5 hours. i only wanted to get some food and then go to sleep but it took forever and while they were serving the lights were on in the cabin.  i was so annoyed of how unproductive the service was.    male to moscow. really disappointed with the whole return flight from male  it is a long flight plane ok but the crew very rude  it was a big disappointment the way they treated passengers snappy answers etc. flight was delayed by almost two hours but no proper apology etc. i find it also very strange that the drinks are served half an hour before the meal by the time your meal arrives you have none left then you wait about another half an hour to get a coffee i think this should be seriously rethought it is the same way on all long haul aeroflot flights. the biggest issue however was at arrival when two of our suitcases came totally damaged we have reported this at the airport immediately were advised to log the given report via aeroflot website within 7 days now we received answer  very rude lots of exclamation marks asking for whole set of documents new statement from us for what  the report was done at the airport copy of the passport etc. any airline can have a nice plane but they can make a difference when something goes wrong and in customer service apparently still long way to go with aeroflot.   flew aeroflot from moscow to nizhny novgorod. new rules for cabin luggage exclude video and photo cameras as well as laptops and books this is very uncomfortable. the prices are high and the service is like a bad low cost company. ground staff are watching out for every kilo backpacks are now limited to 5 kilos which is just ridiculous.    bangkok to madrid via moscow. flew with economy class due to the cheapest price during long holiday. it was a little disappointed with the plane and staff as the plane was very old and uncomfortable seat small legroom. the staff was not very helpful like i expected. toilet was very dirty. on the way back i had a chance to reselect the seat to be a long legs seat at the front row. cabin crew and another passenger were keep crossing and made me could not sleep for whole night.    flew rwandair from harare zimbabwe. to london uk. via kigali. my childrens allergies were not taken seriously. they both have anaphylactic reactions to various food. i struggled to get suitable meals for them and my children were given nothing but fruit at times yet hot meals could and should have been prepared for them. i checked in kigali if theyd have their correct meals given to them and was reassured everything had been sorted. to my surprise nothing had and staff didnt know if allergens were in the meals they were serving. you are only asked if you want beef or chicken and wont know till you open your meal if it was spicy or not. i tried to swap my childs meal as theyd been serving beef curry with pasta and a creamy chicken dish with rice. all id been told was beef or curry by a very rude member of staff. i asked if both my kids untouched and unopened meals could be swapped with chicken but the vile member of staff argued with me saying the meal which he hadnt tasted himself wasnt spicy what could have been resolved in seconds took longer than necessary. he challenged me in an aggressive tone which was completely unnecessary. he reluctantly agreed to swap the meals over. hed told me there were no other meals for my children so i based my choice on guess work. had i known in advance that my childrens dietary requirements wouldnt be met on such a long flight id have spent my money elsewhere. other than that there were several stops and delays on our way to zimbabwe. seats were double booked from kigali to lusaka. on our return we struggled to find seats with our children and staff announced that passengers should sit wherever there was a seat. staff made sure toilets were clean but they could have at least changed gloves as they wore the same gloves theyd been wearing while serving food. the plus side is one of their meals was delicious their flights are generally more affordable than most but that comes with a price. rwandair has more luggage allowance than most in relation to zimbabwe staff on our way to zimbabwe were friendly and approachable aside from speaking in their own language they also kept passengers well hydrated considering the heat. it would be helpful for staff to carry a laminate list of ingredients as none of them seem to know whats in the food they serve and it would be helpful to actually say to passengers would you like beef curry served with pasta or would you like creamy chicken and rice rather than beef or rice. some customers who dont eat spicy food can make a choice rather than having to guess and waste food by returning or swapping it. to and from staff didnt know what sort of meals they were serving.  wb100. when i work in nairobi and needed to travel to kigali for meetings i would take this airline and i have not experienced anything so bad in the past. however a few months ago when i decided to fly it back to south africa after a meeting in kigali i was shocked by my experience. i normally take south african airways on that route but this time the flight was not available and therefore booked rwandair. the airport seemed very busy  like a market place with women talking at the top of their voices to other women right next to them. when it came to boarding there was a mad scramble to get through the gate and onto the plan. it was not organized at all. when we got into the plane the captain spoke to us for a brief moment and that was it until landing time. in the air they served dinner immediately after take off with no snacks prior to dinner. they also didnt seem organized as the person serving drinks served kids first and the one who came with the dinner forgot to serve some children and their poor mother had to walk to the front to get her children food and walk all the way to the back to her children holding 2 trays of hot food while trying to balance as she walked. on landing passengers only knew it was landing time as the lights were switched off and the captain then announced we were landing and told crew to take their seats. on landing the plane seemed to bounce of the tarmac and lean to the right before it finally settled on the tarmac but the captain kept braking suddenly on the taxi to the gate. this seemed strange to me and all the while the captain did not explain anything to us about the landing or the breaking. im not sure i would want to take this airline again to johannesburg in the near future. wb300 kgl to dbx 14 november 2012. my boarding time was at 11.15 nothing had happened by 12.15 so i started to get a bit nervous inquired with airport representatives who was sitting at the boarding gate. they said they dont know what was happening and would check. i found that to be quite unprofessional they should have known there were complications. they came back 30 mins later to advise us that they apologize for the delay and will advise accordingly. flight left after 3.00 that morning. i really think rwandair team in kigali needs to be trained accordingly. its just good manners to keep your passengers informed on things like this.    dubai to kigali with rwandair. the airline left 10 passenger bags in dubai because the airline was over their weight limit. this doesnt make sense because the plane was only 60 full. when asked when my bags would arrive in kigali the staff said they were unsure and this was normal. im in kigali for work and i had my business attire in my checked luggage. the customer service from checking in to landing was less than desirable. the plane was very dirty and had no been cleaned after the last flight. the flight attendant spoke was rude to some of the passengers. im quite disappointed to learn the rwanda air frequently leaves passengers checked luggage at the originating airport to bring other cargo on the plane. nor do they compensate you for lost or late luggage. travelled with rwandair return from kigali to dubai. the outward flight was okay food was good and the staff was warm but on coming back from dubai to kigali i got the rudest flight attendant. the seats on the plane are very squeezed so i requested for a change of seat since i was carrying an infant the lady just shrugged like i was disturbing her. i had to squeeze between two people on seat 5b with an infant while more comfortable seats were vacant. carry a book or magazine as there is no ife. the airport staff are however very helpful. i flew rwandair from libreville to johannesburg via kigala at the end of august 2015 from lbv to jnb and was very disappointed. the flight lbv to kgl without any problem but when i reached kigali to my surprise the ground staff told me to show my vaccination book. i told them that the ground staff from origin did not tell me that i needed to carry my vaccination book. the ground staff told me to stand aside. they agreed that ground staff from origin should have asked it to me as a requirement to travel. i then asked them to find me a solution and suggested that i would agree to get the yellow fever vaccine again at kigali airport as long as i could move on with my trip. their response was that there was no doctor at the airport and i needed a visa to get out of the airport. i told them that i was willing to pay for visa and hotel to stay until the next flight to jnb but they categorically refused to let me out of the airport or to call for a doctor. i finally ended up waiting 22 hours at kigali airport and rwandair not offering even a single glass of water. they kept telling me that they would provide me with food and even a free phone to call home but nothing happened. fortunately i always carry my credit card and could satisfy my thirst and hunger. finally they flew me back to gabon and told me that my ticket was lost. they treated me as a refugee keeping all my documents all the way to lbv. when i reached lbv i complained to the ground staff and to the station manager but until now i did not get any call or mail. i have never been treated like this before.
