nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,SYD-VLI return and VLI-TAH. Long flight on Air Van's 737 was nice and clean. Seats were okay maybe cramped for anyone over 175cm. Flight attendants were very positive and helpful with full meal services for both main flights and on schedule service. Best way to fly to Vanuatu.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,AKL-VLI and VLI-NAN. Both flight serviced by Air Vanuatu's 737. Aircraft was clean seats a little cramped -- but the warm and very helpful flight attendants definitely made up for it. Full meal services on both flights (even with VLI-NAN being only 1 hour and 20 minutes!) Great selection of drinks with two types of red and white wine. On time arrivals. Great airline! Its a shame they don't have a larger network. I travel often to the South Pacific and would definitely fly Air Vanuatu more.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Auckland to Port Vila. Seats a little cramped but fairly comfortable. FA's were friendly and efficient. Food was fabulous - choice of two meals. Great selection of drinks. On return flight again had choice of two breakfast meals delicious. Only gripe is the airport not the airline. On arrival into Vila it's a long wait for customs and it's hot with ceiling fans which don't do anything.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Travelled Brisbane-VLI-Brisbane in January. Very competant and friendly crew and check in. Food was great and for a short flight it was wonderful. Being slow we were at the back of the immigration queue but were nonetheless well entertained by the welcome band. Didn't find seats too cramped at all cosy perhaps.,nan,nan,nan

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Flew Air Vanuatu from Fiji-Port Vila-Auckland on a B737-300. All departures on time. Meal & drink service swift. Crew fairly friendly. Seats a little cramped in economy. No PTV's. Pilot's manouver plane like a car - very swift taxiing and turns. Flights all under 3 hours. Overall a good no- nonsense air shuttle service to Port Vila.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Great inflight magazine outlining the many amazing tourist attractions of Vanuatu and on board duty free shopping is average but not available on the short routes (Nadi - Vila). Travelled this route frequently on this airline's sole 737-300 since 1999 - last trip in January 2004. Has maintained a nice French/Anglo feeling by the all Ni-Vanuatu crew who are tri-lingual (English French and Bislama - Local Pidgen English). Airline also leases aircraft to Air Solomon for flights to Honiara and Brisbane.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,SYD-VLI-SYD. Fantastic new aircraft great crew awesome food. Really impressed by Air Van. Plentiful alcohol including Tusker beer which is great! On time both ways. Entertainment is lacking as it is just a video about Vanuatu but audio ok. Really enjoyed this airline!,nan,4.0,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Auckland to Vanuatu B737-800 return. Seats good overhead screens played for half of flight. Meal okay crew frumpy but hardly seen with Air Vanuatu. I was kicked in the back by a young child every minute of the flight until the last half hour and the two children were raucous and out of control the whole way.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Brisbane to Vila via Santo return Santo to Brisbane. Friendly smiling flight attendants comfortable seats and meals and drinks provided. Santo to Vila on the same 737 we were given bottles of water and packets of banana crisps. However the flight from Vila to Santo was a very different story! We waited anxiously for the 737 to arrive to fly us to Santo but about 2 minutes before take-off there was nothing on the tarmac but a little De Havilland Twin Otter aircraft! And that proved to be our plane! No flight attendants no inflight snacks no toilets but that's what travel is all about!,nan,nan,nan

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Auckland- Vila return. Out in Business and return in economy. Service on both sectors friendly and efficient - business class was in most respects a good experience with exception of the terrible seat pitch. Not a true business class pitch but sectors flown are mostly under 3 hours. Pitch more like about 35-38 inches felt like a premium economy seat pitch. Return food average economy fodder (who wants to eat a full dinner service at 2.00 am). Crew excellent. All in all Air Van are a very good little operator with newish 737-800. Would recommend despite the abysmal seat pitch in J class.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Economy class from Brisbane to Santo return. The crew tried its best to make the journey most comfortable with decent food and a few rounds of drinks including wines and champagne. FA's smiling. The 737-800 seemed to be new. The entertainment system consisted of music programme and advertisements on Vanuatu which is okay for a 3-hour-flight.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Syd-Vli-Syd on new tropical livery 738. Comfortable leather seats with good legroom. Service with good choice of beverages followed by a hot meal. Cabin crew in attendance and responded with a smile to all passenger requests.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,SYD-VLI-SYD in business class. I agree with others comments on the service and friendliness of the airline but Air Vanuatu must do something to improve their business class seats - although they are wide enough the pitch is dismal and does not even allow a footrest. I would urge Air Vanuatu to at least upgrade to Air Pacific standards ie a 50 inch pitch and seats with a proper footrest. Otherwise I can only commend the airline.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,4 flights with Air Vanuatu Sydney - Vila return in the last 6 months. Once the seat belt sign goes off they start their cabin service within 60 seconds not hiding behind a curtain for 30 minutes. Also when you hit the call button the longest time it has taken to get service was less than a minute.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,BNE-VLI Economy VLI-BNE Business A great old style service airline reminiscent of Ansett or Qantas years ago the economy flight comes with full meal and drink service and extra requests are no problem even on this 2.5 hour flight seating was about the same as you'd expect on a 737 domestic service. On the return we paid at the airport for an upgrade (cheaper than booking in advance if you are prepared to take the chance) for the $A200 extra you get the priceless opportunity to wait in the airconditioned lounge rather than the Pt Vila departure lounge with its slow fans and 99%humidity. On board the food choice was excellent for a 3 hour flight 2 course meal and then they bring out fresh cheese and fruit selection and easter eggs for the holiday nothing was a problem. The seats are wider but not much leg room. Only the IFE is limited but its free. There is no better short international flight airline than Air Vanuatu.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,5.0,Flew NF 30/31 from MEL-VLI on the 737-800. Nice leather seating. Very clean plane. However time for new seat cover as the leather from around the seat pocket is coming off. Foot rest would be nice but its only 4 hrs. Food was great includes potato chips (starter) salad main meal bread and a cheesecake dessert. Staff service was great (even though a staff member spilt soft drink on me). Crew member was very apologetic and provided great service to all passengers. All other crew members were great as well and very happy to sell us duty free. However entertainment was non existent.,nan,5.0,nan

Seats are good with plenty of leg and the TV. Cabin crew were a little bit on the grumpy side. The food was nice although they didn't have the requested vegetarian meal I ordered. Seats were comfortable. Landing into Port Vila is a very fast one but the views on approach are excellent. Can't complain much because we arrived 25 minutes early.,nan,4.0,nan

Incoming flight was delayed due to headwinds but the same winds then had us landing earlier than scheduled though the landing in Vila seems to be a very fast one. Plane getting a bit tired inside but great staff. The food was good for international economy and the wine and beers really kept flowing. Overall very good service much better than a recent trip on Air Pacific.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Brisbane to Santo and back in August 2012. Flight slightly delayed due to 'missing spare part'. Service on board very good and smiling good food good beverage selection. Same applies to return flight although it was slightly scary to see that your luggage does not get x-rayed in Santo: a smiley woman asks you to open your bag and performs a visual check. Would travel again as friendly and efficient and reasonable prices.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Food service on flight from Sydney to Port Vila very slow. Fight was 2 hours under way before we received our meal with no choice as to what we wanted. Connecting flight from Vila to Santo delayed one hour and luggage was left behind. Our return flight was as equally disappointing my wife and I were seated together on flight from Santo to Vila with my daughter and then the flight from Villa to Sydney on the same aircraft my wife I were allocated seats apart from each other. This fight was not full but the cabin service was better than our flight over. Even though the flight was not full when I got my food I again was not given a choice in fact staff had trouble finding me a dinner. I have flown Air Vanuatu several times in the past and was very happy with the service but this time was very disappointing.,nan,1.0,nan

Friendly service, standard economy quality food as well as a very easy to use inflight entertainment system which has a very large variety or tv shows and movies.

It's a pity that my critism of Air Vanuatu stems from the lack of friendliness of the staff. They weren't exactly rude, but they were just there.  The food service was painful. Basically the hostees spent the entire filght mucking aroud with trolleys in the aisle. They were there so long people started getting up to go to the toilet and they had to keep shuffling trolleys up and down the aisle. They were simply unprofessional and unfriendly. I think the lack of competition on this route has made them a slack.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 737,First Class,2.0,November 2015,1.0,4.0,1.0,no,Port Vila to Sydney,3.0,"We flew Air Vanuatu, November 2015. Check in staff were on the ball. On board a different matter. The much wanted breakfast was awful. Omelette was leathery and lukewarm with tea served in tiny cups. Crew were seen only occasionally and water was not offered to us during the flight. Captain was informative and the plane landed on time",Business,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,September 2015,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,Wellington to Santo via AKL / Port Vila,4.0,"We could not book ourselves through from Wellington to Santo while in Wellington, though we were able to book the luggage to Port Vila. We had to queue (50mins) for boarding passes to Port Vila in Auckland even though we did not have to book the luggage in. Booking in staff were slow and too few. Why could we not have been given boarding passes in Wellington for the next legs? On arrival at Port Vila we were told our flight to Santo was to fly the next day - we were not told in Auckland? It was cancelled because the engine had to be replaced. We were told we were to stay at Air Vanuatu's expense, in a hotel in Port Vila but to be at the airport for a 7.30am flight by 5.30am, for a domestic flight. The hotel was marginal with a night club active all night. We were contacted in our room after we went to bed to say we had overspent our dinner allowance of 2000 Vatu (about $NZ 28) each. We were to pay the difference or we could not fly the next day. After some discussion we did not pay and we did fly. We had not been told we had a dinner allowance. We had asked at the airport for meal vouchers but had been told this was not necessary. Return flight home by comparison felt like a dream even though it was just normal service. A completely different level of service. The anxiety that we might not return in time for necessary commitments the day after our scheduled return to Wellington, significantly affected our enjoyment of our holiday. I understand this unreliability is common.  The impression we were left with from our dealings with staff concerning the delayed flight was that they were under orders to provide the minimum they could get away with. Don't expect to arrive the day you have booked for. Leave an extra day. You could of course be lucky. Rated 3/10 because the plane left as scheduled from Santo. Otherwise 1/10. I trust that this feedback will help Air Vanuatu learn that the travelling public expect they will be looked after by making travel easy for the traveller (not the airline), and by keeping to their schedules. I would love to visit Vanuatu and Santo again but I am not sure I could cope with the airline again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,3.0,Melbourne-Sydney-Port Vila-Melbourne. Flew Qantas to connect with flight to Port Vila. Old style seats in Business with not much recline but not a real problem for a 3hr flight. Service was excellent with a choice of 2 main courses for lunch and drinks were promptly offered. Cabin crew were typically Vanuatuan - smiling and courteous and they really seemed to enjoy their job. Inflight entertainment was interesting the first time around but then repeated well into the flight! Perhaps they could upgrade this aspect. A word of warning when checking in at Port Vila for a flight out. Checked in 2 hours prior to flight for Melbourne but then kept waiting for security and immigration to open the door for nearly 45 mins in a very warm (non-airconditioned) airport. Lounge at Port Vila mall but at least air conditioned but only packets of chips to eat. Overall it was a most pleasant flight with a great crew on all legs.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,AKL-VLI in economy. Check in at AKL was handled by Air NZ staff who were friendly and accommodating. Flight was quite empty so despite having an economy ticket I was treated to a whole row to myself. The 737 in use on this route is clearly well used but in good order and clean. The cabin crew are warm friendly and helpful. The meal service was quite efficient and consisted of a beef stew with mash and boiled carrots. Simple hot and tasty though I imagine not to everyone's liking the other option available was fish. Sides included a salad bread roll and cheesecake for dessert. A good selection of complimentary beverages is offered throughout the flight. The real winner was a complimentary glass of champagne: this was neither solicited nor is it normal practice for the economy class passengers but for whatever reason the crew decided to treat me on this particular flight. Inflight entertainment is drop down screens with a video of some sort but I find it difficult to see the screens so I didn't even bother and read a book instead. Upon arrival in VLI disembarking was via airstairs to the tarmac. The terminal facilities are simple but functional. Luggage was quite slow this time.,nan,5.0,nan
