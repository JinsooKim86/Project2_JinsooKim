They have planned to many flights in the evening time but not enough desk to issue the tickets. I have waited 45 minutes but could get my tickets and deliver the luggage, only when they have started to shout the destination I go and take me to the front. Bad planning, not enough number of desk to issue the tickets. Either you should plan the flights with reasonable time between, or you should allocate enough resource to cope with all the passengers.

There is no lead about the luggage, nor is there anyone with an adequate informative response, but instead they are rude and inconsiderate and further very very very not well-trained or professional. I was asked to do your job and come down to the airport to look for the luggage at your storage units, noting its their job. I did so, and it still wasn't found. Now, they are asking me to file for compensation while they didn't even provide the initial compensation, and they are only willing to provide a fixed amount of compensation. Away from the luggage, the flight was overbooked and dirty. It was a circus of Children and loud parents. The food was nasty and inedible. The entertainment was hardly entertaining whatsoever and outdated, and to be entirely fair, almost non-existent.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

A319 / A321,Business Class,4.0,May 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Abu Dhabi to London via Amman,4.0," |  I was a little apprehensive of my flight from Abu Dhabi to London via Amman, but it was one of the more pleasurable flying experiences I have had recently. Check-in at AUH was in the premium check-in area then headed to the lounge for an hour. Boarded on time for the 07:30 departure. A319 for the 3-hour flight from AUH to AMM in a 2x2 configuration. Cradle style reclining seat was comfortable for the short journey with pull-out screens from the arm rest. Not much in English to watch. Small snack of cheese and a few pastries wasn't particularly appetising but full beverage service offered. Fell asleep for most of this sector. Two-hour stopover in AMM. Modern (five year old) airport was a surprise, very appealing and functional with RJ dedicated Crown Club occupying the the mezzanine floor with great views over the terminal below. Still serving breakfast at 10am with warm croissants, Arabic foul, cereals, cheese, hummus and full bar service. All perfectly adequate. Boarded on time for midday flight to London on a A321 again in 2x2 configuration using the similar seating of cradle seat with decent recline and retractable footrest with good pillow and blanket on the seat. Pre-take off drinks of juice or Arabic coffee were distributed. PTVS had much more choice of English and Arabic entertainment on this sector and was comparable with a long-haul service. Cabin Service Manager introduced himself, orders were taken for drinks, menus distributed along with amenity kits and sound cancelling headsets. Plenty of legroom. Lunch service began soon after take-off with linen table cloths being laid followed by drinks. Champagne was served by placing the glass on the table and pouring with warm nuts to accompany. Trays were brought with the appetiser and salad course. The main course, cheese and dessert courses were served off a beautifully laid out cart in front of you where you were encouraged to choose what you wanted from the selection. What a delight! It was like going back to the golden days of first class air travel. All elegant and unhurried. Jordanian and international wines were served. The food was delicious especially the amazing desserts. All in all, a wonderful five course meal served beautifully. Staff were always passing through the cabin to see if more drinks were wanted and then an hour before landing small glasses of 'white coffee' water infused with orange blossom were handed round. The AMM-LHR five-hour sector was a truly enjoyable experience and one I certainly hope to repeat again.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Boeing 787,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Beirut to Montreal via Amman,1.0," |  Beirut to Montreal via Amman. There's no airline as low as Royal Jordanian. They will not tell you of any fees for preferred seating and then will claim the plane is full and you can't change your seat, even though there are empty available seats. They stamp all boarding passes SSSS which means full inspection by airport security: Body searches, bag searches, and walking barefoot. The seats are terrible, uncomfortable, and have no leg room. They made us board the plane, and immediately after said that there is a delay with transfer passengers and made us wait in the plane for 45 minutes. And this was already a flight of 11 hours and 20 minutes. They did this because otherwise they would be forced to issue vouchers to passengers to go and eat something at the airport's cafeteria. To avoid expenses, they locked us inside and then told us about the delay. Unscrupulous people! The boarding time for my 10:20 flight was marked as 8:45!

Cabin crew is a bit more professional and helpful compare to my previous flight with them. IFE is better compared to their Airbus fleet, I think this B787 is their flagship aircraft. But still fewer choices in their movies and audios list. I'm expecting a decent meal on this as its a 5.5 hr flight but totally disappointed. Only a sandwich in a box with a small water, pretzels and a small baklava was served. Like what I said before I don't like the way they served a set meal in a box as it doesn't look good a full-service airline. I still prefer to see meals in a small tray like the usual. After that meal, we were just given a small pack of peanuts and beverages of choice.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0
A320,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,Dubai to Amman,4.0," | Dubai to Amman. At first, I'm not expecting much about the service of this airline as I read most of their reviews are not good. On this sector, I first notice immediately how rude the crew assigned on Economy section especially when I heard how she verbally told the lady on the bulkhead that she's not paying attention to the safety video well in fact she cant blame her cause the lady is attending the needs of her small son on her lap. I think that crew should be given a lesson on good manners and proper way of speaking for her guest with some courtesy. I also don't like the way they set the meals in a carton box instead of using a tray as it doesn't look good in a full-service airline. They should change the in-flight entertainment monitors as touch screen options are not responding and most of the monitors are not working at all like mine so I decided just to use my own gadget rather than complain to the crew as for sure they cannot offer any other seats.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,April 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Amman to Cairo,3.0," |  Amman to Cairo. We were flying to Egypt on a family holiday and were informed on our arrival at the airport that our flight had been cancelled and we would now be flying five and a half hours later (meaning that we would now be at the airport for seven and a half hours). It was known that the flight was cancelled before we left home and we were never notified despite our booking being made online. We asked the airline to either arrange for us to be transported home (our transport to the airport was 40 JOD (about 60 USD)) or for use of the Business Class lounge. We thought that these were simple and reasonable requests that Royal Jordanian could easily grant. We were not asking them to compensate us for the afternoon and evening plans we would now miss in Cairo. We just wanted to wait out the long delay at home or in the Business Lounge. The customer service staff were hopeless and cowardly. No one seemed to have any authority. No one would outright refuse our requests but they kept asking us to wait 5 minutes while they got someone else to help us and then ran away, never to return. After waiting an hour and a half, we finally we found Tamara who did try and help us but said that her top manager (whom she had to call at home) had refused to even allow us into the lounge for our 7 hour wait. What a shameful response and how embarrassing for the national airline to show so little care for their customers. We were told that our delay wasn't long enough to qualify for a hotel room because it was only 5 hours and 40 mins instead of the required 6 hours. For the record the delay was in fact six hours because the flight we were rescheduled onto was also delayed, as was our return flight from Cairo a week later. We live in Amman and fly often for business and pleasure. If we can avoid using Royal Jordanian we will. ",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Three nights in an airport are not a viable option with three young children. Now our 8 pieces of luggage apparently did not miss our flight - five have appeared in Bahrain via RJ but they say it is not their fault.

The food was ok on the first trip but on the return the options were limited and the food was generally too spicy out of Bangkok and no way to avoid it. The crew was still typical RJ crew some were quite nice but generally would ignore you if you called them they attended to me 45 minutes after!

The J class cabin consisted of four rows of very comfortable sleeper seats in a 2x2x2 arrangement. The flight was only 2.45 in duration so I didn't get to test them in 'bed' mode but they were extremely comfortable to sit in.

In Hamburg we were not allowed to leave the plane or get any food or drink. Eventually got off the plane - immigration were unaware of who we were and a further delay was caused here. Before we left the plane the crew told all passengers that a representative from the airline would meet us in Hamburg - nobody met us and nobody knew where to go. We were told food and drink would be available for the passengers - this did not happen and each passenger had to pay for their own food and drink.

Our flight was delayed for 2 hours and each RJ rep at the airport gave a different story and they were all obviously clueless and kept us in the dark with no update of any kind.

Crown Lounge in Amman is poor and requires major investments plenty of personnel there who are actually doing nothing for the passengers. AMM-BKK return legs on Airbus 330 aircraft were not new but still met the regular comfort standards. Entertainment system's choice is slightly wider compared with RJ medium-haul but still poor when compared to other Arab airlines flying to BKK.

Told my boarding pass was not valid. Told the plane was overbooked and there were no seats available. The crew and the flight manager told us they would schedule us for the next flight. Told to call Royal Jordanian office and book our own tickets. It was 2am in the morning. After 6 hours of calling a member of staff helped us reserve a ticket.

Last- minute gate change not announced in the lounge resulting in a long back-track. A330 angled flat seats are the most comfortable of many I have experienced and I managed sleep on the night sectors. Arrival at Amman was a huge let-down. No-one at the currency exchange and no officer at the visa on arrival desk. Bag took 45 minutes to arrive. The new terminal cannot open soon enough. At LHR there was another 45 minutes wait for the bags of about 20 passengers whilst all other bags cleared within 30 minutes. Transit in AMM en route back from LHR was as bad with lengthy waits to get near the departure gate and absolutely no organization. On the other hand meals on the AMM-LHR sectors were excellent as was the smiling service. The replacement of the A330 with an A320 for LHR-AMM was no hardship even though the seat pitch is considerably reduced. BA’s Terminal 3 lounge with excellent food and drinks was almost empty for a full 2 hours before the flight. RJ provides a very good service. It's a pity the airports let it down.,nan,5.0,nan

Finally meal was very good and in economy there was choice of 3 meals which is rather unusual although they could have run few more rounds of drinks given the length of flights. The only downside is Amman airport which is not exactly a great experience. In addition they weren't able to issue boarding pass for our connecting flight in Dubai which could have complicated our short transfer in Amman but fortunately we arrived to transfer desk as first passengers from our flight. It is noteworthy that once many people with same problem from our flight came to transfer desk they quickly opened 4 more counters so I guess they were well-prepared for this.,nan,5.0,nan

Initially flight attendant didn't come with water or a hello but then the purser saw me (I was in the last row and she was up in the forward galley) and brought me water and a smile. She made this flight great along with another flight attendant. Smiles - constant refills on drinks. The food on RJ is awesome! Flavourful and quantifies are massive.

The seats were of the soft-leader kind and it was hard to leave them upon arrival. The cabin crew was excellent and the Thai flight attendant did her utmost to make our flight as enjoyable as possible. But what was most noticeable above all was the fresh air during the flight. As I'm usually prone to nose and eye problems due to dry cabin air I was really surprised that I had none of these problems whatsoever during this flight. The only downpoint would be that the entire business class cabin was in 2-2-2 layout despite a trend nowadays to cater to solo travellers: in this cabin you still would have to climb over your neighbour if you end up in a window seat.,nan,5.0,nan

Problems started with Check in at Heathrow for a flight to Bangkok via Amman. I had booked an exit seat (I am 6’4”) but on checking in was told that I would have to pay extra for this. It was only £30, so I thought well I did not argue over that. Paid it and was given seat 25B (Boeing 787). When I boarded I noticed a dark stain on the carpet in the aisle in front of me. Being a nosey person I bent down touched it and it smelt like hydraulic fluid. I mentioned it to the Cabin Crew. A member photographed it and said it would be dealt with. The flight proceeded to Amman where we got off the plane for a 1.5 hour stay. No real issues – was shown to the Petra Lounge, very friendly and good standard of food and refreshments. Embarked for Bangkok, same aircraft, same stain – a little bigger now – asked new crew what it was – told that the cleaner had spilt some fluid and not to worry. I wasn’t placed in exit seat but after speaking with cabin crew and showing receipt I was moved back to 25. We arrived in Bangkok on time. Inflight entertainment was pretty naff and it wouldn’t have hurt for the cabin crew to crack a smile occasionally either. Return flight Check in – again told I had to pay for exit seat but not £30 - this time over £80 which they insisted in cash and were very reluctant to give a receipt. I paid it as I was too tired to argue. It was the same Dreamliner I had travelled out on, this time with a huge stain on the carpet. Cabin Crew said that engineers had been told but that the it wouldn’t be looked at until next service! Again poor catering and inflight service but landed safely in Jordan. Led to Petra Lounge where the staff had changed. Good food and drinks but you couldn’t relax as there was someone hovering over you all the time asking if you wanted more every 10 minutes and taking empty plates etc. I didn’t realise but they were clock watching too – as soon as two hours were up I was asked to leave! The flight was leaving from Gate 106 - went there and waited – no announcement but on the departure board changed to gate 116, OK an error I thought – went there. Waited till 30 minutes before departure nothing moving then an employee told us gate change to 224 (across to the other side of the Airport). Quite a rush but made it. Looked down to see an A321 crawling with engineers over the Starboard engine. Eventually we boarded and I was shown to an ordinary seat. I mentioned I had reserved and paid for an Exit seat but was told that I would have to pay in cash the Cabin Crew $100 if I wanted an exit seat. There were some free but I refused. A little later after take-off I witnessed some Arabic passengers just moving to the seats without any payment – corruption reigns it seems. ",Business,5.0,nan

No issue for me here. Talking to other passengers, they found out about the schedule change in the airport, when boarding. no email communication was sent to them. I tried to check in online for the Istanbul - Dubai flights, system error so do at the airport. Istanbul check in (as I was not able to do it online) spent over 1hr in the queue even though I got to the airport a good 2hrs before the flight. Royal Jordanian was the only airline in the airport that did not have a unique queue : each counter with it's own queue. 15 min before boarding time the lady at the counter I was queuing at announced that she would close the counter (as he had to go to the gate for boarding). She stayed after pressure from the angry passengers. I was checked in and out of passport control just in time for boarding! People who had their seats selected when buying the ticket, received different seating (initial selection was ignored) and even given seats in different rows for one leg of the flight. Boarding, no priority was given for passengers traveling with children. When leaving Amman, and just a few minutes after boarding was complete, the pilot announces that due to air traffic, we have to wait for 10 minutes - next PA announcement comes about 40 minutes later, informing us of technical issues with the plane that will be solved in another 10 minutes. Another 40 minutes (approx) pass without seeing a single crew member and without any announcement. Then one of the passengers comes from business class to inform a friend that we're changing planes. About 15 minutes later people are starting to get their luggage and leave the aircraft. The seatbelt sign was still on, nobody announced officially what was going on. We spent over 1.5 hrs in a hot plane without even being offered water, only misleading information, if any. In the terminal, again no PA announcements, only one employee informing the passengers in Arabic that in about half hour we would be given the take-off time. I had to ask for translation. In the end we boarded the same plane and we took off without so much as a 'sorry for the inconvenience' from Royal Jordanian Airlines staff and we landed in Istanbul with a 3hr delay (more than the duration of the flight). Inflight entertainment had a decent number of new movies on 2 of the 4 flights - there was some issue with the system and it either had to be restarted (takes about 20 min) or it was turned on late.

Transit in Amman is a joke, very chaotic and very rude Security Staff, I had goods confiscated from me, (which are not prohibited) - when I questioned them they became rude and aggressive. I am sure the goods were then shared out between them as a bonus! Check-in staff at LHR were very good, at Bangkok they were rude. As said many of the Cabin crew are surly and non smiling but some are. Whenever I pressed the call button for a drink etc they always came and I did not have to wait. My only criticism of Ground and Cabin crew (excl LHR) is that during the boarding of flights they do not board by Seat row, it gets very chaotic and the Cabin crew do not act to make the process smoother. On my Amman-LHR flight, many passengers were walking around the cabin asking other passengers to swap seats - this lead to a delay. You can pre-book your seat on RJ website in advance, so do that to ensure your party sit together. To pre-book just go to Manage booking - enter your reference number and enter few bits of extra info and then you can to it.

Turkish Airlines 773 next to us in a small boarding area so passengers were getting confused which line to get in.

Meals served from a cart so it really makes you feel special and like the old days of flying. You can have as much food as you want, served with a smile. AVOD was ok - this is where RJ disappoints. Not a lot of selection for movies or TV shows. If they add to this the product will be flawless. Lay-flat bed allowed for 6 hours of sleep which was great. Nice pre-arrival meal served and survey forms passed out. Our main attendant helped my mom learn some Arabic and was so friendly - taking pics for us together.

Living in Amman I often have no other choice but to fly with Royal Jordanian. An experience that I mostly regret because of the unacceptable inflight smoking practices. I have very little else to remark about Royal Jordanian which I consider a reliable and responsible carrier, other than the smoking practices. As a non-smoker I am particular sensitive to the unpleasant smell of cigarettes. Even worse when I am trapped on an RJ flight, like in my most recent flight experience RJ610, 17/04/2016 from Amman to Dubai. It is sad that passengers are advised by law to adhere to the strictly enforced non smoking rules - except the ignorance of the flight deck, where officers allow themselves to rise above international regulations. Fact is that smoking is not permitted in the cabin and lavatories. If I discount the presence of an unknown smoking passenger hidden in an overhead compartment, the only two remaining options are: an air freshener with distinct cigarette scent or a quick cigarette behind the cockpit door? I would love to know what the Airline Regulations and Standard Operating Procedures regarding smoking at the Cockpit are?",Business,3.0,nan

The IFE is touch-screen with hi-def screens but average offering of international movies/TV programs. Software: The first segment from AMM to BKK were staffed by Jordanian crew, the crew proactively go around the cabin and greeted each passengers by name, they were very attentive and very polite. Upon boarding, the crew offered each passenger a small cup of Arabic Coffee as a pre-departure drink. BKK to HKG was staffed by Thai crew led by a Jordanian purser. The crew on this leg does not appear they want to be there at all. During meal service, I was told that my first choice of meal (Curry) was not available despite there were only six passengers in the business class cabin of which one was the flight engineer, one was the security guard, two were travel agents traveling on industry discounted tickets and I was one of only two who were fare paying passengers. Instead of offering the meal choices to the fare paying passengers first, the crew decided that the flight engineer and security guard were more important as they were served the curry. Asked to speak to the purser and he gave me an excuse that the meal choices were first come first serve. Apparently seat 1A was not close enough for the crew to ask first. I was also told by the purser that oneworld Emerald status does not mean anything to their airline and that he does not care if passengers bring their businesses elsewhere.

Food was decent but felt throughout all flights that cabin crew while pleasant enough were not very proactive on drinks, coffee etc. In fact the male crew just seemed to leave all the work to the female crew who seemed rather over-worked. Also 2 of the 3 pilots on the final leg from AMM-LHR spent most of the flight occupied in the lie-flat seats while leaving the control to a FO.

I regularly travel on British Airways, and the RJ staff were equal or better than BA. The food was fine, but you don't travel economy and expect gourmet food. I think my only major issue with RJ is that on long flights such as the ones we took, it wouldn't kill them to give out free alcoholic drinks. Our tickets were well over £500 each, and a couple of glasses of wine surely wouldn't have broken the bank! Fortunately I read that they charged for drinks before leaving, so I bought a bottle of wine for the flight in duty free at Heathrow - make sure you get one with a screw top! The flights were all slightly late leaving, but not by much - we were late leaving Heathrow and Hong Kong due to airport congestion. The planes were fine, the A330 fairly new I think and the 787 very new, and feels spacious inside, with a seemingly taller ceiling. Flying to Hong Kong via Amman made it a long journey, about 18 hours going and over 24 coming home, due to a 6 hour stop in Amman, but there are many worse airports to spend a few hours in than Amman - try Addis Ababa or Nairobi.  Amman airport is modern, spacious, airy and  clean with has good loo's etc. There are several bars and cafe's, McDonalds etc and good (and cheap) duty free shops.

Later I went to Royal Jordanian office to report the loss. All details were taken but so far (7 days later) there has been no sight of my luggage.

I used my moist towelette to clean the greasy film from other people off of the window but it gets better. It smelt as if the cabin crew chief or the pilot was smoking cigarettes.

We lost our luggage on our way to vacation in Tel Aviv and had to purchase new clothes and stuff. Our luggage was returned day 3 of our vacation out of 10. They have not reimbursed for anything. Upon questions, they keep giving me email addresses and I don't get any responses whatsoever. Thank God we had travel insurance and i got a reimbursement from them because Royal Jordanian still hasn't responded to anything yet! I guess they want to delay responding and hope we give up? Then on our way back we had a stay in Queen Alia airport and we were expecting the airport to provide us any accommodation. We had to pay for our own hotel because they said there was another the next day. Of course, they did not realize that we had to check out of our hotel the previous and in any case when we booked our flight, the auto system is the one who prompted that for us. Ridiculous. The aircrafts were new and the food was good though. Al though, the crew is not particularly friendly. This will be my last time flying them.",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

Royal Jordanian offered a competitive price as well as an attractive baggage policy of 2x23kg for economy class, which is more than the main competitor.

Usually they ask if I prefer an aisle or window seat but they just book without asking now. Most of the time the staff are unfriendly. The food is always bad. I've been flying with RJ for 25 years. They used to be good - always giving a bag with a tooth brush etc, this is now only for business. Alcohol used to be free now it's not, and last but not least the entertainment system has the worst screens and worst movies - especially the old ones. If there was another direct flight to my destinations I'll always take it over RJ.

Boeing 787,Business Class,2.0,November 2016,3.0,2.0,2.0,no,CDG to BKK via AMM,4.0," |  Second in the queue in business class check-in line, there was an issue with the pax in front of me. He was on his phone trying to sort something, the agent on hers, for 10 minutes - nothing resolved. I later saw this pax in Y on board so don’t know if he was only in the line due to OW status. At last, an agent in the Y class line said to her colleague “Will I take him?” – meaning me – and her colleague replied “Up to you.” I was being checked in and asked which lounge I used at CDG. “Dunno” she said. She asked another agent - “I’ve no idea."" It was so rude / bad I just laughed. I think they thought I couldn’t speak French. When I got to the AA lounge (I'd checked before which one to use) the agent said “This is not where you’re supposed to be.” When I challenged this it was only resolved when a colleague came over to him and explained OW Sapphire rules to him. A sign saying RJ pax could use the lounge was on the desk in front of him. Flight to AMM was OK-ish, but no proactive service from the crew. Meal was served and cleared away as soon as they could manage it – twice, not-finished drinks taken from my table – the crew disappeared behind curtain for the rest of flight. The food was mediocre, the in-flight entertainment limited and uninspiring. The AMM lounge a dump. Poor food, nasty toilets, birds flying inside, no one to let you in shower room. Cannot imagine its state if toilets anything to go by. Security staff at AMM incredibly rude and aggressive. “Where you go?” barked, is really not good enough. Flight to BKK full. Most pax in business class appeared to be Royal Jordanian staff, behaving as though on a company outing. As we taxied two were standing in the aisles, using their phones, the woman beside me (no ideas who she was, young and pretty, very popular, both captains came out to chat to her) went into the cockpit for take-off and landing and I did not feel the FAs had proper control of the cabin. Breakfast consisted of 3 types of pastry with a bread roll on the side. No nuts with the welcome drink, no bottle of water, surely the minimum in business class. It was available if you asked for it, but you had to ask. The bar area onboard was used for a flight attendant to store her suitcase. Flights back were more of the same. The flight from BKK only better as only 9 pax in business class. In the middle of the night I pressed the bell to ask for some sparkling water. It took the flight attendant 5 minutes to come and offer to “help”. It’s not as if she was busy. I got what I asked for to the letter, a glass with water in it. No ice, no lemon, no offer of anything to go with it. Someone needs to tell Royal Jordanian that training their staff to snarl “Enjoy” at English speaking passengers whilst slamming a glass on to the tray and high-tailing it back behind the curtain before any more awkward questions can be asked does not make a premium passenger feel valued. The volume on the passenger announcements on the A321 to CDG was so loud that when the pilot made an announcement mid-flight the dozing man in front of me almost leapt out of his skin. I’ve learned my lesson. I thought as a One World airline it would be roughly on a par with other carriers in the alliance, if not necessarily as good. The ticket cost about £200 less then Qatar Airways and it allowed me to try a new aircraft type for me (the Boeing 787). However I cannot recommend the airline at all. I would sooner not fly than use them again. My main feeling is one of having been cheated out of my money.",Business,2.0,nan

The check-in agents at Vienna were very nice and helpful. The boarding process was efficient and the flight left on-time and arrived early. The meal consisted of three options (meat, chicken and fish). I opted for the chicken option (chicken with mustard) and it was good. The flight attendants were all very nice and attentive.

During all complaints and claims Royal Jordanian hides behind story that their flight are actually carried out by subsidiary Royal Wings and that their Customer Service Plan not applies. On the way the second leg flight from Amman was changed to early morning forcing first leg in day before forcing transit night over in Amman. No hotel or any other compensation was made. On arrival in Sharm El Sheikh baggage (of quite a group) was not delivered. Baggage is not delivered but needs to be collected by individual with promise that costs made are refunded. Royal Jordanian did not provide details for tracking, baggage was ready for collection only 60 hours after arrival. Costs made are not refunded. On return flight was delayed from 13:45 via 17:30 without informing passengers (many people complaint). Finally flight was delayed to 20:00 causing as to miss Royal Jordanian connection in Amman. Flight was rebooked to night flight departing Amman 2:50am with 5 hours delay waiting where Royal Jordanian did not provide access to lounge and claimed not to be responsible.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

I arrived at Amman Airport around 12:00 am and I preferred to get into Amman to stay in any hotel nearest the Airport after the officer told me I am not entitled to a hotel. I came back in the following early morning to catch my flight which was supposed to take off at 12:15pm. Unfortunately, I noticed on the flights screen that my flight will be delayed upto more than 3 hours. I tried to ask any officer there but no response. On my way to the gate where I should take my delayed flight, I found many people are gathering in the front of the company's office waiting for the boss with authority to address their concerns about their flight to Doha which is delayed for 8 hours more.  I was surprised from the response that has also has no authority to address their concerns or even make available some kind of comfort to such people, noting that some of them were on business class, and he will communicate with the top management in this respect. The conclusion is such a company doesn't have any kind of policy or procedure exposed to its employees or passengers. The best answer I used to hear is 'I do not know'.",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

I was then very disappointed to get in a plane of Ukranian Airlines with business seats like economy seats - the same size and same space between seats as they look like. A low quality cold food served as lunch. It's not acceptable to charge money for business class and fly people with economy seats and level.

In fact, this is the the third time in a row my Royal Jordanian flight has been delayed (within the space of two months). In fact, the last flight was not only delayed, it was replaced entirely with a Ukrainian airlines flight and crew and a cabin so dated it took me back to my childhood. On the last two delayed flights we were served some kind of salami derivative matter between bread, and a single biscuit. No choices. No entertainment either. I wonder what awaits us this time and when it will be. This is not a cheap flight. A return to Istanbul (2.5 hours) Usually costs me between 450-600 GBP.

The food was great, inflight entertainment easy to navigate, the noise-cancelling headset fantastic. The Bangkok technical stop is a bit comical as ground staff feverishly scrub and vacuum the cabin while you are in your seat, but it was done with good humour. The new Amman terminal and lounge are grand, and can compete with the best of them. Before landing, the crew in my section came to say ""It was very nice to have you on this flight"".

I send this complaint both to the customer service of Royal Jordanian Airlines as well as through a facebook message on their facebook account half a year ago. I received an e-mail that I could expect a response within 10 working days, but haven't had a reaction to my complaint even after sending 8 messages in the last 6 months. Truly dissapointed in this airline of which I expected good service. On the 2nd of June I was supposed to have a direct flight from Amsterdam to Amman. I choose this flight, because it was a direct flight and was willing to pay €200,- more for a direct flight compared to the flight going through Kiev. Exactly a week before I got a message from the travel agent I booked through saying: ""For your information, Royal Jordanian has changed the departure date to the 3rd of June. Unfortunately, schedule changes occur quite frequently in air travel, and when they do, we offer you the airline’s most favorable alternative. We ask you to reply to this email and let us know if you would like to accept the new itinerary. If we have not heard from you before the 31st of May, we can no longer assist you with the change. In this case, we advise you to check-in in due time for the airline staff to assist you with the change, as your current ticket is no longer valid for travel due to the change."" After calling the airline and telling about this, I was able to change and keep the flight on the 2nd and fly through Vienna instead, to still arrive on the same day (the 3rd of June my tour was starting). They told me to write a complaint and so here it is, two weeks after I have returned from the beautiful country Jordan. I would like to see compensation of your airline for the change of flight. I understand that it saves you a lot of money, but this goes at the expense of the quality of your customers travels. If I would have known beforehand that I would've had a transfer, I would've booked through Ukraine International Airlines. It is highly inappropriate to cancel a flight with just one week notice and without any form of compensation. This doesn't suit the reputation your airline has.

The flight is a duration of 3 hours+, and a sandwich is not enough for such a flight duration and does not at all represent the hospitality Jordan and Jordanians are proud of, not to mention that it is far less than what competitors offer.
