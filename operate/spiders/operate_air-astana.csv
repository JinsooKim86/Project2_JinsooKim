A320/B769,Business Class,4.0,July 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,St Petersburg to Bangkok via Almaty,4.0," |  St Petersburg to Bangkok via Almaty. There has been significant improvements to this airline in the fourteen years since I first flew. It was a day service between St Petersburg and Almaty on a clean A320. Seats were comfortable, spacious and with a reasonable recline. Food was good and well presented. In flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection. Cabin service was a little hit and miss - I asked for wine with my meal and by the time I realised that it had been forgotten I had finished and did not ask for it. The cabin crew spoke reasonable/good English but only spoke to me in Russian because initially I had spoken to them in Russian. The check in in St Petersburg was fast, efficient and in English. They had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane. The flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in Almaty. The Almaty - Bangkok sector was a night flight on a new Dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 2.30 am. Check in in Almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers. (It would have been faster to use the economy check in counter)! Food was good and the seat/bed was comfortable and there was quite a selection of in flight entertainment. I was identified as a foreigner and so spoken to in good English. The plane left and arrived on time and again my luggage was amongst the first off the plane.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Everything about the flight was perfect, quick check-in, boarding, quality of special meal, reservation of seats and comfort, kids amenities, entertainment system, cleanness of cabin. I would only recommend to provide wifi access but cabin crew informed me that internet is available on some flights. Since I flew with my daughter of 4 years old I had things to do and hadn’t had a chance to enjoy internet anyway. Crew is very positive and i have been individually welcomed as a Silver member.

A320,Economy Class,3.0,June 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,no,Dushanbe to Astana via Almaty,3.0," | Air Astana has practically a monopoly in the Central Asian region where I live and work and they don’t hesitate to remind the customer of that. I have travelled approximately 75-100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from Moscow for both myself and my fiance. You’d think this sort of ‘loyalty’ (is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options?) would earn me a little more respect than what I received today, but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports, all I seem to get is ignorance and hostility. Customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in Central Asia in my experience so I’m long past expecting “service with a smile.” I was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of Dushabe. Apparently Air Astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing. These fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit (10kg for Nomad Club Silver members) when the standard tickets allow for 20kg (30kg) respectively. I unknowingly booked this fare through a third-party website where there was no indication that this wasn’t a standard fare ticket. As I said, the ticket price wasn’t particularly cheap. I expect this sort of thing from FlyDubai or Wizz Air but from a national flagship airline? Seriously? Of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a government-backed monopoly? And about the Nomad Club, it’s quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is. Almaty Airport, the airline’s hub, is a glorified bus station which is insanely overcrowded, overpriced, and boring. On a positive note, the air crew staff are polite, if not exceedingly. Not the worst but not the best.",Business,2.0,nan

Air Astana has set and manages to maintain exceptional high standards of service. Al the cabin crew appear to have fundamental English skills. The new uniform is fresh and professional. The safety video has been improved and is actually pleasant to watch even after many flights in a short time frame. The new aircraft have screens on the backs of the seats and passengers can select their entertainment. The new earphones are great and I always keep the set. The passenger pack is in a useful bag and the products inside are good but I miss the mini-biro pen. The food and beverages are of good quality with a proper cutlery. I have found the cabin crew to be attentive and responsive to my needs. Depending on the airport I have boarded check-in staff may not have the same consistency but my recent check in at Atyrau was good (this is not usually a friendly airport though there are some exceptional individuals working there). I would say without fear of reproach that Air Astana is my preferred airline of choice.,Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Still need to get personal TV screens on all seats, on all flights. The ""watching shows/films on my own personal device"" is a cheap way out, I definitely do not like this option.

Unfortunately after 1h they switched on the lights and served some food. I tried to continue my sleep. As we were delayed and as I didn't have an absolute proper Visa it took me a while for immigration. Searching my bag was easy even I was late and the belts already stopped. Air Astana had some helpful staff there and got my Bag from the luggage room in a minute. Finally I didn't catch my connecting flight. But the rebooking to the next Astana-Almaty flight worked without problems on this Airport. On this flight they served breakfast that was OK. ALA Airport is hell. Staff (even Air Astana check- in) is nearly not speaking English and to get to the domestic check-in you have to have a print out of your ticket as they don't know what an e-ticket is. Staff in-flight was always kind and helpful and had a good English.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,I flew to Bangkok from Almaty December 2009. We had trouble at the beginning. Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that. Very unprofessional attitude. Later on cabin crew were helpful and friendly food was OK good classical music channel to listen airplane relatively new clean very small legroom though for a tall guy.,nan,4.0,nan

They have launched a web check-in service but do not have a terminal to print the boarding pass at the airport. I find it rather uncomfortable due to the fact that you can't often find a printer when traveling on business trips. On my last trip I've checked-in online printed my boarding pass but I have learned that my seat doesn't exist because they've changed the plane. I've found it out only when I was onboard.

The onboard service was adequate for a medium haul economy class flight. No complaints except for the incredible rise of prices on Air Astana International flights.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"The comments about this airline mostly relate to their international flights and I understand that they offer a good service there. It's a different story on their internal and regional flights. I booked on-line for the short hop return from Bishkek to Almaty. It seemed like a good idea at the time but proved to be a disaster. The airline changed their schedule without informing me their records apparently said that they had ""tried to contact me"" - I'm not even sure how. I turned up at the airport and waited for 5 hours assuming that it had simply been delayed for that time only to find out that they had moved me not to that flight but to one 20 hours earlier. The Air Astana agent acted as though he hadn't seen an e-ticket before claimed I hadn't paid for the outward journey or maybe hadn't paid at all - really any excuse to not allow me onto the plane. I had no alternative but to go back to Bishkek and travel overland the next day - all at my own expense of course. The return flight had been similarly moved but a local agent helped me out to properly arrange that one and got a refund for the outward journey. I complained to Air Astana as my non-arrival had seriously thrown out the plans of my hosts in Almaty not just mine. No answer. I complained again only to receive a fob off reply that they regretted this but they weren't going to do anything further about it and hoped that I would fly with them again: I doubt that very much. I've given 1 rather than 0 as the Almaty to Bishkek ""return"" flight itself wasn't bad.

Great service great food an interior decor and outside livery that have a quality design. Air Astana customers include many oil industry personnel who have flown often worldwide and positive comments are often noticeable among passengers. Agree with a previous comment about FAs who are very pleasant.

However the Business class lounge is severely lacking in facilities in Almaty. Not even free drinks. In Atyrau there are no Business class facilities at all! Terminal facilities generally in Atyrau are severely lacking. Its not possible to get any refreshments in any way shape or form once you are in the departure lounge. Thankfully if you are just transiting through Atyrau to Almaty or vice versa you're not in there long.

Air Astana is the best airline in Kazakhstan in terms of comfort and service. Luckily I have not had major delays and those which I had were usually weather related.

The flat bed seats were brilliant for an overnight flight as was the meal drinks selection and level of customer service. A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully. There was certainly more legroom available than on other airlines I have flown into and out of Almaty and Kazakhstan itself. The meal was a lovely Thai chicken curry.

Food and service was very good. After the debacle of the previous flight the agent in KL met me at the gate to again apologise. He had been very helpful previously. I also received an e-mail from the company's senior operations manager who went to lengths to apologise and explain. I do feel this is more than most airlines would do to follow up. This does give confidence that the airline is focussed on continuous improvement. The entertainment unit also had more movies loaded and this kept me fully occupied and well entertained for the flight. However suffice to say that the experience on the return journey was a good one with very good service and perfectly on time with the plane unloading from an air bridge on arrival making unloading of the 767 much more efficient.,nan,4.0,nan

At 4.30am we were asked to leave the plane and return to the terminal where we were informed that the flight was cancelled and the next one would be in 2 days. Ground staff rude and incompetent.

The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.,nan,5.0,nan

I think that they are the best airline in the Russian speaking world. My flights left and landed almost on time although we sat in the plane for an extended period of time in Ho Chi Min city and were not allowed off it. The food was good included the shortish flights between Almaty and Astana. The entertainment on the two long haul sectors was a bit limited. Cabin crew spoke quite good English - even on the internal sectors. Seats and legroom quite comfortable though the seats do not go horizontal on the long sectors.

I said I had and Aeroflot had already transferred it to Air Astana as they told me so. He said my luggage was not with the flight according to their record. He also went out to see if my luggage was at claim lounge. He couldn't find mine so took me to report lost baggage. 15 mins after reporting the loss I was waiting for my next flight in departure lounge. My luggage was found at SVO airport.

Offered tickets on additional flight on the same day but it was late to get on the connecting flight in Almaty. After 4 hours told that the additional flight was delayed. At 11pm it was announced that the flight was cancelled so we attempted to rebook. Told the next available flight was in 2 days which was unacceptable and we bought tickets with another airline. The next day we flew to Almaty with another airline and got on our connecting flight to Bangkok.

A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline.,nan,4.0,nan

The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea. You didn't have a huge choice of movies but most of the recent blockbuster releases were there along with some international movies.

Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us.

From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good.

The inflight entertainment is current and changes frequently.

Quite a lot of confusion at FRA last time when the plane was 90% filled with a single group of Chinese travelling to Urumqi. Don't take a window seat in winter - the a/c isn't up to it and there's an arctic draft every time.

During the past the service has been getting better and better. Some irritants during flights such as flight attendants bumping in to your elbows (aisle seats) or waking you up for meals have disappeared. Meals have got better. The old 757 interiors are being renovated. Long flights know offer personal entertainment systems for each person in Economy. All the ticket prices have been reasonable though it is hard to build up miles with Air Astana's Nomad Club. That is one complaint I have with Air Astana. With most airlines I would have gotten free upgrades by now. Many of Air Astana's low fares exclude you from accumulating frequent flier miles. I hope this changes in the future. Overall I say Air Astana is a good carrier to choose nowadays.,nan,4.0,nan

The overnight flight from Almaty to Bangkok took off at around 1 am. About two hours into the flight a full meal was served. Before landing in Bangkok at around 8.45 a.m. no breakfast was served. For a flight like this suggest that two light meals be served – one shortly after take-off and breakfast before landing. Overall it was a pleasant experience flying with Air Astana.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Heathrow to Almaty return via Astana in Business Class. This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus! Overall we enjoyed our experience with Air Astana perhaps more so than we were expecting and given that they are often keenly priced I would recommend them.,nan,5.0,nan

Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules. The flight from Moscow was delayed for about an hour because of a technical problem. We were promptly advised by the crew of nature of the problem and the likely time needed to fix it.,nan,4.0,nan

I also read that you can get a refund or exchange the ticket if you miss the flight! On the flight the staff weren't petty  and didn't complain when I changed seats and laid across them for a full five hours sleep. Unfortunately the connection flight couldn't leave because the weather outside was so windy and snowy, so i spent a night in Astana, Kazakhstan, in a free and clean hotel with a bus stop right outside of it that very regularly goes directly to the airport for just £0.20. I then caught a flight to Paris the next day on a very modern plane, and from there on Air France to London, which was arranged without cost by Air Astana. Staff generally spoke very good english in Astana, and the office is within the small airport - so there's always someone available for help. When the flight was cancelled due to bad weather in Astana, there was very little information going around as to what would happen next. A simple series of messages would really have put me at ease, as I was quite stressed at the time. But things did turn out completely fine, to my reassuring surprise. The other problem was when I caught the flight from Paris to London, my baggage had not been put on the same flight! To be fair, this may not have been Air Astana fault, as the baggage label definitely listed both Paris and London airports. The bag was put on an Air France flight the next morning and delivered to where I live in about 2 days. I also had a tracking code that I could use to check where the bag was at any time.

Each flight departed and landed on time. Cabin crew were friendly and had reasonable English (there has been a marked improvement in the 10 years that I have been flying with Air Astana). On the flight to Almaty lunch was served and on the flight to Bangkok a very late dinner was served. With a 1.00 am departure for Bangkok the Airline would be much better served by giving a light supper soon after take off (or have a decent meal available in their lounge) and then having breakfast about one hour before landing. The food was well presented and portion size was adequate. The wines were OK. On the Tbilisi - Almaty sector they offered an IPAD but did not take advantage as I had my own entertainment. My luggage did not get any priority and was one of the last bags unloaded from the plane. From Almaty to Bangkok my luggage did get priority and was off the plane soon after I arrived at the carousel. Overall a pleasant experience without any unpleasant incidents.,Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I was part of a business trip that was promoting tourism in Thailand. The best flight was ALA-BKK, since they had AVOD on the seat backs - the aircraft don't have AVOD. The food was average, with the exception of BKK-TSE, which gave me a very good breakfast. Most flights, check-in is average, although some employees are more enthusiastic than others, and once onboard the flight, there is a flight attendant handing out candy. Boarding process could've been more efficient. ALA-TAS and back used an Embraer plane, and the seat is the most horrible seat I have sat in and recline is half of what you get on an A320. The flights are mostly uneventful. Overall, I would pay for the upgrade to business class next time, but if I were forced to sit in coach, I wouldn't mind.",Business,5.0,nan

Having heard good things about Turkish Airlines we chose the Tashkent-Almaty-Bishkek-UB option with the last leg on Turkish. Air Astana responded to every email of mine within minutes and while we were to have an overnight layover in Astana in the original plan with a hotel paid by us, Air Astana put us up in a new Bishkek hotel with food and transport to and from the airport. The flights themselves were on time, had more then average legroom, newer planes, good food and friendly attendants. Turkish Airlines was the low point of the three legs, being one hour late arriving from Istanbul, but it did complete our necessary connection.

This flight was departing almost 7 hours later, at 5:50 am. However, when I approached the counter I found out the flight was already delayed to 19:00 pm. 13 hours delay! Ridiculous. And they let me buy the ticket from their own webpage. Most of the passengers accepted hotel and waiting, but ten of us couldn't wait. I explained to them about my connecting flight to Valencia and I accepted any possible route which would take me to Frankfurt on time or any part of Spain but they denied this option for four hours, insisting on my delayed flight with them as my only option (13h waiting in Bangkok airport plus 14h in Astana). Missing my connection to Valencia and being late for work. I even got the chance to talk to someone from management on the phone, but she would only say ""I'm sorry"". Only good part was their ground staff, which suffered this situation exemplary even though they were lacking the power to do something. Finally I accepted the refund of my ticket, which they signed, and booked a flight with another airline, spending a big amount of money to get to Madrid. After this, I was expecting the refund of the ticket, but they only offer me 3.930THB, which is not even a 1/4 of the amount I paid for the ticket. I have never in my life dealt with a despicable airline such as Air Astana. It makes me feel sad because they have really good staff onboard but, recommended? Of course not.

I flew many times with them and never had problems until two days ago when they let me down real bad. When in the beginning of January they started offering promotion flights to several destination in March for their loyalty card holders, me and my sister decided to take advantage of it and planned our trip to Paris during Nauryz (3 day National holiday in Kazakhstan) in advance. However, on Monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 21.03 to 23.03 due to ""Spring flight schedule corrections"", thus completely eliminating any chance of using these Holidays for a trip. These types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed BEFORE offering promotions on the dates. Upon contacting their CS They declined to change flights or to compensate internal tickets. I'm deeply disappointed however, considering their near monopoly status in Kazakhstan i fear i cannot boycott them that easily.
