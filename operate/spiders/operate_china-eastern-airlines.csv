Unfortunately, I have to regularly fly with this airline so I became a member of the Eastern Miles Club in order that I could accrue some points. I didn’t want the points so much as recognition for the flights. Because I am a westerner, I am almost always get placed up the back of the plane with the other westerners. So, I thought, if they recognise me after all these flights, I might move to the front. For the last 3 months, I have had a new passport (a renewal). We are not allowed to update our accounts with the passport number, we need to call the hotline. I called the hotline and they told me helpfully to email the details to their help desk. I emailed the help desk and they told me I need to call the hotline. And so it goes, back and forth, neither party willing to do anything at all beyond what they want to do or need to do. After 7 emails, with the same request, I am frustrated and stuck. They wont upgrade the passport number and they wont recognise the points. I cant “start again” because that would mean buying a new mobile phone number. When flying with them, could someone please advise the airline that airline issued earphones plugged into their entertainment system, does not affect flight controls. With religious fervor, literally 30 -40 mins before we land, everything is cleared and closed. No phones, no headphones, no entertainment, no kindles - nothing. Sit still and read Chinese Duty Free magazines. Ground staff at check in - very business like, process bound and perfunctory. They remind me every time, what I am about to face over the next few hours. Generally speaking, I have found cabin staff good. They just don’t enforce the rules, particularly as it relates to other passengers playing videos on high volume while we are taking off! I ended up fixing the problem myself. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone.",Business,2.0,nan

They didnt apologise, didnt give me any explanation, didn't try to put me in another flight, staff were extremely rude and I had to ask to have an hotel booked and paid by them. (I went to see 3 different desks and all of them acted the same). The hotel they took me was in the middle of nowhere, dirty and no-one could speak English.

It is very annoying that they don’t have a menu for each passenger to read, they just go to your seat and show you the menu and you don’t even have time to think because there’s only 2 choices! So after the take off i slept and missed the dinner but when i woke up I asked them what’s for dinner and they gave me 2 choices. I got the chicken but it was so bad like it was a bit cold and they did not even bother to heat it up. In the menu there were lists of dessert like ice cream so I asked them if they have any and they just laugh and said “oh no ice cream”. They don’t have some chips but they have some left over chocolates. The entertainment system has very limited choices. I mean if you will spend for business class maybe just go for a better airlines and you’ll pay the same amount of money and will surely get what you’re paying for. My luggage was supposed to be part of the priority ones but it came out very late! Also the flight from Shanghai to Cebu was also very disappointing as they dont have dinner and the flight attendant told me it is because it is only a 3 hour and 50 minutes flight.

I called the airline right away, but their customer service cant speak enough English that the only thing they told me was “no information” 5 times. Every week i kept calling until a manager told me that my Shanghai to Manila flight was cancelled and its either they rebook my ticket or refund. But according to reviews, they dont really get the refund so i just asked for a rebook. I arrived in Shanghai in 7pm and the flight they book me going to Manila was the next day 6:55pm. I didnt argue and just accept the flight without any compensation, free hotel. I waited in the airport for almost a day without social media. After I arrived in shanghai, i didn't know that i have to get out and get a 24 hr transit since my flight will be the next day.

I bought my tickets to 2 weeks before the trip. It was about at least SGD500 cheaper than Korea Air, Asiana and SQ during cherry blossom season in Korea. Noting that this flight was cheaper than Scoot (budget airline). This was my first flight with this airline and I was prepared for the worst and hoping that I am safe and my luggage were in the right place. Turns out that the flight wasn't too bad. Service was nice, food and drinks were ok.  I have a 2hr stop over in Shanghai and everything was on time. The seats were clean. Other customers may not give you the most pleasant experience (a lot of noisy tour groups) but that is not within airline's control. They gave out pillows if you need. Blankets can be taken off plane if you want. One thing I dont like about this airline is their lack of control on how many cabin luggages a customer can bring in. So many customers brought 2 to 3 big bags that cannot even fit in cabin and a lot of customers were not able to use the cabin due to these greedy customers. It will be dangerous if this plane were to get any accident if you need to evacuate but you will probably get jammed along the way because too many luggage blocking the path.

Our flight on China Eastern resulted from a delay in our original Qantas flight (delayed 8 hours) and we were able to obtain this alternative, direct flight instead. Check in was pain free. Boarding was efficient and everyone on was on board in time for our scheduled departure time. The flight pulled out on time, but it did take about 20 minuts before we were airborne (busy time at Shanghai Pudong). Staff were relatively friendly and most spoke some English. The aircraft looked new and clean. A pillow and sealed blanket provided. The leg room was quite good for economy. In flight entertainment pretty good, except for the inflight advertising that occurred following completion of each program. Good screen size.  The inflight meal services was memorable (awful). The food would have to be the worst I have encountered on any airline & air staff seem to go about it all about face. The drink cart rolled out first, but before it arrived at our aisle, a hot meal was handed out. On completion of the meal, we were offered a drink. Yes please, I will have a red wine. Given about one centimetre of wine, being the end of the bottle. I did ask for a bit more (the stewardess looked shocked, but I did get another couple of centimetres). The wine was quite good. After all this, they came around and asked us if we wanted a bread roll. desert, some cut up water melon. Tea or coffee not offered. It was a bit like a Chinese Fawlty Towers in the air. I did notice a couple of (presumably) Chinese passengers eating food they had brought on board with them. Obviously they were aware of what the meal service was like. Breakfast was equally as bad as the dinner service. We arrived in Melbourne about 30 minutes ahead of the scheduled arrival time.

I took a flight for Christmas, they suddenly changed the departing time, so I tried to contact them on the phone and by email several times but never got any reply. I decided to give them a second chance. This time I had to fly from Seoul to Singapore transfer in Shanghai. My first flight took off 3 hours late (of course they didn't warn us in advance so I enjoyed waking up early to then wait doing nothing in the airport for 3 hours), and I was supposed to have only 2 hours to transfer, so I thought I'd miss the second flight. Thankfully, they told me the second flight was still there when I arrived. I hurried up only to find it was delayed for 3 hours too. I then got in the plane, but it didn't take off. We waited 2 hours in there, with absolutely no explanation nor apologize. The only good news is they told me there would be free wifi in the plane once it takes off, but it turns out it never worked, half due to chinese laws banning facebook and many other sites and apps, and half due to the fact their wifi was shit anyway. At the end, we landed 5 hours late, therefore arriving at 3am, meaning there was no public transportation so I had to pay for an expensive taxi, and yet still received no explanation, no apologize and no compensation. To this day I still have no idea what happened. I contacted them, but of course they didn't reply. 100% will never ever use this company, again, even if they have $1 flights.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

Me and my daughter (16 years old) were given separate seat in 3 flights! My daughter was very nervous to be alone. I had to ask a lot of people to move around to accommodate ourselves! The airplanes are so cramp that you can not move at all. In a 13 hour flight the served a dinner and for another 10 hours not a single time they offer even a glass of water. The attendants don't show up when you request! They brought the dinner roll about 30 minutes after dinner serving. There is only one person serving with cart. Our return flight from Osaka to Shanghai was delayed 3 hours and we lost the next flight to LA. The most interesting part was that there not a single cancellation from other airline. When we got to PVG airport since we were late we were going around for 30 minutes until airplane stopped far and we were transfer by bus (cold at night). Since there were so many flight canceled or delayed it took us 3 hours to get a transfer for 24 hours later. Then took us another one hour to get a bus and go to so called hotel. OMG, motel is much better than that. Our flight landed at 9 PM and we got to bed at 2 AM. The next day out flight to LA was delayed again for 2 hours. This time they said they wait for transfers! I asked them why did not you wait for us yesterday. They said we only wait for 10 people or more! About 35 people came from Bangkok to PVG (trasnfer) to go to Los Angeles but their boarding pass was only till PVG and their luggage were stranded in Shanghai because they could not leave that terminal in airport to transfer them!!

Then right before the flight a manager of China Eastern approached us, showed photo of one of our bags and told that due to some issues they were not able to send it with our plane. He said that there was no problem and that the bag would be sent with the next plane. When we arrived to Moscow, another manager of China Eastern met us and confirmed, that everything was okay and the bag would be sent with next plane. Sounds good, right? But since then we didn't get not only our bag - we were not able to get any information from China Eastern! Shanghai hotline doesn't work, people in Russian office know nothing and can't get any information. Eventually they just stopped answering my phone! Even baggage claim service of Sheremetyevo airport can do nothing! They send requests and get no answer from Shanghai office of China Eastern! It's is utter disrespect to me as a customer and total lack of management skills. It's been 6 days since we arrived and I'm losing faith in ever getting my bag back. And to add cherry on top of this mess - due to lack of luggage tag I wasn't able to get insurance for lost luggage.

The guy at the baggage claim desk at the airport asked for my flying ticket and, while I was filling out the PIR, he took off my baggage receipts which (this I found out later on) were necessary to claim compensation for the delay. During this 15 days, I tried to call to their Shanghai base several times but nobody ever picks up the phone. After two weeks, I received a call from one of their representatives who told me they would send my bags to the airport, because they don't deliver to the customer's address. On top of that, there was no way to talk or complaint to this person because he didn't speak English, or any other language than Chinese. So, my baggage was lost more than 2 weeks, they provided no costumer service at all, and after all the inconveniences they caused, it is me who has to pay for the transport of my bags.

I had heard many horror stories about the Shanghai transfer process, and unfortunately, they became true. Be sure to leave enough time, at least two hours. Pudong Airport has very few gates and it seems that every plane uses a bus (even airlines like Korean Air use them). This adds about 15-20 minutes to getting to the terminal once you land. The transfer staff is very unorganized in stress, as many staff were calling for LA flights but completely ignoring anyone going to Bangkok. Tensions and tempers flared among passengers as everyone was trying to cut and get around slow people. Staff always says ""hurry, hurry, go go"" when there's actually not enough time. Our connection was missed because of this, and by the time we waited in line to get our new flight tickets, go through immigration and go upstairs we missed the last flight of the night. The system could be vastly improved. China Eastern did put is in a clean hotel (20 minutes from the airport by their shuttle bus), gave us a bowl of cup noodles at night (and some dumplings/soy milk in the AM). But the one thing they never did? Say sorry. The planes themselves were in clean condition, way better than I expected. Flight attendants were just ok. Nothing special, nowhere near as polite as Korean or Japanese airlines. Food was definitely subpar, about only 70% was edible on all our flights.

I  purchased a round-trip ticket from Seoul to Bangkok for my mother (cannot speak English with minimum tech ability to use a Smartphone) from China Eastern Airlines official Korean website. I also purchased the same Seoul to Bangkok, but only one way as I was going back to my work in UAE after Bangkok. My flight was 3 hours earlier than my mother's return flight. The ticket I purchased for my mother had 1 stopover each way: Seoul to ShangHai Pudong, ShangHai Pudong to Bangkok, returning Bangkok to Yantai and from their to Seoul.  However, on 30 Dec, when my mother wanted to check-in at the CE counter, the airline staff said that this flight goes from Bangkok to Shanghai Pudong to Yantai to Seoul, and two stopover within China is not permitted, showed a piece of paper regarding transit regulation within Mainland China, therefore boarding is not permitted. Suddenly, there was magically a new stopover at Shanghai Pudong. This makes the Shanghai to Yantai leg a domestic flight. Seven passengers including my mother was denied boarding. CE staff did not provide any assistance, closed the counter and left, leaving these passengers stranded in Bangkok Airport. None of the Korean passengers had good enough English language skill to dispute with the Airline, and nor CE spoke proper English. Disputing with them would not yield any positive results anyways since CE staff do not care at all about customer grief nor complaints. Since I had left already to Dubai, my mother was all by herself and had to seek help from two other kind Korean young men (also same ticket) to purchase another ticket using their Credit card from a different airline to go back to Korea (direct flight BKK-ICN from EastarJet). This practice is practically a scam, since this Shanghai stopover was not  shown during the website search, not shown in the receipt nor the itinerary email I received. Also the information that ""two stopovers within China is not allowed"" cannot be verified, and we don't know if this is true. My mother had to wait nearly another 24 hours at the airport as a result. If you cannot speak Chinese, forget about everything, even if they deny for no reason. This kind of practice should not be allowed. CE may look like an excellent budget airline: 30kg checked in Baggage, full in-flight meals, spacy seats. And you will save $300~600 per trip. But when it happens, it will happen to you, and you will be delayed and stranded with no options, no assistance, no staff to talk to and helpless.

They arranged my flight to be about 1+hours to make a transit in Shanghai and the point is I was told that my luggage cannot be direct pick up in Tokyo during check in, which means I had only 1+hours to go through the transit progress and luggage pick up.

The A330 from Paris to Shanghai was quite new, had a decent inflight entertainment system and the seats had a good pitch. A little minus for the service: flight attendants weren't that friendly and there was only one round of beer for the whole plane on the 11-hours flight from Paris to Shanghai. Furthermore, there is room for improvement concerning ground service and online check-in. Reserving seats was only possible via telephone, online check-in did not work at all. Probably the biggest minus was the ground personell in Shanghai - very little English skills and very rude. There is no ""western"" food on China Eastern flights, however almost all meals were tasty.

On the day of, the airport informed us that they gave away our seats on the connecting flight (originally we had our tickets booked to be in the same airport) and instead made us go to the other airport called Shanghai Airlines. The flight experience was pretty standard, but the aircraft arrived 1.5 hours late, which only gave us less than 1.5 hours to check out of China Eastern Airlines to Shanghai Airlines, which is about 1 hour apart. This caused us to miss our connecting flight and it also caused our return trip home to be cancelled. We purchased new tickets to go to Guangzhou and once arrived, we attempted to get the airport to re-book our flight home, but they stated that our current return flight home was still there and even gave us a confirmation print out, so we chose not to worry about it. However, on the day of, we were informed our flight was indeed cancelled and this caused us to buy new tickets for the flight home at the last minute prices which are much more expensive. When I contacted customer service for a refund the original tickets (I assumed we couldn't get it for the new ones purchased), they said that they were unable to refund those tickets, even though it was their fault we missed the flight You would think that because there was a flight delay, they would at least given us a partial refund, but there was no refund at all.

Then I was asked to send my suitcase key to TPE airport and that they will deliver it to PVG to open my suitcase! So I did and when they received it at TPE they told me that China Eastern staff refused to take my key to PVG with them, because the person who asked me for the key hadn't asked them before she asked me for my key! Then I was even asked to deal with this issue myself.  I refused all of it, meaning to destroy my suitcase and to go personally to PVG to retrieve it! Somehow they got my key to PVG and 4 days later I finally received my suitcase, obviously no threat was inside and all of my stuff was there, even though messed up. After this horrible experience I decided to complain to China Eastern only to find out that there is no email address to complain in China. I called their Taipei office where I was given 2 strange email addresses, to one of them my email was not even delivered and I have never heard from anybody from the second email address ever. Then I found that there is an option to submit a complaint directly on the UK website of China Eastern, which I did. I complained that nobody answered my emails from China and asked them to kindly forward my complaint to the corresponding office explaining all my experience! Never heard from anybody!

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Guangzhou to Toronto via Shanghai,1.0," |  This is by far the worst airline I've ever flown. Flight was delayed for three hours causing me to miss my connecting flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou. The chairs were narrow with little to no leg room. Most flights allow you to use cellphone after 20-30 mins take off but phones are prohibited for the whole entire flight with this airline. After I landed in Shanghai, there was three employees to help about 70 people who needed accommodations. They just wrote a flight number on my boarding pass and told me to get my bag with no further instructions. They did provided transport to and from the airport but I almost missed it because they didn't announce that they were leaving in English, which I get that it's not a English speaking country but there were many foreigners like me that didn't understand what wasn't going on and just needed reassurance. We were driven to our hotel, more like cockroach tower, thirty mins away from the actual airport. The next morning I was driven back to the airport three hours in advance for a domestic flight. Needless to say after my first experience with China Eastern I wasn't looking forward for my trip back to Toronto with them. But oh boy, it got worst. My route was from Guangzhou to Shanghai then Toronto. On my flight was Guangzhou to Shanghai, a trip that usually take 1 hour and 30 mins took about 3 hour and 30 mins. The flight took off on time but due to some fog i Shanghai  the plane landed in another airport to refuel. This was what they said and even writing it out now it made no sense. There was obviously a technical error on their end where they needed to stop at another airport to refuel. When I arrived in Shanghai, my flight to Toronto was actually delayed so I had a chance to still fly out that day. But I wasn't informed of this until after they told me to wait for my luggage, which took about 1 hour to come out, and by the time I got my luggage the flight already closed their doors. There were once again only three people to help ~40 people to redirect their flight. I was forced to stay a night again, another cockroach tower and this time even further from the airport. After all of this happened, when I was checking in, the employee was using his phone the whole time while checking me in. He was so invested on his phone that I had to tell him to give me back my passport after everything was done. This is not just one act of horrible customer service executed by china Eastern but multiple and to many paying customers.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

On board and closed up ready to go on time and arrived in SYD a little early. Seating layout was the older 2-2-2 but OK for a good sleep with the seats flat, although the cabin was kept a little too warm for my sleeping habits. Sleep took priority over IFE so I cannot comment on that. The food options were all tasty, with good, attentive service and plenty of snacks during the flight if needed.

Their fare is cheaper than many competitors but you get what you pay for. My flight from JFK New York to Shanghai was unpleasant in many ways. First the seating area was not cleaned. There were crumbs in the arm rest. The pillow and blanket came unwrapped which makes you wonder if they cleaned it between flights. The food choices were limited. They show you the menu but two out of three choices were unavailable. Lastly, the flight attendants were absent mostly and not helpful. There were kids squatting in the middle of the aisle talking loudly during a night flight from NYC to Shanghai (mind you this was in business class where passengers were trying to get some rest or trying to get work done) and the flight attendants were nowhere in sight to help escort the kids back to their seats. Also, the flight attendants were not the friendliest. When I asked for a seltzer water I was met with annoyance then a curt hand off of the can (no cup).

Frustrated enough, at the third time in line, the Officer complained in Chinese and made a phone call to the Airline Transfer staff, I assume he did not give me a proper paper, took her n other staff to work on my paper, finally I got out. The trouble was not finish here. The lady at the next check in for transfer was not nice. After weight my luggage she told me to exit and go to the third floor to enter the departure gate.

Instead the counter rep just says I've missed my flight without suggesting alternatives like ""Let me put you on the next flight or something."" He directed me to 2 separate other counters for no reason then says I have to purchase a new ticket at a premium to change to later flight. Later I found out this was not necessary after I paid. Tried to find the on shift manager and he questioned me by saying if I had bought the ticket at a China Eastern ticketing counter as if I went to the wrong place.  As someone from Chinese descent and living in Hong Kong, I wish I could proudly say there's a world class airline from China. Clearly, China Eastern is not currently nor will be one anytime soon.

China Eastern offers a good business class product on the Boeing 777. The seats were lie flat and the in-flight entertainment was good but limited with the selection of movies. I took all Chinese offering for the meals and they were excellent. My Advice is to stick with the Chinese options do not go for western selection which is limited as the majority of passengers are Chinese one should follow the locals for meals. The cabin crew in Business class has one or two people who speak  English. Seats are very comfortable I was able to sleep for 6 to 8 hours going to Shanghai. The bad is Shanghai as the new terminal is not open so all incoming China Eastern flights park at the new terminal then you get bused to current terminal. No issue with doing the transit it is  simple just follow the signs and complete it with the electronic machines that read your passport and boarding card. Then off to the Business class security line which is where you may have to wait 10 to 15 minutes. Finally the last flight to Manila was great on a smaller Airbus A321. The seats were good and the dinner offered was  either Chinese or Western. Again stick with the Chinese option.

Overall experience (relative to the ticket price which is considerably less than the competition) is acceptable.,nan,3.0,nan

VIP lounge is below standards and my flight was not called so I was late at the gate. No in-flight entertainment system and the variety and quality of food was poor. A good note is that the quality and friendliness of the staff has improved possibly a sign that the overall level of service will follow.,nan,1.0,nan

New 737-800 from Jeju to Shanghai (economy) no food or IFE but it was only a 50 minute flight so that was alright seat decent for a 737 and service was nothing out of the ordinary. Business class lounge at PVG was a bit small and old the hot food section at the buffet was cold. PVG-SYD was on an A330 with lie-flat seats.

Delays on most flights with some explanation but did not affect connecting flights. Cabin crew were robotic with very few smiles and very curt English. In-flight entertainment ranged from nothing to HD level in-seat monitors with an excellent choice of movies and games (CDG-PVG only). Was upgraded to business on the OKA-PVG flight and was pleasantly surprised by the food. The economy food was edible. Overall good value for money and much better than I was expecting having read the reviews here. The transit in PVG is an experience I never want to experience again but that is not China Eastern's fault. Would never travel via China again just because of that.,nan,4.0,nan

Outbound flight was an older plane with 2-2-2 seats that reclined to an angle and did not lie flat. FAs went about their work perfunctorily. The food was very bad - both options were like an economy class meal in terms of taste and quality. They did not have a dessert cart. IFE system had a fair selection of movies. Return flight was better with a newer plane and lie flat seats. FAs were professional and pleasant and spoke English better than the outbound flight. Meals were also tastier. The price for the flight is good but you get what you pay for and quality is uneven.,nan,4.0,nan

Down sides: Consistent bad service in different countries and cities. During the flight it was fine nothing special and staff need more training for attention to details. Lounges in PVG are tiny and dark you have to pass boarding gate to get into the lounge so if boarding in process then you have to wait for 20-30 minutes to go down to the lounge.,nan,4.0,nan

FRA-PVG flights on time on new and clean A330-200-completely full high season flight but crews were very friendly and attentive. 2x meals Lunch and breakfast were served each with 2 choices (Asian and Western) but this time the drinks offers were limited to soft drink 1 sort of beer and 1 French red wine only. AVOD with over 700 programs of films and games is more than enough. During the night flight crews came around regularly with water and soft drinks. We seated near the WCs and saw that cabin crews often cleaned the WC which was appreciated. Transit at Shanghai Pudong was better organized than last time. Onward flight PVG-BKK on smaller A320 without AVOD (only shared screen) flight full crew pleasant but worse English skills than on Frankfurt leg - Lunch (2 choices of Chinese) again limited drinks offered. Return flights BKK-PVG with 90 minutes delay. After landing in PVG with only 30 minutes of transit time - thanks to escort of CEA ground staff- smooth and quick transfers with immigration and security checks. PVG-FRA on very new A330. After arrival in Frankfurt CEA ground staff told us that our luggage will arrive a day later. Only two minus points - first for food and beverages which have gone down in quantity and quality and second - the slow cabin service. Will use again.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Business Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,2.0,JFK-PVG (Shanghai) round-trip. Onboard I found the flight attendants did not speak English well and were not too interested in doing their jobs. The food choices quality and quantity were not better than my experiences in economy class of other airlines. On the JFK-PVG flight the menu was handed out for dinner and quickly collected back as if they were hiding something. Well they were as I realized on the flight back. After dinner I had to ask about dessert and a small container of ice cream was handed out. I saw a passenger having cheese I asked for it on the trip back and was reluctantly offered it. 8 hours into the flight flight attendants walked around with small sandwiches. The breakfast after this horribly long flight was not memorable and was worse than dinner. The seats are not lie-flat and were not that comfortable for an overnight flight of over 14 hours. Return flight was not much better. The menu was handed out and not collected until near landing time at JFK. Interestingly there were 3 meal services listed (Lunch Light Snack Breakfast) but only 2 were served on this 14.5 hour flight. Again meals were of economy class quality service was slow uneven and not enthusiastic. Beverage service was slow and geared towards minimizing consumption. As far as I could see I was the only one who got the cheese plate because I asked for it and the flight attendant reluctantly complied. Same quality seats as the outbound leg. While Business was really more like Economy Plus in terms of service there is also a small First Class cabin on these flights which appeared to be more comfortable with the lie-flat seats that have become popular on other carriers. A few words about Business class lounges. At JFK it was run by some other airline and was no better or worse than the usual JFK lounge. At Shanghai I would rate the lounge as one of the better ones I have experienced. The beverages and snacks were fine and suitable for the western palate. All in all I would not recommend this airline for business class.,nan,3.0,nan

Check-in staff at Wuhan were very rude didn't greet us and literally tossed our documents on the counter at the end. Flight was on a relatively new A320 with comfortable seats.

Transit at PVG was reasonable no real delays to speak of and most staff were at least agreeable (though I wouldn't specifically say friendly). PVG-YVR also departed on time (arrived early in YVR) and was serviced by a larger jet that had individual touch-screens with an optional pop-out console that could be used for navigation. Selection of TV programmes movies and music was quite good and there were a few games to choose from as well. The food was airline food; nothing to really complain about here just standard fare (pretty bland and nothing special though what do you expect on an airplane). Staff were agreeable and came through at regular intervals with water and you could request other beverages as well. No real complaints. Will use them again.",nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,LHR-PDG-DPS in business class on Jan 23/24 2013 on A330's. First leg on a Skyteam branded plane which had a few more rows of business class and was all very new. Seats were fine full lie flat good blankets and toiletries. Entertainment system was fine slightly limited choice. Food was a bit odd you get to select your main and then they serve a whole menu with different starters depending on the main which they hadn't mentioned when you ordered. Dinner served after take off was very good lunch served before landing was just about ok but choice was limited. Cabin staff were great very polite and quick to respond. The second leg was not quite so good it was just under 7 hours so by no means a short hop but they only served a 'snack' and I was very surprised when they said they had no breakfast. The plane on this leg was slightly older and had China Eastern branding blankets were not quite so thick but apart from that it was pretty much the same as the first leg. Staff were ok too. When I originally booked there was a 3 hour stopover in Shanghai but this was subsequently changed to 8 hours. Business class lounge at PDG is pretty ropey bad food uncomfortable chairs and painfully slow WI-FI. The Skyteam lounge at Heathrow is pretty good though. The only other annoyance was that they didn't have any visa on arrival forms for Indonesia which meant we had to find them when we arrived and then scrabble around for pens. The other thing is that it is impossible to choose your seats before you get to the airport which is pretty unusual in this day and age but having said that they did honour the request on my booking for a window and an aisle together. All in all a 6 out of 10 experience and actually one minor benefit of the changed arrival time is that you avoid the terrible traffic in Denpasar. Could easily be improved by more modern web booking system more food on the Bali hop and perhaps a slightly wider choice of meals. But then it is a lot cheaper than anybody else for this journey.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Flew from Seoul to Dhaka return via Shanghai Hongqiao and Kunming. The price was less than half of any competitor's price. I was pretty satisfied with this airline. The airplanes were modern and clean. The English level of the staff was not high but they were quite friendly and efficient. The food was reasonably good but only Chinese style food was available. The flight out of Dhaka was over an hour late departing and so I missed the connection in Kunming but the staff in Kunming were friendly and reasonably efficient in arranging another flight for the following day and a free night's accommodation in Kunming. No entertainment was available but that doesn't bother me. I don't really have any complaints about this airline.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,3.0,Return Sapporo to Singapore via Shanghai. I chose China Eastern for the price. Overall I have no huge complaints. The worst part of the flight was transferring in Shanghai but CEA can't really be blamed for that. Most of the flight attendants were relatively polite. I was however not impressed with the food. On the first flight the meal was almost inedible. On the second leg the longest of the two they only gave us a snack pack with a variety of packaged snack foods. Hot meals were offered on both the return flights but they were also pretty bad. The drink selection is also very limited. There is no personal entertainment system that most of us frequent international flyers are used to. There is just a screen a few rows ahead showing Chinese TV shows with subtitles. As it was a night flight and each leg was relatively short it wasn't a problem. Seeing as CEA fulfilled their basic obligation which was to get me to my destination safely while charging almost 300USD less than any other airline I would possibly fly them again. But if I needed to take a flight longer than 5 hours I'd definitely spend the extra cash and choose a different airline.,nan,4.0,nan

Biggest challenge was going through China but if you can handle the slow processing and tight security then this airline will serve your needs. Flight attendants were laid back but were nice enough and were helpful when asked. Food was adequate and included fresh fruit. On the flight over there were sandwiches and drinks available throughout the flight at the back of the plane in addition to the regular drinks and meals served. Warm wash cloths were passed out for freshening up. were Not many entertainment screens but most passengers had iPads or laptops for entertainment. The seats were no different than any other economy class seat we have travelled in.

Flight boarded on time and in common with all Chinese domestic carriers the cabin crew hustled passengers to get their gear into the overhead locker and take ones seat. Doors closed at around 08.25 am then we sat and sat and sat for 5 hours. Reason given was runway congestion at Hongqaio (a constant nightmare at this airport). After about 2 hours the food trolley was rolled out and the boxes containing bread cake and some nuts were handed out along with some drinks. We eventually took off 5 hours later. The 1hr 20 minute flight to Qingdao was uneventful. This is my 11th year of domestic flights in China and its always the same flying north in winter from Hongqaio airport.,nan,4.0,nan

The business class section is divided in 2 sections: 18 and 12 pax in a 2x2x2 configuration giving a very cosy and warm atmosphere plenty of space. This aircraft is equipped with proper full flat bed. The bed is a good 2 meter long about 50 cm wide (maybe more) the seat fairly wide (although narrower than SQ) which should not be a problem. We had all the amenities you can expect and a very soft comforter and pillow. The food was pretty good. we were offered a pre-dinner drink and a selection of Chinese style or western style food was available. The crew was available during the whole flight at the snap of a finger. The only negative points is that we were rushed through the meal. We had to slow down to make them understand there was no rush! Although the crew was nice trying their best to be polite and use proper English to get understood some lacked the elegance to provide a high standard service. The entertainment system was pretty good a large screen great picture and good selection of movies. Overall it was a very relaxing flight very good value for money in Business Class.,nan,4.0,nan

On these regional flights you don't get the full onboard amenities but it was ok. The blanket could be longer as it does not fully cover your body when lying down. The crew was nice always trying to help. English is not their strength - but the experience was good.

Plenty of choice of entertainment even for four long sectors on AVOD. Service from cabin crew was mostly charming and efficient but sometimes let down by difficulty with English. Food was variable but generally very good. Skyteam lounge in LHR very good Qantas lounge in Sydney excellent but China Eastern lounges in Pudong very poor.

Told to rebook for the next day but there was mayhem at the desks with limited staff unable to cope with increasingly angry crowds. No hotel accommodation provided.

Aircraft was an older 737-300 and the cabin showed a lot of ware the rows were placed very close to each other and the plane was full.

The meal was hot be we were not sure exactly what it was except it was supposed to be some type of chicken dish.

Because it was a late evening flight there was no food service but there was a beverage service. FA’s were efficient in their duties and very helpful to the passengers.

None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated. We did have one recent American film shown but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and flight attendants are plentiful responsive and apologetic. Speaking of the meals the entree is always a meat/brown gravy rice or noodles congealed mass. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yoghurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks/Soft drinks are frequently served but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly. Also an FYI regarding switching off your electronic devices approaching landing - they initiate this process 30-45 minutes before you actually land. Seats were pretty standard for economy but if the person in front of you reclined the pitch was so that it made your tray table unusable.,nan,2.0,nan

When drinks trolley came round I asked for a gin and tonic only to be told we have no alcohol in economy to say I was amazed would be an understatement. There are no video screens in the seats and you have to watch whatever appears on the old fashioned wall mounted screens which consisted of 4 foreign movies with subtitles.

This flight was on a brand-new A330. There were very big individual TV screens with a great user interface and very clear screens. The choice of films wasn't huge but it was varied and it was easy to find something good. The headphones aren't great - you'll need a two-pin adapter to use your own ones. There was lots of legroom and the seats were the type that slide forward to recline. This is really important on a flight into China as people recline as far as they can; the person in front of me reclined all the way but this did not impinge on my space. Food was OK - not spectacular but better than I expected.

There are a few tiny screens above the seats but unless you sit close to these screens you will not be able to see anything and the movies were dubbed into Chinese with English subtitles so anyone that do not understand Chinese would not stand a chance reading the subtitles.

Flight from Shanghai to Sydney was also ok - an older plane with drop down screens and subtitled movies. Staff again appeared aloof however served water regularly again no bar service except limited red wine. Food was not brilliant. The worse thing was the Chinese passengers who would not follow instructions from the cabin staff! A couple of things to bear in mind - The Chinese do not deal with strangers well whether Chinese or Western even if it is there job to do so it is there culture not to smile at people they do not know. A lot of comments have been about lack of alcohol well this is a Chinese airline the Chinese culture is not a big drinking culture white wine is uncommon and spirits only for the wealthy.

The food was good and drinks (beer/wine) was available on request although friends who traveled on an earlier flight said that they only received one beer for the whole trip. We ignored the movie as it was a small screen set in the ceiling and you risked a stiff neck watching it. Seats were uncomfortable for such a long trip and we had over an hour delay at Shanghai airport most of it sitting in the plane with poor air conditioning before our connecting flight took off for Beijing. On the connecting flight to Beijing the in-flight movie was once again on a small screen in the ceiling but this time we were not supplied with a headset so it was pointless. Our return flight to Sydney was from Shanghai food was OK but if you were seated in the middle of the plane and wanted a wine or beer with your meal - bad luck - they ran out half way through the service. The Steward told me that they only had four bottles of wine to serve among all passengers and only a dozen small cans of beer. I guess the point I am trying to make here is that China Eastern promote themselves as a full service airline - not a budget one however you get the feeling that it is bordering on a budget carrier. Would we fly with them again? I don't think so this was a one-off package tour for us to experience a trip to China and as we always arrange our own travel I would rather pay that little bit extra and enjoy a more comfortable and full service flight.,nan,2.0,nan

Food and drink provided for a flight just over an hour long although being a vegetarian the ham sandwich was not to my taste. Bags waiting on the carousel - beware the long walk that characterises modern Chinese airports. Bad points: Twice the price of the outbound flight though to be fair it was a peak time departure (1630). An hour late leaving with no explanation other than the incoming plane was delayed; probably weather related with the after effects of Typhoon Usagi creating havoc generally - the weather at Chengdu was particularly inclement - so why not say so? Failure to control carried-on luggage resulted in chaotic boarding the overhead lockers full with little more than half the passengers onboard - again beware if travelling in China pretty much anything and everything irrespective of size is brought into the cabin.

But these irritations aside I found the service prompt and friendly the food about as exciting as I have had on any other airline and the value for money exceptional. Of course a trip across the Pacific on a new A380 is more comfortable but for short and medium haul flights this airline is not incomparable to what other full service airlines have to offer for the same length hauls. It is ridiculously cheap. Return from Japan to Bali on a full service airline cost me less than a flight from Australia to New Zealand (half the distance) on a budget airline where I have to pay for my own luggage food and drinks and entertainment whilst sitting on a hard faux leather chair with my knees under my ear lobes.

No taste at all. Drinks were not cooled. They served only half full cups of water/tea/fruit juice which made me conclude that they didn't have enough on board so I chose a full can of warm beer. Then they show a movie but of course no earphones available. The chairs were uncomfortably closer than with our flight to Siem Reap (my knees blocking chair in front of me) and I'm only 1m 85.",nan,1.0,nan

Around 6pm they told us there was delay until further notice. We waited at the airport for 5 hours. People started complaining and then they said it was due to bad weather. Because of pressure from passengers staff at Shenyang airport agreed to provide hotel accommodation for us upon arrival in Qingdao.

The flight to Shanghai over Paris was so-so (food very bad and worst of all the cabin was all but clean next to the window chair the dirt (nuts paper dust etc etc) was still there from previous flights. The flight from Shanghai to Paris was even worse. The food was flatly awful. The crew left the light on (only slightly dimmed) during the night flight (since when do people sleep at night with lights on?) crew was nowhere to be seen in business class until 2 hours before landing one (way too) small bottle of water. I requested another one and they told me that there was no more!. During the flight there were no snacks (what was offered was so unattractive and small that you wonder where they got this). The English of the staff is not good at all. This was by far the worst Business class flight in many years of flying. SkyTeam do something its hurting your reputation.,nan,2.0,nan

The flights from Shanghai to Vancouver and return were on time and the food they served quite ok (except for the breakfast). Their cabin crew were a little impolite when you ask them in English but if you speak in Mandarin you could actually see a positive change in their attitude. I remembered asking them for a drink in English and one of the cabin crews asked me to get it by myself. But when I used mandarin and asked them in the same manner I got a free refill of my bottle and a wider smile. The comfort of the seat (Shanghai to Vancouver) was good the leg room is quite big. I will go for this airline again on my next visit for the price I paid I think it's value for money.

During service for first round of drinks and peanuts the staff did not provide napkins and no I wasn't skipped by accident. The food quality is terrible. What was served was worse than a $2 meal you can get in Shanghai. The rice was hard fish beef chicken all dried out. If you want soft drinks instead of a can you get about 2/3 of a small cup. Selection is extremely limited no ginger ale only 1 kind of beer. Only recommend if this is the cheapest flight you can find. You really get what you pay for in this case. The seats are probably the hardest ever for me on a plane. Only highlight is the inflight entertainment you do get a good selection of movies to choose from.,nan,3.0,nan

The cabin attendants were excellent the plane was relatively new with the seating arrangements being great.

It was the only carrier available for some rural airports. although there seem to be a negative impression on here regarding its service and delays I have to say that during the 10 something flights I took with them not once was my flight delayed or my bags lost.

Both flights delayed the first delay sat for 1hr on the tarmac in Hong Kong while the second was a 2 hr delay due to aircraft change. No information as to reason for the delay or how long we would be waiting. Boarding Shanghai-Beijing was chaos staff seemed to exert little or no control over passengers. Some passengers were on cell phones while we were taxiing to take off. A special meal had been ordered but for some reason was given fruit as my meal.

However I was still able to clear check-in security and get to the gate 10 mins before boarding. Hong Kong-Shanghai was very comfortable on an A320. Once we arrived at Shanghai we had to go through Chinese customs and back through the metal detectors to transfer. Shanghai-JFK on an A340 was very good. However there was no in-seat entertainment systems and the communal movies that were offered were not very good. In every seat however there is an electrical plug. I saw quite a few passengers plug in iPads and PSPs and such so CEA is allowing you to bring your own entertainment. The food throughout both flights did not offer any non-Chinese food options. On the return flight everything was fine and the food and drink seemed to be of better quality. The flight to Shanghai was about 30 mins late which cut my transfer to HKG close. CEA is good value for money.,nan,4.0,nan

The modern A340-600 aircraft has roomy space compared to other international airlines and my favourite comfortable 2-4-2 seat configuration. They also have power outlets behind each seat which many airlines don't have they have many music channels. The meals are a great amount. The flight attendants are friendly and helpful as on the way to PVG a PAX lost his wallet somewhere and about 3 FA's tried to help him find his wallet for over an hour and they made an announcement too. Shanghai's PVG international airport is very nice and modern and easy to navigate around. I've seen many negative comments and review for China Eastern and don't understand why. But most of them i've noticed come from Westerners and I understand why. The food and culture and drinks with no ice is Chinese culture. It'll be unfamiliar so bring some snacks. I've heard of many situations where they give Lunch vouchers and hotel room for delayed flights.,nan,4.0,nan

Lounge in SYD for return leg was Qantas lounge so very good excellent food and showers etc. Food on the return leg was much better not only variety but quantity and quality was much better.

nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,Two very different experiences with China Eastern. I recently flew Melbourne to Shanghai and returned three days later business class. First surprise the plane was a Shanghai Airlines B767. Seat 2E was comfortable enough with good legrest and went back to about 150 deg not flat but enough to sleep. Welcome drink was water or a glass with about 1 cm of sparking wine - very odd. Lunch consisted of small salad reasonable main course and plate with four pieces of not so fresh fruit. Dinner consisted of same small salad and same poor quality fruit plate with noodle dish in between. The silliest part was that utensils were the poorest plastic I have ever seen. They were so thin the tines of the fork could not be used to pick up the meat or the vegetables - so I had to eat with fingers which is not terrible just really silly. Business class toilet was out of service but crew did their best to give us access to one of the forward economy toilets. Return flight out of Shanghai was quite different. Same type of plane same seat. Welcome drink was normal glasses of orange juice and white. Toilet worked. Dinner consisted of salad very good appetizer seafood main course and fruit or ice cream for dessert. All served with silver cutlery which debunked my thought that plastic was used out of Melbourne for safety reasons. I do not know how the quality out of Melbourne could be so bad as I have used many airlines out of Melbourne and never had such bad food or accessories as on the Eastern China flight and what makes it so strange is that the airline has such good standards out of Shanghai. It was almost like two different airlines - I would never pay business class to fly the first but I would for the second.,nan,3.0,nan

Boarding was on time and the cabin surprisingly modern. There was in-seat-entertainment (on the flight back there were only overhead displays) though the choice of movies very limited. The cabin crew worked well but they didn't have time for talking or at least smiling. The seat was a little too small for me although my height is average European. Food was okay not more not less.

After what seemed a never ending delay in departure (partly due to a sick passenger) the flight was reasonable except for incredibly uncaring fellow passengers who consistently wandered up to the toilet while the aircraft was still taxiing or put their seats completely into recline before the aircraft had even taken off. First Class on these domestic flights is closer to a cheap business class flight in a country such as Australia.

I would advise taking your own entertainment as the initial first leg of the trip was the only one with a personal TV system every other flight only had communal TV screens showing Chinese films with English subtitles. Food was mainly meat with noodles or fish with rice you may want to consider becoming vegetarian for the trip. I had an overnight stop over in Shanghai nothing was very co-ordinated at the airport - ensure you have a hotel booking slip from your agent.

They brought out hot towels after each meal which was a pleasant surprise. Domestic flights were pleasant and uneventful.

The business class seats on the A319 were 2 2 across and were proper regional business seats rather than the usual economy seat with the middle one kept free that you get with BA. Soft drinks were served prior to take off then hot towels and a second drinks round then a full lunch which I have to admit was the nicest meal I have ever had on any aircraft.

A few times I saw flight attendants cleaning the toilets which passengers don't normally get to see on other airlines. Both international flights were red-eye but I got a fair bit of sleep which refreshed me coming into Shanghai and being quite tall (185cm) I found the seat pitch very good. However the meals were a bit meagre and not up to the standard of for example Qantas. Also they need to improve on in-flight entertainment as on half of the flights it was the drop-down TV and the other half was personal TV.

The cabin crew were very obliging and helpful and there was surprisingly good leg room. We were able to get an emergency exit aisle seat on two of the sectors without having to pay extra - this was a nice bonus! The seats were adequately comfortable. As for the inflight entertainment there is not as much variety as you may get from more well known airlines but there was enough variety to keep your interest. On the way back we had a 7 hour delay due to an issue with the plane. Although this was annoying we were given meal vouchers to use at Melbourne Airport - the value of these was more then enough for two of us to have two really nice meals! Also when we arrived in Shanghai we were given compensation there as well. Having been delayed before on other airlines it was refreshing to receive adequate compensation as this has not always been offered in the past so it was very pleasing to see how well they dealt with the situation. All in all China Eastern offer good value for money and are worth trying out. The important thing is not to expect an Emirates or Singapore Airlines experience - you are paying about half the price so it won't be to that level.

However when I arrived for check-in at PVG they refused to provide through check-in to CCU and said that I would have to collect my baggage at KMG and go for a fresh check-in. This was ridiculous since PVG is the home base of China Eastern and they can easily manage to put systems in place for through check-in for through bookings. But they refused and when I met the duty supervisor she told me to contact the check-in counter at KMG for immediate check-in. However as expected when I arrived at KMG at midnight none of their counters were open. I managed to locate the duty supervisor who refused to help out. I had to spend money and stay in a hotel.

Left Kunming on time but with China Eastern there is a 6 hour wait at Shanghai for a connecting flight so my travel agent got me to transfer at Nanjing instead should have been only a 3 hour wait - Nanjing isn't set up for proper international transfers so you have to unload your baggage at Nanjing exit the domestic terminal and go through the booking process again at the international check in. And guess what China Eastern has different rules as regards baggage on domestic and international flights so I ended up having to abandon an oversized item I was bringing back at Nanjing airport. The officious supervisors at the China Eastern check in counter weren't interested in the fact that I had booked the baggage in at their Kunming counter knowing full well that I was flying on to Sydney. The kicker was that the flight on to Sydney was delayed 2.5 hours for 'unspecified reasons' so didn't even get the shorter wait time anticipated.

The flight attendants were extremely polite friendly on boarding and very responsive to call requests. The food was adequate only in that it was edible - it was served on the SYD-SHA leg in a plastic box and on the SHA-YVR leg in a tray. The choice for both meals on both legs was just a variation of chicken/seafood rice/noodles. The dessert was okay though! Alcohol was very limited - just red wine and beer. But they were very responsive to refills (I asked early to avoid missing out). The return flight from Sydney to Vancouver was just AUD $1500 and to be honest - I felt that China Eastern has (so far) offered value for money.,nan,5.0,nan

Spoken English by flight attendants is poor to terrible. No on board movies. Ok unless you are Chinese and don't mind staring at a 13 inch screen at 10 paces to watch a poor movie dubbed in Chinese. Flight attendants kept insisting (twice) I turn off my iPhone (of course on airplane mode) which I was reading from even though I pointed at two other (Chinese passengers) who clearly had their mobile devices on and she did not bother them at all! Very poor operation by staff - wrong gate info displayed on monitors which did not come on until well after a huge line up formed we had to ask which counter to go to.

We had full flat bed seats on both legs of the journey which were very comfortable indeed. Food was average. Service was average but typical Chinese standard. Check in at both ends was efficient.

I was pleasantly surprised at the end of my journey. The flight was punctual no issue with baggage food and beverages were decent and satisfying attentive flight attendants who made multiple trips to provide beverages as well as the leg room being more spacious than expected.

I was a bit worried after reading so many negative reviews but found China Eastern to be equal to or better than many other airlines I have flown with. The planes were clean and comfortable (by plane standards) and the staff were very professional and helpful with quite good English. The meals (all Chinese) were tasty. There was usually a choice between noodles and rice but the noodles were difficult to eat because of the shape of the fork. The only alcohol served was beer and red wine with dinner. If you want to party and annoy the other passengers this is not the airline for you! On most of our flights the monitors dropped down from the ceiling so there was not a choice of entertainment but on the flight from Shanghai to Sydney we had personal monitors with a wide choice of TV movies games etc. Mine was not working and I was offered a change of seat which I declined as I spent most of my time sleeping anyway. Our planes were all on time (or close enough) and check-in and baggage claim were efficient.

I don't know if it's a mechanical failure so I asked an attendant to help me. She wasn't able to recline it either. Maybe acceptable for this 2hrs flight but certainly unacceptable for long haul.

This would be fine if all the exit aisle seats and other seats around me weren't empty once we were fully boarded! The food was acceptable and there were regular drinks offered their English style breakfast was odd to say the least I would opt for the Asian style were I to travel with them again. The service on the flight was friendly and welcoming. The TV on any of the flights didn't work for me either there was no sound or the screen wouldn't stay up or it just wouldn't turn on. Not on a single flight did it work. It did work for some of my travel companions and they tell me they were able to watch some recent movies and TV shows with a selection of English Indian Chinese and Japanese shows to choose from.

The staff were incompetent. (At the airport I asked if I could upgrade. And after 3 attempts including trying to overcome the language barrier with the supervisor I gave up). The food was inedible. You know it is bad when you choose the pasta with seafood and the flight attendant asks ""Are you sure?"" and shows you the food before giving it to you). The seat was uncomfortable. (Old material not enough legroom). The in-flight entertainment was unviewable and had the worst English dub ever.

Three flights were around 10 hours and one was about 13 hours long and on all four we were served 2 full meals (generally a choice of one Asian meal and one Western meal). Seats were comfortable and had a decent amount of space in economy. Only complaints would be that it was not possible to check-in online and that their seat allocation system doesn't seem to seat people that are travelling together next to each other. We were two people booked together and on our PVG-SYD and PVG-LHR flights (which we checked in for over 13 hours in advance as they were our second flights) we weren't given seats together despite specifically requesting it for the return SYD-PVG-LHR flights at the check-in desk. We went to the service helpdesk and the woman was able to change it with no problems so not sure why the original guy couldn't give us seats together. We noticed a number of couples and groups not seated together on the PVG-SYD flight so definitely request it when checking in and follow up at the service desk if still not seated together.

Yes the crew's English is a second language resulting in a few communication lags but isn't one benefit of travel to gain exposure to other cultures?

The food was just about edible. Getting served was very hit and miss with some crew just walking up and down the aisle with drinks and not asking each passenger if they wanted anything. It was up to passengers to attract their attention and many time people were just ignored. Some staff were friendly some barely hid their contempt for the passengers. We booked a baby bassinet but it wasn't provided and the cabin crew couldn't even understand what we wanted when we asked so we had to spend a 13 hour flight with a baby on our laps. No children's meals were provided even though we booked them. We checked the baby buggy at the gate in Heathrow. When we got to Shanghai it had disappeared and it took us several hours of speaking to unhelpful staff to get it back. Shanghai airport is a huge gloomy depressing place with zero facilites beyond basic seating and horrifically expensive shops. 8GBP for a fruit juice. All in all the worst airline I have flown with by a wide margin.

The cabin was dingy from the 1970s and not cleaned thoroughly - there was rubbish from the previous flight(s) both on the floor and in the seat folio. The entertainment system was appalling. The selection of movies did not include any current releases. The ""nostalgia"" section contained not one but two Shirley Temple films. The screen image and subtitles were shadowy and blurred and the sound quality was very poor. No drinks were provided after take off. After 95 minutes I asked a flight attendant if I might have some water. The request was met with a surly look and the flight attendant said that drinks would be served with the meal service in 20 minutes. I asked the flight attendant for water again and after 15 minutes a plastic cup half filled was produced. Things got worse. Children were permitted to use the cabin as an activity area and continually ran along aisles shouting and squealing. The meal was lukewarm. The dinner roll was at least two days old the savoury roll at least three. The chicken dish was tepid and the rice came in a rectangular non friable block apparently not heated. Dessert was a canned peach half and pear quarter. There was no fresh fruit nor vegetables.

I did so promptly as requested but after some thoughts I had to ask the stewardess again to be sure. I know many airlines already allow the use of digital devices even during takeoff and landing. Some airlines may not adopt the practice yet but to go to the extent of disallowing the use of my phone (in flight mode) during cruising was really extreme to me. All laptops or tablets are ok. I was really surprised and felt embarrassed as I felt like I was being picked upon. I've travelled with other airlines using my phone to watch movies without any problems. In the end the 6hr journey was a torture. I could only wait for my food I guess. Then food came and I was asked to choose. But by the time I was served the crew couldn't provide me with what I wanted. There was no more choices. Too bad if you don't like rice with eels. No more CE for me.,nan,3.0,nan

What they don't tell you is that you have to get off at Nanjing and clear customs. That is the passenger has to not the baggage. The flight then becomes a domestic flight so service basically stops. When you arrive in Beijing you have to do a baggage clearance through customs. Was very confused about the seat belt sign. Although the pre-flight safety video said ""when the seat belt sign is illuminated return to your seat and fasten your seat belt"" the sign was never not illuminated. When I asked how we knew it was okay to move around the cabin there was no response. When asked how did I know when I had to return to my seat I was told there would be two ""dings"" from above. Unless you ask you have to assume it's safety by telepathy because nobody tells you anything. In business class was offered the hand written menu. Yep hand written on a piece of scrap paper. How very rustic. The choice of drinks was limited and once you chose one that was what you drank the entire flight. Well the entire flight until after Nanjing when there was no gin and tonic served because it was now a domestic flight albeit the same now tired looking tech crew and aircraft. The seats were comfortable enough but the aircraft was tired and in need of fixing things such as rips and tears on seats and around the cabin. Not sure the nose tissues really worked as hand towels in the toilets as they tended to break up a bit too quickly for one to dry one's hands. Why bother? The headset for the IFE was a DYI: you are given a headset and the batteries to install into it. That's a first. The IFE offered bore no relation to what was indicated in the one and only inflight magazine (no entertainment guide) between two seats. It was torn and weather beaten on 3rd January.

There is no signage to the special business class check-in so I ended up at an economy clerk and thought so what. Oh no one must go to business class section which was back near the front of the terminal without any special signage. Was attended to by a most rude woman who had no idea about customer service. The baggage belt behind her to whisk away the business class bags was not working (whether it ever does or not I know not) so I had to walk back with my bags attended to by a busboy of sorts who took me back to the economy class check in area so my bags could go on the belt. Obviously no deviation from the plan allowed. He then demanded a tip! After customs and security (very helpful and most patient people given the rudeness of others they attended to) I made it to the circa 1974 business class lounge. Entry about that under lounges.

The flight had the same problem with the seat belt signs it was never extinguished so it seemed okay to get up and wander about when the wheels had left the ground. Although told not to use electronic devices nobody really either bothered to obey or enforce it as the pax in business must be very important and know all about safety.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,I recently flew with China Eastern Airlines and it was a terrible experience. Without any warning or explanation my flight from Bali via Shanghai to Toronto was delayed by two days and I was told I would have a 24 hour layover in Shanghai at my own expense (technically I would not be permitted to leave the airport without a visa). When I tried to speak to a representative in Bali I was informed that China Eastern does not have representatives in the country - only ticket agents. The website does not provide a customer service email (which is a fairly unique approach) and when I finally got through to an English speaking China Eastern office operating out of Vancouver (from my hotel in Bali) I was informed that I needed to speak with the Shanghai office. Finally when I got to Shanghai nobody from China Eastern was in the least bit interested in either explaining what happened. I will never fly with China Eastern again.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,5.0,no,nan,4.0,Our flight was from LAX to Shanghai. Our flight left on time both directions. The plane was clean and the seats were fairly comfortable. They reclined much more than a lot of economy class flights I've been on. We were served two full meals and one snack. The food was probably a 3 on a scale of 1-5. Not as awful as I expected. Usually chicken pork beef or fish with noodles or rice. We did get salads on the LA leg. They only served red wine and beer and when the two bottles of red wine was gone that was it. No mixed drinks. Our flight attendants spoke a little English and were courteous. My big complaint was I booked this flight through Webjet and it was difficult to confirm our flight. Tried calling several times and was on hold for over 45 minutes once with no answer. Web site was difficult to navigate I eventually emailed China Eastern and was told I was confirmed. I was unable to choose seats. If you can choose your seats try rows 70-74 with window seats as there are only two seats instead of three. I was able to score these seats on the return flight. The inflight entertainment was excellent with over 50 English speaking movies to choose from as well as some foreign films and games.,nan,4.0,nan

Needles to say on arrival in Shanghai the transfer option to a different airline had been cancelled I was transferred to a hotel for the night which was a reasonable standard hotel. No further comments on the outward Journey accept the food on the Manila Flight was something I could have got at a 7/11 before boarding it was a suppose worse as I had no choice once aboard. Return flight 17/03/2015 Manila Shanghai-London. 1 week before departure on ringing China eastern to recall my flight details was informed that my London segment was cancelled (due to operational difficulties) and that I would have to lay over in a hotel for a day at their expense. Flight MU 212 took of on time from Manila and had been in the air for 30 minutes when the captain announced that there was fog over Shanghai and we did not have enough fuel on board to wait for it to clear (he said 40 minutes) we would be returning to Manila so after burning off enough fuel to land we had a splash and dash to Shanghai we had enough time to get a snack in the shops at Manila as nothing was offered by the airline we took off again about 3 hours behind schedule. Food again was very poor on landing at Shanghai was transferred to a poorer state hotel where the staff had very limited English and poorer quality rooms then the hotel on the way out was picked up by coach in the morning and transferred to the airport.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,I flew on two domestic sectors KMG-JHG JHG-KMG and one international sector KMG-SIN. Domestic flight was interesting. I checked into the Domestic Skyteam Elite counter at Kunming Airport and gave them my Garuda Gold card (Skyteam Elite). They had never seen the card nor heard of the airline before. Thank goodness I could speak Mandarin and understood the question the counter staff was asking another puzzled colleague and could tell them it was an Indonesian carrier within the Skyteam. After checking in for me she tagged my luggage with priority baggage handling which was only accorded to Skyteam Elite Plus members but hey I wouldn't complain. The one hour flight from KMG to JHG was short. It was operated on a B737-200 which was relatively comfortable on the second row of the economy cabin. I had the aisle seat and slept through the flight. There was no personal IFE on board. Water and a packet of candies were distributed as you boarded the aircraft. On my flight back from JHG-KMG I had the same puzzled look from the check in counter staff about my Garudamiles Gold card. The Skyteam/Business Class counter was not open which was strange. The domestic queues for economy class was long. Flew the B737-300 and the aircraft had a slightly newer configuration than the flight from KMG-JHG. It was a full flight and the crew were just busy trying to get every one on board. Flight was okay. Same bottled water and a pack of candies as you board. For the KMG-SIN International leg we had to clear immigration at KMG and collect our luggage. Get out of airside and proceed to landside departures to check in. Checked into the business class counter as there were only two counters and which every was empty served me. Again had to explain to them about Garudamiles. Flew on an A320. The best configuration and seat comfort with blankets provided. Before departure a cabin crew came to me and spoke to me in Mandarin welcoming me as a Skyteam Elite member and offered me a bottle of water and politely told me to speak to any of the crew members should I need anything. Thought that was a pretty cool gesture to recognise the Skyteam Elite members even for the lower of the two premium tiers. There was no individual IFE but there were screens on board which you could watch Just for Laughs without the sound. Earpieces were not provided but given the flight was at 1045pm scheduled to arrive into Singapore at 2am I slept through most of the flight. The supper was just a box of bun and cake some peanuts and water. You could ask for other beverages which I got an orange juice. This flight carried only 60 passengers and i was fortunate to get the fourth row of three seats in the single aisle aircraft all to myself with room to stretch. Overall I would fly China Eastern again. That's also because I speak some Mandarin and it was easier to communicate with the crew who were always polite.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,"I am amazed at the bagging that the Chinese carriers get on this site. I am based in Qingdao China and do a minimum of 20 domestic flights every year mostly on China Eastern and Shandong Airlines. I have been using Chinese carriers now for 13 years. My last trip was from Qingdao to Bangkok and return via Shanghai Pudong. Checked in at Qingdao and my bag was checked all the way to BKK flight took off from Qingdao on time and landed on time in Pudong. Flight itself was uneventful aircraft was an A320 breakfast in a box was served along with your choice of drink. There was a slight delay boarding the Bangkok flight boarding was from an underground ""gate"" which of course meant a bus ride to the plane. Flight was on an Airbus A320 no IFE and due to the inevitable backlog at Pudong took off about 1 hour late. The service on board was good was able to get a couple of beers before lunch although lunch itself was horrendous but not to worry as there is plenty of good food at our destination Bangkok. Flight did make up some time en route but as I was going on holiday (Chinese Spring Festival) I wasn't bothered. Baggage was on belt by the time I cleared immigration. The return flight whilst having a MU flight number was actually operated by China Eastern's sister airline Shanghai airways. Flight was on a Boeing 737-800 and was pretty uneventful lunch was a delicious Thai curry so much better than the lunch served on the inbound flight- different catering I guess. Arrived at Pudong on time then had a 5 hour wait for my domestic MU flight back to Qingdao. There is not much to do at Shanghai Pudong Terminal 1 -however found a nice restaurant on level 2 of terminal 1 called the Hope Star restaurant where you can have a nice cup of coffee and an edible sandwich for 80 Yuan (ca $12) which is a very good price for an airport and you can sit there in a comfortable seat for hours. Flight back to Qingdao was on an Airbus A330 which is actually a leg of a San Francisco-Pudong-Qingdao flight so was equipped with IFE however due to the short flight time 1 hour 15 mins-nothing worth watching. All in all a good trip I have been flying now for 40 years averaging 30 flights per year been flying long before the introduction of IFE so I know how to amuse myself on a flight-modern travellers are too demanding and cannot amuse themselves. I believe that the Chinese carriers are very good-I do not need constant updates from the flight deck I am not a movie or rock star and do not need the cabin crew to be falling all over me. I will admit that there are communication issues with the Chinese carriers but when you board the flight  smile and say Ni Hao you will immediately have broken down some barriers. You get much better value for money and service on Chinese carriers than you do on similar flights in Europe and the US. Now long haul flights well different story you pays your money and you take your chances.",nan,5.0,nan

Pu Dong airport has issues, however the only thing there that is within the control of China Eastern is the lounges.  They're pretty basic, and not of an international standard, or even close to what you might find in Singapore or Hong Kong. However rudimentary, they are still an escape from the over-crowded terminal 1 at PVG.  The PVG-ICN-PVG sectors were on the older angled-flat business seats, which were entirely fine for 90-minute sectors.  Full hot meals with two choices of main and a few wine choices were offered on both short sectors.  Again, quite satisfactory.  The English-language skills of the crew were not the same as those on the PVG-SYD sector, but one must remember that these were flights between China and Korea, and so it's entirely reasonable to expect that the crews will be best at communicating in Chinese and Korean.  Blankets, pillows and slippers were provided on the short sectors.  It's worth noting that the economy cabins were very full on the PVG-ICN-PVG flights, but business class was a ghost-town in both directions. Not so on the PVG-SYD sector, a ten-hour overnight sector on the A332 equipment designated as 33E, i.e. 6-abreast seating in business class, with 180-degree recline and a significantly larger entertainment screen, and two business-cabins separated by a galley.  There was only one empty seat of the 30 in the split cabin, the passengers were about half Chinese nationals and half Australian, with a couple of Europeans and a Canadian to boot. On boarding we were met by the Purser/Service manager, a young woman of Chinese heritage who spoke excellent English with a distinctively Australian accent. We were escorted to our seats and offered sparkling wine, orange juice (with pulp, not the overly-processed kind) or mineral water.  Soon after that, menus were presented.  The flight had a full dinner service, from which passengers could choose Chinese style with two choices of main course, or Western style, with two choices of main course.  Dinner was served course-by-course and there were no trolleys used for either drinks or food.  Table-cloths were used.  Breakfast choices were either Chinese or Western.  The wine-lists had a (real) Champagne, three reds and two whites, which in my opinion is entirely enough.  A decent selection of soft-drinks, waters and juices was also on offer.  Amenity kits (with Clarins products) were already at each seat. Dinner service began soon after takeoff, and soon after the closing of all the window-blinds (this was common to all the MU flights on this trip, and I found it both odd and a little irritating, however this is what the crew are trained to do!), after which pajamas and slippers were distributed. The seat reclined completely flat, the pajamas were soft cotton, and the duvet was soft and thick.  Interestingly, the cabin temperature was kept quite low on this flight, in contrast with other airlines from Asian countries who, in my experience, keep the cabin temperature warm enough to grow orchids in Iceland. I was woken hours later by the clinking of cutlery in the galley, and having returned from the spotless bathroom, was offered breakfast.  The dim sum were hot and tasty; everything on the tray was tasty.  Breakfast was offered as passengers woke, rather than throwing the lights on and insisting people wake-up because the trolley is coming.  Very civilised, and other airlines could learn a lot from this. We arrived in Sydney on time, and I must say that China Eastern was surprisingly good.  I didn't have sky-high expectations, but that was wrong. The English skills of the crew on the PVG-SYD sector ranged from very good to excellent, and the crew were attentive and very polite.  All in all, a positive experience on MU for a very very keen price.  I would gladly fly with them again in business class.",Business,5.0,nan

After some exercise walking around the terminal to check in found the Biz class check in and found the service courteous but the area run down in appearance. Made it through immigration and security easily but struggled to find the correct lounge. Once there it was not worth the effort. Uncomfortable seats and well worn furnishings. Strolled down to the gate and learned that departure time is the real boarding time. Fought my way through the line onto the bus and then shoved my way to the stairs and made the climb. I found if I didn't assert myself I would keep getting cut in front of the line. Once onboard seats were old style angled beds. Service was courteous and smiles were plentiful. My jacket was ignored until about 3 hours into the flight. My meal order was taken chicken ordered and beef delivered. Debated pointing this out but decided between my language skills and the crew's skills I should enjoy the beef. I think there were inflight announcements from the cockpit but they were difficult to hear. I did have to ask for water about halfway into the flight and after asking got regular top offs.

Flight departed on-time at 1pm but further delays resulted in arrival in Hong Kong 12 hours later at 1am. Delays were due to bad weather in Hong Kong leading to diverting flight to land in Guangzhou airport at 5.30pm. Cabin crew didn't notify passengers of the diversion until plane was about to land at Guangzhou 4.5 hours after departing Xi'an at 1om. Passengers remained on board for 1.5 hours until we were bussed to terminal at 7pm where we only stayed for 30-35 minutes and re-boarded the plane at 7.30pm. A very light meal and bottled water was provided to passengers who had a few minutes to consume the meal. Passengers remain in the take-off position at their seats for the next 2 hours without any clue until the plane finally took off at 10pm. After landing the plane in Hong Kong the passengers remained on the plane for 2 hrs until 1am. Due to many planes in the queue from the delay the baggage claim pickup added more delays along with the delays in getting public transportation to leave the airport. At this time the public buses had ended leaving only a few choices - taxis airport express train and private cars. The cabin crew failed to communicate clearly the delay to passengers failed to allow passengers to be in a comfortable position during the delay provide refreshments during the time (2+ hours) on board plane waiting for bus to go to terminal or waiting for gate to be available.

Then when it is morning we don't get a meal before landing when we are hungry. Secondly on the PVG-DEL sector there was no choice of meals except veg and fish. Surprisingly the flight had only 6 cans of beer and 1 bottle of only red wine per cabin. It is not in good taste to tell a customer that the drinks are finished. Thirdly when we reached Guilin airport security check and departure area we were informed that due to a storm our flight had landed in Nanning so we had to wait. However no one spoke English in the airport CE office was unmanned for most of the day and no information was given to passengers as per time of departure. We were forced to sit in the airport for 15 hours. They took us to a hotel at 8 pm and immediately brought us back but the flight did not leave till 3 am on 16th May. The airport was not able to provide enough meals - certainly nothing vegetarian for my husband.

The planes are modern and so are the entertainment systems, but that's about the only positive aspect. My main complaints are as follows: 1) The planes are rarely on time. I fly China Eastern frequently within China for business due to lack of choice (there are few domestic airlines and they're all about the same quality) and I would estimate that their on-time departure rate is less than 20%. If I'm only delayed one hour I feel lucky. On this particular flight we were stuck at the gate for ~1.5 hours. 2) Their policy on electronics is outdated. Mobile phones in flight mode cannot be used during the entire flight. Also, most other airlines now allow small electronics to be used during takeoff/landing, but not China Eastern. 3) I love Chinese food, but what they serve is awful. I'm from the US originally, and I thought US airline food/service was bad, but China Eastern takes ""airline food"" to another level of inedible. 4) The service is also not friendly and intrusive.

I often take low-cost airlines (WizzAir, Ryanair), so my expectations of service quality are not high. But the huge difference is that those low-costs clearly state the limitations, so you know what to expect. Not China Eastern. My Economy ticket included 2 pieces of baggage of 23 kg (46kg in total). It wasn't written on my ticket, maybe because I bought it through Airtickets24. I arrived at the airport with one suitcase of 31 kg. They strongly insisted that I have to repack it to 2 separate pieces, so I had no choice but to buy a box and to check-in with two huge pieces of baggage (both half-empty. I will never understand the logic behind this (Economy plus and Bussines can check-in 2 pieces of 32kg, so it wasn't the problem that 31kg is too heavy for one piece). I was told that my baggage would be sent directly to Dubai, so I don't have to pick it up for my 14 hour over-night layover in Shanghai. But when I arrived there, they changed the info, I had to pick it up and spend extra money to store it at the airport. The check-in at the Pudong Airport in Shanghai was a mess. My flight wasn't listed on the board. I had to stand in the queue to ask where the check-in is and then stand in the long check-in queue for an hour.

Although we were transferred to an earlier flight we had to collect our luggage and collect new boarding passes which had already been prepared. This process was somewhat confusing and the boarding passes lay on the counter like a deck of cards with passengers randomly going through them to find their own. The information board showed that the new flight was delayed with no ETD or whether it would even be leaving that day. A rep came to explain the situation. He spent 10 minutes giving a Chinese explanation and in English, simply said we do not know. Suddenly he received a call on his mobile and said we may be boarding. After a mad rush to the gate it transpired that this was not the case after all and everyone returned to what seats were available, or the floor. Half an hour later the flight was officially called and we were on our way. The shorter, domestic flights offer food service but no entertainment. On one occasion we experienced a 2 hour delay after we had boarded the plane, due to a sudden storm. Dinner was served during this delay, before take off, and was a good use of time. I do not know what the flights cost as they were part of a tour package, but based on service and comfort I would recommend China Eastern Airlines.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

We were told to wait 10 minutes. There were no seats. We had 3 young children and finally after an hour of sitting on the dirty floor were given our boarding passes. No explanation. No apology. No transit visa. This is terrible! Left a bad taste. Onboard the flight, limited smiles from cabin crew who were clearly tired and were spotted sleeping in the business class section.

Staff told me that I could bring the baby stroller at the gate of the plane but when I arrived at the gate of the plane stewardess told me that she would not take care of the stroller and that I had to come back to boarding gate. I folded the stroller and left it in front of plane gate and she finally took care of it. The inside of the plane is like the service, very poor. The cabin seats were worn and in poor condition. Strips missing from seat armrests, seat cover had some old stains, and the headrest cover was marked with hair from previous traveler. Inflight entertainment is one tv for 20 passengers. Connection at Shanghai (PVG) was just a nightmare. We had to queue for more than one hour at transit counter. Fortunatly we had 3 hours to catch the next flight. Boarding gate was used for several flights at same time and there was no information on the displays so it created a huge traffic jam. When embarking I noticed that the escalator which was going to the plane gate was not working and that there was no elevator. So I asked someone from the staff to help me with the baby stroller.

This is the worst experience we have had with an airline. Their planes are good. Relatively new and in good condition and their prices for flights are good - however from there it is a deep slide downhill. From your first dealing with them to the last goodbye you will be treated poorly. My wife was yelled at for asking if her seat was close to a bathroom as my wife a medical bladder condition. There isn't a language issue going on here just an uncaring poor staff issue. The flight attendants do the minimum. You get poor meals and even though they have coffee, tea, wine etc on the carts at mealtime they will bypass you and offer you nothing. At check in or between flights they don't give you needed information for flights or connections and don't ask as you will be yelled at or treated very rudely. My wife and I try very hard to be undemanding and polite and were treated with indifference or rudely by airline staff. When we deplaned in Shangai to make a connection to Vancouver Canada in our haste an expensive hat of mine was left in an overhead bin. I enquired at their check in quickly after we were off the plane while we were dealing with our transfer to our next flight if somehow I could retrieve my hat. I was dismissed with a wave of a hand and told to go to lost and found (not told where this was). I was then told rudely that I would be gone there a very long time and never would get it back. Even though I was only off the plane minutes it was obvious they would not help and I would never get it back. I never did. This just fit with our overall experience with China Eastern. My advice is that there are lots of airlines out there that offer quality service at reasonable prices. You don't have to deal with airlines like this one.

I had a contact number and no one bothered to notify me. I am a confirmed passenger (flying from Vancouver to Beijing via Shanghai where I made a stop), yet when they cancelled the flight I am virtually not protected on any subsequent flight as is the trade practice. I was only asked to walk half a street block's distance and queue in another counter for 20 minutes to get my passage 'endorsed' on another flight. Only with that I can check in again. There are earlier flights but I was able to get only the 8:40pm flight, a 3hr 40min delay against the flight time of 1h40. This new flight was 'too early to check in' so I was turned away by the counter staff after some quering, and I was asked to come back to check in 1h 30m, holding on to my luggage. There is absolutely no sense of some form of apology - the trouble is all the passenger's bad luck, as this clearly is the airline's attitude. No drink or meal voucher is offered and we the victims are only new passenger with absolutely no responsibility on the airline's part, and that should consider yourself lucky to get a seat on a later flight they allow. Check in staff attitude was rude, and unhelpful, and I was unable to reserve an aisle seat or any seat, just get whatever available on check in.  I got on the 8:40 flight and on arrival I lost my ground transportation in Beijing and had to stay in an airport hotel. There is drinks service on the flight but no snack, not even one to purchase. And to think that I should be on the 5:30 flight.  I do not know whether there is any law in China governing flight cancellation and passenger's right, but all my blame will go to the attitude of China Eastern Airlines. They simply have the right to cancel without reason and if the passenger had it, it is the passenger's bad luck. I live in China and fly every month so I know airlines. Not all airlines are the same but China Eastern is for me, the worst airline of China, definitely. My advice is that if you have a choice, avoid flying with them.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Cabin was clean and staff service more than adequate. Check-in was good. Seat pitch is not among the best but acceptable. But standard, not delivery, of food service is slightly below competitor's. Not much to expect of food on an economy flight but the food seems extremely economized compared with competitors. My seat was well-located but I had no choice of my preferred main course. The meal was the lowest cost option, no bottled water, and bread was served well after the meal by the time when you have finished eating. The food is domestic Chinese, for example the salad is beans in a sauce with seasame oil which suits me but doubtful if for foreigners. Good that the Chinese tea is decent. Cabin staff do speak adequate English, compared with flights on a Russian or a East Europe airline. It was a satisfactory flight particularly for value (I took a OW flight).",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

For example one of them kept nudging and walking into me as we walked by and spilt cold water over me - I said be careful and she ignored me. No apology nothing. Then we had to sit through and watch a stupid exercise video all in Chinese for half an hour near the end of the flight when some of us were watching films, TV or the map and others were listening to music.

We paid for Business Class due to the need for flat bed seats. We got an old plane with seats that didn't recline fully meaning a sleepless flight. The reason for the delay in departure was blatantly untrue (icing on the wings - the outside temp was 9ºC) as was the reason for the excessive cabin temperature (27ºC). We were told that was the normal temperature passengers liked, but after a couple of hours of complaining of the heat, an honest attendant told us the air conditioning wasn't working! We moved seats after a sleeping member of cabin staff was moved out of one of the seats. There was a poor choice of food and it was lukewarm, as the attendant seemed unable or unwilling to heat it to the correct temperature. There was a terrible choice of films. Our stopover was Shanghai, a horrible bleak airport, where we were met by rude and unhelpful ground staff and had to find our own way to a shabby VIP lounge. This was a very long way from where we had entered the airport. Our luggage was left out uncovered in the rain, so when we got to our destination, we found the clothes in one end of my husband's soft case, were very wet. All in all it was a dreadful experience. I can't stress enough that this is an airline to avoid at all costs,even if, as in our case, it came highly recommended.

I spent 7 hours at Shanghai Airport being sent to different queues where the staff there just shrugged and didn't care. I stayed until midnight where luckily one staff member was nice enough to help us reschedule our flight (our flight was cancelled that night). They offered no accommodation, no apologies, despite it being their issue. I spent 300 AUD on accommodation out of my own pocket. The next morning I was again told my flight was cancelled, the main issue was that if I don't fly to Guangzhou and use that part of the trip, my flight back Sydney would be waived too. After struggling at Pudong airport for another 8 hours, the next day, I decided to go to Hongqiao Airport and was lucky enough to get a China Southern flight to Guangzhou. Although China Southern had flight delays, the staff apologised and offered free meal services. I was told to call the China Eastern service centre to check whether my flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai and back to Sydney was cancelled, the call centre advice was dreadful.

Flight is always delayed and they tell you after it is already delayed and you’re sitting at the gate or on the plane waiting. China Eastern never warns  it’s passengers or give them advance notice that there will be a delay. Every single flight I took had this problem, the worse was Shanghai to Rome. Everyone was waiting at the gate for 3 hrs and the board does not say ‘delayed’ and the airline workers do not tell you how long you have to wait for, they just give you a bad attitude and say “just wait”.  On all 4 flights the flight attendants were rude. They complain under their breath right after you ask for a cup of water or if you are standing at the back to stretch your legs. It’s like they are trained to be rude, if you don’t want to serve people, don’t be a flight attendant! I heard 2 female attendants complain right in front of my face about how annoying I am in Chinese because I am standing with 4 other people at the back of the plane. They do not offer basic needs. No tooth brush set, no extra blanket. You cannot ask for another blanket if you are feeling cold, the flight attendant will say “one per person”, I had no one on the seat next to me so I asked to be given a blanket. the flight attendant says he “can’t find it”, I didn’t even see him try to find one. I was not the only one surprised by this on a 10+ hour international flight. Everyone who is considering this airline due to the low cost, please don’t. Just pay a little bit more and get China Southern or a better airline that treats you like a human. You will find that you wasted your money going through all these problems, and it is much better to be comfortable and treated like a person for a long international flight.

This was done without  notice from the staff and we did not pay attention to the change indicated on the boarding pass. During the transfer in Shanghai we realised the boarding pass issued was different and tried to seek support from the local staff because my wife was 6 months pregnant and we in no way intended to wait 12 hours at this airport.

Please do not follow my steps, I am quite a bargain-seeker myself, but no price can justify such a bad experience.  During check in my ticket was allocated a ""standby"" boarding pass, meaning I might fly or not.  Due to that reason my bags were only checked to Shanghai, despite me having a connecting flight to Manila later. I insisted to check in directly to Manila. Not possible. At the gate I was allocated some random seat (not negotiable), despite willing to pay for upgrade to business, I was told not possible, no seats. Funny enough, some 6 or 7 people got upgraded from economy or standby to business right after me.  The worst part was still to come - the seat. Literally, I have never experienced such small pitch in a intercontinental airline, they say it is 31-32 inch but it is not - 29, maybe 30. I could hardly fit in (I am 185cm), with my knees hitting the seat in front. Comparable to Ryanair, but that for a 12h flight. Recline was normal, but the seat moved even further forward - making it impossible to fit the leg straight in the gap between the seats. It was a nightmare. Inflight service was quite slow, staff English level limited, food normal. Mind, they only fill 1/3 of a cup of beverage, ""so that it does not spill"", granting a few walks to the back galley for refills (there is no further service after dinner). Entertainment system works, but there is a very limited selection of movies, which were all dated 1-2 years. I managed to find only one that I have not watched already. Shanghai Airport is big, and of course I had to go all the way through border control, customs and back again to check in to handle my bags 1.5h process, I wonder how that would work on a short connection, Connecting flight to Manila was delayed by 1.5hrs, of course no information or apologies given.

Flew to Toronto from Shanghai in Business class round trip at the end of May with family. Price was excellent, that’s the main drive I took them. Starting with check-in at PVG, check-in staff I met at PVG T1 First/Business Zone was not great. They processed our check-in with a bad emotion, and were careless.  He printed out 2 boarding pass with same name, hence missed one. Lucky, I verified all boarding pass in front of him, and pointed that out, and asked him to double check. Then, he processed it again quickly, and pass to me without a sorry, and again with errors! If I didn’t pick up those errors, and made queue till border check, I would have had to return to make check-in again. The lounge at Shanghai PuDong T1 cannot be considered as a normal lounge among top tier airports, very limited choices of foods and drinks, and you won’t have desire to eat them. Seats are aged and not comfortable. The lounge is crowded, staff shout for boarding calls, noisy just like at a local market. China Eastern Airlines use Boeing 777-300ER for PVG – YYZ, the one I got has excellent condition, as only 1 month old. Inflight entertainment starts only after take-off and ends before descending, selections of movies and shows are so so, not very up to date. WIFI is offered during entire flight, but you have to register online before your flight, Internet Speed sounds like 2G, but better than nothing. Business class has 1-2-1 layout which has great privacy, seat is comfortable for sleep. But seat is not clean, you can see soup trace on the seat. I cleaned it up by myself. FAs were with commercial smiles and tried to be attentive, but you won’t feel warm. Again staff are efficient, sometime too efficient and become careless. You can tell they just want to finish their jobs. I asked them to push my 1st meal 2 hours later, the FA first-of all looks surprising, then keep asking me every half hour. Foods were quiet good, tea selections were excellent! Services on the inbound flights were quiet similar, but FAs were more attentive and patience, without issue with ground stuff.

I know this is utter nonsense, because I have never seen a China Eastern flight take off on time, much less early. I then explain to her that I have bad knees, and that I may need assistance to get to the plane on time if they are boarding early. I ask if I could catch a ride on one of the electric vehicles. She flatly refuses me, and after I asked why, she said it was a 100RMB charge if I did. I get to the gate, early, and of course, they are not boarding early. I wait 15 minutes again, and the counter person directed me to get in the back of the line for coach after I showed her a first class ticket. They boarded late, as I knew they would, and then upon getting on the bus, driving around the airport, we walk up the rickety steps to the plane. And no drinks for first class passengers - the flight is too short, the flight attendant tells me, followed by ""maybe just this flight"", and the worst meal I have ever had on a plane.

My issues are not with the on-board experience, which was acceptable. On my flight, there was no individual entertainment, but we had a collective screen. This means China Eastern had to find a compromise in terms of entertainment, a common denominator, which turned out to be - a cockfight. The real problem with China Eastern was their logistics. I flew with a partnership between Air France and China Eastern, going first from Geneva to Paris, from Paris to Shanghai, and finally from Shanghai to Phnom Penh, and three weeks later the exact opposite sequence. There were absolutely no issues the first time round, the Air France ticket counter issued three boarding passes, and my luggage was sent all the way through. However, for incomprehensible reasons, the return wasn't as easy. China Eastern check-in refused to issue all three boarding passes, giving me only the boarding pass to Shanghai, and insisted that I leave the airport at Shanghai, only to check in again, for a flight that was to connect four hours later. So I wasn't able to go through the regular transfer circuit, instead I had to go through immigration, customs, and then check-in procedures all over again. Chinese officials did not understand why I was to leave the airport since my flight was leaving a mere four hours later, and neither did the check-in lady, admitting that this procedure was lacking basic logic. It took me a lot of explaining each time, so the whole process took three hours. I did not have to check in my luggage again, because surprisingly, my luggage was allowed to transfer immediately to Paris, unlike me. However, this actually proved to be a problem. They refused to send my luggage any further than Paris, which meant that I had to leave the system again, to wait for my luggage and recheck it, even though by this time I had already acquired both of my remaining boarding passes in Shanghai. I had 1.30 hours transfer time in Paris, but due to significant delays in getting off the plane this was reduced to 25 minutes. In this time I had to pass the French border check, customs, wait for my luggage, run to another terminal, check in my luggage, and go through security again. Exhausted from a long flight, I ran all the way, begging the other passengers to please let me cut in line. Fortunately everyone in Paris (CDG) was very nice. Once more, the check-in lady admitted that this was all very unusual, not understanding why I hadn't received three boarding passes, and why my luggage had not been checked all the way to Geneva. Fortunately for me I made my flight in the nick of time, but not thanks to China Eastern, whom, through a serious lack of logic in their logistics made a stressful day out of a journey that could have been very straightforward.

I have flown China Eastern Airlines several times before but this flight was definitely the worst one I had with them. In general it's not a good airline but it provides basic service, getting from A to B. On this particular flight the ground staff was extraordinarily rude and privacy doesn't matter for them at all. They somehow introduced new company guidelines for the return flight where you are not allowed to bring a lot of additional things. They opened and checked from a lot of passengers the bags again by opening up the carry-ons completely but they didn't even check every customer. After asking why, there were no further introductions given and just told you can also decide to not take the flight instead. This was the rudest behavior I ever experienced with the airline but I guess nothing should shock you anymore flying with a Chinese carrier.",Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0

But it is most likely our last flight after experiencing amazingly poor behavior. We left Frankfurt and arrived in Shanghai on time and then began the nightmare. We were told that the flight to Tokyo would have a 2 hour delay because of mechanical troubles. At 3pm we came back to our gate and we were told that the delay could be longer and maybe the flight will take off at 7.30pm, meaning 6 hours delay but the information was vague and there was no real communication from China Eastern. Nobody really took care of us. At 7.30pm, the good news arrived, we can go onto the plane. We were really happy after a 23 hours trip from Frankfurt, we were waiting for take off 10 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, again zero communication from the crew about what was happening, ""the weather is bad maybe we will take off soon, but it's not sure, we don't know"". We try to keep calm and wait for more information and an exact time of take off. At 11.30pm after 4 hours in the plane without having moved or received something to eat, we heard the official and cold news: ""the flight is cancelled, thanks, leave the plane"". We went out of the plane, took the bus back to the terminal and in front of the terminal door we waited again for half an hour without any words or explanation from the China Eastern crew. After 27 hours from our departure, 10 hours delay from our transit flight, we thought that China Eastern would take care of us but nothing happened. Nobody took charge with something to eat, with a hôtel for the night. We went again to China Eastern desk to have some information about how we have to manage this situation and when we can finally go to Tokyo, but after have waited quietly during another half an hour, no real answer and no solution. These people wanted to hurry to close the desk. I took the decision to manage my family by myself and found an hôtel were all can sleep a little bit after nearly 30 hours on the trip. We saw that the first flight to Tokyo was at 7.30am, so we had to come back early to take this flight. The day after we came to the check-in and again there were no real solutions offered to the customers from the canceled flight MU539, but we could check in and take off to Tokyo Narita and not Tokyo Haneda. We were so upset, tired, unsatisfied that we took the decision to go to Tokyo as soon as possible also if Narita was the worst solution - but even better than stay in Shanghai. We finally arrived in Tokyo at 11.30am Sunday November 23rd in the wrong airport and China Eastern Airlines lost our luggage on the way, so that the nightmare continued... To sum up, we arrived in Tokyo after a 38 hours trip and nearly 19 hours delay. Wow, nightmare hardly describes it.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Check-in at LAX was nightmare and staff couldn't seat my wife, child or myself together (all middle seats as well). We ended up not using our child's purchased seat because they couldn't figure out how to seat us together and of course, no refund. Attendants were cold but helpful (extra blankets) and my child ended up sleeping on floor at my feet. All flights inexorably delayed (30 min - 2 hours.) Worst part was connection in Pudong Shanghai. Expect extra screening and attention from military police. Although screening allowed our child's bottles, military took our child's milk on PVG-LAX portion just before stepping on plane.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,November 2016,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,PVG to JFK,3.0," |  Shanghai to JFK New York. I flew 8 flights with China Eastern between October 16 and November 2, six of these domestic flights within China on Shanghai Airlines, which is owned by CE.  On the international flights planes were new and clean, with seating you'd expect in economy class. Meal and drink service were fine, but food quality was lacking. Noodles were extremely greasy and fish was very fatty, not appetizing.  Another dinner consisted of eggplant (again greasy) and rice, with a side dish of a cold white pickled vegetable, plus a packet of 8 saltine crackers. No cheese or anything else with the crackers. Water melon for dessert. Inflight entertainment was odd, perhaps chosen solely with Asian passengers in mind. Baggage handling : the outbound trip checked my bag from JFK to my destination in Guiyang, with change of plane in Shanghai. In Shanghai I learned that my flight to Guiyang had been cancelled because of weather so about 4:00PM I and 10 others in my group were taken to a hotel about 15-20 minutes from the airport. At 9:30PM our tour guide knocked on each hotel room door to tell us that CE required us to return to the airport to claim our bags. Why? ""If you leave it overnight it may get lost."" We went. After Guiyang we headed to Wenzhou, again via Shanghai. We arrived in Wenzhou on a morning flight but bags did not. When would they arrive? ""Maybe tomorrow."" This seemed strange since there were two more flights the same day. In fact the bags reached our hotel shortly after midnight, probably arriving on the second of the two remaining flights that day. My TSA-approved lock was missing, but bag contents were complete. These experiences did not raise confidence in China Eastern's ability to handle luggage. End of my trip involved a flight from Guilin to Shanghai leaving Guilin at 12:10PM on November 2. At dinner November 1st our tour guide received a call informing us that our flight had been cancelled ""due to a change to winter schedules on November 1."" We were re-scheduled on a November 2 flight leaving at 7:30AM, the only flight of the day. This required leaving our hotel at 5:30AM. If winter schedules go into effect on November 1, why did CE sell us a ticket for November 2 using ""summer schedules""? And why was our guide only notified of the change the night before the flight? No traveler in our group received any email notification of the schedule change. We can only thank our tour guide that she had contacts that informed her of the change; otherwise we would have shown up at the airport about 10:00AM November 2 to discover that the only flight of the day had already departed. Our ongoing flight from Shanghai to JFK, summer-scheduled to depart at 7:30PM was re-scheduled to depart at 8:15PM and actually departed about 9:00PM. I'm glad I had no ongoing connection to catch the night of my arrival in JFK. This experience does not give confidence in China Eastern's scheduling nor its ability to inform passengers of schedule changes, though I see in reading other reviews that other travelers have had experiences much worse than mine. Improvements in scheduling, baggage handling and meal quality are be required if China Eastern hopes to succeed in competing against other airlines offering service to China.

The food was good, staff were friendly and helpful. Legroom on the seats were acceptable. The only big problem is that they can't get their flights going as scheduled. Every stop there was a long delay. Departure date from Honolulu was delayed 1 day. When checking in for my flight from Wuhan 2nd stop, to BKK the staff asked me for my baggage I said ""it was checked thru to BKK in Honolulu"". tHEY said ""no you must pull your luggage here and check it for your flight to BKK"" which I was not told in Honolulu. The flight from Shianghai was already late. If you have ever been to Wuhan the arrival baggage area is quite far from the departure area. The staff at the counter told me ""You must go quickly or you will miss your flight to Bangkok"". I had to run out of the departure terminal and all the way down to the arrival baggage area saw no signs in English. The staff wrote something in Chinese on a sheet of paper and said ""show this to the security there,"" I finally got my luggage which was being held at the luggage security area. I rushed back to the departure area and the check in counter is closed. I ask the staff behind another counter and explain my dilemma. They check my 2 bags and gives me a boarding pass. I scurry to the gate and get there as they are boarding for BKK. The plane is half empty and was delayed - if not I would have missed my flight as the flight. Return flight from BKK was no different they changed the schedule by 7 hours twice I had to keep checking schedule in Thailand. ""Delay in BKK"" arrived late in Shanghai. Got to the gate when they are almost done boarding for Honolulu already. I get on the plane, find my seat and buckle up and sit for almost 2 hours waiting to take off. The woman next to me says ""This flight always delayed"". No explanation, no water or beverages while waiting. Both meals were ok although I only ate one, the breakfast before arrival in Honolulu. This flight with China Eastern was quite an experience not to be repeated. I already booked for BKK again in February with KAL at $250 more but without the drama. The ""China Eastern"" check in counter in Honolulu needs more training to give the passengers all the information they need. They say never say never but in this case I will never fly this airline again. Disappointed China Eastern flyer.",Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0

For domestic flights it is located at the far-left check-in island (N) close to the security area. The N-sign is not visible from the departure hall. During the day I had a meeting near the airport, so I checked in about 8 hours before scheduled departure time for the flight to Pudong and for my connecting flight to Amsterdam. Check-in was OK, but staff barely spoke English. When I returned to the airport, the flight was delayed by 2 hours (because of travel disruption at Pudong Airport the aircraft arrived in Xi'an later than scheduled). As a result I would miss my connecting KLM flight from Pudong to Amsterdam. Airline ground staff were not very helpful, it took them 30 minutes before an English-speaking staff member arrived. They said they couldn't do anything for us, we should sort things out at Pudong Airport and made it KLMs problem (the flight was part of a KLM ticket). Because of all the hassle and because the staff where not very sharp we almost missed our flight.  The MU A321 aircraft looked quite new, as do most MU A320s and A321. Good, soft seats, this time even with adjustable headrest. Good seat width and pitch for economy. Friendly flight crew. The food on this 2-hour flight was terrible. As it is on most domestic flights within China. We arrived with more than 2 hours delay and I missed the connecting flight to Amsterdam. Staff at Pudong were not helpful and it was quite chaotic at the transfer desk. They said I had to go to the KLM counter next day to check for flights to Amsterdam. Knowing that could be risky, as KLM flights are often fully booked, I called KLM to check for flight options. (KLM customer service was friendly and helpful and was able to put me on the first KLM flight of the next day). China Eastern arranged a hotel to spend the night. This hotel was old and shabby and quite far from the airport (30 minutes drive). Overall: good aircraft and flight crew, very poor food and customer service.",Business,2.0,nan

I asked for a drink when entering the cabin which never came. I needed to ask 3 times for a single glass of wine - and they never asked if I would like something else. In the morning they did not bother service the breakfast - without removing empty water bottles remaining from the night. The cabin was heated to seemingly sauna temperature, without a chance to get indivudual fresh air to my seat. The seat was a nightmare : good while sitting but with poor upholstery - the more it reclined the more it became a graded patchwork - no way of getting a nice sleep. ",Business,2.0,nan

They told me that planes have luggage weight limits per flight and that my China Eastern plane had exceeded these on my particular flight. They had then started offloading random suitcases (!), so amongst others, mine got thrown out despite being under the 20kg check-in weight limit. They were supposed to be delivered to my home the next day, but it's now been 3 days - it should be scheduled for today. They told me I'd receive a phone call in advance to ask me what time I want the luggage delivered - but instead I get a text message basically telling me to stay at home for 4 hours in case they come.

The initial departing flight was delayed by 2 hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight. The flight attendants ushered us off the plane while trying to ask what we should do. Upon entering immigration, they took our passports and took it upon themselves to have the airline rebook our flights as you can't enter China without an outgoing confirmed reservation. No airline personnel were there to assist, at this point had things been bettter organized we could have made our connection. once through immigration we went to the service desk, where we literally spent 2.5 hours trying to re book our flight. when we asked why it was taking so long the ""customer service agent"" stated ""do not talk please"". When we pushed to speak management we were refused. The staff kept saying they didn't understand English. Once our flight was rebooked they informed us no accommodation would be provided although we will now be in China over 24 hours.

Thats the extent of my complements lets get on to the complaints. Cabin staff have a very basic grasp of English and have a very irritating habit of saying ""yes sir"" when they have no idea what you are asking for. Food is absolutely unfit for consumption. Flew into Shanghai Airport and was shocked when we were left the plane. Instead of a gate tube we were greeted by a ladder truck and de-boarded into a snowstorm on the runway. We were not warned in advance and most of us left the plane in t-shirts and had to stand in the freezing temperatures waiting for a bus. Thats right a bus. Same when boarding our connecting flight. One would think that the airport must have been overly busy and there were probably no airbridges available but upon our departure that thought was put to ease as we taxied past unused airbridge after unused airbridge. It probably boils down to a small cost saving by de-boarding passenger on the runway but I paid good money for my ticket and this is unacceptable.

Zero help or cooperation is available in their stopover in Shanghai. We experienced some dificulties during this transit. What really annoyed us was not the vagaries of international travel, but the inability for China Eastern staff to take responsibility for their errors, to raise or resolve issues appropriately or to perform simple tasks.

So I missed my connecting flight to Seoul Incheon. The inflight entertainment, for my seat on all 4 flights I took my the TV has a problem. It switched off and on on its own. I clicked English and it went to chinese. Their movies are all Chinese speaking even if its an english movie. On reaching the queue to transfer was a mess. I'm supposed to transfer to connecting flight, however the flight was delayed till 5pm. Not only that, I dont know why they asked us to enter China, meaning stamped our passports, exit and check in again. The staff are shouting at each other. They show attitude when passengers don't understand them because of their lousy English. When I approached China Eastern, I wanted to enquire about my flight delay, and ask if they could compensate because they took my 1 day in Korea. The guy immediately asked me to speak to his supervisor because he does not know how to communicate in english. So I spoke to the supervisor, and he blatantly ignored me. This guy is a representative of China Eastern, and he's the same guy that ignored all other people who speak English. I had ordered special meal due to religion but when I got on my connecting flight, my special order was not indicated because my flight was changed due to the delay. China Eastern claims there is WiFi on board, but we were told to switched of all devices throughout the flight. Never going to take China Eastern anymore.

That was both a precursor and the best part of the trip as it involves this airline. The crew was cold and the drinks were warm. When we arrived at our layover in Shanghai there were no representatives to assist passengers with directions. We ended up finding our gate with no assistance (and no smiles from any airport personnel). We arrived in Siem Reap two hours late. Luckily we had a great time in Cambodia! When it was time to return home the adventures began. While waiting in line at the ticket counter several Chinese tour groups started fighting amongst themselves. Then after we checked in and moved to the security lanes some of the members of these groups started skipping past the queue to get to the checkpoint. Mind you, this is still the good part. We were scheduled to leave at 2255 (10:55 pm). Our first delay was two hours. The airline counter said it was because of heavy traffic in Shanghai. We then sat around for another five hours with no word on when we'd leave or what the delay was. At approximately 1030 (am) we were given a coupon for food within the airport and told that the new time was set for 1230. By this time the tourist groups were literally in full revolt. Arguing with each other and verbally assaulting airport staff. No airline staff because they were nowhere to be found. Finally at 1500 (3:00 pm) we were put on a bus so we could board the plane. The flight from Siem Reap was uneventful but noisy. When we landed in Shanghai I asked on of the attendants for assistance finding where we needed to go in the airport. She led me and my family to the bottom of the stairs (at the airplane) and pointed to the bus. The transfer area in Shanghai is foreboding at best. When we walked to the queue a worker was berating a lady because she was asking where she needed to go next. Our process was uneventful that night but because of the delay we couldn't return home until the next day. Therefore we had to stay in a hotel out in Shanghai. That was another experience in and of itself but if dirty carpets, low water pressure, hard beds, and cigarette smoke smell is your thing, I know a place. At 0555 (5:55am) the next morning with no notice we got a knock on our door and a man speaking only two words - bus now! This part actually went smooth and the plane left only thirty minutes late. More cold flight attendants and warm drinks with one extra bonus. Not going to say why but we also got sick after the flight.

Check-in at ICN is horrible - flight scheduled to leave at 4pm, we arrive at airport at 12pm, took 1 hour at ICN just to get through lineup. Another 30 minutes delay due to ""passport unable to be scanned, it was a problem with Canada"". At least they tried to expedite me through Security with a Fastpass, but even then, with a 4 hour window, we barely made our flight. Nobody enforces the 1 Carry on rule - many passengers carrying 3-4 bags of Duty Free in addition to the Carryon, making Carryon Space unavailable. Whats the point of rules then? Landed at PVG, went thru transfers quickly, but recheck through Security for Vancouver flight. Boarding time was 11:05, and as we were seated in row 72 (yes - 72) - we supposedly to board first. However, as this is Shanghai, nobody follows the rules and as a result, everyone just mills around and pushes into a queue to board first. Unable to use ""Airplane Mode"" on cellphone due to Chinese Civil Aviation rules - therefore, even if I was to take my phone and try to charge with USB port, cabin crew frowned upon this - yet others were able to listen to music on their iphone? If you speak only English, God help you - you won't be able to communicate with airline staff. China Eastern Airlines Staff will randomly ask randomly selected passengers to join CE ""club"" thing - again, as they don't speak English, we declined whatever they were pushing onto us. At least we had 2 meals and had choices of 2 options each time. On a positive note, prior to landing, they had every participate on Tai Chi stretching exercises. Treat China Eastern Airlines as a discount airline that gets you to A to B. if you're going A to B to C, God Help you. On top of that, upon arrival at YVR, airline lost bags and apparently the Ground Crew are not China Eastern Airlines staff - they are from Swissport - therefore, any lost bags are not handled by CE and therefore, unable to get any sort of lost baggage number for insurance clams. Only use this airline if you're going to one destination without a transfer and able to speak Mandarin. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

You could do nothing during the 30-min period when the plane was taxiing to the runway. WiFi was unavailable during the whole flight. Flight map was also shut down until late. A flight attendant explained that this is because flight map was not allowed to see in US air space. What an unbelievable explanation I've ever heard about! Meals were really bad and no fresh fruits were provided. During the 14-hour flight, no snacks other than peanuts were available. Cabin service was nearly zero aside from meal and drink serving, and it seemed that some of the cabin crews were not willing enough to help the passengers. The planed arrived PVG 35 min ahead of schedule, but it was hold on the tarmac for nearly 45 min until we reached the gate. The second leg to Guangzhou was also all about waiting.

In common with other airlines they like to fly long legs with lights out, irrespective of the time of day at take-off, landing or midflight locations.

The flight from Delhi was 1 hour late. The transfer desk staff in Shanghai were nowhere to be found, so I waited in line at the immigration for 1 hour, because there were only two officers attending to 200+ people. When I finally arrived at Honqiao airport, the flight had already departed. I was told by the counter to go back to Pudong airport and wait on standby. I was finally able to board a 13.10 flight to Tokyo. The boarding started at 14.20. After that we were kept inside the aircraft for 3 hours because of ""air traffic"" issues. Despite the long wait, no meals or water were offered. The flight finally left at 17.10, arriving to Tokyo 6 hours later. Needless to say, no explanations or apologies were offered by the staff.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2017,3.0,1.0,4.0,no,Seoul to Melbourne via Shanghai,3.0," |  My experience with China Eastern Airlines has been by far the worst of any airline I've travelled with. I was travelling three consecutive flights, the first of which (Seoul - Shanghai) was delayed 8 hours. No reason given. They changed my connections, gave me a $10 food coupon and all was well. Or so I thought. The airline then tricked me and the others with connections into signing a waiver, saying we would still make our connections as the flight was on time. Yet the plane was delayed again and everyone with connections missed their flights! I couldn't believe it. They had known the plane wouldn't be on time and we weren't going to make our connections and tricked us into waiving all their responsibility! How dishonest and slimy. Luckily I took a photo of the waiver before signing it, as I was suspicious about it. The staff were acting like dodgy salesmen tricking you into signing a bad contract or something. Turns out I was right. I should mention that they gave us 80000won (maybe $60aud) as compensation for the delayed flight.  We spent a tedious 3 hours in customs, as we now had to leave the airport. They were so understaffed I can't believe the Shanghai airport can even function. I was told to go to one place, yelled at, told to go to another place, no one had any idea what was going on and hardly anyone spoke English. Or if they did, they concealed that fact to dodge responsibility for answering my questions. My flights were changed again and now I would be landing 26 hours after I was supposed to. 50 hours in transit, and currently stuck in Shanghai. Exhausted and angry, we waited for an hour and a half in the airport and another staff member shuffled us into a rickety bus and took us to a hotel. The hotel staff were lovely, and dealt with us swiftly and kindly, despite it being 4:00am now. We were fed too, but after heading back to the airport the next day, I asked 3 separate info desks but was provided with no food coupons and had to exchange my own money to buy food.  The staff were rude and unhelpful. There is no information given to customers when things go wrong and the airline does their best to rip you off and dodge responsibility for their company's mistakes. The worst part is, there's nothing that can be done. I've signed a waiver that excuses them for any compensation, and there's nothing I can do. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

Was flying from Manila to Toronto via Shanghai with my wife and two kids. The flight was first and then diverted to a different airport due smog. That's when the nightmare started. We're not allowed to deplane for more than two hours due to lack of ground staff. Eventually upon disembarking, the ground staff said we will be transferred to the main airport in a shuttle bus for the connecting flight. We were kept waiting for the bus for more than 4 hrs without any proper explanation. It was hard to communicate with them and the staff was rude. Eventually when we reached the main airport, we were told the flight has left and there are no seats until the day after. Again no proper explanation. They transferred to a very crappy hotel faraway from the airport. We were stuck for two in this hotel with kids without proper food and staff that does not understand a word of English. Finally upon checking in for the two days later, the staff refused point blank to accommodate our food request. We survived on buns for 14 hrs. They were even rude when we tried to explain our dietary requirements. Kids fell sick. Never flying this airline again. I would give it a big zero.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

First we have to start two months before the flight, when I got an email saying I had to write another email in order not to lose the ticket I bought several weeks before. I wish I hadn't done it and I had booked the flight with a different company. I flew with my wife and son from Ho Chi Minh to Paris (and return), with a nightmarish stopover in Kunming (China). Both times we had to go trough the immigration lines to get our checked in luggage and check it in again and go through the long immigration lines to get back to the boarding area. What may have been a quiet wait turned into a hell of long lines and rude Chinese officials. I can't understand why they can't have the luggage transferred for the passengers in transit, specially when we had over 7 hours of transit, which gives them a lot of room to do it. If we come into details about the flight, the food is average and, surprisingly for a long distance flight, scarce. Although they had available drinks and sandwiches at the back, the offer was poor. As for the flight attendants, they did their best but we couldn't find one who could speak proper English (or French, as it was a flight from Paris), which made communication difficult. The entertainment offer was also bad, with some good movies in the catalogue but really bad earphones that made the watching experience not very enjoyable. I am not a picky person with airlines but I believe this is the worst airline I have traveled with, even low cost companies have a better service.",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

Upon boarding the plane in Bangkok on 7th January we smelled a burning electrical fire smell. We asked for information from the flight staff and nothing was provided. We waited about 2 hours before any announcement was made that they had a mechanical issue with the plane. Only after that did the flight staff offer any water or food. We and other passengers asked for an update and no information was given. It was obvious to the passengers on the plane that the plane would not be repaired however we were forced to sit in the hot plane for several more hours. Eventually all the passengers were moved to another plane which departed at 5:05pm. No communication or announcements were given so waited about an hour as staff attempted to find all the passengers and move them to the new plane. During the delay there were other flights departing that we could have been put on, however we were held on the tarmac and given no information. We requested information on our connected flight to NYC, and the staff refused to answer us. We asked if the connected flight would wait for us or if there were any other flights to the US and the staff refused to answer us. We landed in Shanghai around 10:30pm. We were still not told by any staff if our connected flight or any flight was available. We were not provided China arrival or departure papers and the staff refused to communicate with us. We spent another 2 hours at the Shanghai airport where we were finally told that the airline would not offer any connected flights and we had to stay overnight in Shanghai. The ground staff in Shanghai was rude, refused to answer questions or communicate with us or even look at us. At least half the flight was English speaking, and no staff would speak to English speakers or call for someone who could help. We were herded like cattle into a bus which took another 45 minutes and dropped us at a low budget motel. Again we were given no options or explanations. The motel staff was also rude and confiscated our passports against our will. They refused to give us our passports until we boarded the bus back to the airport the following day. The low budget motel did not provide us any food that we could eat, and there was no nearby place where we could buy food. We were given a plastic bag with dried beef ramin noodles and no explanation of how to heat them in the room. Furthermore, all our flight bookings for this trip were for Hindu meals as we don't eat beef. At this point I felt like a prisoner being held against my will. The room that we were provided was 12 degrees Celsius and we were shivering all night long. I had to wear my clothes and coat the full time we were there but I still got sick the next day because it was too cold. It was not clean or well kept. The sink was clogged and not draining properly. The tv did not work. There was no alarm clock. We were not given a king or queen bed, and instead had to sleep on separate twin beds shivering cold, hungry and thirsty. There was a dirty mattress sitting in the hallway outside our room so I was concerned about cleanliness. Because we arrived a day late to NYC we both lost a full day of income for our small business.

When I read reviews before boarding indicating that the crew on at least one China Eastern flight was smoking, I was skeptical. But I am now halfway through a twelve hour flight on China Eastern 590, departing SFO January 6 at noon, and have smelled cigarette smoke four times. Each time I have raised concerns with the flight attendants and they acknowledged the smoke, have policed the lavatories and asked the crew, but claim nothing has been found. Then the head purser told me that there are two pilots, one the older one who is a heavy smoker but he claims not to have smoked since leaving SFO. I have to assume that there are smoke detectors in the toilets, and since there is nowhere else on the plane to have privacy, my best guess is that the captain cannot resist repeatedly smoking, even in the face of repeated customer complaints (not to mention regulations and basic safety principles for himself and his crew.) The airline needs to investigate this. The flight attendant did agree to make an announcement in economy class to ensure no one smokes. A 1 out of 10 rating because of the safety issue and inability of the crew to identify the source and stop this potentially hazardous situation.",Business,1.0,1.0

At Toronto quick and efficient check in, lounge was fine, decent food drinks offered and seating was good. The crew managed to communicate with me in English just fine, the food choices were good and tasty - the drink list looked quite good but I stay away from alcohol when flying. Inflight entertainment was a bit limited but for my taste was ok - just a bit dated. The seat was perhaps a little too firm for me but being able to lay flat made all the difference. Transfer in Shanghai was simple, the lounge in Shanghai is very busy and it could use more comfortable seating and more food choices. Flight to Manila was delayed three hours do to atc issues and is common in China. For the price I paid (almost half of Korean Air or Cathay) they compare very favourably. Areas for improvement are meal presentation and for staff to come through the cabin more often inflight to see if the pax need anything. The IFE needs more choices and more recent titles.

My shoulders were nearly in the seats next to me and it was a battle for the armrest for the 14 and 16 hour flights. The seats seemed very firm and weren't comfortable to rest in at all. It didn't help that the Chinese woman next to me kept spitting into a cup, making the loudest noises ever to do so. Aside from the small seats in Economy, the movie selection was not great by any means. I was able to choose from a couple that I found interesting, but I ran out of viable options pretty quickly thereafter. Lastly, I had purchased my tickets 5 months before the trip actually took place and had chosen aisle seats for every flight. On my way to New York, I was given my aisle seats. But on the way back, I was sat in a middle row seat, in the middle of the plane, for both legs of the trip. I was not at all thrilled.

The food was okay; it was good enough for me to eat the whole thing, but it could definitely be a bit tastier. There were beverages served throughout the whole flight, and the attendants kept me hydrated without me having to get out of my seat. Also, they really cared for the passengers; once, my two children had to go to the bathroom, but turbulence hit while they were going. The flight attendants took them in a safe place of the cabin, as our seats were pretty far away from the toilet they were going to (the other ones were occupied).

Even though I had read many bad reviews about MU rude staff, the crews on this flight, (in fact all my MU flights) are very friendly and professional, they are willing to help passengers; the check in staff at PVG airport are  friendly as well. There was a travel group sitting around me, I noticed that the crews had taken care of them when they needed. The IFE screen offers a great variety of entertainment.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2017,2.0,1.0,4.0,no,Amsterdam to Auckland via Shanghai,4.0," |  Amsterdam to Auckland via Shanghai. Would not fly with this airline again. First of all the crew onboard barely spoke a word of english, which usually is a requirement for international crew. Any queries I had about arrival cards in China, and New Zealand could not be answered because of the lack of English. Service on board was alright. Crew did not walk around asking for drinks, even though it was an evening flight, and I constantly had to get up to ask for something. Never come across that before. There is only option for type of wine: red. There is beer which is usually finished by the time they get to you if your sitting in the back. Another weird thing onboard on our flight from Shanghai- to Auckland was that it was a day flight, so flying majority of the time in the day time. our flight was blacked out with no light so we we were really put off schedule. Not enjoyable arriving at 5pm and having slept for 7 hours to then having to try and sleep that evening isn't ideal. Also check in is a nightmare. Never got a window seat (couldn't log in online majority of the time) even though they said it was possible 2 days in advance. We kept trying to log in with the info that they asked: Family names / First name. To be able to long in you do infact use your family name/ first name but at the end you have to add: MRS/MISS/MRS which is only specified 24 hours in advance and once you could check in all the seats are already taken. I noticed that check in and the whole website is very easy for Chinese people to check in but anyone who only speaks English it is very hard. Also when trying to ask the check in staff in Shanghai why all the window seats were already taken, even after arriving 4 hours in advance I couldn't get an answer. Again an incredible lack of English and it was like speaking to a brick wall - gave up after about 5 minutes of trying to explain myself and not getting anywhere. Apart from having a cheap ticket that was about the only thing that was going for this airline. Slack staff and very cheap airline. Honestly very dissapointed and a terrible way to start your vaction off on.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

We booked China Eastern as an accidental alternative to United Airlines changes of flights. The lounges were first class, a pleasant surprise. The Shanghai connection was flawless, all you have to do is read the signs and follow them, plenty of time in the lounge where western and eastern food is served. Every one was very helpful and supremely polite. Onboard our 2nd leg, we were served more food, quite good, the cabin was very clean and so were the rest rooms, again polite, pleasant staff, we had to stop them serving us more wine. We arrived early in LAX and somehow beat the computer glitch that fouled many returnees later that day. Entertainment was great, we slept quite well too.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Passengers waiting area open to the outside (very cold) outer elements. Evidently no personnel at gate who speak English. When I attempted to gain information, the airline's personnel waved me off in a completely dismissive, contemptuous way (a back-handed ""go away"" gesture followed by ""not know"" ""can't help"" pigeon English). The airline's personnel at other gates were equally rude and dismissive. I was booked on this flight as a partner of Delta, who must also take part blame for the airline they chose to represent them.

The flight consists of 2 flights with an approx. 1hr stop in Kunming. The first leg newish aircraft, very comfy seats with adjustable headrests. The staff was very polite and helpful, however they didn't approach to say ""hello"" to SkyTeam Gold member (as they're required by their management). I saw them greeting their own program's FFs, also delivering them food before others - a nice gesture I think. The food was quite tasty and they're not scared to offer pork options. On other Chinese airlines it's just beef or chicken in economy class. On arrival in Kunming all passengers continuing to Baoshan have to exit the aircraft and exchange their boarding passes inside the aerobridge - I think this step is unnecessary and just time wasting. The other leg in a very old B737-700, just a water handed in during boarding but for a 50min flight it was OK. I saw many negative flight reports about China Eastern, however I have never had big issues with them and recommend them.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Sydney to Shanghai leg was flown by A330, plane was ok, entertainment screen was quite big. Food wasn't spectacular but was edible, in fact, not much different to Qantas anyway. Crew members' English were reasonable, the only negative was the fact the cabin temperature was a bit too cold.

Very disappointing experience flying with China Eastern Airlines as a family of four people. The seats on the plane were not comfortable and the space between the seats was not existent. The food was not tasty. For example dinner option included pork noodles or duck with rice. We all ordered different options but were quite dissatisfied with all of them. The flight attendants on international flight do not speak English so if you do not speak Chinese you are in a lot of trouble if you need to ask for anything. There was no entertainment system on the flight and you are not allowed to use any electronic devices including mobile phones on airplane mode. So you are basically stuck to your seat for 13 hours and your only entertainment option is Chinese newspaper. To top the list, it was very stuffy and hot and we were literally dripping with sweat during the entire flight. It is not in my nature to write negative reviews, however I thought that this might be helpful to know if you consider booking an international flight with China Eastern Airlines.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

This airline respects FFP status from their partners (Air France - KLM in my case). Arrived to HKG a bit early, and was offered to take an earlier flight, no extra cost. Access to lounges provided at all airports. Connections at Shanghai relatively smooth (no flight delays), but they parked their aircraft way off on the tarmac, so took quite a bit of time for the passengers to be bused to plane. Highlight of the trip was a free upgrade at the gate for Shanghai to Paris leg, so I cannot complain. Overall, the airline is about average in terms of in-flight entertainment and service in economy, and comparable to a Western carrier in business (they have lie-flat seats on their A330 on PVG-CDG flight). I was in the end happy with what I got; however, I have not fortunately experienced any issues while traveling, so I do not know how they handle disruption, which is where true quality of an airline is revealed, in my opinion.",Business,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,April 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Shanghai to Sydney,3.0," |  The flight was a night flight from Shanghai to Sydney. The cabin was cold throughout the whole flight. Seated in seat 70H at the rear of the plane I asked the cabin crew (both male/female) to please turn up the heating as everyone with the exception of two male western passengers had their coats on. It was freezing. Both crew members said the heating was up to 26 degrees and this has been pre-set. I exclaimed that if this was the case, why are all the passengers sitting with their coats on. I asked both of the cabin crew to ask the flight service director to pop down to see me. I was told by both that she was too busy attending to passengers in First Class. When we got off the flight in Sydney, the flight service director was saying good-bye to disembarking passengers. When I told her my plight, she proceeded to follow me up the aerobridge apologising for this oversight. She told me that no one had brought this matter to her attention. While she appeared to be very apologetic, I can honestly say that I didn't see her once coming through the cabin in economy class. People are not comfortable sitting in their seats with their coats on. I used two spare blankets to keep me warm throughout the flight. The food was below basic with the same meals served on the way up, served on the way down. The bread roll was served after the meal and not with the meal, which was a bit odd. The in-flight entertainment (IFE) was abysmal and I was told I could not use my iPhone (which was on flight mode) to listen to my music, while the Chinese passengers were using theirs. This was my second time in flying China Eastern (the last trip in 2006 on a flight from Shanghai to HK) and it will be my last. The cabin crew do not appear to have the social or cultural niceties to satisfy their customers' expectations and comfort. Another thing, we did not hear from the captain once on any of the China Eastern flight sectors. Amazing for any airline that the captains of China Eastern do not introduce themselves or give you flight updates which are left to the staff. Perhaps that's a cultural or hierarchical difference only known to them. They talk about passenger safety, they forgot to mention passenger comfort.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

Our flight stopped in Shanghai, but when we got off to switch to our Beijing flight, it has been cancelled with no explanation. Every single person has to be rebooked, and they had two people working the counter for multiple cancelled flights. Turns out a connecting flight to Osaka was also cancelled. It took hours to rebook, and everyone was stuck with nowhere to sit and no wifi, so those of us without Chinese cell phones couldn't make calls. They did put us up in a hotel, but we were in the airport for hours, followed by a roughly two-hour bus ride. It was awful. And they never explained the cancellation to either flight - or if they did, it wasn't in English. The English-speaking ticket agents didn't know the reason, either.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,December 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Shanghai,1.0," |  Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Shanghai. Original Flight 2am on 20th December. Flight took off towards Shanghai but making a detour halfway through. The captain made an announcement in Chinese that the weather in Shanghai was so bad and couldn't allow our aircraft to land. No announcement was made in English. Most of the passengers were having international flights (connecting flights in Shanghai as I did) and there were some who didn't understand Chinese at all. They only realized it the moment we landed and there was a sign saying ""welcome to KL"". The counter only had 4 ground staff (2 men, 2 women) and only one of them was capable / authorized to rebook our flights via another airline etc. One of the ground staff told us 2 total different stories as to why we are back in KLIA - airspace in Vietnam restricted our plane from entering (however, the flight next to our gate was going to Xiamen using the exact route as we were, but they are able to fly regardless) and secondly that the air crews were now unable to fly as their ""working hours were up"". After negotiating for 2-3 hours, the ground staff finally said that they could get those who can reach their destination with a direct flight to another airline. I was able to get MAS tickets to Narita but leaving around midnight that day (I'll be only reaching Narita at 7am the next day). We were also given the choice to take the same plane later that night, 9pm but we would only arrive in Narita 12 noon the next day. Those who had to make connecting flights regardless were stuck with using the same plane. Compensation was lunch buffet and resting in a room until 6pm at Pullman Hotel. Poor management of the ground staff: We were made to bring our luggage to the hotel when they told us we didn't have to. No staff followed us to the hotel or picked us up. We had no update info on the flights. My flight was further delayed, the staff at the check-in counter couldn't tell us why exactly the flight was delayed again but there was another flight to China at 9pm (but not the same flight). Food on the plane was terrible. I asked for Chinese style breakfast which was plain porridge with no condiments/sauce, no side dish whatever sort (and small portion). Even the buns only came approximately 30 mins later and are served cold (they couldn't heat the buns up in time). In-flight entertainment: a screen that drops out from the upper compartment (mine was 6 rows in front of me).",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Travelled from Toronto to Bangkok via Shanghai with China Eastern. I experienced the worst customer service, no one spoke English and everyone in Shanghai was extremely rude and unhelpful, sending us from one person to the other without solving our problem. We were forced to stay in China for 24 hours instead of the 3 hour layover that I paid for. This resulted in us missing a connecting flight from Shanghai to Bangkok (which I paid extra for just so I dont have to have a long layover). We also missed our flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui and missed 2 days of our trip in transit and lost hotel bookings in Thailand which we pre-paid. We were not compensated for anything. We had summer clothes and it was -5 C in China and no one even offered us a blanket when we told them we were cold. They sent us to a hotel that had all its windows open and it was freezing. They gave us the worst food that we could not eat it (it was 1 am so everything was closed and we couldnt buy other food). I will never fly with China Eastern again and would not recommend this company. Seats were extremely rammed and tight, you can't use some electronics even if in airplane mode at any time during the 14 hour flight.",Business,1.0,1.0

We got an extremely low fare (380 Euros for HAM-CDG-PVG-SZX) which made the choice easy. However, flying China Eastern was a relaxed expirience. The A330-200 was quite new and had spacious seats and so did the A320 on the domestic route. The IFE could have had a little more variety, but was okay even for an eleven hour flight. But bring your own headphones, the ones they distribute are a catastrophe. Food was okay as well, only criticism: I could only get one beer on the long-haul flight. The crew on the international flight was a bit rude and did not speak english very well. Nevertheless, the domestic crew was friendly. Check-In in Shenzhen was a little unorganized and we had to re-check our bags in Shanghai. On all legs, there were only minor delay (~30 Minutes PVG-CDG).

It was 10 hours into the flight when I found out we would be arriving late, so I showed my boarding pass to the staff. They were rude, and basically laughed saying I ""would not make it, need new flight"".  No one helped me. When we landed it took about 2 hours of waiting with 15 other people to find out what was happening with our connection flight. We were finally told that we were put onto a flight the next morning, 12 hours away - then to be told that this airline would not put us in a hotel for the night. $10.00 food voucher and that was it.

The flight attendants were rude and ignored us. The food was so-so. Then leaving Rome we had to buy a whole new ticket to fly with China Airlines because China Eastern did not let us know we needed a visa to stay in Moscow overnight. So when we called China Eastern to see if they could find us another flight they did nothing but look up one flight said it was booked could not refund us or give us credit for it.

The aircraft was modern and clean. The business class seat was similar to Cathay Pacific, and seats have direct aisle access and recline into a very comfortable and private flat bed.  The food I was pleasantly surprised. I'd read bad things so opted for the Chinese options. If you are flying a Chinese airline, then you would expect the Chinese food to be good and it was. One meal I would go as far to say it was delicious. On the return leg, I did try a Western option (lamb) and it was tasty.  The crew were courteous and attentive.

I arrived at LAX, and line wasn't too long but the amount of agents helped it go quickly. I checked a bag without any hassle and made my way through security. When boarding was announced they had agents holding up signs indicating where you should line up.  It was a pleasant experience and once I boarded I was surprised at how much leg room and space I had for a basic economy seat on this aircraft. Food service was mediocre but it's economy.  The in-flight entertainment had a lot of good american films but not so much tv shows. The staff spoke fairly decent English and provided very good service. The only issue I had was with China Government regulation that says people cannot operate cell phones on flights but iPads and laptops are ok?? That doesn't make sense. We arrived in Shanghai on time and departed for Hong Kong on time as well. Both flights were fine and the same level of service for the return trip. I would highly suggest China Eastern given their price. However, I always prefer a nonstop flight if I can so the layover wasn't ideal but that wasn't China Eastern's fault.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

We got off to a bad start when after my JFK - PVG flight landed I was told the Shanghai to Beijing portion was cancelled. As I collected my bags and headed up to the ticket counters to rebook, get a hotel, and wait for the next flight, I was stopped by a young man who was Airport Services looking for lost tourists and he took me to a grumpy ticket agent. A scrap of paper was handed over to me with a new flight number and time. I asked for a hotel. I was told there was no hotel because it was a domestic flight. I said I've just come in from New York, but I was told no hotel, no refund, just given a paper slip with a flight number and time handwritten on it. It gets better. When I said, I need a hotel to staff, he said he knew a place. He asked me if I had a credit card. Well, I could just get my insurance to pay for a night. He drove me to Hotel Land and negotiated a $250 AUD room with a scrummy Chinese breakfast. I paid. I was tired, in need of a shower and figured - insurance, that's why you get it. The next day, I have a 1:10pm flight and they said that getting the 10am shuttle from the hotel would mean I'd have plenty of time if there was traffic and security delays. I agreed. I did not want to be late or miss a flight. I get to the airport at 10:06am. Check in took 40 minutes. Security 10 minutes, and then the tranquility of a near dead terminal. Forty minutes until boarding and I'm ready to go. Oh - gate change, here's a boxed lunch for your trouble, flight's delayed for a bit. After all these announcements, I ask the woman next to me how long she thinks a bit of a delay will be. Her response, about four hours.  After three hours, we are hustled onto a plane that has magically appeared. We actually board. On the plane, my seat has that concave, butt dent and forward tilt that makes me want to sit on my hands, a book, anything to stop me from tilting out into the seat ahead, but it doesn't matter. I fall asleep and then a stewardess says ""We're not sure how long we're going to be here so, the captain has asked us to get off."" Its about 5 o'clock now.  Another dinner, more hours and finally  ""your flight is cancelled!"" It's 8pm. That's when the fighting starts. No rebooking. No refunds. If you want out, its $3600 to get back to Sydney.

I think the real reason is the issue with a air traffic control. Very bad experience!",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I was told to wait till the aircraft departed from Beijing. I had to stand somewhere in the termincal with my big luggage. It is terrible and I never had such ridiculous refusal of check-in. After standing almost 30 minutes, I was pointed to a check-in manager, who helped me get my boarding pass and luggage checked in. Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. Flight was smooth and service on board quite attentive. Seat was old version of business class seat, which was used as first class for domestic flight.

First we had to wait another hour for the luggages, after that we was transferred to a hotel, and had to wait another hour for a room. Sunday at 01:20 i finaly got a room.

The female cabin attendants keep shouting loudly to passengers seated on aisle seats ""Be careful, Be careful!"" as they pass by pushing food/drink wagons, instead of ""Excuse me!"" Their level of English proficiency is very low. Almost none of them speak Japanese, either. No information is given by China Eastern on Internet that passengers with economy tickets must pay for wine on international flights. No charge for beer, however. The flight from Xian to Shanghai on Aug. 7 was delayed more than 90 minutes; however, no explanations for the delay were made available to passengers at all. Consequently, I missed my connecting flight 539 from Shanghai to Tokyo Haneda. Again, I was left in complete limbo as to if I would be able to get on another flight. And if so, which flight?

First, my connection flight was cancelled but this was written nowhere. The next available flight (Shanghai to  Beijing, not exactly an uncommon route) they propose me is 5 hours after the one I had. Then, this flight was late, God knows for how long, because not only it was not signaled on the departure boards until one hour after it was meant to leave. I asked if it was possible to know more or less, I didn't needed the exact time, just if we were talking about 1 or 5 hours. Staff said that they had no idea.

I went to the check-in counter again at 172 0hrs, the check-in staff told me to wait till 1830hrs, saying that the flight is delayed. To my understanding, there is priority check-in for business class and first class passenger. Passengers of these priority class should be checked in, even in the flight delayed situation. They can be comfortably hosted in business lounge, not just waiting uncomfortably in all passenger waiting place. I have travelled with many airlines in business class, and I am very comfortable with their hospitality. The Beijing airport check in is the worst of all.

Cannot use cell phone in airplane mode as well, but can use a laptop (dont get this logic either). Worst of all I was told that I would claim the baggage in Kathmandu (final destination) during my checking in Denver, but they made me claim the baggage in Kunming where I had to stay with my luggage for 17 hours layover. The return flight was as painful as the going one where I had to stay with my checked luggage for 12 hours in Kunming and 3 hours security check in qingdao. The flight experience is total disaster -  when the flight attendant asks you to close the window and if you open in between, they come and yell at you, if they tell you open the window and if you close it, they come and yell; if you ask for additional food or drinks after the serving time, they tell you its over - and zero customer service.

A330,Economy Class,1.0,July 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Seoul to San Francisco via Qingdao,3.0," |  Seoul to San Francisco via Qingdao. I am doing this review for the sake of the passengers who are thinking of taking China Eastern Airlines as their carrier to their next destination. Your hard earned money will never be worth it by flying this company. The outbound flight from San Francisco to Seoul Korea via Pudong Airport was seamless.  However, you cannot check in online if the ticket you purchased was not directly from their website. Check in in San Francisco was prompt. No hotel accommodation if you are changing flights between two different airports. I used the Mercure Hotel outside of Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai. The return flight was the most horrifying. First, the check in agent could not use my ticket. Someone perhaps already “checked me in online”. I have informed the check in agent that I have not done so, and basically they are calling me a liar for saying that. The whole ordeal of trying to figure out what happened to my reservation, after calling the Shanghai office, took about an hour; just to sort out the problem of which CE could have handled properly. The hotel accommodation I was provided was located at the outskirts of Pudong. I was arriving at Hongqiao about 9:45 p.m. local time, and the travel between these two airport is about an hour with no traffic. The person who picked me up transported me into a family size car with no signs whatsoever that it partners or contracts with CEA. One will be freaked out if they do not put enough courage to trust the driver and staff who spoke no English. Handsome Hotel in New Pudong Area, this hotel makes you feel as if you were in North Korea. Morning came as I connect to my other flight, I made it Qingdao. My flight from Qingdao to San Francisco was scheduled to depart at 12:30 p.m. local time. 12:00 p.m. came, no announcement that the flight will be delayed. No reason, no staff, no explanation. One, two, three hours passed no staff to explain to their passengers what the deal is. You get one staff who spoke only Chinese and a bit frustrated if you ask her to translate in English whatever she just announced in the paging system. Finally we were provided with packed meal with a whole bunch of preserved side dishes. Still no explanations as to why our flight is delayed. Came 8 o’clock p.m., finally our plane was on-sight and the gate agents started to finally show up. Passengers were aggravated and just angry about the whole ordeal. CEA should always  put a gate agent or a customer service representative to provide information regarding up to the minute information about the flight. We were left out with no clue for 8 hours, we were not allowed to leave the airport because our passports were already stamped as “departed” and we were not allowed to do so by the immigration officials. We were delayed for a total of 9 hours, with no palatable meal, no explanation, no sense of compassion from the staff about our flight. At 8:30 p.m. we boarded the flight to San Francisco and some of the passengers became very physically obnoxious to the CEA agents. I could only understand their frustration. CEA should not even be in business if they continue to observe this kind of business relationship with its customers.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

There was a selection of Hollywood movies as well as Chinese movies. Some of the foreign movies had English subtitles, some did not. There was also some Chinese TV but very few American shows. There was no WiFi on my flight, and they ban cell phone use. The staff was courteous and understood English, but don't expect to have a conversation with them. This flight was overnight. My main gripe was that they would turn on all the lights in the cabin and make announcements every 4 hours or so to serve food, even in the middle of the night. The food selection was hit or miss. They had the option of Western or Chinese food and some sodas to pick from or tea. They came through the cabin every hour or two to serve water. Overall, exceeded my expectations and I would fly with them again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Return flight on 26 Sept. delayed from 2am to 4am and sat in departure lounge until 4am and then told to come back for 10am departure, only given $4 food voucher for burger King! We were told bad weather in Shanghai (checked online and 32 deg and raining only). So they delayed telling us to come back at 10am to avoid the 8 hour hour notice to avoid giving us hotel. Left at 10am and arrived at Shanghai 3pm, connecting flight at 12:15 pm was missed. No signs or help from ground staff. After 2 hours manged to get flight for next day at 9am via Tokyo to Toronto. Again had to queue for visa and then then for hotel. No one spoke a word of English! After another 3 hours (9pm now) put on bus to hotel 50 mins away. Arrived at 9.50 pm and after getting room got a terrible meal, and told them I need to leave by bus at 6 am. Slept at 11.45 pm but hotel manager banged on door at 4.55am telling me to check out and take bus for 5 am. No time so missed 5am bus and waited for 6.30am bus (again no food). Bus broke down 10 km from airport at 7.30am!. No explanation no instructions!. So flagged a taxi and taxi took me to wrong terminal even after I showed him the flight info! By now its 8.15am so scrambled and pushed my way through security and immigration to board plane at 8.50am. Relief but not for long - my seat screen not working.

Staff are terrible, can barely speak English, food is inedible, no spirits are available, customer care is non existent, entertainment systems are extremely poor, cabin was dirty etc Etc. We are Qantas platinum frequent flyers - we agreed to fly with China Eastern after being assured that our Platinum status points/frequent flyer points would be equal to those given on Qantas and that we would have the same level of service. This was a downright lie - no status credits, barely any points ans non existent service. I was horrified at the lack of care from the China Eastern staff - they clearly don't care about the customer, they turn the lights off as soon as the first ""meals"" are served and you are expected to simply be quiet for the remainder of the flight. We fly home on Tuesday and I am dreading the flight. I thought Jetstar was the most budget-style airline you could get, but CEA takes the cake. The worst part about it is that the Qantas flights were actually cheaper. I've learnt my lesson, never ever again! Avoid at all costs.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

The worst part was our treatment in Shanghai, we had to spend 18 hours in Shanghai and the airline did not provide any food or accommodation and did not take care of food preferences on the next day flight. Worst of all, they asked for money to store out luggage for extra 18 hours as if it was our fault that were stranded there. Our flight from Delhi to Shanghai was delayed by 6 hours. We were provided food vouchers but no place to stay in a lounge. This was inconvenient, but treatment was okay. Our layover in Shanghai was only 1.5 hours, so we missed Shanghai - San Francisco flight. They put us on the next day's flight, meaning we had to stay at the airport for 18-19 hours. They did not provide any accommodation even though we asked for it repeatedly. We are from India and eat vegetarian food, and no food was provided for all 18 hours. They asked us for 13,000 INR (about 200 USD) for storing our luggage for 18 hours. That is ridiculous.  We did not pay. As a result, they gave our luggage back and we had to check it in again the next day!  Our preference for Shanghai to SFO was vegetarian food, but they said in the next day flight that the preference applied to last day's flight only, and they don't have any vegetarian food.

He did not smile at all, other than when he asked his assistant to explain to me that they didn't know where my bags were and that there was no lounge in Beijing. When I was boarding, I was the 2nd in line. When I reached the counter, another male ground staff member snapped at me to stand to the side. I watched as dozens of Economy class passengers passed through. When I asked what was wrong, he snapped back at me, again while looking at the table rather than at me, that Business class passengers had a VIP bus. Then when there were no economy class passengers left, he let me through. When I reached the boarding access-way we had to go down the stairs. A female ground-staff member asked for my boarding pass, and when she saw that I was a Business Class passenger she shouted to the bottom of the stairs, what I presume to be “He’s Business Class, he’s Business Class”. When I reached the bottom of the stairs I was directed away from the transport bus which was right there, to another bus about 20m away between some pylons and other things on the tarmac.

After long time waiting, we were given 2 options: one to fly the next afternoon and the other to fly to WUX, an airport 150km away from Shanghai. When asking possibilities to transit somewhere, I was told that MU can only fly us once to any airports we wanted and we had to pay for additional flights to PVG. What a joke! We had to accept flying to WUX. We sat in the lounge from 6PM to 2:30AM before flight took off at 3:00AM. To my most surprise, after 10:30PM, there was no staff in the lounge and there were no snacks or food any more. There were only very loud automatic announcements saying “We are sorry to announce that flight… was delayed or cancelled” repeated endlessly. Arriving at WUX, we booked a taxi to Shanghai, of course paying all costs ourselves. I recommend to take airlines other than MU should you wish to travel in China. HU and CZ are much much better.

I have to say I was motivated to write this review in large part due to the generally negative reviews I had read on China Eastern prior to taking my first flight. These reviews are so negative I almost cancelled my booking to use Avios points on Cathay. However on actually flying them I was truly impressed by the flight. The seat is excellent and felt the same as the one I had flown on in Air France recently (also excellent). I managed 9 hours of sleep, a record for me. The service was professional if a little robotic although the FA constantly checked if I needed anything else during meal service. Once meal service was done the FAs pretty much disappeared until breakfast although there was a self service food station left out. Entertainment system was limited but that’s my only negative.",Business,5.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,nan,May 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Edmonton to Kathmandu,1.0," |  Vancouver to Kathmandu via Kunming.  In February this year, my husband and I found a great deal on a flight to Nepal for $903.61CAD. The flight was with China Eastern Airlines, booked through Flighthub. We thought it was too good to be true, we were right. Icouldn't find any reasons as to why the tickets were so cheap, so we purchased them and began to plan our trek through Nepal. The itinerary clearly stated 2 layovers, one in Vancouver, and one in Kunming China. We would fly Vancouver to Kunming China (arriving at 19:25) where we would have an overnight layover. Our flights to Kathmandu left the next day at 16:05. I made sure to  research the Visa requirements for China and we did not require a Visa for this layover. I booked our hotel in Kunming for our overnight stay. Fast forward to our departure date. We flew from Edmonton to Vancouver without any problems. As we were waiting at our gate to board our flight, I was paged to come to the boarding podium (10 minutes prior to boarding). I was informed by the China Eastern  attendant that my husband and I would not be allowed to board the flight as we did not have Visas for China. I explained to her that we did not need them as we were flying into and departing from the same city, and we were in China for less than 24 hours. She then informed me that there was an additional layover in Guangzhou, which put us in the country for 26 hours (2 hours over our time allowed without a Visa). I was furious and demanded an explanation as to how an additional layover (that makes the difference between being able to enter a country or not) was not listed on our itinerary. The attendant just shrugged and told us to downstairs to the China Eastern Air ticket desk. We watched our flight to China depart as we scrambled through the airport to find the desk. Upon arrival we were greeted with someone who I can only assume was a robot. We explained our situation numerous times and requested to be reassigned to a flight that could get us to Nepal. The attendant found numerous flights that would get us there, but refused to book us as she said we had to call  China Eastern air even though we were standing right in front of her. The only thing she could say was ""sorry"" with a shoulder shrug, over and over and over. We called, and low and behold, we were transferred to another robot with three phrases ""Im sorry"" ""I don't know"" and ""I can't."" So as my husband attempted to sort things on the phone with the China Eastern rep, I called a Flighthub rep. The Flighthub rep informed me that this was China Eastern's fault and that they needed to fix the situation, while the lady at the desk is telling me that it is Flighthub's problem. The Flighthub rep asked me if he could speak directly to the China Eastern desk rep so I handed her my phone and informed her that he wanted to speak with her. She threw up her hands and kept saying ""NO,"" refusing to take my phone. This went back and forth, each attendant blaming the other, acting like a bunch of children.. Meanwhile, the only solution that the China Eastern rep (on phone) had was that we could get on the exact  same flight in two days from that time, which would leave us with the same Visa problem. Not a solution at all. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,July 2017,2.0,1.0,3.0,no,San Francisco to Osaka via Shanghai,2.0," |  San Francisco to Osaka via Shanghai. Flying with China Eastern was the worst airline experience I've ever had. On my way back to the United States from Japan, I was told at check-in that although my reservation was supposed to be Osaka > Kunming > San Francisco, that I would actually be stopping in Shanghai for a quick plane change before going to Kunming. I asked them if I needed a 3rd boarding pass for that in-between time or if they could provide an itinerary with the times and they said it would be unnecessary because it wasn't a full layover and staff would help us once we were in Shanghai. When I got to Shanghai, we had to go through Chinese customs. All of us with this route were taken together by staff. However, I was the only non-Chinese citizen and was held back. They said they needed my new boarding pass or an itinerary to let me through. I went to the China Eastern desk in Shanghai to see if they would provide this, they refused, so I went back to customs. Basically I kept being sent back and forth between customs and the China Eastern desk for hours that I eventually got left by staff and all the other passengers were taken to Kunming and I was left stranded in Shanghai with no clue what to do. After about 6 hours of this they finally re-booked me on a direct flight back to San Francisco from Shanghai. But the staff was extremely rude and yelled at me for not forcing my way through customs (although all they needed to do was print my itinerary for me and it wouldn't have been a problem). After being re-booked I was taken to another area to wait for another hour for a shuttle to take me to a hotel (it was about 1am at this point). The shuttle finally came and it was an unmarked van driven by two casually dressed men. I waited in the shuttle for an hour with no update about where we were going and when we were leaving. Eventually other passengers started being loaded in. They filled up the van completely, with people standing in corners (and once again, this is just a normal van, not a bus or anything meant to be stood inside of). We got to the hotel and the hotel told us that we were going to have to share rooms with other passengers. Luckily there were some Chinese people in the group who knew they were just trying to scam us and talked the hotel staff into giving us our own rooms. Therefore, it's clear what sort of sketchy hotel China Eastern had chosen for us. Luckily the next morning I was able to get out on my new flight but only after about 8 hours of being mistreated by their staff. I will never fly them again no matter how cheap and would never suggest anyone else do either.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,October 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Vancouver to Delhi via Shanghai,1.0," |  Vancouver to Delhi via Shanghai with my family (my two daughters 9 and 2 yrs, my wife). On check-in I requested to give me front seat, they denied to me, told me its 1st come 1st serve. After boarding they serve dinner. I already booked Asian vegeterian meals which was confirmed. But they served my family non veg. I showed my itenary which shows all veg meal confirmed. They told me they dont have any information about it. Then they serve us a dessert, rice, pok choy and bread roll - we returned our meal. After 9 hour they serve the meal again, and I thought the crew will find some veg meal for us as we were super busy ate nothing for last 12 hours. But at the end I find all the pessengers were served meal except us. I ask them where is our meal, they replied only non veg left and run away. It was disgusting they know we are vegetarian - they even dont try to serve fruits or some veg salads. I asked one of the crew member to call the supervisior or give me the complaint book, and finally she went and bring two asian vegeterian meal. I was shocked they told me they dont have this meal twice, and only when i got mad they give me this meal. Also most of the crew dont know the basic English, it was hard to communicate with them.
