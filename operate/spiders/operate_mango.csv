nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Johannesburg to Durban,1.0," | I have had endless problems with Mango Airlines on multiple consecutive occasions. I try and make payment for a flight booking on their website and I am informed that there was an error with payment, payment has not been processed and I do not receive a booking confirmation. Yet I receive a notice from my bank informing me payment has been processed and allocated to Mango. After phoning the bank and receiving an authorization code Mango still insists they have not received payment and refuse to issue me a booking confirmation. This is after waiting more than 30 minutes for someone to answer their phone. This has happened every time I try to phone and with every department. The staff are very helpful and have a nonchalant attitude, not really caring or helping to help resolve the issue. One person that assisted me informed me that the website was down but as soon as the website is operational again I will automatically receive my booking confirmation. After a few hours I still had not received the confirmation. Mango simply say they have not received payment, they cannot issue a booking confirmation. This has happened twice in a row. Shocking service, I will never use this airline again.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The return flight to Johannesburg was delayed by over an hour due to mechanical problems. On our return Johannesburg  we were delayed due to the exit bays not attached and luggage was delayed. Our connecting flight was with kulula at 8.50pm we missed, and Mango did not offer any compensation. With 2 young children we were told they cannot help us, stranded at the airport with no other flights or accommodation. Very upset after a family vacation.",Family Leisure,5.0,3.0

nan,Economy Class,4.0,March 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Johannesburg to Cape Town,2.0," |  Johannesburg to Cape Town. The worst service and customer relations I've encountered.I am from overseas and was staying in Johannesburg with family. My cousin and I wanted to go visit another family member in Cape Town and Mango ended up being the cheapest for me; whilst for my cousin another airline was cheaper so we were flying separately but at similar times so as to meet up in Cape Town. Then during the day I received an SMS saying my flight was delayed from 19:30 to 21:30. This was quite frustrating because (as mentioned above) I was due to land at the same time as my cousin in Cape Town; but would now only be taking off as she landed. Frustrating, but not the end of the world. Next thing I receive another SMS saying the flight was further delayed and would now only be taking off at 23:30 - a 4 hour delay meaning my cousin would need to travel on as it wouldn't be fair to expect her to sit and wait for 4 hours while she could be with family as we were only in Cape Town for a weekend. I then get another SMS saying the flight is delayed and a different time is provided. I cannot recall this time although it was earlier than 21:30, but at this stage I'm so frustrated I plan on just heading to the airport to find out what's going on as it seems nothing is really clear. When I get to the airport I wait in the queue and receive my boarding pass and try to ask what the issue is and why everything is delayed. I explain that I'm meant to be travelling in convoy with my cousin and that we only have the weekend in Cape Town so these delays are somewhat frustrating. I am told that the ""we were down"" (whatever that means?) and that there's nothing to be done. I then go meet my cousin who is busy trying to check in, only to discover that they've now also got 2 different times on my boarding pass (19:30 - the original time & 21:30 - the supposed new time) so now I have to go back to a line where heaps of people are queuing as there are many delays (and many complaints) to clarify what time my flight actually will be. In the end, we got to Cape Town. Once back in Johannesburg, before leaving the country again I receive and SMS stating that Mango apologised for the delay; and says we can call them for assistance. I discovered they were willing to pay R250.00 for the inconvenience. As I was leaving the country, I decided to email them and find out whether this was applicable to overseas service users; and if so how that may work. I emailed 8 times and never received any response. Whilst I understand that the offer of a voucher as a gesture of good will due to the delays is non-obligatory, it is really frustrating that they never answer their emails and on top of such terrible service. It almost seems like a tactic used to ensure that not all affected and offered recompense are able to make use of such, therefore saving the company money. It would have been preferable to be given a discount on the flight that was delayed; or even vouchers to use on board for on board refreshments.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Cape Town to Lanseria,1.0," |  Cape Town to Lanseria. Probably the my worst experience. The counter system is so bad. It takes all mango flights to where ever in the country. No destination names are on the boards so everyone queues in the same line. Then to top it off I was told why I missed my flight, because I ""late"" when I was standing in the queue. There's a silent policy in the airport so no announcements are made.  Any ways I told some one comes around to tell you when flights a board. No one came to me and asked me, so I missed my flight. I had to pay again although the flight had not taken off. No help was offered. So I had to wait from 14:00 until 19:00 for my standby flight. Was this worth it, well if you from the UK and intend using this flight forget it.  To top it off the flight was delayed for another hour and no one could inform you what was going on. Really not the service I expect from a cheap airlines.",Business,1.0,nan

I landed in Durban, picked up my luggage and on loading my luggage into our car, noticed a large tear down the side of my luggage. We had already paid for our parking and drove straight home, with the intention to lay a complaint with Mango. Mango did not respond to phone calls nor our emails. My dad eventually had a response from Mango ""Customer Care"" where they  fobbed us off. Numerous repeat emails to Mango solved nothing. They then forwarded the email to the head of customer care who promised to look into the matter. Never heard back from him either. True to Mango standards - they ignored us!

My flight was scheduled for 17:30, I was meant to arrive home at around 18:30. I only arrived at 20:35 - the flight was delayed, and apparently they had multiple issues. But then, if I leave the airport at 18:45 which was the delayed time, surely I'd arrive no later than 8?  Everything was so slow and delayed, especially compared to my previous experience with Safair 2 days before, where it so quick and smooth. I will never fly mango again.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,nan,4.0,nan,no,Durban to Cape Town,4.0," |  Durban to Cape Town. Sometimes it costs a staff member nothing, to save a customer a lot of trouble. Flight JE361 was late, but that's not a big thing. However Mango didn't give a revised arrival time. We waited with our cellphones, to sms or call our families and change itineraries. I did not hear it announced once! Then they told us to turn our cellphones off! I asked the air hostess  very politely what the arrival time was, as I needed to sms my wife before turning my phone off. She said: ""You cannot tell. Anything can happen during the flight. You must turn your cellphone off now."" I asked again (saying ""please"") for any time I could use. She said only: ""We don't know. The captain will announce it later"". I began explaining that (again, ""please""!) we could not communicate later with our phones on flight mode, but she walked away while I was speaking without saying anything. She was treating me (and everyone actually) pretty badly. In fact, she didn't seem to care at all about anyone on the plane's trip. I remember thinking what a rude lady! (At the same time, the Mango voice came on the intercom, saying that ""if there is anything our staff can do, to make your trip more comfortable, please do not hesitate "" etc. Well it couldn't have sounded more ironic) When leaving at the end of the flight, I told her that she'd messed up my trip unnecessarily and treated us badly. She then said again: ""It's about the flight time right? We cannot know how long a trip will be. Anything can happen in the air"". When I replied that they did seem to know how long routes would be, as they gave us arrival times when flights were NOT delayed, she said (incorrectly): ""But I told you it would be two hours and five minutes"". This was a lie, and also contradicted her previous statement, that they didn't know flight times. She and her colleague started writing a complaint form statement, that I doubt will be any more coherent, accurate or honest than their verbal statements. They were now both being quite rude and snappy. It was time to leave before things went down-hill! It's cheapness is not worth the unpleasantness.",Business,1.0,nan

When checking in at the counter we were greeted by a very unfriendly lady who did not even smile. On weighing our bags we were 1.6 kg overweight between the two of us, which works out to 0.8 kg over weight per person. She told us that we would have to pay excess. We told her can't we get a concession as it's less than a kg each and or bags were bubble wrapped so we couldn't remove anything. She refused and we asked to speak to the manager. Instead of calling the manager she called a colleague of hers who was equally unpleasant. We explained that the excess weight was so minimal and we didn't even have hand luggage and then she told us to take our bags off of her counter and find someoene else to help us at another counter. In we end we had to wait to go to another counter and paid the excess of 0.8 kg for each of us. After this incident we will never use Mango again.",Business,2.0,nan

Taking into account that the Mango plane was the only plane there and that it was a 2 min walk from the plane to the baggage reclaim I was sorely tempted to walk back to the plane and get the bag off myself. As for Cape Town there were 4 conveyors to pick from but they loaded/mixed the bags on the conveyor that had baggage from another flight hence major confusion.

Kulula are also a budget airline but I have always been treated with some empathy from them when I mention my 23kg suitcase and 2 items of carryon (overnight bag and separate laptop) are associated with a longhaul flight.

The flight back on 7 July 2017 was delayed, and, it was not a good introduction to Mango. But I flew down on Mango today to Durban again. On time, the airplane was so comfortable and neat! It was a pleasure to be greeted with so much flair by the cabin crew.The photo I took was an added bonus.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

I checked in at 17.30 (departing time 19.15), on thát moment Mango already knew that our plane was delayed. Nobody give us that info! At 19.00: 1 hour later departing time. We told the crew that we had a international flight at 23.59. 'No worries, we will phone your company'. At 20.00 one hour extra. 'No worries', we arrived 23.45 in JNB, to late for our plane! Searching for a hotel, a taxi, costs for the new ticket, eating + drinking in the 24 hours we had to wait for our next flight? Mango didn't help one single moment. We get a voucher 300 Rand/23€ for our next Mango flight, now - never again!!",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

I called them, and they checked if the booking got through. They said it did not and said that I should make the booking again, so I did. I got one booking confirmation and was satisfied until I saw my credit card was charged twice. In my contact with Mango I asked for a refund. They did not answer my e-mails. Only 4 days before the flight, they sent the booking details of the second booking, the one that I don't need. I am dissatisfied with this service. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,November 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,JNB to PLZ,3.0," |  Yesterday returning from Port Elizabeth back to Johannesburg after a long day of meetings I again realised why I never fly Mango Airlines (SAA). You must have the most unfriendly staff of any airline. Out of my more than 100 local South African flights this year, I have been on Mango 4 times. You must be doing very well to not care about retaining clients. I will only from now on fly with Mango if nothing else is available.",Business,1.0,1.0

I have flown with Mango quite a few times in the year, and almost every single time they are 10-15 minutes late. This is considering that they are apparently the most on time domestic flight in South Africa for the past seven years. Clearly not always on time.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,July 2016,nan,1.0,nan,no,JNB to PLZ,nan," |  Me and my wife went to South Africa for my honeymoon, and bought a flight ticket with Mango to go from Johannesburg OR Tambo to Port Elizabeth. I've bought it back in February. The flight was scheduled to July 16 at 5 PM. We arrived at the airport at 2 PM, and came to check-in. There we were told that the flight was changed to 1:15 PM, so it was already gone! Talking to their supervisor, she said that they sent me and my wife an email telling that, but neither of us got it. I've told them to forward me that email, so I could see it with the time it was sent, but they didn't do that. They said they could sent us on next day's flight, but we would need to pay most part of the value anyways + hotel + food. As we planned our whole trip in advance, we already had a car rented in Port Elizabeth, and also a hotel booked there. After all that, we ended up getting a car in Johannesburg, drive until Bloemfontein, get a new hotel there, and then drive on next day right to Plattenberg Bay, as it was our next booked hotel after Port Elizabeth. A big cost due to this Mango problem. Honestly I believe that errors happens. What got me mad there was the situation where they didn't want to assume their mistake, and made me pay for all that - after all, I needed to pay for the car fuel (thanks Hertz for allowing us to get the car we rented for Port Elizabeth in Johannesburg), the already booked hotel, the new hotel. And also the flight tickets that we already paid previously! I expected more from Mango Airlines with good reviews all over the Internet.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,June 2016,nan,1.0,nan,yes,CPT to JNB,3.0,"We fly Mango Airlines from Cape Town to Johannesburg weekly. The online booking and check in are very user friendly and the inflight attendants are very friendly. But in the past couple of weeks Mango flights have frequently been delayed. We were delayed by 3 hours on Monday and were offered a R250 voucher? I can understand that flights are sometimes delayed but if delayed by hours, surely they should send out emails or sms's instead of allowing passengers to check in and then announce the delay with the result that you are stuck at the airport and obliged to wait on the other side of security control. The other problem Mango have is that they don't communicate with their passengers. They call for boarding and then make you stand in line for 40 minutes without a word of explanation. When you ask you get a rude lie from the floor attendant like they are waiting for buses etc., or there has been a plane change when in fact there is not even a plane yet.",Business,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,March 2016,2.0,1.0,nan,no,CPT to JNB,3.0," |  Cape Town to Johannesburg. The ground handling and customer service on Mango Airlines are completely hopeless. Not only did they manage to forget to load my bicycle, which meant it didn't arrive in time for my connecting flight to London, but they also consistently gave me the brush-off when I complained. When I (not the airline) managed to trace my bicycle 4 days later, I had to lobby hard to get it on a flight to the UK, and was then charged a fee to have it delivered. The wrote a letter of complaint and requested an explanation and compensation; the reply from Mango suggested I was to blame. Further letters and emails have gone unanswered by the airline. They are an inexpensive airline, that is true; however, if you value your luggage, I would steer well clear and fly with an airline with a more credible and helpful customer service policy.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The Mango Airlines cabin and ground crew were friendly and accommodating, whilst the leg room was incredible! I mean seriously impressive - if only all airlines offered this sort of space I'd be a much happier traveller. The whole experience puts European budget airlines to shame. I'd certainly recommend them.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
