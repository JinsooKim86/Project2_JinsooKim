A330,Economy Class,5.0,August 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Colombo to Melbourne,2.0, |  Reasonably good airline due to direct flight from Melbourne to Colombo return. The aircraft seems to be old. On our way up our seat 22K was faulty with meal tray practically hanging off the seat. I was forced to sit in another seat away from my wife. The seats are narrow and very uncomfortable. The plan was on time and arrived online at destination. Very encouraging. Service was good and meals are acceptable. One of the breakfast was egg omelette but it was almost egg soup. The staff are great. I will recommend the airline to travellers from Melbourne to Sri Lanka.,Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

Excellent flight, most passengers including me choose to sleep rather than take dinner, was a past midnight departure. Crew were very professional, aircraft was a bit old but business class was great, good movies, good breakfas , bags took long time to arrive but more a Melbourne airport issue than the airline.

Firstly, the food was not so good but I am OK with it. Seats were not comfortable at all, but it looks clean and neat. Entertainment were OK. Some of the cabin crew acted that they do not want or like to work in that airline. Rude cabin crew, zero hospitality, poor service.

Serendib lounge at Colombo Airport has seen better days, but there'a good buffet and travelers are entitled to free showers and a 15-minute head massage. As I had a 7:50 am flight the lounge was not crowded. This flight makes do with the older A330-200 with adjoining seats. I lucked out and had both seats to myself.

A330-200,Business Class,3.0,July 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Melbourne to Colombo,4.0," | Overall I would say good but not excellent. The Aircraft registration showed the plane was manufactured in 1999, so getting close to 20 years old and it showed. It's a shame Sri Lankan doesn't use their newer A330-300's on this route, but I guess most of the traffic is holiday. The seating is fine and flat bed allows proper sleep. Crew were mixed, some great, others very surly, even up front. Food and beverages good, could improve on timing, 4pm take off and a full dinner is served with an hour and then another dinner 6 hours later, with 3 hours still to run. Movies good, headphones average. Sri Lankan has a great product overall but the difference in cabin lay out and amenities between the A330-300's and 200's is stark and needs to be consistent if you want to be airline of choice.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,4.0,July 2018,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes,London to Colombo,2.0," | London to Colombo. This is the only airline that has a direct daily service between London Heathrow and Colombo. The aircraft used was the Airbus A330. I did not find the seats particularly comfortable for this 11hr flight. The in-flight entertainment content – movies, TV, tourism was adequate for my requirements. However, there was only one USB socket that worked in the 8 seats around me. The headphone socket was very loose and I had to be very careful in the insertion. The cabin crew showed big smiles when they started off and they tried their best to do their work. They were formal and attentive but not warm. The food was adequate and unremarkable. Later in the flight, the toilet floor was wet. On both legs, the flight was uneventful and arrived on time. I would rate this airline as full service but functional in standards. I would certainly fly this airline again more because it is a direct flight to Colombo from London than the quality of service and airplane.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

A340 on the CMB-FCO flight was in better shape despite being one of the older aircraft in the fleet. Seats were rock hard. Crew were somewhat disinterested on this flight.

There is no IFE on this flight of 4 1/2 hours duration - not even a route map displayed on an overhead screen (although all seat armrests had IFE controls fitted). You cannot lift any armrests so even if you have three seats of a row to yourself there is no way you could lie down across all seats. Catering is basic. A carton of fruit juice or water from the trolley prior to the meal service. The meal tray was about A4 size and was populated by a lone and small aluminium food container with a cardboard lid plus a set of plastic cutlery. Contents: three small morsels of chicken plus rice.

Dubai to Colombo sector on old A340-300 (4R-ADB) and must say that the ground handling agent in Dubai for UL lacks customer service for a flight with 300 plus passengers we were put in a mini gate in Dubai. Boarding was chaotic and since families were asked to board first we literally had to manoeuvre our way into the aerobridge as travelers without families were blocking the entrance and ground staff did not do much to ease the boarding process. Aircraft was worn out and looked tired my IFE did not work for the rest of the 2 hr journey no AVOD at all. Food and beverage took ages to be served and must say that the meal wasn't that tasty. Service on the other hand was alright with the usual smiling presence on-board. As for the CMB-DXB we were on the re-furbished A34-300 with new interiors and AVOD. This time food was good and so was the service. UL crew lived up to the expectations they were friendly and helpful and most importantly responded every request promptly and with a genuine smile.

Yes its true UL has not the newest fleet not the most advanced seats not the best IFES but they provide what many other carriers lack; service from the heart unpretentious and warm. And their simple but very tasty food is a good break from the usual nonsense of a long list of wines and fancy food which usually does not taste that good after re-heating anyway.

Unfortunately the flight was a let down. The plane really needs updating. The overhead CRT screen rattled above us for the whole 10 hour flight. The entertainment system was archaic. The headphone jack for the entertainment system doesn't allow you to use your own headphones the audio didn't work anyway so no entertainment on a 10 hour flight. The food was ok. They didn't have landing cards - luckily I was in transit. But the deal breaker for me is the reliability of this airline granted my flight was only an hour late but my wife's flight is 5 hours late today.

Staff very attentive food excellent with choice of Sri Lankan and Western cuisine including vegetarian option. Impressive leg room although there is an IFE box on all window seats which prevents you from stretching your legs underneath the seat in front. IFE is old fashioned streamed and not on demand and requires updating and increasing in content for such a long flight. Outbound flight arrived early even though it was late leaving. Inbound flight on time take off. Boarded by seat numbers no advance boarding for families with small children. Crew attentive available and on both sectors it should be noted that there were snacks and sandwiches served between meals which was great. Free drinks were plentiful. Arrived almost an hour early at Heathrow but had to queue for landing. Sri Lankan offer the only direct flight from London to Colombo so if travelling with children and do not want to hassle of a stopover then this is your obvious choice even though it is marginally more expensive than alternative carriers via a Middle East stop.

Meals were quite tasty and service was quite good but the IFE really let the experience down with very limited selections. In addition my touchscreen kept freezing but there was nothing they could do as the cabin was full. Fortunately the problem fixed itself after a while.

Service was great and food was good but entertainment was limited to a few movies. On my return trip UL 554 with the same aircraft as my flight to Frankfurt and new business class seats there was a little problem with the air conditioner so I couldn't sleep so well. Flight arrived one hour early and left early so I had 3 hours to transit at Colombo for UL 422 to Bangkok. Again delayed almost one hour as the flight arrived late from Dammam. The entertainment functioned well this aircraft was the first introduced with new business class as it was the one only working with safety videos before take off.

On the outward journey the plane was so old it had ashtrays and awful seats which were definitely not adequate for long-haul by today's standards. On top of which the TV was in the seatback of the seat in front so consequently when they reclined you could not see the screen. My screen only worked on 1 channel so I had 1 film to watch on an 11 hour flight and my husband's TV didn't work at all. On the return journey it could not have been more different. Excellent lie-flat beds great food great amount of channels to watch superb flight! I suggest you ring the airline before hand to check that the aircraft will be a lie-flat before you book!,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,4.0,LHR to Colombo return. A340 on outward flight - cabin felt cramped compared. Clearly a fairly old aircraft that was showing its age in the cabin and lavatories. No soap in the lavatory and when I asked for some the response was rather surly! Same can be said of the general attitude of the flight attendants on this leg. In general the in-flight service was slow and not particularly friendly. Inflight entertainment is on a loop and several large old style TVs complimented the seat back screens. Return leg on an A330 which felt more spacious although seat pitch was the same I believe. Service a little less surly than the outward leg. Good briefing from Captain - clear and informative which makes a change. New choice of movies from outward flight - very limited selection though and nothing that appealed to me but this is of course a highly subjective area. Tried to buy duty free - again it was possible but I the surly attitude prevailed and I was treated very much as if I was making an out of the ordinary request! Overall surly cabin crew on both legs and flights were OK but nothing really stands out - a little bit of effort from the cabin crew and some updating of the aircraft and they would be in a much better position.,nan,3.0,nan

Dedicated generic fast track check in and security area in Abu Dhabi worked very well and check in to lounge took less than 5 minutes. A320 is just over a year old unfortunately the interior is already showing its age. The leather on the seats was dirty and I used my hot towel to clean grime off the arms of the seat. Friendly welcome by crew and great service with drinks being filled up regularly. This A320 flight leaves AUH at 2230 and therefore most people want to sleep. Dinner service a little slow and when the main courses did come mine was stone cold. Unfortunately my first choice wasn't available the passenger across the aisle got the last one. Dedicated J class bus in Colombo to main terminal. Return journey J class passengers can avail of the silk route lounge where you are checked in by an agent while seated brought through a dedicated security kiosk in the lounge and escorted to the Serendib lounge airside. Service on the return was friendly the dinner was delicious.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,Return flight FRA-CMB-BKK-CMB-FRA in Business. Booking process very smooth online was looking forward to their new business class at least on part of flights but all 4 flights were in the old business class. Nevertheless it was a surprisingly good experience. Priority check-in/priority lane on security check and boarding worked well on all 4 flights warm greeting from crew all flights were on schedule. In FRA they use the One World lounge in Terminal 2 ok but nothing special. Serendib lounge in CMB is easy to find (small airport) and only a few steps from/to the gate what is very convenient compared to some other airports. Not the newest but excellent food service drink selection and Internet access working well. Lounge in BKK on flight back was ok but again nothing special. Flight experience basically the same on all 4 flights older business seats that do not recline flat but are still very comfortable. Inflight entertainment is outdated. What makes the difference is the friendliness of the cabin crew. Food and drinks were very good as well. The downgrade is due to the old seating and no IFE although that was not bothering my very good experience flying with them but for others it might be an issue. Highly recommended will fly with them again on next occasion.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,Heathrow to Colombo (UL504) and return (UL503). Business class on outward leg to take advantage of the flat bed on an overnight flight (7 rows with 2-2-2 configuration i.e. 42 seats all of which were occupied). Tried repeatedly to check in online but got an automated message that this was not possible. BA desk at Manchester confirmed they could not through check pax or luggage. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the baggage collection on arrival from Manchester transfer between terminals and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare taking almost 3 hours. Lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – spacious and relaxing environment. Boarding was a bit chaotic. Families with children called first no preference given to business class. Onboard service and environment was similar to typical business/club class with many other airlines with the exception of the entertainment system (very limited selection not easy to use poor quality sound). Crew very attentive drinks served frequently good choice of western and Sri Lankan meals for dinner and breakfast. Flat bed was very comfortable. Good Bulgari amenity kit. Returned in economy class (2-4-2 configuration). No queue for check in at Colombo and were allocated requested seats. Surprised that we were automatically through checked to Manchester even though we were overnighting at HRW. CMB airport was a reasonable size with a good selection of shops. Airport has a limited number of toilets and these can be very busy at certain times. Clear boarding announcements. Good welcome and attentiveness from crew. No amenity kit despite this being a 12 hour flight. Seat pitch and width is not significantly better or worse than many scheduled economy seats. There was no foot rest. Overall there are issues because the planes are dated but otherwise the cost of business and economy class service represents good value compared with other airlines. Would definitely choose Sri Lankan again for a direct flight.,nan,4.0,nan

These seats are very good plenty of storage space fully flat and very comfortable. Only one minus - remote control did not work so I had to touch the screen to navigate through entertainment system. Very good meals (especially Sri Lankan options) and very pleasant service. On the way back to Paris got older A330 with old seats which is different story. Difficult to find really comfortable position to sleep which is important on an 11-hours night flight. Main remark on both long-haul legs is the fact that they serve breakfast very early almost two hours before landing around 3.30am. So if you want to sleep - let attendants know! Sindbad lounge in Colombo is medium size but toilets are very small and busy. All in all - not so bad (except old seats on way to Paris) especially known the price which is as twice as cheap compared to Etihad or Emirates.,nan,5.0,nan

Pre-departure lounge was decent with comfortable rest chairs and a good variety buffet and drinks. The flight was 30 minutes delayed. Was welcomed onboard by a very friendly crew with a smile and was served drinks before takeoff. The seats were very comfortable i must say. Full flat bed reclinable chair with a wide Entertainment system and a inbuilt massager in the chair. Was very impressed with the quality of the New business class format of the airline.

They then changed our already booked seats from row 30 to row 50. Not good but got worse at the gate they changed our seats again to row 62 with no explanation. When we got to our seats they were at the very back of the plane with restricted room for the window seat. I couldn't put my tray full down as there was not room. The IFE did not work at all.

Absolutely nothing to complain about except the parents of an unruly obnoxious child on the KL to Colombo leg who threw a 2 hour temper tantrum and seemed to feel their malevolent offspring's behavior was somehow acceptable in public. As the parents were unwilling to the FA's and several passengers attempted to intervene. When I spoke to the purser about a seat change she instead invited me into the galley for coffee and desert.

Main dissatisfaction was that after making very specific enquiries about weight and dimensions of cabin baggage we scrupulously limited ourselves to 7kg only to see people carrying large cumbersome and clearly heavy cases onto the aircraft. If they make rules they should enforce them and not rely on Brits to do all the compliance! On three out of four meal services the options shown on the menu card we had been ceremoniously presented with had run out. On one occasion a cabin stewardess made a special effort to try to provide something better than the default. Ordering a drink that came out of a can (eg beer) you did not get the can - just a glass! The safety demonstration was very poor. I was twenty rows back from the cabin crew and they simply seemed to wave their arms around to demonstrate the emergency exits. Terrible lack of rigour. Ironic that we had to make a safety stop at Frankfurt on return to London and the cabin crew we called upon to demonstrate emergency procedures again just before we landed. That said the flight was reasonably comfortable and passenger handling otherwise to an acceptable standard. My main yardstick is BA who would win hands down.,nan,3.0,nan

Terrible non AVOD TV and Audio Program and not the promised full flat seat. Very good first class style dinner and breakfast. 4 flight attendants have to serve a maximum of 18 seats but no one knows what the other one is doing. They walk back to the galley for every single plate and glass which is very confusing for them and the passengers. Anyway very friendly crew and excellent meals served. 30 minutes late departure in Colombo 20 minutes late arrival in Frankfurt. Good Value for Money and if they offer the new Flat Bed soon I will fly again with them.,nan,4.0,nan

Low quality Wines and no Champagne served (in an Air France Lounge ). Very good organized boarding with separate doors for Economy and Business Class. Old style Business Class seat in an A340. Good enough for a 3 hours but very bad if a long distance flight. Very limited video program audio did not work at all. Good dinner but kind of rushed service by very friendly crew.

My partner is elderly so I organised a wheelchair for Bangkok airport. That was a big help as the airport is huge. That evening the boarding gate was 1.5 km from the business lounge. Business lounge was fine plenty to drink and eat. Flight to Colombo was 3.5 hours and that passed quickly as we were served a full dinner that was excellent. There was no time really to notice the audio-visual. The seats reclined to become a very comfortable armchair. At Colombo we were taken to the Business class lounge. There was plenty to eat and drink. Escorted to the plane. On-board again it is reclining lounge chair type with footrest. Dinner was served. There were some movies but it was late at night so we slept instead. Breakfast was the best airline one we've had! Again served course by course and more if you want it. There were some movies available if you wanted. In Rome the dream comes to an end but that's Rome airport for you!,nan,5.0,nan

Legroom ok boarding a bit of a joke - with a mass surge towards the walkway when boarding was announced. IFE poor but staff were friendly and attentive - responding to requests. This was a morning flight and served breakfast - western and Sri Lankan option the former which was good. Return on Business. Lounge at BKK was decent - with plentiful options of canapés and drinks. Located close to the gates that UL use. Equipment was an A330 with the new business class seat. Staff friendly and attentive. Food great - with plentiful options alcohol free-flowing. Seat comfort was good though the motors are quite noisy when adjusting the seat. IFE system was good - the joystick control to navigate screen needs to be more sensitive. Lack of noise-cancelling headphones a significant drawback - would expect this for Business class. Luggage out quickly at CMB.

Both aircraft (A330 and A340) clean and well kept but seat back TVs small and dim and in desperate need of an upgrade to AVOD. ""New"" interior on A330 disappointing - ugly carpet and seat covers the colour of mud.

Flatbed is spacious lots of storage space and comfortable for sleeping also has massage function. Recliner was ok too for short flight less than 5 hours. Service and food were outstanding on all sectors. In fact I had some of the best food in the sky with them also plenty to eat and choose from alcohol was free flowing and top up frequently. If you can find a good fare they are very worth considering. Boarding in HKG and BKK orderly only when in CMB was a bit chaotic but still tolerable. A note about the Serendib lounge in Colombo airport. Because UL is joining One World in next year the lounge is undergoing renovations they now temporarily uses the lobby of Serendiva transit hotel. It's dark and no windows a bit sad but the food is still good. The new lounge will open again in a few months.,nan,4.0,nan

Not only did they change the departure time 3 times from 10am to 8am to 6am but the direct flight Bangkok to Colombo was changed on the date of travel to be non-direct through heir new airport Hambantota with no communication to passengers - whatsoever - with the entire flight getting up to depart and having to be told that it had now stopped. It therefore left us with 6 hours to pass in Colombo because of the earlier departure time (from 10am to 6am) and staff were rude! We did not get what we paid for - the later flight departure which was meant to be a direct flight! We will not fly SriLankan Airlines again.,nan,1.0,nan

Very good product crew was friendly but not well organized quite chaotic Service After food was Served we had to ask for the Drinks They just forgot.

nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,UL423/422 HKG-BKK return: This is one of my preferred airlines choice on business class flying this short route as their prices are often very competitive (between 350 USD to 500 USD) over 9 other airlines who are serving the same route but a much more inflated price. Srilankan airlines gives you 40kg luggage allowance and lounge access it doesn't get any better. Service is always attentive and smiles all the way food is very delicious and nicely presented which is one of their strong points. This route often use the flatbed which offers so much more luxury and comfort. Great leg room storage space large AVOD screen etc. Entertainment system is okay not the top of the top but passable. Duty free shopping is great often they have incredible promotions. Only one gripe is their chaotic boarding process in BKK business class passengers weren't given any priorities which to me was very disappointing. Other than that it remains one of my most favorite airlines. If the air fare is cheap (check their website) try it by all means you will be pleasantly surprised.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,BKK-CMB-FRA return in business class. On all flights except the CMB-FRA sector we had their new lie flat business class seats. It was quite upsetting that this configuration was not available on the long CMB-FRA flight moreover as this was a red-eye flight. Check-in in BKK quick and efficient given priority passes for security and immigration. Lounge in BKK is Air France - quite sterile and no real food. Service on board was excellent delicious meal served. IN CMB boarded from the bus gate air conditioning not working and business class boarded last - weird! Luggage in FRA came out last despite being tagged priority. On the return flight quick check-in at FRA. UL is using the JAL lounge - quite poor choice of food available. Great dinner on board but not sure why they serve a 2nd dinner just before a 5am arrival in CMB. Serendib lounge in CMB closed due to renovation used another old fashioned lounge but was quite ok. Flight to BKK left 30 mins late. Delicious breakfast served on board. Entertainment on all flights quite a joke. Choice extremely limited and the AVOD system in business class is almost impossible to navigate. Luggage in BKK came out first. UL business class product clearly has some shortcomings but given that the ticket is only nominally more expensive than an economy class ticket on some other airlines it is still a good choice and value for money.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Rome to Bangkok via Colombo July 13th. Business class. Check in was quick and easy. Given a priority pass for security but everyone has to face the same endless queues for immigration. Had asked about a wheelchair for my elderly partner. We had booked the service for disabled passengers at Rome airport but it is quite understaffed so we chose not to worry about it. On arrival only 2 wheelchairs for the morning rush time so waits can be quite lengthy. Business lounge is a quiet refuge. Nothing special to eat but plenty to drink and of good quality. Onboard staff caring and will go to a lot of trouble to keep the business class passengers happy and comfortable. Considering what we paid for the return business class flight from Bangkok to Rome return we consider we received excellent value for money. On each flight we had reclining armchair type seats. They fold out almost flat and have plenty of personal space. One toilet in business class for 8 passengers. Colombo stop was only a couple of hours. From Colombo to Bangkok we were served a wonderful breakfast. There are movies shown on-board but to tell you the truth better to spend time enjoying the inflight service rather than worrying about the movies! On arrival at Bangkok we were given priority passes for immigration and a wheelchair was waiting for my partner.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,5.0,BKK-PEK it is surprising how many routes into China this airline operate - to Hong Kong Beijing and even Guangzhou. The flights to Beijing don't operate every day nor at the same time on the days they do fly but I was able to squeeze them into my routing by using their very early Fri morning departure and an excellent one-way fare in business class that was about the same as the competition - Thai and Air China - were charging in economy. There was no wait at check-in but some delay as the staff were unaware that China has dropped visa requirements for many nationals who are spending less than 72h in China. After this frustrating delay I was able to proceed through fast track security and into the shared lounge. The hors d'oeuvres were appalling possibly toxic but drinks were available and there was a partial view of the airfield. Boarding was an hour late due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Colombo. Once onboard the four-engined Airbus A340 cabin crew incredibly kind and charming. The seat was an old fashioned cradle recliner extremely comfortable and massive seat pitch. Only two other passengers both of whom were rude to the doting crew. Perhaps there is something unique about Sri Lankan passengers that requires the laminated card in seat pockets regarding zero tolerance for disruptive passengers something I've never seen before? I had a look in economy which was a bit shabby but still looked comfortable. I opted for the Sri Lankan meal option the main course a curried mixed grill absolutely gorgeous. The Ceylon tea service that followed was the best tea I've had. Finally enjoyed an hour's sleep before landing and a kind farewell from one of the nicest crew I've flown with. Despite the lack of alliance mileage on offer I will fly this airline again.,nan,5.0,nan

Aircraft was an Airbus A320. The airfares are low (sometimes). They serve free food. Some in flight entertainment. Planes are clean and comfortable take off and landing very smooth Staff very friendly. However the flight was unduly delayed by half an hour. They don't provide any headphones or anything to use the IFE if it is a short haul flight. They provide free accommodation for long connection flights only if some of their criteria of booking are met which includes a high base fare and connection of over 8 hrs. For connection flights that don't meet their criteria they'll at best give you free transport to and from the airport to the hotel. I shall definitely fly Srilankan again.,nan,4.0,nan

Return flight was a night flight which left CMB at 12.55am. It was odd that we were served a meal after take off considering it was 1am in the morning. It would have been better to have switched off the lights and let all the passengers get some sleep and serve a light breakfast before landing. Crew was perfunctory and little else.

Outbound - the cabin wasn't even a quarter full yet still had our meals thrown at us and not even offered anything to drink just given a very small glass of water. Crew seemed more concerned with getting to crew rest (curtained off passenger seats at the back). Inbound - even worse service than outbound! Asked for a veg meal was told there wasn't any yet the crew member on the other aisle was handing out plenty of veg meals. Basically there wasn't a veg meal available for me! Were not given bread like everyone else had to ask for it. During drinks service asked for a sprite was given a glass decanted from a standard sized can. Other passengers around us were bring given the whole can. Safety onboard is almost as bad as the customer service. Seatbelt sign went on numerous times for turbulence and numerous times this was completely ignored by most passengers. Crew didn't say anything and were not enforcing it. Completely undermines the pilots why bother putting it on in the first place! Also flight from MLE-CMB there was no cabin crew sat at either of the third set of exit doors!,nan,3.0,nan

Only complaint was lack of footrest and limited seat recline but this wasn't a major discomfort on a 3.5 hour daylight flight. Good service standard and choice of menu items. Punctuality was good and PA announcements clear and appropriate. Pity about the remote parking at Colombo but an airport limitation rather than airline. CMB-LHR in an A330 with fully horizontal recline and AVOD (with flight progress disabled for some reason). Again excellent service catering and punctuality. SIN Lounge was fine and the alternative at CMB adequate while the regular airline lounge is being renovated.

Food quality was in fact of superior standard the crew kept me well fed on board right throughout the flight. Plus kids were given free complimentary goodies. Choice of drinks were good too.

The entertainment system was not working properly (No Volume). This I brought to the notice of the cabin crew member who changed my headset 3 times with no result. Then I was told that the flight was full and that if they could not get the system working it was ""hard luck"" which is not the answer I expected. I managed to get it working by gently kicking the box under the front seat which I know now is something to do with the entertainment system. I usually stay awake on my flight to London as it helps me to overcome jetlag when in London. However due to this I was always trying to sleep as the entertainment system kept malfunctioning and as a result had a lousy stay in London for the 1st 2 days. The food too was not what it was and was mediocre. However ignoring the reply I got regarding the entertainment system the service was very good. The aircraft's need to be changed as they are old and this was the case on my return flight as well. All in all I see a deterioration in the quality that was offered by Sri Lankan and gives me the indication that I need to look at other options.

I don't sleep on long haul flights so distractions and entertainment are absolutely essential for me. It soon became apparent that there was a problem with our system in our window side seats with the entertainment system we alerted a cabin crew member who said they would reset the system no follow up communication was received and the system still did not work and after food had been served staff were not very visible and as the flight deck also operates the call button this was not an option either as it was not working. Eventually a second flight attendant was alerted and again we were told that it would be reset again nothing was done. A third member of staff was told of this and yet again nothing was said or explained to us. 9 hours had passed during this time and I was going stir crazy no sleep and not even able to read as the controls also operate the reading light. Eventually it was time for our second meal and we made one last attempt to resolve the problem and this time the staff member had the guts to admit that it was not working and would not do so for the flight and that several other people were affected as well. 11 hour flight with no entertainment whatsoever no way to read or call a flight attendant they were rarely present between meals and the only way to get there attention was hope someone else used the call button. No offer of refreshments between meals and fairly surly staff this is not acceptable treatment for human beings trapped in a metal tube for such long periods of time and should be taken very seriously by the Airline. I was praying that it would be over and have never been so relieved or eager to leave an Aircraft.

Where they really excelled was their food and service the food was very good and served very nicely and they also changed the choices around for my daughter.

On the Bangalore-Colombo-Bangalore sector food was pathetic portions very small and no drinks served. Sad considering it is an international sector too. From Colombo- Bangkok-Colombo food was good aircraft old and only wine and beer were served - no other alcohol. Flights were on time and their 30Kgs baggage allowance is a bonus. Considering I am over 6' tall I found the seats comfortable and legroom good. Not a bad airline considering I found the food better than Emirates. Only complaint I had was that the gates on the ground floor lacked air-conditioning seating capacity and was stuffy and sweaty.,nan,4.0,nan

The SriLankan code share flights A340/A330 were old. The A320s used for short hauls are not that bad. The hospitality used to be very good few years back but now standards have dropped quite badly. The most annoying thing was that I pre-booked for AVML throughout my entire journey but it came with an absolute shocker in two separate instances. I was offered beef salad along with AVML main course on my way to Colombo. The cabin crew were rude in their behaviour. On my return the same thing happened chicken or fish salad was served along with AVML. Despite those incidents the AVML tasted good. I hope the airlines would take better measures and educate cabin crew on respecting the beliefs of its customers or at least keep them informed of what's being offered them.,nan,2.0,nan

COK-CMB sector with a new A320 with IFE and CMB-MCT an old A320 which has no IFE but provided an IPad. Seats not fully reclining but very comfortable. Crew very polite attentive and pleasing and full of energy to serve the passengers with their warm welcome. Choice of tasty food and quality beverages but no amenity kit provided on the CMB-MCT night flight. Cabin and Toilet very clean and tidy. On time performance. Announcement from the Cockpit were clear and audible. COK Business Lounge (Earth Lounge) very average but at CMB the Serendib Lounge is well maintained food is adequately stocked but good selection of beverages. Lounge toilets are spotlessly clean and well maintained at CMB. Only one charging point for laptop Wifi connection. Other internet available are either very slow or cannot access. Apart from minor points overall an excellent experience with SriLankan airlines and will fly again.,nan,5.0,nan

Return trip way worse. Why on earth do they allow passengers to tilt seats back? 11 hours of cramped seating next to the window leads to wild thoughts of jumping out just to feel comfortable (for a short time). Woken by cabin lighting nine hours into trip - for a hot towel and the worst meal I've ever had on a plane. Staff seemed more intent on making their duties easier - not keeping us comfortable. At the end when descent (as always) makes my hearing go I was being asked to do something by a stewardess - turns out she wanted me to raise the cover of the window behind me. Not my job or problem. IFE mostly Asian language films but enough there to do some distracting from the awful legroom problem. On loop system. Cabin tatty. So ok out - poor return.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,Rome to CMB. Generic lounge below par at Rome and boarding chaotic with no separate lane for premium passengers. Then things change. A very warm and gracious greeting at aircraft door and met at seat with more smiles. Jacket taken with no request and purser introduces himself with a chatty welcome to every passenger. Menu excellent and food well presented. Attentive and warm cabin crew with proactive service. Flat bed great but lacks a cover and duvet. Good amenity kit. Silver tea service the good old fashioned away. Flight on time. AVOD good but needs more film choice. Will be up there with SQ and CX if only they can improve boarding procedure give noise cancelling headphones and I think a more extensive wine list. For price paid an outstanding service and flight.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,On 14 Nov flew flight UL 205/161 MCT-CMB-TRV in Business Class. Wonderful experience compare to airlines in/around Indian sub-continent. Apart from an hour delay (unavoidable technical glitch) the A320 flight experience was superb and commendable. Wish to congratulate the Crews for their presentable personable manner in which they served the passengers (a mixture of business class passengers - I mean some are freely upgraded from Economy) but all received that warm welcome and sincere services. The FA's keep smiling and all requests are met and well attended too the food was delicious and in good quantity with plenty of softies and drinks served without hesitation. The minor lags to point out is no IFE and seat non-reclining to a half bed to keep up with modern luxury of travelling but its ok for a four hour trip. Even the toilets were kept clean and full of amenities stored and presented a personal amenity kit to Business Class passengers. To be honest it is my first experience with SriLankan Airlines and I am fully satisfied with their services.,nan,4.0,nan

I have used the airline several times in the past and have always had a pleasant flight but this exceeded my expectations of Business Class. The crew were gracious and attentive.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,I flew from Colombo to Hong Kong with a short stop in Bangkok for one hour where we had to stay on the plane. Strangely enough for some reason they did a roll call on the plane while we were in Bangkok but I had my Bose noise cancelling ear buds in plus I was sleeping while waiting for them to get ready to go again. I didn't hear anyone calling my name and this would not be a concern regardless since I was just continuing on to Hong Kong. Because the head crew guy for the flight attendants didn't get a response from me he had my checked bag pulled off the plane and also found my bag in the overhead and pulled that also. I was then rudely poked in the shoulder to wake me up and asked if the bag they just brought back on the plane was mine and then they put it back in the overhead bin. Then the main guy came and informed me that they had to delay the flight had pulled off my luggage and then somehow realized I was on the flight - go figure - and had to put everything back. I was shocked and was being treated as if this was somehow my fault. Totally hilarious and crazy. We left half hour late and continued to Hong Kong where my checked luggage showed up. I was worried actually. Otherwise the entertainment system worked great and the plane was a pretty new one. The service was good otherwise.,nan,4.0,nan

Our flights were at civilised hours in the morning and afternoon. 2 weeks before departure I had an email to say that the flights had been changed - to late in the evening and the early hours of the morning - very inconvenient for us. Flight to CMB was on time the plane was a bit old and the in- flight entertainment units were very dated and did not work properly. The food was poor. Return flight to BKK was a poor experience and Bandaranaike airport was dreadful. Arrived 3 hours before our flight at 1.30am. The airport was packed and chaotic. There was no system at the few and inefficient check in desks open and passengers were very confused. No staff to help or guide people. We queued for 2 hours and checked in with 15 minutes to go before our flight left. No fast track system for people in a hurry and minimal information the very few announcements were too quiet and unintelligible. We managed to get on the plane but it was then delayed for over an hour. It was the middle of the night and people were trying to sleep but as soon as we were airborne the air hostesses went around waking people up to give them a drink and meal. The lights were not dimmed for sleeping. It was a very stressful and tiring experience. We will not fly with this airline again.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,Flew after several years from SIN-CMB return. A320 aircraft small but the cabin crew was good and attentive to passengers.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Flew with my family SIN-CMB 2 day stopover then CMB-LHR just before Christmas and then FCO-CMB-SIN in January on the way home. All in business and A320 to/from SIN A330 to LHR and A340 from FCO. Boarding on all flights orderly interestingly business was boarded last to avoid economy crush but economy boarding appeared to be very smooth. Silk Route service at CMB was great like first class on other airlines dedicated check in entrance all paperwork sorted out while waiting in a lounge then escorted through customs. Small service company lounge in SIN nice enough lounge in CMB but no Singapore Airlines or Qatar equivalent though food offering was good and nice view over the airport. All flights left on time except FCO which was 30-40 minutes late due to customs debacle but time made up en route. Large short haul business class seats in grey leather on the short (3.5 hours) SIN flights. Very nice catering tray based with 4 main choices. Functional on demand entertainment system with some good movies. Long haul flights both featured full flat beds in attractive terracotta colour leather fine seats and good for sleeping. Two pillows and nice wool blanket supplied along with small but very nice Bulgari amenities bag. A330 entertainment system was loop based some ok movies but mainly slept on this sector. A340 entertainment system was much more modern on demand system with good movie choice. Maybe they have not finished upgrading the A330 fleet with new entertainment systems. Catering on long haul flights out of Colombo and Rome was outstanding full table cloth and china metal cutlery quality glassware. Served with pre meal drink and cashews appetisers mains cheese and fruit dessert coffee/tea/liqueurs etc. 4 main choices restaurant quality food comparable to first on some other airlines I have travelled on. Wines were pleasant enough but not of the same standard as the cuisine but fine nevertheless. I don't think I have ever flown on an airline with so many hot towels being offered! Overall cabin service was amongst the best I have encountered very professional but also very friendly and personal. The crew had a wide age range and were all charming and a credit to the airline. Pilot announcements were clear and informative. All aircraft cabins were clean and we'll maintained and fare prices were incredibly competitive.

Flight BKK to FRA via CMB was a disaster: have never seen such an old and run down aircraft (A330 dating from the early 90's) dirty seats torn seat covers non working entertainment facilities dirty screens and windows overhead lockers opened at take off. Cabin crew not trained extremely unfriendly and unmotivated. Food was cold and inedible only water available during night. Never again will I will with this airline.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,2.0,We upgraded to J class from Y class for a flight from Shanghai to Bangkok a stopover point between Shanghai and Colombo. At the time of the upgrade the call centre informed me that the plane was a new updated A340. After the upgrade was complete and the seat plan made available for J class it became evident that it was in fact an old A340 with bucket seats rather than lie flats. Check-in took 45 minutes in the J Class counter with 2 people in front of us. and an empty business class. The Lounge at Shanghai Terminal 2 was mediocre and the lounge staff incompetent not knowing where the flight was boarding or when we should be boarding. They actually made us almost miss our flight by taking us for an unnecessary drive along the tarmac. We eventually got back to the terminal building and found our way to the plane after running away from lounge staff. The flight itself was ok. The plane was old with uncomfortable seats. Once the person in front put his seat back you were completely restricted and could not extend your seat fully. The seats were not great. The staff were very good and friendly and so was the food. All in all they did make up for the sub-standard equipment. The IFE was almost non existent. The airline has a long way to go.,nan,3.0,nan

They cancelled our flight two weeks before departure without even offering an apology just a terse email. Had to ring customer service to get new e-tickets. They moved us onto a later flight and then when we got to the airport they told us they had over booked the flight and we would have to come back tomorrow. No discussions or compensation offered. After much complaining they finally admitted that there were a few seats left and let us check-in. Planes are old. Seats uncomfortable and my partners in-flight entertainment system didn't even work.

The CMB SriLankan Lounge is newly refurbished and had an amazing buffet. The older A340-300 had about 35 paxs and 6 of us in Business. The cabin is a little dated but clean. A nice breakfast menu was handed out for this 1.5 hour flight to Male. Food was good not exceptional. No inflight entertainment was available. Colombo is a great stopping point to spend a few nights before heading to Male. Arriving in the late morning allows for day arrival connections to the islands.

CMB-DXB on an A330 new flat seats (more flat than other A330) but no AVOD. Online check in didn't work so took 15-20mins checking in each time. Only given Bvlgari amenity bag on DXB- CMB.

COK-CMB sector with a new A320 with Flew A320 SIN-CMB followed by an A330 CMB-CDG in business. A320 seats mildly comfy but the A330 seats are excellent (being ex Emirates). IFE is limited on UL but adequate enough. Amenity packs are basic but I never get excited by them so were OK by me. Food looks good on paper but average in reality. Drinks are OK. Service is very patchy the FA's try but this is an airline from the third world and service reflects this. NB: no noise cancelling headsets (or sleeper suits/pyjamas) so if this is important to you bring your own. If space on a budget is what you want I think Sri Lankan will please. If you want to be blown away by service and luxury pay the extra and fly with a legacy or middle eastern carrier.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,Flew A330 from Bangkok to London. 2 flights same type of plane. One of the cheapest choices. First off the Pro's: The service is excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. It felt like any request could be met and I saw myself and other passengers receive such. The food was good but not as good as I hoped. Don't sit in the middle of the plane as your choice from the menu will have run out. Cons: Plane seemed clean but a little old and the seat was uncomfortable. There are boxes underneath the window seats and some inner seats so stretching your legs was impossible. The entertainment system is awful for today's age presenting around a small choice 5 Hollywood movies plus some foreign ones and TV but you cannot pause them or restart. So choose one film at the start and that's it. 2 of the screens I looked at didn't work and a 3rd had bad audio. On a whole It was not as enjoyable a flight as it should have been but there is potential. For the money I guess it was ok.,nan,3.0,nan

Drinks were plentiful and when I asked for a glass of wine and a rum and coke I was served both without complaint or any negative indicators. Not all the seats were of uniform colour some were green and others brown but that is a covering the seats my wife and I sat on were comfortable and plenty of leg room. Sufficient entertainment to keep me entertained though not as recent in the line of films than other carriers.

The airplane toilets were very dirty right from take-off. The food also unpalatable. The staff begin with big smiles but these disappear very fast especially if you voice a comment or question they don't like. They are highly unprofessional and very quick to display irritation with passengers. The entertainment service malfunctioned so much it is better to forget about it. Even when it worked in 3 of my 4 flights my TV or earphones didn't work. Very cramped seats flimsy blankets which the staff takes back 40 minutes before landing in an aggressive way on all my flights.

Addressed by name and welcomed on-board again by crew at my seat. Quality amenity kit with extensive menu placed next to me with my melon juice. Superb personal service everything anticipated by crew and better than first class on many high tier airlines. Night flight so I did not bother with IFE but I think this needs improvement.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,1.0,You'll see earlier a post from me from SIN to CDG via CMB. My return flight from Paris to CMB was quite different. We had an old seat A330 (creole recliner style) which disappointed me. The seats are pretty bad but for the price one cannot complain and its pot luck whether you get the new or old version at this stage. The IFE is continuous loop so bring an iPad full of stuff to watch as the UL offering is terrible (and I'm being polite). However the food and service from CDG was markedly different. The cabin crew were on the ball and were polite prompt helpful and caring. The food quality was excellent even though I ate very little due to the timing (desert was a let down as the advertised offering and what came were strangely different). My partner and a friend all ate more and enjoyed theirs as well as the flowing wines including Australian quality wines. Now if only the product and service was consistent UL J class would be a force to reckon with. But then again the price would skyrocket I'm sure. We'll be doing this again later this year so clearly we're sold.,nan,5.0,nan

My family were re-booked onto a flight between Bangkok and Colombo 15 hours after the intended departure time requiring an overnight stay in Colombo and then a 5.5 hour car drive the following morning to get my family to our Pre-booked accommodation in the South East of Sri Lanka near Yala. We had 3 other flights pre-booked with Sri Lankan Airlines as part of our holiday (which was partly ruined by our forced itinerary changes). In summary our flight experience was as follows: Food and beverage seemed slightly better than many other airlines we've travelled with. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and professional. In-flight entertainment may as well have been non-existent. I don't recall it being that bad 30 years ago. The age of the plane it's seats screens and entertainment consoles must be approximately 30 years old. Flight times were consistently changed by 10-20 minutes (early and late) without any notification. The staff at airports were grossly under-staffed and consequently appeared irritable cranky and unprofessional. We will never fly with them again.,nan,1.0,nan

After asking one of the crew members to switch on the air con we were told that it would be working after the plane reached a certain height. Flight security demonstrations on the TV screens stopped due to a ""power loss"" which was the explanation given by one of the crew members over the speakers. We were scared to fly after this announcement! Due to the 4 hours delay of the flight we lost our connection flight. We went to the counter of Sri Lankan Airlines at Heathrow Airport to ask them for refund or an alternative flight but for one hour no one came. After all that waiting at the counter the man who finally showed up just informed us that he could not do anything for us.

I am glad I upgraded to Premium economy on the flight out as normal economy was a bit cramped. Male to London got an upgrade to business class and well worth the £600 it cost.

When she tried to change the return trip she was informed that the Goa leg was no longer being run and she could change it to Chennai and they would arrange an internal flight for her to Goa. This was very good service. However due to luggage etc she decided to cancel the return leg and book another airline. SriLankan Airlines agreed that she would get a full refund. 9 months later and many many emails between her the issuing agent and Sri Lankan Airlines including a visit to Sri Lankan head office and there has been no refund. I can only assume that SriLankan Airlines do not honour there promises and refunds are not issued!,nan,1.0,nan

Eventually went on to Colombo - where again they gave us no info and eventually after hassling (and 4 hours in the terminal) we found we were instead getting an Emirates flight to Male. They told people there was no need for new boarding passes - it turned out there was and several people having gone through security were turned away and had to go back and get one.

At CMB we asked the information counter about the transit hotel assigned to us at BKK. They claimed to have never heard of it and were no help at all whatsoever. All this happened in the middle of the night so we were really frustrated. The woman at the transit counter was exceptionally rude. We were then put on a bus with some other passengers and were brought to a small and very dirty little inn quite a long way from the airport. On the way to BKK the MLE handling agents refused to check us in saying that our ticket (issued by SriLankan) was for 15 days while our visa covered only 14.

We were only told the night before our direct flight to LHR that we were to be diverted via Colombo and we had to do our own phone calls to arrange our return flight. What made the journey more tedious was that at the Colombo boarding gate we were all searched even ladies rubber flip flops were checked. The passengers were getting very angry with the lack of information being given and were told time after time the delay was due to operational reasons.

This meant starting 3 hours earlier to get to Colombo. On arrival at Colombo our flight showed 'check-in' but no departure time. No one at the SriLankan Airlines desk and eventually heard a rumour we were delayed awaiting a VIP. All this time our aircraft was ready at its departure gate and never found a SriLankan Airlines rep to explain the delay. We were called for boarding 1.5 hours late and then sat on the aircraft for a further hour with no explanation. After anger levels getting pretty high the captain came on to apologise for the delay due to operational reasons. (Plane surrounded by armed army personnel). Eventually 2 helicopters arrived and disgorged said VIP - President of Sri Lanka on his way to UK . So 6 hours added to an already tedious journey with just one weak apology.

Firstly the airline only has two long haul A340-300's running this route both pretty tired looking planes though one of them seemed slightly better than the other. Inflight entertainment is a complete joke - didn't work on the way out or back (thankfully due to reviews on this website I had bought myself a Sony PSP to keep me entertained). Staff seemed pretty miserable and disinterested in helping (I asked twice for them to reset my screen and was ignored both times - also took them an age to clear trays from the seats - this after one of the stewardesses had kicked my tray as I had put it on the floor as far out of the way as possible and she managed to scatter the contents. Rather than pick it up she pushed it back under my seat - hence I cleared it away myself.

Our experience with them was a disaster from start to finish. We checked in 3 hours before the outward flight to find our online booked seats were not available the flight was overbooked and they were trying to bump people off we had to sit far apart on the plane - row 50 and 24 - not a great way to start a romantic week away. The flight entertainment did not work on many of the seats flight was delayed service and the food were both awful. We complained at Heathrow and got the Service manager from Sri Lanka that night to at least make sure we had seats together for the return journey. We tried to check in for the return flight on the 31st to find we had been bumped off the flight - apparently due to overbooking. We were told there was nothing they could do. To cut a long story short we got them to pay to re route us via Qatar but despite promises of many things ended up being stranded in Doha airport for 8 hours without accommodation before being able to get a return flight to London. It took us 37 hours to get home on a journey that should have taken no more than 14 hours door to door and caused us great distress and inconvenience. SriLankan Airlines are a dreadful,nan,1.0,nan

IFE the old type which was poor and terrible picture quality combined with a basic headset made it not too pleasant. UL have gone back to the open trolley concept for meals which is so outdated despite being able to view all on the menu. Food relatively cold but selection good and tasty. Overall service remains quite amateur and not co-ordinated.

Drinks served after take-off followed by a reasonable meal and then lights out. Because the flight was only one quarter full we could spread out. Unfortunately not all the armrests could be lifted so I had to wriggle a bit to get comfortable but it was far better than sleeping upright.

They came round with the duty free trolley before we landed at Male selling all sorts of alcohol but they did not mention that you are not allowed to import alcohol into the Maldives – if you bought any on the plane (which I did not) it would have been confiscated on arrival. They also gave out landing cards for Sri Lanka (final stop) but not the Maldives where most passengers got off and then had to fill landing cards in at passport control.

We were told no because they didn't want an infant in premium economy disturbing the other passengers. We were forced to move to economy seats and to this day (we flew in February) we still have not received a refund. They also managed to loose our pram despite the fact that it was taken to the airplane door.

The last sector (CMB-DEL) was operated was brand new Airbus A320 which had an advanced AVOD system and the seat pitch was excellent. Above all despite of very competitive price it was 100% mileage applicable on their frequent flyer program which means that now I can redeem free return tickets between South India and Colombo from this trip. Overall very good value for money I'd love to fly with them again. Few complaints are: Most SriLankan aircraft are outdated - on NRT-CMB it was a leased aircraft and seat pitch was very tight.

IFE buttons worked it was good and quite acceptable for an 11 hour night flight. A delightful flight primarily due to cabin crew. Despite late departure out of LHR the arrival into MLE was close to schedule.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,AUH-CMB Business class. Separate bus to aircraft A320. Greeted warmly and jacket taken. Seat is cradle type and has seen better days with no foot rests and whilst clean it was tatty but spacious. Only 3 pax in the cabin so plenty of space. Newspapers offered drinks order taken with a wide choice of drinks and wines. Food was good older style presentation but tasty. Great to see tea coffee served in a Hotel afternoon tea presentation. Staff were friendly but not intrusive. A personal video player was offered not many movies but fine for a 4 hour flight. Arrived on time we were met at the aircraft by a ground rep who obtained our bags and arranged our transport to our air taxi. Overall genuine service although seat product could be updated.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,I flew DEL-COL and COL-BKK. The aircraft used for DEL-COL leg was smaller but the food (dinner) was quite good with plenty of wines/drinks.

No room at all and when the passenger in front reclined there was no where to put my tray for meals. Food nice and the cabin staff on the London/Colombo were excellent - very polite and attentive for the whole flight. Colombo/Bangkok not so crowded so a lot more room. Entertainment not brilliant and English programmes seemed to be more animated films. Landing cards 'ran out' in the front of the plane and at the back I heard no mention of landing cards at all which proved a nuisance on arrival at Bangkok. Food quite good on outward journey and service was excellent. Entertainment not brilliant.,nan,4.0,nan

Only negative aspects were no personal TV screens lights left on at full brightness for the entire night flight making the passengers restless and noisy. I was also woken up several times by the cabin crew at midnight assuming I automatically wanted to have dinner (despite having an eye mask on and ear plugs). The most frustrating thing was the beeping sound every time someone pressed the attendant button (every 1-2min for the whole flight). This should be switched off like some other airlines do.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,3.0,SIN-CMB in Business Class. I take this flight as it leave/arrives at good times and avoids overnight flying. They recently changed from A330 to A320 and there is a big difference. A320 is cramped no leg rests (in row 1) little recline lack of overhead storage embarkation is a zoo! Meals are now on trays rather than the A330 trolley service. Crew seemed overworked. This compares to intra-European biz class or US domestic biz class on cheaper airlines. I would only recommend this service due to departure times.,nan,3.0,nan

The outbound flight was delayed 4 what annoys me is that UL knew about this delay well in advance yet did not contact passengers ahead of time. Delay voucher was given for a filthy breakfast in the airport restaurant. Food on the outbound flight was terrible and no other alcoholic beverages apart from beer and wine were served. What a plunge in service! Return flight left BKK on time again food not great but this time at least 'proper' drinks were served. Unfortunately if you want to avoid red eye flights between CMB and BKK you have to use UL all other airlines fly at ungodly hours in the middle of the night.,nan,2.0,nan

Lounge at RUH very poor but it is not the airline's lounge and we normally use the Costa Coffee anyway because the lounge is so dire! RUH-CMB-BKK: an old A340 with cradle seats. The service is good and with a choice of movies games or the now dated hi8 cassettes. Food and drink very good and unlike last time we were able to have a 'real' drink 20 minutes after take off. Excellent cocktail menu and the cabin staff pleasant. On the second sector the food was brought round hot on a trolley. BKK-CMB - A330-200 but with a new interior including lie-flat beds with VIOD (unfortunately the IFE was not working on this sector so no movies were available).

I have flown this sector several times with an older 320 but UL is probably the only carrier able to decrease the quality of its Cl class product. Seats are the most uncomfortable I have experienced in C class. Service and food decent. CMB-BKK in old A340 with worn seats and broken IFE. Put up in a shabby Colombo hotel during my 14 hr transit on the return. UL refused to credit my FFP's into my Etihad account (their FFP partner).

Meals were tasty and the tea served was the best I have been served on a flight. The only downside was the very hard seat.

The difference was very marked. The food was dismal and cold even duty free was poor only had one of the things we wanted and that was broken when we checked it.

Needed to be told by passengers that there was no toilet paper or hand towels available We asked for a white wine with our meal were served red asked for coffee and tea was poured I had finished eating my meal before my partner even received his. All in all an appalling experience.

When we arrived at Heathrow we were given 5 seats in the back two rows of the back of economy - toilets on both sides a light on all night and constant footfall. Worst seats on the plane! When we complained at the check-in desk we were told by embarrassed staff that head office in Colombo had decided that day to give a group priority and move people who had already checked in to other seats. Outrageous! As it happens it was a newly kitted out plane with decent entertainment and the staff really looked after us as they knew we were cross so not as bad as it could have been but cannot believe that they could just decide to move you after checking into seats. The flight back was an older kitted out plane with poor entertainment and very uncomfortable seats. The sound did not work on my seat so no films for the 11 hour flight.

System would not allow changes and surely didn't take in to account our next long haul flight with the same airline. We asked for this change at the counter in Rome but they had issues as well with their own portal and could not do much besides promising the transfer desk in Colombo would change our seats. Ground personnel kept on bouncing us between transfer desk and gate shifting responsibility. The Manager in charge showed up during boarding 30 minutes before take-off. Problem was not solved and when I wanted to express a formal complaint I was given a piece of paper for printers and a complaint box was indicated to me.

My daughter and I had trouble with the audio which was quickly sorted once we'd pointed out the problem we were told we could change seat if they weren't able to fix it; there was a good choice of films to watch.

Showers and plenty of food and drinks. The flight left on time. The seats were comfortable and plenty of food and drink was offered for the afternoon flight. We arrived in Sri Lanka late in the afternoon and had booked the transit hotel service. That worked easily. You go to the transfer desk and they issue you with a form. Then through immigration and to stopover desk. You are issued with another form and taken to a bus with the other transfer customers. The Kuala Lumpur flight arrives at the same time and Europe flights don't depart till after midnight so there was a bus load of us. We were taken to the Airport Garden hotel. Immigration was quick and then we went into the Serendib Lounge to wait for the Rome flight. That is the newly remodelled airport lounge. It has good bathrooms and also a snoozer lounge area where you can recline. Plenty of food and drink if you want it. The flight left on time and we got the fully flat bed seats! Wonderful.

The problem took more time to be rectified than expected and passengers were let out for an hour with a bottle of mineral water each. The same person kept on apologizing over the PAS for what had transpired but his crew seemed annoyed and took it upon the poor passengers as if it was all our fault.

Cabin crew had attitude problems towards passengers and disappeared behind their curtain. Annoyed if disturbed. Water/juice which wasn't offered. Although menu given most dishes were not available so you had no choice if you were hungry. Crew obviously had no idea how to serve alcohol as was given 3/4 glass full of gin and virtually no tonic.

We had to forgo one paid night in Bangkok because of their incompetent booking system! In July 2014 we flew from Bangkok to Colombo to begin our journey and remember the cabin being quite shabby with very poor leg room. Will avoid future journeys with this carrier.

With the walking stick and me as carer we could cut those queues. The Business class lounge at the airport is ok. It is a quiet place to sit. Drinks are served but make sure you don't need food! Onboard everything was bliss! Memories of that airport dissolved. The cabin crew were kind. Drinks and snacks were always available. The meals were full and copious. The seat reclines to a flat bed. This means I can't remember much of the flight except for eating a lot. So that's good. The transfer in Colombo airport is problem free. There is the Serendib lounge. Here you can have a shower grab a snack and get another rest in the recliners. The transfer time is 2-3 hours. we had to wait for an incoming flight to arrive for more passengers so it was more like 3 hours. The flight to Singapore takes about 3 hours.

CMB-LHR was an older A330 but with a refreshed cabin also with a new large screen AVOD system. Handling of kids was excellent with juice and cookies on boarding strollers delivered to the ramp etc. 2 full meals served professionally (e.g. allowing us to feed the kids first before coming back to serve us when we were ready). The bathrooms were clean and well stocked with toothbrushes etc. The crew were friendly with the kids and attentive whenever one cried or some food was dropped. They were courteous and also quite stylish and well groomed. The sari uniform and peacock theme throughout the cabin gives some personality to the airline.

On the other 3 legs the crew varied from ""not so friendly"" to friendly but unprofessional. The food was tasty and portions quite generous I had my champagne glass topped up without asking! Their inflight entertainment was not the best but that didn't bother me personally as I have my own tablet. The headphones and blankets are not really premium quality just the same as in economy class. Even though the toilets were kept clean and fresh on all 4 legs I found the cabins were not very clean.

We have just arrived at Colombo Airport and have experienced the worst service ever due to no one taking responsibility for the delay which has had a knock-on effect causing us to miss our connection to Male and our sea plane connection. In London we were already told there would be a 1 hour delay and that the Cabin Crew would advise on the connection. Just before landing we enquired again and were told to seek ground crew in the airport for advice at the transfer desk. The transfer desk issued us with a voucher to make calls to sort out our problems ourselves. The voucher was insufficient and the desk operator kept cutting us off. There were no announcements for passengers about connecting flights there was no explanation for the delay nor an apology. Basically no one cares. The flight itself was fine although the cabin was very dated and looked dirty especially the floor in the toilets. I found the staff very passive and slow to respond equal to indifference.

The seats were old but spacious as its configuration was 2-4-2 which is rare in newer widebody planes. It had plenty of leg room. The food was average to poor.

Flight probably 80% full. The A320 for the onward flight to MLE was more spacious and comfortable. Both legs of the return flight were much better. MLE to CMB A343 flight was full but still OK with full inflight entertainment. CMB to LHR in a recently re-furbished A332 which was much better than the outward flight. Lucky to move a front/bulkhead seat with plenty of leg room. Excellent choice of inflight entertainment and hard working and attentive cabin staff. Each flight departed and arrived in good time.

Lounges in Singapore and Paris shared with other Airlines very clean and well serviced. Business Class Lounge in Colombo is well laid out well serviced clean great range of Eastern and Western foods and Wines from all major Regions. Flight crews on all legs could not have been more helpful the planes were clean and fresh and well maintained. Extensive Eastern and Western Food Menu International Wines as well. On the long haul legs - Colombo - Paris just a 10 hour night flight the seats recline to flat beds and I slept very well both times. The Singapore-Colombo legs are just 3.5 hours hence the seats are the normal Day Business Class seats. This airlines does not fly to Australia so I used some frequent flyer points to get to Singapore and return. I joined the Airline's Fly Smiles program as I will definitely be looking forward to flying to Europe (Rome London Frankfurt or Paris) with them again. They fly into and out of Paris 3 times each week and have more new Airbuses coming on stream from October to increase their capacity etc. They don't offer a First Class option - they don't need it!

Full lie flat bed was comfortable and comparable with most Middle Eastern carriers. Cannot be complimentary enough about the cabin crew nothing was too much to ask. We travelled with our 20 month old daughter and the crew spoiled her rotten. Food and beverage selection is what you would expect from a business class ticket. Inflight entertainment was old with all TV selections coming from prerecorded tapes.

Once again they were slow in response to the call button and distanced themselves as much as possible from the cabin. During service they presented the look as if obligated to smile.

Curiously legroom seemed 1-2 inches less in this plane than newer A320 on way out. Stewardess did not know but after initially ignoring our request she allowed us to change seats.

The only positive aspects: good to have metal cutlery and bar always opened. At the duty free they didn't have the cigarettes I asked for (even in the catalogue). CMB-MLE: short flight on a pretty new aircraft but the temperature was set extremely cold despite many passengers asked for increasing it no results. MLE-CMB: 1.5 hour delay trip acceptable.

It was a wonderful way to pass 2 hours trying this and that. Boarding was easy. Economy and business passengers were divided. Sri Lankan offers flat bed business seats to most flights including this, so it was a luxury experience. Champagne was offered and meals ordered before take off. In flight service was perfect. Prior to the meal we were served sherry and cashews. The meals were wonderful. Plenty of choice. SriLankan has upgraded the inflight entertainment to offer 100+ channels. So it matches most airlines.

The seats were incredibly uncomfortable. 2) On boarding the plane we noticed that my daughter's tray table would not stay up. We informed the cabin crew who got an engineer on to have a look at it. We were told it would take too long to fix and they would have to tape it up after take off - the table fell down three times during take off and the attempt to tape it up involved using masking tape to try and tape the plastic to the material of the seat in front - this did not work and the table fell down regularly during the flight and landing - including when my daughter was asleep. 3) The inflight entertainment screens for myself my daughter and my mother-in-law did not work properly the touch screen malfunctioned and any programmes regularly stopped and started making it difficult for us to watch any films to take our minds off how uncomfortable we were. 4) The food was very poor and my son (who has an allergy to spices) was given an identical meal (fish and vegetables) twice in a day. 5) Two of our reading light controls stopped working and the only way we could switch our lights on and off was to ask a member of the cabin crew to go to the front and control them from the main control panel. Overall I will never fly with Sri Lankan Airlines ever again and would not recommend them to anyone.,nan,1.0,nan

The airline reserved area has alcoholic drinks and better quality food. The main area has more substantial food. You can go from one area to the other. Our flight was delayed an hour in Bangkok, so we had plenty time to investigate the lounge. Boarding the flight was done in a hurry to try and make up time. Unfortunately, Hong Kong airport is a busy one, so we had to wait for a new take off slot. In the end, we were about 90 minutes late for take off. These things happen. The flight was smooth and comfortable. SriLankan business class is one of the best in terms of friendly service, good food and drinks.

The seats on the new A330-300 on the London to Colombo leg are arranged in a 1-2-1 layout. As we were travelling as a couple we chose the centre 2 seats and as each row is slightly staggered there was a surprising amount of privacy. Seats are flat bed and very comfortable. There is a lack of storage space around the seat but this is made up for by the large overhead lockers. The only slight niggle with the seats is that for a 5"" 11"" male the foot room when fully reclined was a little tight - but it did not interfere with a good nights sleep. The second leg to Male was in the older A330-200 series with a 2-2-2 layout. But the seats were comfortable. But being such a short leg of just over an hour I am unable to comment of sleep quality. Food was excellent on both legs, and was really nice to see curry's and local breakfast dishes with bold and hot spicing - the SriLankan breakfast was especially spicy! Drinks onboard were varied and the cocktails were good. It was good to see premium fever tree tonic used (but you have to ask) and the Champagne was adequate. Cabin crew didn't come round regularly with drinks but were more than happy and courteous when asked via the call bell or popping into the galley. Cabin crew were well presented, friendly and professional. The only niggle was when serving food they forgot my wife a couple of times - the crew on the left aisle thinking the crew on the right aisle had served and visa versa. I cannot comment on the wifi as I didn't pay for this. I'd expect it to be complementary on business class but as it wasn't - I didn't bother. In-flight entertainment was acceptable with some up to date films but the choice was limited so I can only give 4 stars in this area. If I was to have a criticism it would be the lack of water on the flight. Small bottles were offered at the start and end but we drink large quantities of water each day (even more on long haul flights). When I asked for 2 large bottles of water for my wife and I was told we could only have one. It would seem you can drink massive amounts of champagne and spirits but no so of water.

Check-in at BKK was swift, fast-track through security and into the Louis Tavern Lounge - nothing to complain about here. The first leg to CMB was outstanding. The senior flight attendant welcomed us by name and shook my hand and thereafter the service was second to none. We arrived on-time and delighted by the experience. We went into the rather crowded Serendip Lounge as we had an hour or two until our onward leg, but having found a seat, the lounge was pleasant with a good choice of food and drink. We boarded the A330 to LHR and found a clean, spacious cabin. The flight was not unpleasant but it wasn't a patch on the first leg. Sitting at the front of the cabin, we were served first at lunch time and had the full choice of menu and the food was good. The later, afternoon snack was served in reverse order so we were last to be served, by which time there was only one option remaining, which didn't appeal, so rather disappointing. During the flight I visited the galley for a drink - it must have been a crew rest break as the only person there was the male cabin supervisor who was sat doing paperwork and ignored me completely. After waiting a few minutes, he was clearly aware of my presence but still made no effort to serve me until I asked for service. Rather poor. Overall, nice planes, good spacious cabins but variable service. They are competitively priced and I would happily use them again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The cabin crew were ok, quite serious, they didn't serve many drinks and when they did, they walked past offering wine, then tea or coffee, without a trolley, so you had to be alert and assertive to get their attention or you missed out.

My aunt had a Business Class ticket and we travelled economy. Prior to take off we explained our situation to cabin staff and asked if we could check up on our aunt every now and then and also if they would let us know if she was not settled. That was all ok and a couple of times the crew called us over to business class to reassure her that all was well. However, half way during the flight she was unhappy and wanted to sit with one of us, so a cabin crew member suggested I take her business class seat and she sits next to my sister. Peace prevailed for a while until a new face appeared (business class cabin manager) who pompously demanded that I leave this seat as it was not SriLankan Airlines policy that seats be swapped. I explained the circumstances to him and he said it was 'not his problem' and said he can find me a seat at the back. I further explained that the cabin crew in economy were aware if the swap. At this point he walked up to one of the air hostesses and in a very arrogant tone pulled her up for not informing him - humiliating her in front of me. Then my aunt who was half way through a meal was asked to return to her business class seat, which she did but was very shaken. We asked to speak to the superior but was told he was too busy.  I understand that you need to have policies in place but some compassion and decency could have been shown in this instance. SriLankan Airlines website describes business class as ""Walk into a sanctuary of comforts that is closer to your dreams than to reality. Be a guest of the trademark SriLankan hospitality at 30,000 ft and find your home away from home amidst the cottony clouds."" We saw none of this and couldn't wait to get off the plane.

At 00:00, the person who was taking care of our checking checked our passports and printed our 3 boarding passes. He then asked my friend to show his return ticket to his home country. According to him, this was required as my friend had a business visa expiring in less than 6 months. From 00:00 to 00:30am, we literally begged Sri Lankan employees to provide us an internet access in order to show the required ticket. Moreover we were not able to use the airport wifi as the connexion was too slow. None of the employees helped us in any way. The trainee in charge of our check-in kept on asking us to wait 5 mn for his help, while taking care of the other customers, without finally helping us in any way to solve the situation.

Their staff can't do anything other than reading what's in front of their computer screen and one of the worst customer services experience I have ever with an airline. Their so called loyalty programme 'flysmiles' is designed for loyal customers never to be able to utilise the miles and compared to Virgin, Delta, BA and even American Airlines, srilankan miles are inflexible. Though the airline is part of oneworld, they don't seem to have full privileges as other airlines within the alliance as transferring miles are very restricted.

Service started around 30 minutes later with drinks then full meal service, which was very nice all courses well presented and tasted great. I prefer Airbus to Boeing on long haul flights, they appear quieter and this flight was no different. The seat had lots of space and while similar to other Asian airlines felt comfy and relaxing. A  1-2-1 set up the same as CX or BR, I managed 5 hours good sleep, additionally I used the AVOD with a good enough selection, a 2nd meal service once again great presentation and taste offered 2hr 30 min out of Heathrow. Arrival 30 early to T3 after a flight time of 10hr 55min. Bags off within minutes I used the free limo transfer service offered to business class passengers arriving/departing LHR which is a great addition. I was home 1 hour after arrival. Airport service apart this is a great service and fantastic value for this route originating in KUL with a stopover in CMB. Would have been 10/10 if not for airport service.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

A330,Economy Class,5.0,April 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes,Colombo to London Heathrow,5.0," |  Was a little concerned to use this airline given some of the reviews, but was completely wrong. I found them to be excellent in almost all respects, notwithstanding general economy class space constraints common to all airlines. Online check-in was as per most airlines, and Bag Drop at both London Heathrow and Colombo took just a few minutes allowing plenty of time for airport meals/shopping. We were then welcomed aboard with a bow by extremely friendly, polite and attentive staff (a theme we found throughout the country in fact). Seats: As a 6 footer, seat clearance is a general problem for me on most airlines. This seemingly new A330 in question had room to spare - measured a good 4 inches space in front of my knees, and good seat recline - I managed 6 hours sleep on both outbound and return legs - unheard of when generally I cannot sleep a wink in economy. IFE: Possibly the largest seat back screens I've seen - 10inch - iPad size with full touch screen, dozens of movies, TV series, live news, pause/rewind, gate to gate operation, live cams, etc. Onboard WiFi was available too though I found this a little pricey - the 15Mb I paid for was used up in just a few minutes. Food and drink: Always 2 options (1 always a curry which I find generally reliably good on long flights), and on this daytime flight we were served 2 full meals at the beginning and end of the flight. Drinks were plentiful, full bar, and staff very proactive bringing refills on beer, wine, water and softs for kids. Experience comparable Emirates, Virgin, BA and other highly rated airlines (this is of course a One World partner and it showed). Customer Service: My single complaint preventing higher score was the outbound direct to CMB was amended to have a stop in Male for 2 hours owing to an unforeseen maintenance period at Columbo airport closing the runway until 4pm for several weeks. This added around 4 hours to the trip, though was not the fault of the airline. I had booked 8 months earlier before the work was planned. Others were able to take advantage and fly direct to the Maldives. This however caused problems with seating and I lost the Window seats I had requested for my kids when the flight was re-scheduled (we were given 4 middle seats in a row). Customer Service were responsive to email, but despite multiple attempts, could not seem to undo this issue. All in all a very pleasant experience, and highly recommend SriLankan Airlines.",Family Leisure,5.0,3.0

Because of the significantly lower price, I was apprehensive about what to expect. However, after reading fairly positive reviews on Skytrax, I decided to give it a try, and would not hesitate to fly them again on some routes. Like the 1x2x1 layout in Business Class. Food is mediocre, but adequate. Service was pleasant, though don't expect it to equal Singapore, Cathay Pacific, Qatar etc. Cabin a little worn, but not a turn off. Overall no complaints. However, don't expect much from their premium lounge at Colombo Airport. A grossly over-crowded mess of mediocrity. Needs to be 3-4 times the size. It was literally standing-room only when we entered at 5AM. Have to wait for a seat to be vacated, & remained so until we departed. Worst business class lounge yet encountered Internationally. Boarding is also an absolute nightmare at Colombo Airport, which is a facility in need of major upgrading, which I understand is due to begin. Mass of pushing, crowding and nowhere to sit at the actual gate where you have to go through a security check. A fiasco of total incompetence, poor arrangement and  confusion, and  Business Class passengers are just part of the same mob pushing at the gate. No separate boarding privileges. So overall, a pleasant flight experience, matched with a very subpar airport.",Business,5.0,nan

Throughout my 5 days stay, I called this number at least 25 times and there was no response at all even for a single time. Somebody takes the call and disconnect, thereby we lose the call charges also everytime! While returning, we are asked to come 6 hours prior to departure time due to renovation of airport and I utilised this time to go to arrival section for knowing the status of my baggage. There were about 500+ unclaimed baggage lying there, out of which my baggage is not found. After spending an hour's time I was told to contact at Chennai Airport. There is no swift response from their Chennai office also. They are simply keeping quite till end of 21 day tracing period and then take their own time to issue the compensation of 20 USD per Kg for the lost-baggage weight, which is not even covering 10% of original value lost. There is hardly any seriousness shown in tracing the baggage and they are testing our patience for providing the letter to process our claim with Insurance. Apart from losing the value of goods, we are facing hardships without the items planned in overseas tourism travel and also losing our valuable time in follow-ups, providing documents until we get the claim.",Business,2.0,1.0

One small gripe was I was travelling with a bicycle and depite following the packaging rules, I was told (at LHR) the bike was improperly packaged and I would have to sign a disclaimer.

Disorganised staff had no clue what was going on and did not tell us when the flight would be going for 2 hours. Flight ended up leaving 6 hours after expected. As a result, I was so late back to London I missed a friends wedding! When I complained to SriLankan Airlines about this and asked for some sort of compensation for this delay, they said they couldn't give me anything more than an apology because they were not an EU airline and not flying within the EU.

The first disappointment came when i headed to the check in counter at Bahrain International Airport where i witnessed a hostile crowd at the Srilankan Airways counter who were furious because the flight had been overbooked. I had checked in online a day earlier and this turned out to be an advantage since they called those passengers and told us we could proceed with immigration after dropping our baggage off, which was a huge relief. I never found out what happened to the other passengers that were not allowed to board. The next shock was finding out that our plane had no entertainment system on board and mind you were are talking about a flight that lasts for over 5 hours. I regretted not taking my ipad at that moment. And to add to my vows, the food I  had specially requested was an absolute disaster. The wait in Colombo airport was short and we boarded our next flight to Bangkok. Now this was more like the Srilankan airlines i had heard of, with each seat having a console. The food was absolutely fantastic and the seats were super comfy too. The rest of the flight went off without a hitch. The return flight was a repeat of the first leg with no entertainment consoles on the flight and bad seating. I had a 7.5 hour wait at Colombo and regretted not taking a Visa On Arrival. The flight from Colombo to Bahrain was in a plane without any of the livery that you would expect and a really old plane which had interiors that were peeling off. The staff were exceptional and friendly.  I would also recommend that the airline refit its planes with entertainment. ",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

The seats were very old and seats were no longer comfortable. Just an hour into the flight, I was developing cramps in my legs.  Secondly, there was a beautiful, brand new, on board duty-free magazine. What was saddening is that they never had any of the products I asked for. Having travelled numerous times on Srilankan Airlines, I was used to seeing the cabin crew selling their ware very earnestly in the past. That enthusiasm was not there in these two flights. The cabin crew were just not interested in selling any duty free products. With such disinterested attitudes and lukewarm service, this airlines will never achieve its past glory. As for the wonderful cuisine Srilankan raves about, I must say I was disappointed. The glass noodle salad which I expected to see some greens, had a hint of celantro and one small piece of a salad leaf. Probably, they must have added some dressing although it was not very evident. Please also get some decent, better quality head sets. The ones provided were uncomfortable and would not sit properly. Srilankan Airlines better get there act together. ",Business,3.0,nan

Once we reached the 'slop counter' we were told to go to was a grossly inadequate offer of food, I wasn't sure how long it had been there but I wouldn't have chanced it on my dog.

My first problem with this airline started after I needed to change booking my leg DXB-CMB leg of this booking. Sri Lankan Airways provide a Skype level of customer support which is handy if you are overseas. I needed to bring forward by booking by a day. With each of four contacts with the Skype support I was advised of a fee of US$230 to change the flight, to which I agreed to. However each time the operator put me on hold to begin to process the payment the Skype call disconnected. These four calls took place over a four hour period. In frustration I bit the bullet and rand the Colombo based support number directly and got through quite quickly surprisingly. I was then advised that the same ticket change would now cost US$930! I asked why rise in price? I was told that they could see from their records of the calls that I was offered the US$230 but since this time the fare restrictions had increased the change for this fare. I told them not to bother. Things got worse. Check In experience in DXB was chaotic at best. Poor and inadequate lane signage to the point where most passengers had no clue where to stand. There was no priority given to Business Class passengers. Passengers allowed to jump to the front of line.and there was no passenger management by on site manager. Finally I got to the business class check in which is in reality no different to economy class I was advised at check in that I would be unable to collect or access my checked in baggage in CMB? Why not as this was the first I had heard of it? I advised manager that I needed my luggage as there were items in it needed for my business meeting in CMB. I advised that I had concerns that my luggage would get lost being in CMB for so long unattended prior to the KUL flight. (I was proven correct) I was advised to see what they could do for me in CMB. I did, and they could do nothing. So now I am in Colombo with no luggage. As I anticipated it would be, my luggage did not make it with me to KUL in the next flight leg. It wasn't until a chance meeting with a Malaysian Airlines Customer Service staff member was it established that Sri Lankan airways had indeed failed to put my baggage on the plane and it would arrive via a MH flight later in the day. Why didn't Sri Lankan Airlines bother to tell me? They had my email address. Now I had no luggage in KUL either! Finally the Sri Lankan Airlines lounge was terrible in CMB. People using mobile phones in quiet areas set aside for quiet times between flights, children allowed to run riot in the area without staff intervening with parents to control their children.

Airborne on time and offered a menu and pre meal drinks by a very nice crew who where proactive and friendly, the meal on this flight was y well presented and finished off with coffee. Flight arrived CMB on time to a remort stand where we where bussed to the terminal with business class passengers on a separate bus, visited the Serindib lounge while in transit nothing special but fairly. Quiet. Boarded the flight to London from gate 14A which was fairly organised on to a newish looking A330-300 with 1-2-1 seating set up, seat 2A offered privacy and comfort slippers blanket & amenity kit waiting on the seat drinks and hot towels offered. Departed on time again once airborne service started quickly with pre meal drinks offered and meal orders taken, once again the crew were fantastic, friendly but professional. The food offered on this flight was presented very well and tasted great the quality appeared very good, lunch a mid flight snack and ample drinks & dinner served on this 11 hour flight. TV was good enough for an 11 hour flight I really have no complaints Sri Lankan offer a great product, Colombo airport is not the best so if improved the whole product would benefit. Bags delayed at LHR otherwise nothing to complain about. Complimentary chauffeur offered on arrival worked well. Great service would use anytime.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

He told me off saying 'sit down' with harsh tone without knowing that I had to make way for the next passenger to go out. At this point of time, the seat belt light had been turned off. Second incidence happened when the flight had touched down and passengers were ready to take belongings from the compartment above the head. there was a guy sitting infront of my seat no 64D, couldnt bring down his bag from the top compartment.

Chauffeur collection from home worked well, check in at Heathrow T3 quick and polite as was quick track security, offered the use of BA lounge, however having Oneworld FF status choose Cathay Pacific lounge instead which is very nice with good food offering. Boarded from gate 24 onto a new looking A330-300, seat 1A which offered a little more space the layout on this aircraft is 1-2-1 similar and offers good privacy, drinks & towels offered. Once in the air the meal service was quick and well presented, after dinner I watched a movie the TVs selection is okay but not to the standard of perhaps Emirates but good enough. I managed 6 hours sleep woken to coffee and shortly after a full breakfast service, again food was well presented and tasted good - landed about 10 minutes late so total flight time of 11 hours. I stopped over for 18 hours, SriLankan offer hotel if required. I was already checked in for my continuing flight so formalities where quick, I used the Serindab lounge which isn't too good, boarded through gate B2 a remote stand but well organised. Boarded an older A330-200 with the older set up of 2-2-2, however full flat which is nice for a 3hr 30min flight, breakfast served by a nice proactive crew although food on this sector wasn't great. Managed 2 hours sleep before arriving more or less on time. Priority immigration and bags off quickly. Great service really far better than my normal airline BA.

As someone who travels regularly business class from Sri Lanka to London, Emirates is the best operator however if you wish to travel direct, SriLankan is the only option. SriLankan Airlines business class is not a bad product - is it just a bit sloppy and could easily be made substantially better. I am only going to mention two areas here, but everything they do could so easily be made better. First of all staff need improved training. The welcome into the business cabin is non-existent, for the safety briefing no one opens your tv, no one offers to take your jacket, or ask them what champagne they serve and you get a blank look. Food also, whilst not horrendous could easily be improved. For example, breakfast of nice poached eggs with a tiny amount of smoked salmon on a weird (but acceptable muffin) with hollandaise, was surprisingly good - but who in their right mind would put peas with this? (not to mention a chicken sausage). It shows an ignorance of food. We also eat with our eyes, - a vegetarian curry was so grey and miserable looking I just wanted to leave it. Why ruin yogurt but making it so sweet one can barely eat it (why not simply serve a fruit puree on the side so I can mix it myself?) Of course Sri Lankans are very charming, and the airline has a soul, it just needs to sharpen its act.",Business,3.0,nan

The staff said that they are offering a meal which turned out to be acheap sandwiches with a drink. I demanded that the airline put me in a lounge as the delay was close to 7 hours.

A lot has changed, and it's positive. As a Oneworld Emerald, we used the Cathay Lounge which was a nice start to the trip. The gate crew were affable and caring, advising a 10 minute delay in boarding. On board, friendly smiles and genuine respect. Lots of drinks, cognacs, wines in proper glass, 3 options for food (nice curries, but also western), lot of water rounds and juices too. The TV has mainly older films (ie something you'd see on SKY TV) but it's fine, and I slept most of the 10 hours. Awoke to a healthy breakfast, smoothies.

Check in on each leg was quick and efficient. I wasn't offered fast track security departing Heathrow, but I was given an invitation for fast track immigration at Heathrow on my return. UL business class passengers get the use of the BA / OneWorld lounge at Heathrow T3. Not luxurious, but comfortable and well appointed, plenty of hot and cold snacks, and reassuringly plenty of seating. The Serendib Lounge in Colombo was small and felt a bit cramped but comfortable enough with a decent breakfast buffet (closed for 30 minutes or so to switch to a lunch buffet). Good, clean toilets and complimentary wi-fi in both lounges. The SriLankan equipment was an Airbus A330-300. Business Class in a 1-2-1 herringbone type configuration (note – the Sri Lankan A330-200's have a less generous C class layout). The seat was spacious and comfortable, and easily converted to a fully flat bed at the push of a button. A blanket and toiletries bag are provided, but no pyjamas. There is an enormous TV screen, but the selection of programming was somewhat disappointing, with very few recent film releases. Good selection of journey maps though, as well as downward and forward facing cameras. Food was of OK but not fantastic quality, with typically three options of starter and main course, but only one desert. Crew were efficient and courteous, if a bit unsmiling on the outward leg, much friendlier on the return leg. One of the Business Class cabin toilets was out of action for most of the return journey. Basically a decent enough Business Class product with good quality seating, so-so meals and entertainment and inconsistent (but never poor) cabin service.

SriLankan Airlines provided a transit hotel in Colombo, and complimentary lunch and dinner at the airport. The hotel room was basic but clean, and had a safe for valuables if you are leaving the airport. Plane and lavatory clean, Flight Attendants were polite and friendly. Food and drink options were good, plenty of choice for inflight entertainment. The airline let us change our booking with no change fee (only had to pay the difference between flights, which was 60 GBP per person). In the 12 hour layover, we were able to go into Negombo to look around the city and beach, and still have some chill out time and a shower in the transit hotel before the second flight. When we tried to do our online check-in the day of our flight, the booking had mysteriously disappeared. We then spent hours phoning the airline to try and find out what had happened. Apparently, they had not confirmed us on the new flight, as they ""didn't realise"" we'd paid the fee (which was done on the spot when we re-booked). They tried to put us on the next-day flight, which we refused. After many phone calls, they finally confirmed our booking and all was well from that point on.

The toilets were clean, the FAs again there to make the flight comfortable. IFE not as good as Emirates but still a large choice of movies, TV to choose from.

Due to the low load factor, they now use a smaller A320 aircraft, but the newest one called NEO. The leg room in business class is quite good, good recliner seat with foot rest, suitable for a 5 hour flight. Their onboard service and catering have always been outstanding, such as the case in this trip. They have a good touch screen AVOD too, and a decent headphone. They also have a wonderful array of teas, which is what Sri Lanka is famous anyway. From Hong Kong direct to Colombo, SriLankan airlines is the only airlines that does that, and luckily, they are a very good choice.

Seat is ok for a three hour regional service, but dated and not that comfortable if you want to sleep.

The seats on the A 330 were average, the headrest being particularly uncomfortable. The trip from Melbourne to Colombo was satisfactory, but the return trip from Colombo to Melbourne was another matter! For goodness' sake whatever do people do in the toilet? The outward trip was okay except people kept forgetting to close the door. But the return trip was a nightmare! People had constantly left the toilet in a pretty filthy condition, water all over, and scraps of wet toilet tissues scattered all over the floor and stuck to the toilet bowl that wouldn't flush them away. The smell of urine permeated the air, and many passengers recoiled on opening the door. The cabin crew bravely cleaned the toilets (both of them) in the centre of the of the plane at least four times during the ten hour flight. I simply cannot understand why people treat a convenience that all their fellow passengers would need to use during the flight, in such a disrespectable and inconsiderate way. It is just a matter of clean personal hygiene. One wonders in what condition their private toilets are.

Passengers take lots of luggage on board so board early (even if they haven’t called your row) if you want to ensure your bag goes in a convenient spot. This won't work when departing Colombo because they use buses - they called some economy rows for the first bus, then business class passengers for the second bus (so that bus left with only 10 people), then a third bus arrived 15 minutes later for everyone else. Maybe that was why we took off late. Four hours on an A320 often isn’t good but this plane had a new fitout, good legroom and a good entertainment system - big screen and lots of choices. Food was ok but heavy on carbs/starch - lots of bread, lots of potato. No real problems and seemed like a good value way to get to Sri Lanka.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

It’s pointless to go into details about everything that was wrong but look at the photo of our entertainment unit and you’ll get an idea - In what modern day business class do you have to hold your tv? I get that this sounds like ‘first world problens’ but our issue is that we were sold an expensive service by SriLankan Airlines and they didn’t deliver. If they’d told us that they wouldn’t offer the service advertised then we wouldn’t have paid the extra money for business - we actually would have flown economy with Emirates and got a much better service. We made a complaint immediately to SriLankan Airlines and it took them 3 weeks to reply with a pathetic excuse that wasn’t even worth the wait. Terrible customer service, terrible airline.

Firstly we got an old aircraft with no lie-flat beds, just ""regional"" seating. Very small plane - perhaps a 737? - It was 3-3 in Economy and 2-2 in Biz. Before takeoff my husband and I realised we needed to organise a part of our intinerary when we landed and so were discussing options and on my phone fixing things up. Air steward came along to greet us, or should I say, greet my husband. He wasn't interested in me (I'm the OW Emerald who booked the tickets, hubby is my dependent) and tried to break into our conversation to do his greeting. It was so rude it was comical. This turned out to be a feature of Sri Lankan - no greeting (on any of the 4 legs) for me, much ignoring of my call button, generally I was invisible yet the men in the cabin appeared to be getting good service. Incredible in this day and age. Anyway - food - I enjoyed most of it. Usually a western option as well as a Sri Lankan one, and I like Sri Lankan food so that was good. Seats - poor on the HK- Colombo, Colombo - London return was a nice new herringbone configuration with decent seats. No in seat storage (at all) but otherwise fine. Colombo-HK we were pleasantly surprised to get the ""old"" long haul product - which is lie flat seats but old style. I actually find these very comfy and much more in-seat storage. I left a jacket on the UK-colombo flight (my own fault, but) never got it back. Was lied to by the staff in the lounge ""oh yes, they really did go and look in the overhead locker you mentioned"" (no, actually the plane had already left for the next leg so when she said this, it was blatantly untrue). Entertainment was dire. OK if you like really old films. The TV selection was laughable. A few single episodes of a few shows - nothing else! But luckily I already knew this and had packed some books. Another gem - was fast asleep on the flight back and was shaken awake for a hot towel! Some 3 hours before landing. After a short exchange when I indicated I wanted to stay asleep, then about 10 mins later shaken awake for food service by another guy. Pretty awful cabin service on balance. Oh - there are no hand-luggage trolleys in Colombo. Normally this would not bother me, but on this occasion I had pulled a chest muscle and even tiny hand luggage was hard to carry.

IFE choice much better although screen not as responsive. Excellent crew; they were really attentive and went out of their way, example, multiple top-ups of alcohol plus provided me with Paracetamol when I knew I had overdone it. For the first drink I was given 2 large glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon and one of these was topped up prior to the meal 10 minutes later. Food was excellent; I had the white fish for episode one with Hollandaise Sauce plus a good vegetable assortment with roll, mini side salad and dessert was Tiramisu; all very tasty and served with metal cutlery. Food service speed also excellent; attentive staff: good deportment plus service augmenting eye contact. Episode two was a beautifully tender piece of braised steak with creamy sauce, beans, carrots and mashed potatoes. Small random side salad plus macaroons. An hour after eating one cabin crew wandered up and down the cabin topping up wine glasses. I particularly liked the captains announcement on the second leg as he explained the fact that we were to be flying at increasing heights along the way as we lost weight due to fuel burn.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,April 2018,1.0,3.0,5.0,no,Doha to Bangkok via Colombo,1.0," |  Doha to Bangkok via Colombo. This was the worst flight I've ever taken. The plane smelt as customers were complaining about the smell, the cabin crew went around spraying chemicals and air fresheners to mask the odor. It was unbearable. The flight was late and 34 people missed their connection to Bangkok. Families with small children had to wait in the Colombo airport for 8 hours, just to board a plane to Singapore, to then get to Bangkok. No hotel vouchers were given. People lost days of their vacations. As a single traveler, I was lucky and was able to board a plane at 8am (so I only had to wait 6 hours). Unfortunately, I missed my connecting flight to Chiang Mai. No reimbursement, or course. All they would offer were breakfast vouchers. The breakfast was disgusting.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

We were waiting in Male business lounge, looking at the screen several times and found out that our plane was delayed. The lady behind the desk said: don't worry we will call you in time. After one and half hour we looked at the screen again and seen the final closing. Running to the gate we just managed to get on. We asked for a welcome sparkling wine instead of juice, but our request was refused. Surprised because on the to Male we had that drink. In Colombo we couldn't enjoy the lounge because had to rush to catch the flight to London.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

At checkin, the representative told me that I have got an upgrade and asked me to talk to the officials at the boarding gate. When I check with the person at the boarding gate, they said you have no Upgrade. I saw them giving upgrade to their known passengers. This is disappointing to me, they should not promise if they can't deliver and the officials spoke in a harsh way to me. I paid for my seat and i am not liable to take this kind of treatment.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,March 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Colombo to Bengaluru,3.0," | Flew Colombo to Bengaluru with SriLankan Airlines. Leg room is less. No entertainment even though screens are installed, won't give you head phones. Don't understand the logic of that. Food is poor and next to nothing offered. The only decent thing is the people, who are very sweet and kind from the entry into the airport. Was given middle seat, citing there are no other seats available and then I see that the last few rows were completely empty. Check-in at airport is exceptionally slow, so is the boarding process. They announce final call 1 hour prior to flight time and don't board till 20 mins before, keeping you holed up in a small room all this while.",Business,5.0,nan

Service was spectacular from the beginning till the end. Cabin crew were fantastic. Food and beverages selection was decent enough and tasted just ok for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment offered. Highly recommended.,Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,January 2018,nan,nan,nan,no,Bangalore to Colombo,nan," |  My friend and I had to cancel the flights because we could not fly. After the flights were cancelled we were upgraded to business class and charged for this. It took us 10 telephone calls, around 50 emails and 1.5 months of chasing to get our money back. The customer support in the UK on the phone spoke bad English and could not explain anything properly. We got confusing messages on emails, were sent from one department to another and faced with numerous delays. Customer service is non existent, the refund system is confusing and requires you to fill a form for each ticket. One department of the airline does not talk to another. We ended up complaining to their customer support team (we were given their details after weeks of requesting them!) however we still faced delays and only got the money back after 45 days of constant chasing.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A321,Business Class,3.0,June 2018,4.0,3.0,1.0,no,Male to Colombo,1.0," |  Male to Colombo. Had a poor experience with SriLankan Airlines recently. Flight got its aircraft changed about 2 days earlier and it was switched to the A321 from the A330 which caused a massive decline in service. To start, there is no lie flat seats like you will see on the A330. No IFE either (I believe this A321 must be the former Mihin Lanka airplane). The staff was ok and the food was fine. However, the lack of customers support with they did not tell that the aircraft was switched to the A321 is totally unacceptable. Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Had no such issues like this with other airline before - Emirates, Qatar, Singapore, Cathay, China Southern etc and they have a much professional customer support against this airline.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
A330-200 / A330-300,Economy Class,3.0,March 2018,2.0,1.0,3.0,no,Melbourne to Male via Colombo,2.0," |  Melbourne to Male via Colombo. 3 out of my 4 flights in this trip were delayed and I did not enjoy the quality of economy class cabin. It baffles me as to why they would use an A330-200 for a long haul flight while a decked out A330-300 was used for a flight that lasted an hour from Colombo to male. Price was cheep and so I guess you get what you pay for. Food was pretty average, drinks kinda limited too. The final flight heading back home was delayed by 7 hours. Although a hotel and dinner was provided but we found the quality of the establishment a bit on the substandard side. The transfer to and from the hotel and going through immigration almost makes it not worth it. My final whinge is around their online bidding system where you can make a bid for business class upgrades. It seems like no one is actually looking at it as my bid of $915 USD per person was got expired without an outcome. Its super odd that it wasn't even considered when one could have bought a fresh one way ticket from Colombo to Melbourne for $1085 USD on the spot at the airport.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Mumbai to Adelaide via Colombo,1.0," |  It started raining at the time of departure from Mumbai Airport and the flight got delayed because of that, which is understandable. But the thing that ticked us off was we were waiting for 12 hours at Mumbai Airport and authority from Srilankan Airlines didn't even provide us any accommodation. Airline was supposed to provide us with dinner, but they provided us with half a sandwich and told we can buy ourselves if we want more. We had a connecting flight via Colombo to Melbourne to Adelaide. We were rerouted through Singapore then Melbourne to Adelaide. There were flights directly going to Adelaide from Singapore of the same airlines from which we were going (Qantas) and there were seats available but the planning experts from Srilankan Airlines put us on Melbourne plane. And this is not all. From Melbourne, we were supposed to take a domestic flight to Adelaide, which was flying like every other hour. But our organisers, very conveniently, put us on the flight which was scheduled after 12 hours. We had to collect all our luggage to complete immigration process. We were roaming around the Melbourne Airport like idiots with 100 kgs of luggage, deprived of sleep and no service provided by Srilankan Airlines. We reached Adelaide 24 hours late, lost our bookings and whole day plan gone to drain. We understand that what happened was because of bad weather but what followed was just bad management. It was not only me, but all the passengers were harrassed. Why was accommodation not provided to us at Mumbai Airport or at Melbourne Airport? Why was there no facility for refreshment? Would not recommend Srilankan Airlines to anyone.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I was quite impressed with the ease of check-in, attentiveness of the cabin crew and  meals served. The flight attendants smiled and made you feel comfortable and were attentive and eager to assist with any questions. The aircraft was comfortable and the toilets were clean. It was refreshing to see that some airlines still take a lot of pride in excellent customer service. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

I a delicious meal for just an hour flight - Butter Chicken with rice with good drinks served. The flight was late due to traffic issues. The seats is big as Cathay Pacific Business Class and comfortable being fully flat. The staff was friendly and caring for its passengers. ",Business,5.0,nan
A330-200/A321,Economy Class,3.0,May 2018,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes,Melbourne to Chennai via Colombo,2.0," |  Melbourne to Chennai via Colombo. Very competitive pricing and the layover in Colombo was short.  Decent Choice of Food - had 3 choices and all of them were available for most of us. Usually, if you are seated away from where the service starts, you end up have lesser options. The A33o-200 used for the Melbourne Leg is very old. The seats were dirty, not reclining fully and the headrest was bulging forward making it almost impossible to sit back without reclining. The cabin crew were really unprofessional when it came to bumping aisle seated passengers. While I understand its difficult to manoeuvre in a fully packed flight, a quick sorry for bumping into a passenger would have gone a long way. Transit in Colombo airport was not very good. The airport itself is very basic and the amenities in the airport were not maintained well( Dirty washrooms). Overall for the price offered, the short transit time and the decent food, I would recommend.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

While it was a full flight, ground staff behaved rudely asking us, a group of 4, to check in the only cabin baggage less than 55 cm. Spoke real harsh to us when we explained there was a laptop in the bag. Boarded flight disorderly, with two rows on boarding ladder. Preflight, there was no briefing to pax seated in emergency row, allowed elderly person to sit in emergency row, next to exit. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

The check in staff at the airport were extremely rude. Although they can appear to be pleasant to foreign tourists, they can be hostile to Sri Lankans and other Asians. On my last flight, I reached the check in desk in the queue one hour and 20 minutes before my flight, but they turned me away saying I was too late. This was despite the fact that they had already weighed my luggage and processed the passengers in front of me and subsequently the passengers behind me. The problem seemed to be that I had a voucher for extra baggage after trading in my Airmiles which the check in staff were not happy about. I had to purchase a new ticket for the following day at great expense and inconvenience. I contacted the customer complaints department in their office who were not interested in this issue or a refund. They claimed that the reason I was denied boarding was due to a heavy suitcase (I transferred some items to another case) and late.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

After an emergency stop in Muscat due to lack of fuel, we were delayed 6 hours and missed our next two connections. After almost 4 more hours at the airport, everyone lies and pushes the responsibility to someone else.

A321,Business Class,5.0,April 2018,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Bahrain to Colombo,2.0," |  Business return Bahrain to Colombo on a A321 . Both flights left on time and landed slightly early . Both were smooth, Crew were pleasant, friendly and engaging. Did not load my gluten free meal on the return leg. But did their best to find something. Entertainment was adequate with sufficient movies and TV to keep you occupied on these 5 hour segments. Drinks were supplied non stop and wine was sufficiently well chilled, food was ok at best barely a step over economy - one starter - salad - option of three mains and one desert . so Y class faire. MY gripe is that the regional seating is not comfortable, hardish seats, cradle style, not suitable for sleeping as the curvature of the seats is non existant with no leg support. Whilst I appreciate that Bahrain may not be a premium route for the airline, both were very full flights being over 180 persons. Most other middle east cities get A330 aircraft with lie flat seats. The seat need to be addressed as they are not worth the extra monies in my view.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan
