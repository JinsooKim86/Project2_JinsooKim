Whilst the onboard team are  incredible, the business class offer on the Boeing 787-9 is frugal, uninspiring and downright average. Meals served which is my primary issue - lacked any inspiration - looked and tasted like an economy class meal on porcelain. Everything about the premium offer was underwhelming and frugal.

A340-600,Premium Economy,5.0,June 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,London to New York JFK,4.0," |  London to New York JFK. Good and not so great. We were originally booked on a Boeing 787-9 in a center and aisle seat in the Premium 2x3x2 configuration. When we checked in we noticed that we had been given seats 18A/C (window and aisle) and it wasn't until we boarded that I noticed there had been a change in aircraft. We were now in a rather old and tired A340-600: no leg rest (although individual foot rests were provided after take off that were very comfortable), clunky video monitor which took some finessing to get to stay up, no USB ports to charge devices and the remote holder was falling out of the side of the seat. Oh well. We were scheduled to leave at 3:45. Upon boarding I laughed as I saw a guy sit down at the Upper Class bar and didn't think anything of it. The plane pushed back on time. Stopped. Then the gate was brought back to the plane in order to eject said person who, in the opinion of the crew, was intoxicated and a danger to the rest of the passengers and crew. The service was excellent: we were offered prosecco or o.j. prior to takeoff which was nice and rarely offered on a US airline. Shortly before takeoff we were given menus showing a dinner service and a pre-landing afternoon ""smart"" tea. Both were really delicious. Cocktails before dinner and wine (individual bottles) with dinner were great too. The IFE system worked well with a great selection of movies. WiFi was pay per use. The ""smart tea"" was a nice light snack prior to landing. We had to wait on the tarmac as the airport was re-opened due to thunderstorms that had passed through just before we arrived. We pulled in to the gate 1 hour late, due in no part to Virgin Atlantic. We are definitely planning on flying with Virgin again and highly recommend their Premium Economy product; definitely worth the additional money.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Our flight left JFK 2.5 hours late, I think to do with weather conditions in NYC. I missed my connecting flight to Milan. Upon arrival at Heathrow, there was a long line at the Virgin Atlantic ticketing booth. There were several large planes that had left late from JFK, but Virgin only had 2 people working at the ticketing booth. I waited in line for about 45 minutes just to get re-ticketed. When I finally got to the front of the line, the person there was not very helpful or accommodating. I ended up needing to talk with British Airways to figure out the right connecting flight to take, and then I had to get back in line again and talk to someone else at Virgin. I ended up at Heathrow for about 10 hours, and I'm fairly certain that I missed earlier connecting flights because ticketing at Virgin was such a mess. Staff on the plane were great, but ticketing was very understaffed and not very helpful.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Check in staff at Atlanta need retraining in the art of customer service, they should be aware that without the customer there will be no job. When checking in I raised a query about the seat allocation and was told in no uncertain terms that I should sort out the problem with the other passengers on the aircraft when I got on board. So helpful and very nearly rude. There was no indication that the check in clerk was going to do anything to help as it all seemed to be too much trouble. As for the food on the flight, this left a lot to be desired. Virgin Atlantic need to sort this out as they will lose customers.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

We were seated at the rear of the aircraft in the centre aisle. On boarding the stewardess sent us down the wrong side of the aisle which was ok but the other passenger who sat in our row of four (there were three of us) commented straight away ""your in the wrong seat"" as we were just checking it didn't really matter at that stage because we hadn't even sat down but she was very rude. Great start. We have flown to Orlando eight times, seven of which have been with Virgin and this was probably the second worst flight we have been on. Nothing wrong with the aircraft or crew but I object to sitting in the dark for almost five hours, this was a daytime flight. I have never known the lights to be dimmed and all window blinds closed, I'm not sure if the blinds was a coincidence but dimming the lights on the plane certainly wasnt. it was impossible to read. If I had been sitting by a window the blind would have been left open. The food was fine, the entertainment was ok but I did have a problem with the touch screen not responding correctly. Landing at Orlando was a little bumpy and immigration was quick and easy. All in all not up to the standard we are used to with Virgin on the outward trip.

Boeing 747-400,Premium Economy,3.0,March 2018,1.0,4.0,1.0,no,Gatwick to Las Vegas,1.0," |  Terrible experience We were at first pleasantly surprised to be allocated premium economy seats with extra leg room . Our pleasure was very short lived. My seat wobbled constantly and I am sure upset the passenger behind. My armrest was broken and detached itself all through the flight. Both tv monitors did not work and the bracket for my wife’s monitor bracket continually fell to the floor and could only be operated if she held it. The flight ran out of alcoholic drinks after the first drink and were not available for the rest of the flight. On our second meal they had run out of everything other than the veggie option. In its self not a problem but sandwich was pretty well uneatable. Approximately at the same time the toilets on one side of the plane were taken out of use. For the last 2 hours No toilets were in action. We were later informed on the tannoy that “if we wanted to do numbers 1’s we would be ok”. The plane itself had seen better days. viewing out of the windows was impossible as they were badly scratched, and loud noiseswere apparent from the wheels when on the runway. The flight was the worst flight I have been on and particularly annoying as we had paid extra for a premium ecomy seat. The customer services section have offered very little and would like the case closed. No chance I suppose I’ve should be grateful for getting to our destination.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,2.0,Having flown to New York with Virgin in 2000 and found them to be the best airline I've travelled with thus far I was looking forward to my flight home (if one can look forward to returning from a great holiday). I was offered an upgrade on my seat for $70 as I had been unable to check-in online and was therefore stuck at the back of the aircraft but declined. In retrospect I wish I had because the seat I was in was incredibly uncomfortable and I was on an aisle so was able to stretch out a little unlike the guy next to me. The cabin crew were friendly the inflight entertainment very reasonable but the food was pretty poor to say the least and a lot of options had run out by the time they got to me (which I understand to an extent as I was one of the very last to be served due to my place on the aircraft). It might have been a bit of a blip as I loved them before but I'll certainly be plumping for Delta over Virgin in the future if given the choice.,nan,3.0,nan

Crew good - the problems come from the seat and the Vera entertainment. The latter has a very small screen for this class (compared to say Austrian or Swiss) awful music selection (surprising) and generally feels old. The seating is awkward - shoulder light cannot illuminate the dinner table due to angle seat upright is narrow for anyone with broad shoulders and horizontal sleep impossible for the same reason.

My seat didn't work and not once stayed in any position apart from upright. Apart from the staff I can't think of anything on that flight that should stay even the food tasted like it'd been used a few times. The second flight was San Francisco to London.

I know that to many a £500+ return is not big money but surely it is not beyond their wit to provide the passenger with something edible. The cabin crew were as always delightful.

nan,Premium Economy,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,My husband and I were on our 10th holiday to Jamaica and when asked to fill out the immigration cards we were told by the stewardess that we only needed to fill out one card as we had the same surname (same family) which seemed strange as we usually have 1 card per person. We did as we were told only when we got to immigration in Jamaica we should have filled out one card per person. We then had to fill out 2 new cards along with loads of other passengers who had been told the same information - and then go to the back of the queue which is something you don't need after a 9.5 hour flight I can tell you. Personally I think Virgin staff need to get their act together regarding this issue. Apart from that everything was great - boarding and take off on time.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,Flew from Manchester to Hong Kong and returned Shanghai to Manchester via Heathrow both ways. The little red service is great quick efficient and perfect for connecting it's a shame this service is being discontinued as even though BA service is fine enough connecting from Terminal 5 is always a nightmare I find terminals 2 and 3 much more comfortable. As for the long haul service I struggle to understand how Virgin can put an ancient A340-300 on a 12 hour long haul route the entertainment was shocking the old Vera Reel system should of been replaced years ago. I could tell they had put there most battle hardened cabin crew on this route obviously to deal with this I have never seen a cabin manager talking to so many passengers mid flight though it must be said she did a great job. Luckily the return flight from Shanghai was on a newer A340-600 and the on demand entertainment was much better. The crew on this flight though were clearly struggling with the majority Chinese passengers and while there were Chinese crew to help there was no communication between the British and Chinese crew. I find the crew on Cathay Emirates Qatar and other long haul airlines to have a much more professional attitude. Overall though the flights were on time comfortable enough for an economy ticket and I would fly Virgin again luckily they are retiring the old A340s because flying on one of them again would be the deal breaker.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,What a disappointment. This was my first time with the airline and trust me though in some ways better than BA I would have rather flown with Delta or US Air. I had to fly to Charlotte for a Funeral and I had to make my reservation at the last minute. All was fine until I wanted to allocate my seating and was unaware that Virgin do charge for allocating seats prior to 24 hour web check in. That was the start of disappointment. I got my seats done 24 hours prior to departure and managed to get 2 seats by the window. When I got into the aircraft Airbus 333 and took my seat I could barely fit in the seat as on one side my partner was sitting near the window and I was rubbing my shoulder with her shoulder for 8 hours and then the Aisle where my other shoulder was bumped by walking passengers and trolleys. Food was ok nothing exceptional and service was ok too. On my return on 14/02/15 flight was empty and my partner was not feeling well at all. I requested the crew for a middle row which there were plenty of them empty for my partner to sleep due to her not being well and despite row 44 to row 48 were totally empty crew had tied the armrest with seat belts advising passenger that the arm rest cannot be pulled up to make a bed. My partner was given a bassinet seat where she had to be cramped in to lie down. As this was an overnight flight as we got nearer to Heathrow I asked one of the crew as to who the seats were RESERVED for as I saw a lady crew writing RESERVED and placing it on the dinner table. The crew replied boldly: IT WAS FOR US. This meant that the crew were allowed to use passenger seats for themselves rather than making the passenger comfortable for a 7hr 15 minute flight. I stopped flying with BA in 2004 and have not flown with them again and the same goes for Virgin Atlantic. No more praises for such an airline.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,"Flew ABZ-LHR-EWR returning JFK-LHR-ABZ. Outward flight with Little Red was as with my previous flights outstanding. The Little Red service exceeds what is expected of a short domestic flight and the crew clearly take pride in delivering the product. Another exemplary flight with the short haul branch. This was my first experience with long-haul Virgin. The outward flight to Newark was comfortable and I found leg room to be sufficient. It was perhaps a bit tight at the shoulders but I was in fairness seated towards the back of the A330's cabin where the cabin begins to narrow. In flight entertainment offered an excellent choice of movies including many that were nominated for Oscars. The crew were polite and friendly not exceptional but gave no cause for complaint. The food (chicken something or other) looked a bit pathetic and the chicken was a bit tough but actually tasted OK otherwise. The sandwich box was a tasty way to round off the flight. Ground staff at all airports went above expectations and were particularly helpful on arrival at Newark. I returned on a 747 from JFK. I had paid extra to select my seat choosing the upstairs economy cabin for the novelty value. Unfortunately my flight was remarkably quiet and they closed the upstairs cabin re-allocating me to the rear of the plane. The ground staff at JFK were not particularly helpful at first in addressing this although eventually offered me an exit row seat which was more than comfortable and although I wasn't offered a window seat (which I would have preferred) the offer to upgrade my seat was certainly welcome compensation. The flight was very lightly loaded and I had very few people around me. The beef stew for dinner was again not particularly appealing to look at but actually tasted very nice. The Gü puddings were absolutely delicious. The IFE broke down and was unusable but we were offered tablet devices and compensation for this - the issue was dealt with well. I managed some sleep on this overnight flight - the complimentary amenities kit helped a lot! I awoke to find I'd missed the breakfast service but the crew had kindly left me a tasty breakfast box without disturbing me which was very thoughtful. As for the final Little Red flight back to Scotland - again excellent. It is clear that the Little Red staff take a great deal of pride in offering what I judge to be the finest short-haul economy product in the skies. The Virgin product is pretty standard and although they promote excellent service certainly for the Economy product it only shows in small areas such as the nice puddings and some little touches here and there. It's certainly not a bad product but not quite the ""rock star"" service that they sell to us. I'd certainly use them again long haul although probably will not be able to with the domestic flights being withdrawn in due course. The Little Red service continue to provide the best short haul flights in the skies and will be sorely missed.",nan,4.0,nan

Entertainment system was terrible - not as good as new VERA on 340-600 planes. Food was average. Return from HK was worse as 340-300 aircraft was even older than one on Shanghai route. Having paid a fortune to travel Upper Class it was disappointing not to be told that old aircraft were going to be used on both routes. Will definitely think twice before flying with Virgin again.

Food provided satisfactory but half way through the flight they had run out of soft drinks so they said on request but it was clear this was not the case as they were visible on the trolley. Extra leg room was paid for which was provided but they did not inform me when booking to expect a playground at my feet. Width of seating was shocking not being a large person it was a little tight but disappointing that I had to have a person sitting next to me invade my space. Very disappointed to over hear young staff talk about customers on the return flight in the manner they did very unprofessional. Again female staff presentation very poor on the return journey. Very much the same as the outbound journey very uncomfortable journey.

nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,"Flew LHR-Cape Town-LHR last month. First the good(ish) news. The LHR lounge was comfortable but rather crowded (despite which the upper level was closed). Food and drink good but if they insist on making everything waiter service they could with more staff. (The Cape Town lounge which is not Virgin's own was however a dismal experience). On board the crew were fine. Food average to good apart from an inedible first course (some sort of chicken mousse) to dinner on the return flight and wines were excellent. Now the bad news: the seating. (1) It was very narrow with no room for an armrest on one side. (2) Converting from seat to bed is not done electronically as in all other business class seats I've ever flown on. The operation requires the passenger to get out of the seat (which cannot of course be done with seat belt signs on) so the back of the seat can be folded forward to make the ""mattress"". This cumbersome procedure is a real nuisance especially if (as often happens on long-haul flights) you wish to go from seat to bed and back again more than once. (3) The ""window"" seats give only the most restricted view out of the windows. In fact alternative rows of seats have no window at all (what's more the on-line seating plan doesn't show the position of windows to enable you to choose a seat with a view). The other rows have a window but the seats are so angled (presumably to save space) that you have to look back over your should to get a glimpse of the outside. In all this seating design should never have got off the drawing board and is certainly not worth paying a full business class fare for. Never again.",nan,1.0,nan

The food inflight entertainment bar etc are not important to us our priorities are lounge access frequent flyer miles and onboard space which we are happy to pay a premium for. However we did feel that the Upper Class suite on their A330 aircraft is now smaller in width and length and the aisles are very narrow when compared to the 747 that used to operate to and from St Lucia.

Unfortunately as we were on an Airbus it was obvious that too many Upper Class seats have been squeezed in.

A busy morning at LHR check-in but staff were there to minimise the queues and I was checked in at an Upper Class desk within 5 mins of arriving. A full cabin on the day flight to Miami. We left on time and a Bloody Mary was mixed at the bar for me (a nice touch) with lunch following drinks all presented on a try with real crockery and cutlery. Plenty of space around me although the old IFE system was used on the ageing 747. We live in a touchscreen digital age now and negotiating screens with a sticking cursor keypad was somewhat archaic and annoying. Crew were pleasant and helpful with regular rounds of water and orange juice (or any other drink if you wanted). We landed 20 mins ahead of schedule and my luggage was one of the first out another reason I like PE. The flight back from Washington was on the new 787 and the difference in seat style and IFE against the 747 was immediately noticeable. Flight was only a third full so I had the window and isle to myself. Dinner served promptly after take off but I wanted a drink first so they put my meal back in the oven and I had it when I wanted it - a more business class level of service from a personable professional team. The IFE touchscreen was great and I stretched out and thoroughly enjoyed the movies snacks and drinks all night long! A full English was served an 90 mins before landing. We arrived an hour early due to strong tailwinds and my bag was out within two mins of me arriving at the belt. I don't mind paying what was nearly double the economy fare when the experience was as good as this.

It was from Gatwick - St Lucia - Gatwick and the seat was 52 window and aisle. Both trips were agony. I am fairly fit as I run quite a lot and my wife rides her horse every day so we are both fit and would regard ourselves as not having any special needs in terms of seating. I will never fly in an airbus 320 again with Virgin. We have flown several times on their 747's and they were comfortable in all respects.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,This was a 6 hour trip from San Francisco CA to Newark NJ with no entertainment because the inflight entertainment system did not work at my seat. I asked 2 different flight attendants to restart the unit but they each gave up in one second leaving me with nothing to do or watch for this long trip. The girl sitting in front of me reclined her seat so violently that she knocked the lunch that I had paid for in the airport off the tray and into my lap and the floor. When I demanded that she sit up so I could at least pick it up and dispose of it she complained to the flight attendant that I was keeping her from reclining her seat. I could not order something else to eat because you need the in flight entertainment system to see what is available and order it. Apparently now that there is the in-flight entertainment unit there is no back up in case it doesn't work for some reason.,nan,2.0,nan

This is something I would expect from a budget airline. I think I will start using other airlines (such as Emirates) even if it means I have to change and add on extra hours to my overall flight time.

Missed my connecting flight in Heathrow because Virgin Atlantic Staff at Check in were unhelpful and unable to perform a simple job - the women there did not know how to print boarding pass making it impossible for me to catch the flight. Had to wait 9 hours for next flight and did not get any vouchers for lunch or similar instead I was spoken to in a very unfriendly and condescending manner. They also were unable to check my bag through although I showed them the baggage-tracking-number twice (it was checked in in Zurich) and I had to wait for 6 days until it was delivered to me in Boston.

Not wild about the seat configuration. I was traveling with my husband and no way for two passengers to sit together. The seat itself was odd to say the least. Very narrow and the seat doesn't recline very much or offer any personal storage space. You then have to get up to have the seat convert to a bed. It was comfortable as a bed.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,Glasgow - Orlando in April 2015 with return flight early May. I chose to write this review because so many I have read have suggested a horrible experience. That was not the case for my family and I albeit our flights were only half full both ways which I'm sure helped the experience. First things first though: the cons. After booking our tickets and waiting for seat reservations to open up we found out that to reserve a seat cost money (£25-£35 with the higher cost for extra legroom or an exit row). This seemed scandalous to us especially on a transatlantic flight. However we chose to reserve an exit row at a cost of £210 in total for 3 of us to have the same seats there and back. The only thing I'd say about this is forearmed is forewarned we had not appreciated that was the case when we booked. Would it effect our decision in the future? Probably not because we wanted to fly direct to Orlando rather than via London (or another UK airport). You can of course wait until 24 hours before you fly but then you are a hostage to fortune in terms of where you might be. We chose seats on the upper deck and this is something I would recommend. It's smaller therefore quieter and there are two bathrooms for a cabin that houses no more than 60 so it's easier to access too. I can't fault the staff who were attentive throughout. Food was ok - this is economy - and we got drinks as often as we wanted (which wasn't a great deal but it was never any trouble to staff to accommodate our needs). The in-flight entertainment system was very good with plenty of movies to keep me entertained for an 8-hour flight. All in all I would fly Virgin again based on this experience but it would be in the knowledge that to get a seat I wanted - I much prefer an aisle seat on a long flight - the 'true' cost would be £50-£70 more expensive than the original purchase price and that is something I would take into account when looking at other airlines.,nan,3.0,nan

The new Upper Class seat is much narrower than the old one and it is therefore difficult to get a decent sleeping position other than on your side with your back to the curve of the seat. Main meal was mediocre and would only have merited 1* but the score was raised by the breakfast which was first class. Cabin crew were cheerful and attentive throughout the flight. Surprised though that the bar was closed all through the flight. Toilets on the A330 were few in number (one dedicated and two shared with Premium Economy) and because there is no centre luggage bin the scrabble for overhead bin space on this full flight was ridiculous. IFE not available until after take off and offering was mediocre compared with airlines like Emirates.,nan,3.0,nan

I remember speaking to the stewardess asking if something could be done and she just said there all like it and the plane is full unless you want to pay for an upgrade - how I wish I had. The worst long distance seating in the world. Never again will I fly Virgin Atlantic. On the return journey today we decided to upgrade VS604 cost me £800+ for the 3 of us only to get what I consider a reasonable seat.

During our return flight the cabin crew were abrupt and unfriendly not a smile between them. We was spoken to in an unprofessional manner. When it came to serving supper we was informed that there was not enough of the vegetarian option and that being seated to the rear of the cabin we was at a disadvantage.

The seat was pretty comfortable for the first time ever I actually got a decent amount of sleep on the way out and didn't have any problems with legroom or numb bum even when on the return day flight the people in front fully reclined their seats. Though to be fair I do not like the fixed armrest between seats it makes you feel more enclosed. Service on board was good staff kept busy were friendly and very well turned out a credit to their airline really. Food and drinks were served regularly. I do think the food has declined in quality for the main meals. They were a bit lacklustre and the desserts were just not nice I left mine on both legs. What happened to the Gu pots? They were always of a reliable quality why change a winning formula. Also noticed no daytime amenity pack but to be honest that is no great loss the night time one is still provided and that is the one I find useful.

Even in so-called 'cattle class' it was an all time low.

This is the first time in a while I've been on VA since I've been traveling a lot on Lufthansa to Germany. It is too bad that this 4 seats in Economy to 3 seats in Premium Economy seem to be all about the profit margin.

Bad from the start flight was shown as Gate Closed 10 minutes earlier than first advised I had issues at security and when I finally got to the gate way after it was supposed to have closed it was actually still open and no-one had been boarded at all. On the outbound trip we had good customer service with a friendly cabin crew. I found the seats a bit hard and also basic inclusions with other (airlines) economy cabins missing (but noticed you get them in premium economy for some more cash) - eg folding foot rest and movable headrests (it moved horizontally but the wings didn't adjust vertically). I always eat vegetarian on long haul usually you're served first. VA offered me a standard meal didn't seem to realised I'd book vegetarian. I had the misfortune to point it out to them and then was served with the most abysmal substitute for a meal with strong flavours of olives and capers that not everyone vegetarian or not is going to like. Thankfully I'm not veg so I asked for a standard meal staff were very good in trying to located something but only came up the veg option on the regular menu which was of equally abysmal quality and taste. What was worse 10 days later I got the exact same meal on the flight home. When I asked for something else this time the staff were disinterested and bordered on rude. Worst food I've had when flying. Wine was quite nice though. Inflight entertainment same standard but the touch screen takes some mastering (its not sensitive unless done in a certain way) and it's not a good idea to have to thump your screen when someone else's head is behind it most likely trying to sleep. Rack for brochures and personal items was either broken or just didn't close at the sides so any small items put in it just fell out not very secure. Flights themselves were smooth so hats off to the pilots they kept us informed through a long period of turbulence. Check in fine at both ends. Got a comfort pack for the night flight socks we're the thinnest I've ever been given. Because of when I booked didn't have to pay to choose my seats but would put me off (besides the experience) using them next time why should I pay on top of the huge fare for me seat too this should be standard with major airline long haul flights.,nan,2.0,nan

I had been so keen to fly on the Dreamliner and actually tweaked our plans to go out and back from LA on this plane. Due to money constraints, this is our first economy flight as a family. Many years ago I flew with Virgin on business to Vegas in economy and vowed never again. The flight out was fine. It is a really good aircraft. Seems generally, really spacious. Plenty of room in the overhead lockers. We fluked bulkhead seats going out and these were good with decent leg room. The seat is a new design and very slim. Quite hard though for 11 hours. Due to not having a table on the seat in front the table folded out from the armrest along with the TV. This meant the seats were really, really narrow. I am a normal sized bloke and this seat was narrower than on any two or three hour hop in Europe with budget airlines. There was a small amount of recline and this did help comfort a little. The food was as you expect it to be. Edible calories. The service was reasonable although very noticeabley different than in premium cabins. Very rushed. The flight home was terrible. I had paid for extra legroom seats and found myself next to the toilets getting stood on and kicked pretty much all night. Virgin should not under any circumstances sell these seats as some kind of benefit. If anything they should give them to people they don't want to fly with them again. The plane itself had lovely big windows which helped the general atmosphere and we did really feel a bit better due to the improved air / humidity etc. Due to the cabin being a 3+3+3 the aisles were really tight. Passing through the PE cabin I was also quite surprised at how cramped the seats looked. All in all, I would not be keen to do this again. If this is the future of flying then I am afraid that we shall be flying less long haul. We are going to Australia next year and there is no way in the world that I will be flying Virgin for this. I think it is time to change my allegiances and to try other airlines for long haul.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

LA to LHR was Virgin Atlantic A340. Biggest let down was the Delta flight from SFO to LA. Meant to depart at 7pm. Took off at 8.30pm. My wife had the same experience a week later. That meant that the transfer time at LA was impossibly short. I had to literally find my way out from the Delta terminal and walk on the side walk to the the Virgin Terminal. That is a good 20 minute walk. There was no assistance available at all. Half a dozen of us made our own way. The had to go through security again which is a pain. Made it to the boarding gate when they were boarding only because the Virgin plane was late. Hold luggage didn't make it. The Delta link up with Virgin is a disaster. Had I known! The A340 is crammed in the economy. Legroom very tight for tall people. And the Entertainment system packed up, so the whole 11 hours were difficult to pass. Service is okay. Nothing to brag about.

The food was average at best but the actions of certain crew had me amazed. I was sat on one side of the galley and on the other side a stag group of about 9-12 guys. Throughout the flight there was constant bad language which was not once addressed by the crew even with small children only a couple of rows back. It seemed that two young female members of the crew seemed to think they were on a social night out with the guys from the stag do and spent most of the flight sat in the galley talking to them allowed them to help themselves to the drinks! Later one of the crew went to the Business class cabin loaded a plate of cheese and biscuits and brought it back to the galley for the hungry stags to feast on.

Arrived early for bag drop but realised that my new passport had not been updated on the ESTA system for getting into the US. Check in agent was pretty good at telling me where to go to get it done but also made a call for me to find out waiting times - turned out I'd be cutting it close so did it on my phone instead. Was enormously relieved as this nearly ruined my entire trip. Paid for assigned seat on upper deck but might consider shelling out double for an extra legroom seat next time if in economy the cramped space is a real issue with a tall guy on a flight this long. Cabin bag space is an issue as well but crew were accommodating in finding space for my bag (which despite being a little large the check in agent had waived through after explaining the unusual reason for my trip - these guys have a lot of discretion and it pays to be nice to them). Plane delayed due to disruptive and violent drunk passengers. I neither witnessed this directly nor intervened as police were already in attendance. Given how frustrating this delay was I would question Virgin's gate staff level of vigilance in letting these guys get to the aircraft in the first place. The resulting tirade of repetitive warning PA's from the captain and cabin senior were a little condescending and poorly worded and seemed to reflect quite a bit of judgement on people who had done nothing at all. Once we got underway flight was uneventful. Food good (for economy) IFE decent but need to bring your own headphones if you want decent sound seat reasonable. One thing of note is that the seat belt signs were turned on for turbulence a total of 5-6 times despite mild turbulence only been present once. I speculated that they were doing this to give the crew a break and I have mixed views on this. Service otherwise good if a little robotic and crew were a tad informal at times.

Its geared for the average Joe like me who can't afford to fly business but for a few hundred extra dollars enjoy something better than economy. Outbound flight VS42 on the A340-600 I found this plane to have a somewhat cramped feel to it. Drinks after take-off were a disappointment. Cabin crew pour drink for you which was just enough to get your tongue wet ! Dinner was good which was followed up with liqueurs. Nice hot full English breakfast before landing. The dedicated check-in and pre-flight champagne are added bonuses. Return flight in economy was a nightmare. The economy seat in the A340-600 is very cramped and almost has a claustrophobic feel to it ! Very little room to move and it even appears the seat-belt length has been shortened making it almost impossible to shift around. Meal was ok and overall attention given by cabin-crew on both legs was good. IFE is out-dated and needs to be upgraded.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,Travelled LHR-JFK return a few days ago. First the pros: I booked the flight over 6 months ago while the seats were on sale - the price was similar to BA but I had flown with them a few years ago on a similar route and I wanted to see if VA were any better! The outbound and return flight was on a A340 which meant I could have the pair seats which I think is more comfortable on a long haul flight. There was a decent selection of movies etc to watch on a 6/7 hr flight. Both flights left pretty much on time and our return flight arrived into Heathrow nearly half an hour early which was good. For me the most outstanding factor was the level of customer service of all the VA staff we encountered - they were all polite professional and welcoming. The cons: not many really! The food was not that great - my coconut curry tasted nothing like a coconut curry! The seats were a little uncomfortable for my husband - I'm quite a small build and I thought they were ok as far as economy seats go but the hubs mentioned that he found them really uncomfortable and he is not overly large or tall! The only other negative is that VA charge customers to pick specific seats - we were lucky and booked the tickets before this charge came into effect but potentially this additional cost would effect whether I book to fly with them again. Overall I really enjoyed flying with VA and would definitely consider using them again.,nan,4.0,nan

The food on board was plentiful and tasty and nice touches like the ice lolly and cloth to freshen up were appreciated. Lots of movies to choose from made the long flights much more bearable and entertaining. The leg room was adequate even for 4 of our party who range from 6ft 2 to 6ft 5, if no one reclines the seat in front, however if this happens it becomes a very uncomfortable long flight, which unfortunately happened to my son who is 6ft 4 but these are the chances you take if not paying for extra leg space.

Upgrades were available, but not for miles but for a payment of £1500 each. Apart from this the ground service was fine. The aircraft was a Dreamliner delivered the previous day. Very smooth flight, we were told that the flexible wings smooth out almost all but the worst turbulence. What excuse will the crew now use to get a break? Food was a choice of Shepherds Pie, Curry or vegetarian. The Shepherds Pie was tasty but was tiny, a very thin layer of minced lamb covered by a very thin layer of potato. The blackberry sponge had sunk at one side and was cold and clammy. Seats were the biggest problem. Yes they are wider than economy and have 38"" pitch, but the one in front still reclines into your face and if that person reclines fully then your entertainment screen does not hinge enough to allow you to watch it without you also reclining your seat. Some airlines now have seats were your seat base slides forward so you recline within you own space. They even supply small packets of mints giving you tips on how to ""surreptitiously"" recline your seat without making it too obvious. Crew were fine as were the drinks, and a very nice red wine with dinner.

I asked for a bulkhead to which they replied that they save those for the disabled or those with children (I was flying with my 23 month old). I laughed it off and decided I would ask the gate when it was time to board. At the gate I asked but once again got the same response. Boarding went well. When the plane was fully boarded, I realized both sides of the bulkhead were completely empty, so I begged the male flight attendant to allow me to switch seats. He greatly suggested I head straight towards the bulkhead I wanted and was confused to why they didn't give me it in the first place. Seats were comfortable, had a seat next to me, so we took advantage of that as well, arm rests do not go up, but I was prepared for this. Enjoyed the pre-flight bubbly and my daughter loved her juice. 30 minutes after take off we received our menu, as well as drink service, also given our amenity pack. My daughter got the kids meal as requested, and she got her meal first. Food was surprisingly very good. They collected our food trays and offered us our coffee, tea or after dinner drink. They put up a seat on the bulkhead for my daughter promptly, it was nice, with a 5 point harness and comfy. We had our own restrooms, and the traffic to bathroom wasn't bad at all.

Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

They now charge for seat assignment. After paying full fare or cashing in rewards miles, Virgin Atlantic now demands payment an additional fee to secure a seat assignment. They claim passengers may select their own seats within 24 hours of the flight, but unless you are near a computer and a Virgin member - and even if you are, who knows if you can actually access the flight info - you are out of luck. Most economy flying passengers ignore such highway robbery ($40 per passenger), and simply take the calculated risk of allowing the airline to assign the seat for them. What is the result? Often, panic and pandemonium onboard and  resentment. Does Virgin Atlantic really need to charge an extra $40 per passenger for what was until just a moment ago a simple, almost effortless, and empowering part of air travel? But now, most passengers wind up sitting where, as boarding staff claim, ""the only seat left"" is. What happens next is already busy flight attendants being asked to scramble and beg passengers to switch seats before and after take-off to accommodate the panicked child who wants to sit with its parent, newlyweds who aren't quite ready to end the honeymoon, and people like me, who on any other airline would have no problem securing my beloved window seat.

The flight to Orlando from Manchester, was on time and landed an hour early. Whilst you can't complain about being early, it meant we had to wait in Orlando airport for an hour for our lift. Plenty of leg room, food, drink and entertainment. The staff were happy to help and professional. The return flight to Manchester from Orlando was quite frankly a sham. The staff were rude and condescending, and the entertainment system in all three of our seat backs was faulty. They had run out of what seemed to be the only appetising meal by the time they got to our seat (only half way into the food service). We were told that we must understand they can't stock lots of type of meal, there is not room on the plane. The cabin staff condescending tone was unappreciated, we know they cant predict what people will want, but perhaps if the other two meals sounded remotely edible, they wouldn't have found themselves in this predicament. This is not the first time the return flight with Virgin Atlantic has been awful. The exact same issues happened on my miserable flight back from Vancouver the previous year. Shown here is an image of the inedible food I received, the drinks service is great. On both flights we were told by cabin crew there was wifi. There was in fact no wifi, and my flight two days later to Barcelona with a budget airline had brilliant connectivity. If Virgin Atlantic wants to charge the scandalous prices it does, it needs to provide scandalously good service. It just doesn't make the grade recently, whereas I used to sing the airline's praises.

Then, Virgin Atlantic kept changing the arrival times on one leg of our itinerary, to the point where it significantly impacted our itinerary. We decided to cancel the itinerary, which was booked through CheapoAir, for a full refund. The refund took 5 weeks to obtain. We booked a new itinerary using the same route, this time directly through Virgin Atlantic, and were happy with the legs and times, and picked great seats for all flights. 3 weeks ago, Virgin Atlantic cancelled the first leg of our booking, and stuck us on a much earlier flight. This would have necessitated both of us taking an additional day off from work, which neither of us had, so we would have taken the additional time off unpaid. A call to Virgin Atlantic gave us 3 options: 1) keep the revised itinerary, 2) change to an itinerary that would have added another leg to the outbound trip and additional travel time or 3) cancel for a full refund. We opted to cancel the itinerary again, and re-booked the trip for a third time, through a different airline. We have been waiting over 2 weeks for the second refund. I have called Virgin Atlantic 3 times, and been told different things each time. Now, I am told it could take 4-6 weeks for a refund.

One problem that needs to be addressed is passengers using extra space in front of row 49 as their right of way from one side of aircraft to the other. Two cabin announcements were made on the outbound flight. On the return flight, I was sat in row 51 and witnessed a passenger in row 49 asking cabin crew to make an announcement, which they did (not very forcibly), then two male passengers having an argument. I agree that if you have paid for extra legroom in that row, it is annoying to have people trampling over your feet. Noticed that one of the male cabin crew discreetly noted the seat number of person who caused the problem. Why when also sitting in an extra legroom seat, did he think it didn't apply to him.

The queues to board the flight for these overcrowded flights are badly managed by staff, customers pushing and shoving each other to board. Unlike some airlines (Singapore airlines in particular) if you go over over your baggage allowance (luckily I didn't) for one case and another family member is under, Virgin Atlantic don't offset the weight. Instead they make you go to one side, undo your packing in a bid to balance the weight between cases. Then you are left to the back of the queue to repeat the case check in process. We didn't take up the offer to secure seats together for my family and I by paying an additional fee, considering the cost of the flight in the first place - I thought it cheeky they even ask. As you can imagine, coming within the first few hours within the 48 hour period prior to departing Manchester for Orlando International, there were only the odd individual seats and exit row available to sit, in leaving me to wonder if I would get to sit with my child on board.

A childish safety cartoon style video which borders on the offensive to people who's first language is not English.

IFE screen prone to freezing and the world map, BA's is far better. Seating was possibly the most uncomfortable I have experienced on a 10hr flight. I know Virgins Boeing 747's are ageing, but really this is the Virgin experience? The crew on the inbound evening flight insisted that all window blinds were closed during the inflight meal as the sun would be up soon (no!), the sun rose 5 hours later. Seems they wanted us all to sleep so that they could put their feet up and do nothing. Overall, a rather disappointing experience.

The middle row of seats had no facility for overhead luggage storage. Apparently the lockers had been removed to provide a feeling of space. Well it did not work. The seat felt a bit more cramped than the window ones plus one has to think where to put the hand luggage. The level of individual service was much reduced.

To be honest though, if I pay for Upper I want to enjoy all the extras that come with it, not sleep through it. Economy class is fine but in future I'll be doing Premium if possible.

It was strange for it to have been excluded from the dinner menu while tea was available. The white wine was warm enough to wash your pots in. I have two complaints: My husband who was seated by the window needed two blankets throughout to shield him from the cold draft that he could not avoid. 8 hours is a long time to sit with cold air blowing on you. Cabin staff seemed aware of the problem - possibly air con. The other complaint relates to the breakfast that we were served. We have travelled on many airlines around the World over many years, eaten in some very basic restaurant/cafes and this ""Meal"" would score the Michelin 5* Award for Inedible, Unpalatable, Sugary Mush. Virgin should be deeply embarrassed and ashamed (strangely I would not be surprised that they may not be) about this slosh calling itself breakfast they served before landing. First course Blueberry yoghurt - extremely sweet and only slightly blue (probably not enough artificial colouring) and Packet of sugar encased Granola (presumably the healthy option) to go in it. In case you didn't want the sugar-blueberry yoghurt you could still get your sugar fix from the Call-Me-Healthy Granola Second Course - in case you need more carbs and a sugar flavoured Blueberry muffin. An almost indescribable danish pastry was a soggy envelope of pastry, filled with a thickish, slimy, sugar flavoured paste.  Tea and Coffee available this time. Tasted like tea and coffee onboard an airplane. I cannot imagine how any self-respecting Airline Catering / Food and Beverage Director could oversee / authorise this food offering and expect to keep their job. And the US supplier should be dropped. If vegetarian options or special meals for those with allergies were required they would be provided.

There was a stopover in Hong Kong where passengers were herded off the plane herded through a security check through passport control and onto the plane where we proceeded to sit on the runway for 3 hours. Plane was late into London and we missed our connection. Virgin issued us new tickets which we took to BA only to discover that we had been issued with tickets but the flight had not been booked and the best that they could offer was 3 separate seats. Arrived at our destination 5 hours late. On the return journey to Australia I was informed in London that my 5 year old granddaughter could not be booked on the flight from Sydney to Brisbane and was to ask at the desk in Hong Kong. In HK a surly staff member informed me he couldn't book her on either on returning to the security check I was informed that my tickets were on the wrong date. Back to the long queue. Armed with the right ticket we reached the plane and arrived in Sydney on time. Our flight to Brisbane had been cancelled - a 6 hour delay.

Our flight out was fine (day flight) with all of the staff very attentive and efficient. Refreshments were plentiful and the food ok. The new Premium Economy seats were just about acceptable given the quite short leg room. Boarding excellent. Return journey (night flight) was very disappointing with quite a late dinner leaving about 2+ hours for some sleep before time for their so called breakfast. This night flight seemed understaffed or were very inefficient but the most disappointing aspect was how uncomfortable the seating was when the person in front put their seats back into the fully reclining position. Being only just over 6 feet tall the seat pressed on my knees for most of the time making any sleep impossible. Also very difficult to get up to stretch or visit the washroom. The food was substandard and poorly presented.

Staff keep you well fed and hydrated even in economy. Obviously it's still airplane food. However the entrees were hot the salads were cold and everything they gave us was filling and edible. Seats are a mixed bag. On the way to London (on board an A340-600) I had a bulkhead seat. The extra legroom was nice but the seat was extremely narrow because it had the tray table and TV in the armrest. In addition to that the seatbelt (for some inexplicable reason) was extremely thick and padded. Between the thick armrests and the thick seatbelt I easily lost 3 inches of seat width. Spent the whole flight with my knees jammed together it was miserable. However on the flight back I was on a 747-400. I sat in the back of the plane where there are fewer seats per row giving more room overall. On top of that my seat had extra legroom for some reason (I'm not exactly sure why...) - I just know that it was one of the first flights I've ever been on that my knees weren't touching the seat in front of me. Entertainment was very good. The only problem I had was that on the flight out (in the bulkhead seat) the TV was stowed on the floor and the extended up in front of me. The screen had been repeatedly kicked and flickered in and out and the remote stopped working halfway through the flight. In the end I highly recommend Virgin. My recommendation is that if you choose to fly Virgin avoid the bulkhead seats. The extra legroom is not worth it.,nan,4.0,nan

All staff were extremely attentive courteous and friendly throughout. The food and drinks service was far above what I had been expecting and there was a great selection with a drinks service regularly. Seat was comfortable and inflight entertainment was great. A flight pack with little items such as a tooth brush socks etc was included too. Due to a delay out of Shanghai I knew I was going to miss my next connection from London. When I asked a member of the cabin crew about this she was very helpful even after leaving the aircraft when I was dealing with ground staff she came over to make sure everything was okay.

In the a/c eventually we were then told that at LHR strollers are only delivered at the baggage belt and never at aircraft. Well our stroller is still missing. Shortly after take-off we asked for a baby bassinet. It was only then that cabin crew advised us that our daughter is 1kg over the 9kg bassinet-limit so we won't be able to use it. Meal quality is what it is for Economy Class - nothing wrong about that. Surprised to see that cabin crew would not go around to distribute water or sodas during the night. Astonished by the general behaviour of most of the cabin crew: mainly impudent sloppy and almost rude. To summarise it was a pretty lousy experience and a big disappointment for me as I always thought very highly of VS and their product strategies. Instead of service trained cabin crew we had the impression to be taken care of by a crew of teenage girls in uniforms.

Virgin call it 'Business' then instead of this upgraded economy and save us all time. I am convinced Virgin changed my seats on purpose so as to push us to the upgrade. The upgrade was ridiculously expensive and not worth it. Food and beverage very mediocre entertainment hand-set didn't work (the passengers behind had to change seat as theirs didn't work at all). Sorry Virgin first time traveller and you've lost me.,nan,2.0,nan

A month later I get an email from Virgin saying the flights had been cancelled and they could now not fly us out until the 3rd September. I phoned their customer services department and was told there was nothing they could do. After 30 minutes they eventually agreed to upgrade us to premium economy for the flights on 3rd which I accepted. On 3rd Sep we arrived at the airport and on check-in I mentioned the upgrade. Told only one of us could have the upgrade. There was no way my partner and I wanted to be separated for a 10 hour flight. He said there was nothing he could do there was only room for 1 of us so we were stuck in economy. The flight crew supervisor came over and explained she knew what had happened and was very apologetic. She said there was not room for both of us in premium economy but that her and the cabin crew would give us the premium service where we were sat to try and make the flight better. I have to say the staff were brilliant. They could not do enough. They brought my partner and I champagne before we even took off. They then continued to top our glasses up with champagne for the entire flight. We were given our first choice of meals and our meals first and when we landed the flight crew have us another bottle of champagne to take with us. Fantastic service and flight from that crew. I then telephoned customer services to complain and I was told they will now give us the upgrade on the way home which when we got to the airport they again said there was no room for us in premium economy and we weren't upgraded as agreed.

Economy all the way but tried an upgrade to Premium Economy on one return leg which they offered at a low price. Very mediocre entertainment system with limited selections movies on loops instead of on demand and surprisingly not many music choices- all with lots of rebooting and starting over. Way below Emirates and even other carriers. Food was small portions and poor which supported my policy to eat as little on planes as possible. Breakfast was like US Air very minimal. Tight seating in general last leg was far in the rear of Airbus with seat so narrow I was in hip pain for a week after. Premium Economy was very good in terms of seats same and entertainment.

The flight outwards (June) was a little delayed because the Captain was stuck on the M25 in a traffic jam but we arrived in LAX only a few minutes late. The flight back (September) left on time and arrived early. Both planes were reasonably new and the entertainment systems worked once they had been rebooted. Check-in staff were helpful and took our ""just over the weight limit bags"" without comment. Food on both legs was very poor and having suffered their dreadful versions of vegetarian food when we went to India I had taken the precaution of buying my own main course at M&S (LHR) or at a deli (LAX) - this proved to be a wise choice and I was the envy of my row. On the return flight pre-meal drinks arrived after we had eaten which seemed a bit strange. Breakfast offerings in economy were a complete joke and not worth accepting. The cabin crew worked reasonably hard but I did get a little tired of cabin announcements. They did give everyone the impression that the trip was a holiday for them and they were going to have a good time when they got to LAX (or LHR) and were very self congratulatory over the PA system on ""how hard they had worked to please us"". Maybe they think that if they say it often enough we will believe them.

The entertainment crashed 4 hours into the 13 hour leg and staff were completely unconcerned. They just stood around chatting. Due to no entertainment we were given a £20 voucher towards another trip only valid for UK bookings. Wish I'd read these reviews before booking.

I've flown LHR to SFO and back 3 times now with Virgin. This time round on VS019 outward on Sept 22 the flight itself was fine but our stewardess came across like she hated her job. Curt abrupt and a ""square peg in a round hole"" I thought. I don't remember being offered a selection menu before but it all became pointless when only the vegetarian option was left. When I politely declined she said loudly ""its pasta!"" To avoid any issue I took it and upon opening it I found that whilst it may have been pasta when placed in the oven two weeks ago the gloopy mess in front of me certainly didn't qualify for that description. The rest of the food was fine though. The return flight VS020 yesterday (Oct 9th) or 8th if you're counting departure time - was probably the best flight I've had on Virgin. The staff were all bright cheerful and made you feel that they really wanted you on board. The only stressful part was checking in at SFO where a problem with a passenger's documents held everyone up but the lady who dealt with us was so pleasant you could feel the tension easing. Another plus was arriving an hour earlier than scheduled. One thing I don't understand. Coming back we had the seats in front of the two we had going out so they were to all intents and purposes identical.

Staff were inattentive and we watched a single mum struggle to get her meal eaten with no help from the cabin staff at all. Other passengers had to assist her! The cleanliness of the cabin left a lot to be desired. On our return journey we upgraded to premium economy but were place right beside the toilets! The cabin staff allowed economy passengers as well as premium economy passengers to use them so there was a constant stream of noise all night long!

So the entertainment system wasn't on-demand but there was sufficient content to keep one occupied for the almost 10 hour flight. Food was perfectly adequate and we were fed a mid flight snack as well as lunch and tea. Couldn't really complain. Crew - very personable helpful and cheerful. I had no complaints.

Twilight check in is a real bonus as the following morning meant we just had to clear passport control/security. The outbound flight was good and although at the back of the aircraft except for a bit of a whiff from the toilets there was more that enough room and were able to get up and chat to others in party without disturbing anyone. The upgraded 747's at LGW are superb and the seatback entertainment is amazing it kept 4 kids quiet the whole way there :) The meals aren't great but it breaks up the flight. On the return 4 of the party upgraded to Premium Economy which they were really impressed with some nice touches as well such as co italics and toiletry set.

Although the onboard staff was great the food very decent and flights smooth my seat was not comfortable at all. Not only I didn't have enough legroom (when compared with the much shorter BA flights I took internally in Europe) but on top of that the magazine compartment in front of me (made of a rigid metal frame covered in fabric) had a really bad design which made it hang loose in front of my knees so I spent my flight fighting with it trying to stretch my legs somehow. Additionally the in-flight entertainment had a nice variety of shows and movies which unfortunately couldn't really be enjoyed because the image and sound kept freezing every few seconds (I noticed this was pretty much everyone's problem) even after it had been reset by an attendant.

This is a clever concept by Virgin it is marketed as business its not but the next step up is hugely more expensive. So you are getting a little more than economy but paying nearly business class fares. If you were unlucky as I was and get seats near the barrier they do not give you the legroom as the other premium economy seats do so you lose out just that little bit more. The food and seat comfort were ok but nothing special the entertainment was adequate. What really prompts me to write this review is the service. A passenger who having made a perfectly polite request for a diet coke who has to make it again after ten minutes because it still has not arrived should get attitude form the cabin staff. I don't expect sulking and glaring and flouncing off from professional air crew! Worse on the return flight five days later one of the male members of aircrew who clearly loved his own voice far too much was never off the public address system. It seemed to be used as a platform for his self promotion and to show off to passengers who just want to be left alone.

I found the customer service staff on the phone very helpful when looking to book my flight. I originally only upgraded on the return flight due to the number of miles I had. When I enquired as to the cost of upgrading on the outward flight he did try to sell me a one way upgrade for 1400 GBP. He made no mention of purchasing additional flying club miles. The only negative I found with the customer services. On arrival at the airport I enquired again about purchasing an upgrade. This time the very helpful check in assistant did mention it. I then purchased an additional 10000 flying club miles for 165GBP and upgraded to upper class. The clubhouse was fantastic. As soon as I had finished my drink I was asked if I would like another. Staff taking my food order were very friendly helpful and attentive. Upon boarding the cabin crew were very welcoming and provided me with a glass of champagne straight away. They were very helpful and friendly. There were numerous cabin crew members that I encountered they even knew my name and regularly referred to me as Mr (surname). On returning to my seat I made a request to a cabin crew member and asked for a plaster without even asking my seat number etc she provided a selection of plasters for me to keep finding me at my seat without any issues. The food on board was better quality than I have received at many restaurants. I only have two areas for improvement and these to some extent are out of the control of VA. 1) The age of the entertainment system. I flew on an airbus A340-600 and the entertainment system resembled something out of the 1980's. A controller on a wire with a very ancient appearance. The films and programmes however were up to date. 2) The lack of a power point for charging a device. I had read up prior to my flight and found the website to say that there were power pints for charging. This was not the case on the aircraft. Nothing the crew could have done about either of these. I have the return flight tomorrow (5/11/13). Hope it's just as good. I had pre booked by seat upstairs on the 747 in the sleep zone. Bit disappointed that the aircraft has had a last minute change to an A340-600. Hopefully it will be just as good and quiet.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,Flew LHR-JFK return mid October with Virgin premium economy. I've used Virgin a bit over the last few years in Upper but this was my first experience of the premium economy cabin. As a bit of a caveat absolutely love some of the upper class gripes ultimately this is a unique product with the herringbone seating for heavens sake do your research before flying guys if you like regular business seating use someone else! Outbound on slightly tired 747 (Tinkerbell) cabin crew however very good food good and entertainment also had a decent amount of choices even if the screens themselves were slightly behind the times. Return flight delayed almost 2 hours after having arrived at the airport early anyway this wasn't ideal. Spoke to Virgin ground staff who immediately moved me to the earlier flight without charge - fantastic service. Return was on an a340-600 (Miss Behavin') and although I have my reservations this felt a slightly enhanced overall product with a better partition between premium and regular economy including separate toilets. Food and entertainment much the same again which was good. Didn't fancy the cooked breakfast option before landing so they brought a yoghurt fruit and warmed pastry item all of which were perfect. Overall for what was a 7hr outbound and 6hr return flight premium economy felt adequate. Seats wide and comfortable with a decent amount of recline. In my opinion not worth the large % increase to upper on this route unless of course using air miles to bridge the gap. Will be travelling the same route in a couple of months and will be glad to use Virgin Atlantic again.,nan,5.0,nan

I have used Virgin before and been fairly happy so made a deliberate choice to do so again. I thought Premium Economy would be a better experience but how wrong I was. The seat was quite comfortable but the man in front chose to recline his seat throughout the flight. This gave me very little space and meant that the magazine holder was bumping into my legs. Also the holder was too narrow to hold much. The food was really awful. On the outward flight the starter was smoked mackerel. I took a bite and had a mouthful of bones. The chicken dish was ok but very small. Dessert chocolate gateau was nice . Entertainment was a waste of time: The only thing that worked properly was the route we were taking so I looked at that for 11 hours. Sky News would have been good but that didn't work either. I remembered Virgin cabin crew being really friendly and helpful but both outward and inward flights they were offhand and disinterested and made me feel passengers were bit of a nuisance to be dealt with as quickly as possible. This was the worst part of the flight for me. Just one more little thing: The courtesy bag of goodies I remember as being useful but it was in a peculiar grey cloth bag and contained a pen toothbrush and a small white stick labelled ""toothpaste"".

This caused hasty re arranged travel plans and extra expense. I couldn't check in online because it was code share and was given probably the worst seats on the plane despite arriving at check in before it opened on both flights.

Once you get into your seat there is very little room on either side of the seat. There is no privacy either with a clear partition separating the seats. In my opinion it was an economy-sized seat.

Also the cabin guy on this flight sat himself in the aisle to chat to his friend which was very unprofessional and annoying.

Asked twice for a new battery and waited 50 minutes for the battery (after 20 minutes I was told that they would come back after they had done duty free - so selling additional products to passengers obviously takes priority over the comfort of customers who are experiencing poor service). The selection of DVD's was no more than 10 movies which for a 9+ hour daytime flight is very limiting. After asking twice again for more DVD's and waiting 35 minutes I (again) had to walk to the back of the plane and ask for them.

The cabin was only half full but the service could not be faulted. Main meal was OK afternoon tea was very poor indeed (2 finger sandwiches and a muffin of dubious provenance). On this leg we had a stand-out flight attendant really professional. On return again check in was fast security relatively painless (for the USA) and we boarded on time and landed early. This time the cabin was packed full. Given it is a short red eye overnight flight speed of service is key and Virgin did let us down here. They took about 2 hours to serve dinner and clear away. Both Economy and Club had been fed and bedded down before Premium. However dinner was good and a full cooked breakfast was served prior to landing. On both legs wine and spirits were freely available. We landed early immigration at LHR was quite speedy and we were on our way within 45 minutes of landing. The new A330s are great with a wide range of inflight entertainment. One of the things I like about Virgin is they include films that no other airlines would show (in this case 'Filth').

In the past you would be given a small bottle of wine - now you are given three quarters of a plastic cup full. We were then given an ice lolly after a few hours followed by a small sausage roll.

The seats which I believe are the newly fitted purple design were comfortable and the extra space in between really makes a difference until the person in front reclines - these seats recline rather a lot and to the point that not even the seatback TV can twist enough to be viewed correctly on the seat behind. Crew were pleasant enough they just don't appear to do much one full drink service offered on a 8.5 hour flight. All other drink services consisted of water or juice only although I did get another alcoholic drink when asked. Duty free consisted of a crew member whizzing past with a magazine in her hand actually had to call her over to get her attention to buy something and when the crew looking after our section decided to pass through the cabin with a trolley they were overheard bitching about having to do twice the work as the previous crew member wasn't doing her job properly - very unprofessional. The meal service really lets Virgin down - worst plane food ever! Despite being offered a menu card stating 3 options (chicken beef fish) we were later told the chicken option hadn't been loaded so we had the option of (fish beef fish) the starter was also fish no other option. It was also noted the children in this section had received the same meals as the adults so I am guessing there was a lot of waste that day incidentally the food on the return once again had a fish starter and really was the worst of the worst airline meal! This airlines only saving grace is the entertainment which whilst not as much choice as previous trips there was something for everyone and it was nice to catch up on corrie during the flight home.

The flight took off on time so no complaint there. To be honest I was dreading the flight because of the kids that might be on it. The kids were no problem whatsoever even the young one sat behind me was great. My problems were as follows - Virgin make a big deal of presenting you with a food menu from which you can take you're pick - that is until they reach you and you have no choice but to have what they have left. The meal itself was a disgrace it was dry and tasteless - worse than an overdone microwave meal the drinks service was atrocious they even completely missed us out on their much vaunted hot chocolate service. The touchscreen television was fine if you wanted to watch a film (good choices) however if you wanted to play a game the touchscreen was slow unresponsive to touch and really awful to use. This brings me on to the cabin crew - I found the cabin crew very abrupt and flippant. Basically it was a case we are here to cater for 1st and premium class passengers and if you don't like it tough.

On paper the seat pitch is the same as Singapore Airlines at 32 inches but this does not translate into real space. Sitting normally my knees touched the seat in front and when the person in front reclined the tray table was rendered virtually unusable the TV screen could not be seen properly and my shins were cramped against the seat underside. Getting out of the seat from this position was an undignified affair almost falling into the aisle.

The ""seasonal"" salad was 80% lettuce with a slice of cucumber and a tomato. Portions were very small and we then had to endure an 8 hour gap between meals with virtually nothing. Good economy class travel is about doing many small things well Virgin currently do nothing well and should send staff on a flight with Singapore Emirates or Etihad to see how it can be done.

The flight over was fine. Nothing special. Mediocre food for business. And really poor lighting (I use the time to work). The seats lie flat and the curve gives some extra room so you can lay on your side. On the return flight however my seat was broken; it wouldn't return to an upright position and was very uncomfortable (the break meant there was a large lump in the back). Worst of all Virgin knew it was broken and hadn't fixed it. To solve the problem they asked another passenger to trade seats with me demanding that that person moved because they were in a lower fare class than I was. I simply refused to do that to the other passenger. And it was outrageous that the attendants suggested that that was alright. I'll never fly Virgin again. If you pay that much they should have seats you can actually sit in. I'd only take them as a last resort. Even then it might be worth staying home.

The cabin was only half full but the service could not be faulted. Main meal was OK afternoon tea was very poor indeed (2 finger sandwiches and a muffin of dubious provenance). On this leg we had a stand-out flight attendant really professional. On return again check in was fast security relatively painless (for the USA) and we boarded on time and landed early. This time the cabin was packed full. Given it is a short red eye overnight flight speed of service is key and Virgin did let us down here. They took about 2 hours to serve dinner and clear away. Both Economy and Club had been fed and bedded down before Premium. However dinner was good and a full cooked breakfast was served prior to landing. On both legs wine and spirits were freely available. We landed early immigration at LHR was quite speedy and we were on our way within 45 minutes of landing. The new A330s are great with a wide range of inflight entertainment. One of the things I like about Virgin is they include films that no other airlines would show (in this case 'Filth'). If you don't like that kind of thing then you don't have to watch it but it's nice to have the choice and be treated like an adult!,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,We always fly Virgin Atlantic long haul (last flights were May 2013 and next flights are April 2014) usually LGW to MCO and either Premium Economy or Economy with extra legroom and every time every single time we have had superb flights with wonderful staff. I cant say we have never been delayed or the flight wasn't bumpy at all but that's air travel and on the whole we have been on time having had a smooth and comfortable flight. The Virgin Atlantic cabin crew are always helpful nothing is too much trouble. For on board food and entertainment you always have a good choice and the seats are comfortable enough for 9 hours or so but anyone gets fidgety after a while and LAX is a bit of a drag the last few hours but again that's air travel!

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,LGW-UVF-LGW. Both flights serviced by Virgin's brand new A330s. Boarding for both flights was well handled by gate staff in both LGW and UVF and both flights departed and arrived on time with very little turbulence en route. Contrary to many comments I was very impressed with Virgin's new long haul economy seating as it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom. In addition I even managed to sleep for 6 of the 8 hours on the inbound flight to LGW which was great as I usually never manage to sleep on long haul flights. Amenity kits were also given out on the UVF-LGW night flight which was a nice touch. I especially liked the new IFE system offered on the new A330s as it is touch screen operated and is also very simple and quick to navigate with a good variety of films and music to choose from. Throughout both flights the cabin crew were friendly and were eager to go out of their way for you. Furthermore call bells were answered promptly and the service felt more personal than on previous airlines that I have flown with. However the only thing that is letting Virgin down is the quality of their catering. On both flights the food portions were far too small for long 8-9 hour sectors so I'd suggest bringing extra food with you if possible. In addition there was very little to choose from on both flights unlike other four star airlines such as BA and the snack service offered on board was very limited. All in all our first experience with Virgin Atlantic was by no means disappointing and we would certainly consider flying with them again. The new A330 is an excellent aircraft to fly on as it offers Virgin's latest long haul product and is also extremely quiet compared to similar long haul aircraft.,nan,4.0,nan

These last 5 years I managed to join the top tier of UNIQ status which does give a more personalised service. However I have taken all I can with this new Upper Class Dream Suite offering on their A330 aircraft. The seat is much narrower than the suites on the B747 and A340-3/6 aircraft the cabin feels congested the isles are not wide enough which means crew and fellow PAX hit your feet on the ottoman when moving around. The bar area seats 3 + maybe 3 standing and although visually appealing in practice is used by the crew to complete admin or serve food from. The food is OK but lacks consistency. The VERA on-demand entertainment system is very good and seems more stable than the older versions. The amenity kit for a business class product is embarrassing and should be removed or upgraded. The LHR clubhouse is always a great place to start a journey with great food and drink offerings. The inflight crew on this flight were great with a proactive FSM who kept things going like clockwork. The flight was a very quick 5 hours and 45 mins I didn't bother turning my seat into a bed as it's not as comfortable as the UCS in the tried and tested and loved older configuration.

Good choices of drinks hot or cold good WiFi connection plenty of comfy soft seats and any additional food/drinks were plentiful and served with a smile. Boarding and Cabin: Somehow we ended up half way back down the boarding queue mixed in with economy and had to stand for quite some time whilst they boarded the aircraft. There should be a separate area to board us like Emirates have! Once on board things for the most part improved we had 2 attendants looking after the upper class section throughout the flight they were all friendly and attentive without being intrusive. One negative though I was asked twice if I would be prepared to change my choice of main meal! At these prices I should not be made to feel in any way guilty for having what I asked for! Virgin needs to address this issue as we were taking off from our home base they should carry enough choices on board! Enjoyed 3 movies on the way and always had plenty to drink.

I was served cheesecake with nothing to eat it with no spoon or fork.

PE cabin is inviting and similar to BA's equivalent. PE cabin crew were very good both ways being efficient friendly and personal.

For the so called 'premium' meal service we were given after the meal empty paper cups and then had to wait another 10 minutes for a hot drink. It honestly felt like I was in a train buffet car - not even a plastic cup. Breakfast service was disgusting a meal given to you with no drink whatsoever no water no orange juice nothing and again the paper cups came out after 15 minutes - BA WT+ offers fruit muffin orange juice a hot drink and a hot meal for it's breakfast service - honestly never been disappointed before but won't be wasting my money with VA again.

I recently travelled business class from Tokyo to London on BA and Shanghai to London on Cathay. I have to say that both airlines were miles ahead of Virgin in all aspects. It is a real shame.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,"An underwhelming experience flying LHR to Cape Town with Virgin. Virgin sells itself as something special. It isn't - at least not in Economy. Flight out was poor in two ways. Firstly the menu choice given out was ""unavailable"" so there was only one option which was not on the menu card at all (tough luck if you didn't want chicken). The food was probably the worst airline food I have had - a real case of cost cutting. On the return journey I ate prior to leaving and rejected the in-flight meal. Secondly the VERA inflight entertainment system was something out of the ark. All films were on a fixed time loop (so you had to wait for all films to finish before they started again). Miss this ""start"" and you missed your film. Virgin as a ""premium service"" carrier should be ashamed for still operating this type of system rather than the ""on demand"" system found everywhere else. On the return journey it was better as the system was ""on demand"". In addition to this the seat pitch and recline was very poor and something as basic as the ear plugs were of a low quality. I found my own (cheap) ear plugs were twice as efficient as those issued by Virgin. The cabin staff were OK. Not good not bad. Overall very disappointing as the reality falls far short of the image Virgin likes to portray. I would definitely not put Virgin as my first choice next time I fly long haul.",nan,1.0,nan

The amenities kit is a joke - when you compare Elemis and Bulgari toiletries with other airlines a plastic toothbrush and paste does not cut it these days. The socks are now made of cheap nylon and not worth the effort. We travelled LHR to LAX return and the service you provide is not up to standard. As many people have commented staff appear to be doing us a favour in the service department and are only interested in turning the lights off as quickly as possible and getting every one to sleep which is nigh on impossible with your beds. I am 5ft 2 and still had my feet constantly knocked by the crew walking up and down. Beds are cramped and not private enough. Compare these with BA Business Class - not even in the same ball park.

nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,1.0,nan,5.0,no,nan,3.0,Travelled to St Lucia in January premium economy out and upper class return. Online check in was very easy but twilight bag drop at Gatwick not possible on arrival at 4.30pm and we had to queue for 1 hour to check our bags in probably because they have reduced the twilight check in time from 2pm to 5pm and only 2 staff were on duty. The new 330 wide bodied aircraft is much more cramped in premium economy than the 747 when travelling in the bubble which was a joy. The aisles are narrow causing more disturbance to passengers and some people are allocated seats in 3s with the loss of privacy for couples. However the lighting and the entertainment were a big improvement and the food was good so overall the PE experience was acceptable. The return in upper class was poor value. Similarly cramped compared with the jumbo and it is no longer feasible to share a meal with your partner as the aisles are too narrow. There is some personal privacy at night and the beds were OK although you are quite near to the seats opposite the herringbone pattern works. Service disturbs sleepers due to the narrow aisles as stewards constantly knock into feet or the ends of beds. During the day it would be impossible to talk to you partner unless you got up as the screens do not fold down so you are very much in your own space which is probably good for business passengers. The upper class meal was truly dreadful. It was impossible to eat the steak so I exchanged it for chicken which was also dry and tough. The stewardess suggested the only decent meal was vegetarian and several people were sending their food back but by that time I had lost interest. Why do they serve lumps of meat which have to be re-heated? Food was much nicer in PE. Overall the service in upper class has deteriorated with reduced costs evident and we were very disappointed.,nan,2.0,nan

The lounge at Miami was grim but once on board we found our seats comfortable when both seated and reclined. We were in the front cabin of the lower deck of a 747 which is quite wide and so did not suffer the problem of our feet being constantly knocked. However I would not have wanted to be in another cabin or aircraft as we could clearly see why many others complain about this problem. The food we had was good as was the red wine and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive and made and unmade our beds immediately on request. The video on demand did not look exciting but as we wanted to sleep this was not a problem to us. The arrivals lounge food and facilities at Heathrow were excellent. The Little Red connection to Manchester was nothing special but our luggage did arrive quickly so we can have no complaints about our experience the Miami lounge apart.

In the past month I've flown both BA's World Traveler Plus (LHR-HKG A380) and Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy so here's the compare and contrast: Pre-seat selection. Free on VS at time of booking; had to pay £200 for the two of us r/t on BA. Airport check-in. VS has a dedicated Premium check-in counter at which there are rarely any queues. BA had no dedicated WTP check-in although T5 at LHR rarely has bad lines. Boarding. VS boards Upper Class Gold members and Premium Economy at the same time. There is a dedicated Premium check-in lane at the gate. BA boards First then Club and Gold members then families needing assistance then WTP. On board. VS offers you a glass of champagne when you sit down BA offered water or orange juice. The seats on VS are a purplish leather and distinctly cooler/better than Economy. On BA the cabin looks pretty much the same as economy just slightly wider seats. Food: on VS Premium gets a separate meal from Economy served in nice dishware. On BA the food was exactly the same as Economy: trays with dishes with foil you have to remove etc. Supposedly the main course may or may not come from Club but I couldn't have spotted it. Drinks service is same as Economy and no one ever comes round during the middle of the night on a 12 hour flight to offer water like they do on Asian carriers. IFE has many more recent release movies than BA. Seat comfort. Good on both BA and VS I find I can actually sleep in these Premium seats and I can't in Economy and that makes all the difference to me. Ambience. I have been flying BA for years and although I don't dislike the airline I now have a personal challenge to try to get a flight attendant any one anytime anywhere to smile at me. On Virgin the crew are simply more fun and engaging with passengers. Arrival. VS priority tags its Premium Econ. bags so they come off first BA does not. Overall the only clear advantage I could spot that BA has over Virgin in terms of Premium Economy service is they have noise-cancelling headphones which VS only has in Upper. On balance every other part of the experience is superior on VS and given a choice again if the price is even remotely similar I know which way I'm going.,nan,5.0,nan

We expected terminal 4 at JFK to have some breakfast facilities for the 07.30 flight but the choice was McDonald's or a coffee stand. Chaotic boarding but a friendly crew and an OK daylight flight to London apart from being very hungry. We were served a cereal bar a muffin and tea or coffee after take off and then a small hot meal (chicken tikka) 2hrs before we arrived into Heathrow. Many passengers asked for food mid-flight as the limited breakfast options at JFK together with a sugary snack after take off didn't really match up to Virgin's advertised ""dining"" experience. We accept that we travelled economy but I'd rate the catering service and quality on this flight as poor. Anyone taking the morning flight from New York should consider taking their own food as you won't get much on board. The entertainment worked well and the crew were friendly but the meal service was extremely disappointing and certainly doesn't match the website adverts.

Movie selection was bland and I was disappointed that most of what was offered was already shown the previous month.

When I arrived 15 minutes after baggage closure I begged the lady working to help me. She went above and beyond booking my baggage in quickly giving me directions and calling the airplane staff to let them know I was on my way. Despite another hold up in customs due to a family in front when I arrived at the gate the staff were friendly and relaxed helping me get in and get seated as quickly as possible all the time with a smile and a laugh. They got me water since I had been running joked with me about the traffic and then continued with what I assume is their standard outstanding service.

The 747 fleet had just been refurbished on this route and our travel agent had a great last-minute upgrade deal for us (outbound and return) - which doubled our luggage allowance to two suitcases apiece. Priority check-in was great and the staff were fantastic. As luck would have it the morning we were flying out my wife had had a tumble and a mobility vehicle was laid on to take us directly to the gate. The Premium economy cabin was intimate - around 20-25 seats only and we easily boarded and disembarked along with upper class. We were welcomed with champagne and shown to our seats.

Used their complimentary 'Twilight Check-in' the night before we flew - extremely convenient and an excellent way of avoiding the additional queue's. Here we parted with our luggage selected our seats and obtained our boarding passes all in 20-25 minutes. Flight out was a 747-400 old livery however the inside was refurbished. Onboard we were welcomed by a polite crew and directed to our seats. Inflight entertainment was simple with a variety of films televisions programmes and other useful aspects that made the flight enjoyable. Menu offered: Lasagne Coq au Vin and a vegetarian curry. I chose the Coq Au Vin and it was surprisingly tasty. Drinks services were regular desert was handed out shortly after main was removed and afternoon tea was well presented and very appetising. Landed on-time at Orlando International airport and cleared immigration within 10 minutes with a 15 minute wait for our bags to appear. Return journey home was on an older 747-400 beginning to show it's age in my opinion. Boarded to yet another smartly presented crew who directed everyone to their seats with a welcoming smile. When seated the entertainment system began after the safety demonstration and we pushed back on time. Meal service offered Beef and Vegetables Chicken Tikka and a vegetarian Pasta dish. Again relatively enjoyable. Drinks service was frequent and staff very attentive. I managed to sleep for around 4.5 hours and awoke to breakfast.

On departing cabin economy passengers were allowed to depart before premium this is only a problem because premium passengers pay a lot more for this privilege so apart from more seat width and extra luggage there is no difference any more between economy and premium.

nan,First Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,5.0,no,nan,1.0,A330 JFK-LHR Upper Class. Virgins new Dream Suite. Check in at JFK very smooth Lounge is excellent - probably the best at JFK - great service and excellent food - a very good start! Boarding on time and easy A330 with new configuration clean and quite striking at first the bar is groovy and the cabin also. Service was discreet and casual which I liked food just OK but the cooked breakfast was quite good - nice china and glassware - very good and attentive FA's. Excellent entertainment system. The seat: The Dream Suite is a nightmare an absolute disaster! A classic case of style over substance. The new seat is incredibly cramped I am 6ft and weigh 175lbs - I had to squeeze myself into this horrible seat! The are two positions - somewhat reclined and flat no leg-rest - nothing in between - this was a daytime flight I wanted to lie back and relax but not sleep - hugely uncomfortable. There is one very small flip out plastic arm rest on one side - nothing on the other - whoever heard of a business class seat without an armrest - ridiculous. There is zero storage space and Virgin has got rid of the overhead bins in the center of the plane - there were about 15 people in upper class - it seats 32 I think - we were fighting over bin space and I only bring one small hand bag - again ridiculous Virgin cannot imagine what it would be like if full. Frills are nice champagne glasses are nice but the reason people buy business/upper class seats is for space and comfort - these new suites offer neither - they have to be the very worst of the new generation flat bed seats. Premium economy seats are wider and have two armrests - how novel! One got the impression that the FA's are fully aware that this is an awful product. I have changed my return flight to the 747 with the old seats- never again!,nan,1.0,nan

Good meal service both ways and decent food portion sizes. A little stingy with the drink service. Older 747s showing signs of age and outdated IFE needs upgrading soon.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,"By far one of the worst flights I've had. Flew PVG-LHR on one of the A340-600 in 60K (G-VWEB). I'm 5"" 8' so not the largest person in the world and yet my knees were being poked the entire flight by the pocket from the seat in front of me. Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it. At least they came around at reasonable times with it and offered drinks fairly often during the flight. Also the lack of any form of power is annoying not even a USB port for plugging a phone/tablet into.",nan,2.0,nan

On the return we flew on the Airbus A330 and it was a completely different experience. I've never been so uncomfortable on a plane in my life. The seats were hard and the head rests had nothing to support your head when you wanted to sleep (unlike the 747). Even my 7 year old daughter who usually sleeps really well on flights didn't sleep at all. I've had more comfortable experiences on Thomas Cook and that's saying something! I feel like Virgin need to up their game as we've flown Emirates a few times and they are far more superior with much better aircraft like the A380.

What an experience. To sum the experience up when I'm flying Virgin again I am reserving upper deck immediately. From flying this route before the upper deck appeared to have more leg room which was an added bonus. You feel like your on your own private jet with limited number of persons upstairs. The staff have. Personal touch with you and cannot help you enough. Because of the shape of the aircraft you also have a side storage area under the window which was an added bonus with enough room for an infant to stand and play with his toys on the storage. On the flight back the infant had a touch of a cold and was sick whilst inflight. The staff without being asked was bringing water wet tissues refreshing tissues and bags to clean up even offered to find us a new seat whilst they cleaned the area.

FA's and service were excellent the food was very good - not something often heard here but it was great on this flight. I do hope that the airlines read these reviews and take note the seat is the all important thing to the client the old one works and the new one does not in it's current form - it looks cool but needs to be stretched out and given more shoulder space and armrest please!,nan,3.0,nan

Good service and very quick through Heathrow! Nice flight with great staff in Upper Class. Teenagers loved the films etc. Way back was a different story on 19.30 flight on Thurs 10th Apr. Still very good in the Clubhouse at Newark (advised us to order food early if we wanted a meal which we did as travelling overnight so wanted to eat early then sleep on plane). Staff on plane not as helpful as outbound. We arrived to find our overhead lockers full of other passengers' stuff - not much help from staff to get this sorted and our 5 lots of hand luggage stowed. Main complaint is that FA would not give me any breakfast despite filling in form night before and despite asking her to be woken up. Even though this was an hour before landing apparently 'Supervisor' had said no more food to be served. Supervisor then turned up with one croissant! I stupidly paid full price for that seat (as needed the flexibility for business) but felt completely let down by the service on that flight. Virgin - your staff are letting you down!

The last and only time I flew with them was about 10 years ago return flight to New York. Back then the return economy flight cost me £250 the flight had better entertainment and proper games with consoles was offered newspapers and the food and drink served was offered practically non-stop in fact I was given 2 main meals! Also very lucky on the return flight as it was practically empty we were given a glass of champagne! This time got 1 small main meal (and didn't eat the salad as it consisted of one small leaf and lots of dressing that tasted of dish water) afternoon tea consisted of 1 biscuit and tea or coffee steward gave me a look when I asked for 2 drinks and only good thing about the entertainment was the selection of films. I don't know why the stewards seemed stressed when the plane was half full! Also on return flight back staff at the airport had an attitude and didn't even welcome or say hello to me! They insisted I put items from my hand luggage into my suitcase as it was 1 kilo over! All this wonderful service cost me just under £800 for a return ticket! My friend flew with American airlines (via Miami) and basically got the same service and quality food and drinks I had from my original Virgin flight 10 years ago.

The Virgin experience was very disappointing by comparison. The plane was old and shabby (I saw one passenger trying to mend the tray compartment cover on his seat it having fallen off) and the toilet in Premium Economy was out of order. The seat was cramped especially when the seat in front was reclined making it no easier to get out of the seat than if it were in Economy class even though I am a small person. The flight attendants especially one were flustered unfriendly surly and unhelpful - when I pointed out that my headphones were not working I was made to feel as if I were being a nuisance by requesting a working set and there was certainly no apology. In over 40 years of flying this was my first time with Virgin and I shall not be repeating the experience. I especially resent the extra paid for Premium Economy on this journey.,nan,1.0,nan

Boarding not particularly organised but a fairly warm welcome on boarding. No magazines or newspapers available on boarding. Main meal was really poor - crew accidentally forgot to give us a menu our preferred food option was not available portion size was very small and the food was low quality. I would happily have paid extra for more/better quality food. I would strongly recommend eating before boarding (as we had). Reasonable drinks selection. Decent range of inflight entertainment but handheld control had one broken button which made it very difficult to select options. Overhead locker space limited due to failure to enforce baggage rules (very large trolley cases allowed on board). Amenity kit blanket and pillow all provided and all decent quality for an economy cabin. I managed to sleep for several hours. Overall the experience was passable as I had booked on a virgin miles discount offer - however I would have been disappointed (even for economy) if I had paid full price for this booking. I travel long haul several times a year and as others have commented; Virgin has a poor economy cabin compared to other transatlantic and other carriers.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Travelled Gatwick to Montego Bay on a 747. Very disappointed with the quality of the premium economy cabin. The plane was clearly passed its 'sell by' date. It looked tired and old with an entertainment system that was difficult to see. On the outward leg the magazine rack was broken and although an engineer tried to solve the problem it was not usable and flapped about throughout the flight. On the return journey the arm rest containing the table was broken and separated from the chair. The stewardess was unable to get help and in the end used sticky tape to hold the arm rest in place. She was going to take the arm rest away and replace with a towel but our comments about basic safety and the need to make it safe led to the makeshift solution. Then there is the food which is probably the worst I have had flying premium economy. Is this a case of an airline flying a route with little competition and therefore setting the lowest possible tolerable standard?

The cabin service was friendly and attentive and food was a step up from Economy. It was a nice touch having real cutlery china and your meal tray served on a tablecloth. The seats were wide but not as much space as I would have expected to the next seat in front. The old bugbear when the seat in front reclines fully is still a problem in Premium Economy it is very intrusive and you need the passenger next to you to climb out if you want to get past them. We got more sleep than previous flights in Economy but it is still a fairly uncomfortable experience. Virgin Atlantic needs to introduce noise-cancelling headphones as the sound quality is poor with the existing headphones but the entertainment selection was excellent. The cabin noise was quiet having only 38 passengers and a dedicated toilet was a good feature. This was our first experience in Premium Economy and while it was a step up from Economy I do not think it is worth the extra money.

Temperature control was cranked right up so it was a hot and sweaty snooze. On the return leg the FAs were friendlier but it seemed quite slow getting drinks served and there was no welcome drink on boarding. I managed a decent night's sleep but breakfast took a while and for once was really unpleasant; undercooked bacon overcooked egg sausage with negligible meat content and baked beans with the highest sugar content known to man. I've had better at motorway service stations! The decaf coffee was served in a mug (nice touch especially as the mug turned out to be made by someone I know) and was fantastic. Reasonable croissant but no hot towels offered. Cabin temperature was better this time. The planes seemed a little tired and the bathrooms were clean but nothing special.

The check-in at LHR Terminal 3 was a breeze - did not have to wait and was immediately checked in queue for Economy was considerable. Checked in the day before and chose my seat online. You cannot check in earlier than 24 hours prior to departure but when I still had not received an email from Virgin 20 hours prior decided to go online myself and check in. To my big surprise there was only a handful of seats available so if you wait until you get the check-in email you literally have no choice left. Bagged myself an aisle seat in 33G which was fine. Boarding you beat the massive queue and are able to board with Upper Class. Settled into wide leather seat and offered a glass of Prosecco. Very friendly and attentive cabin crew. The food was definitely a notch up from Economy and loved the personalized service: warm bread rolls stainless cutlery salt & pepper shaker. I went for the chicken accompanied by the Sauvignon Blanc. The only downside of my outbound flight was that the person in 32G decided to fully (!) recline 10 minutes after take-off which was a complete invasion of my privacy and took away 50% of my leg room. At 6'2"" I am by no means a giant but had to wrap my legs around the seat in front of me to be somewhat comfortable. The real downside is that when the person in front of you reclines it becomes really difficult to see the TV screen properly. I had to pretty much slouch in my seat to get a decent view and the screen does not tilt as far as you'd like it to. Ice-cream during the movie was a nice treat afternoon tea was ok but nothing spectacular. Service during the flight is attentive relaxed and non-pushy. Had to call flight attendant twice to order a drink but served with a smile. MIA-LHR evening flight Premium Economy was full. This time bagged myself an aisle seat 30K. Bit worried that its proximity to the galley would be bothersome but was ok. Boarding in Miami a bit more chaotic than in Heathrow. Dinner ok but less impressive than the inbound flight. Was really impressed with my arrival at Heathrow. Premium Economy means you get to disembark the plane as one of the first after 15 minutes I had passed immigration and Premium Economy luggage has a special tag meaning it's one of the first ones to arrive on the belt. Found myself in a cab in record speed only 30 minutes after landing. Virgin PE - is it worth it? I'd say yes - don't expect a full Upper Class experience but seats in Economy looked tatty and a bit worn and are definitely less comfortable than PE. Not only do you get the wider seat that reclines (which can be a blessing or a curse depending on who's in front of you) but the extra attentive service and the little perks (fast check-in better food etc) makes it an overall enjoyable experience.",nan,4.0,nan

Not that much extra room provided by seats in main cabin on 747. Had to endure economy passengers coming through the cabin often with all their worldly goods whilst trying to enjoy the welcome glass of sparkling wine (not Champagne) as given previously. Two of the four dedicated toilets out of use on VS20 and other two were used by economy passengers as there was no segregation of seating classes. Menu offered a choice of 3 main courses. My wife and I had only two options by the time we were served and the one we chose was of extremely poor quality. I have enjoyed many better meals in Economy sections of other airlines. Those in the seats behind us were reduced to a single option of take it or leave it as there was only one option the vegetarian left. Stingy on the measure of wine offered and coffee served whilst still eating main course. Disappointment at service compounded at Heathrow when economy passengers allowed off before us. Having paid roughly twice as much for Premium Economy as for Economy tickets we felt badly let down and feel sure this was not Sir Richard Branson's vision for his airline. Will certainly not travel with this airline again as there are many better value for money options available elsewhere now.,nan,1.0,nan

Cabin crew have to be the rudest and most unpleasant I have ever met. Paid for extra leg room seats but they split me up from my daughter and husband - the ground staff and cabin crew couldn't care less. Seats were comfortable but only for a few hours NOT for a 12 hour flight. Food was poor drinks ok but not enough service - 4 I believe in a 12 hour flight and only came through the cabin a few times with water. The inbound service from Shanghai to LHR on 22nd April was even worse - 3 trolley services in 12 hours.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,2.0,During my flight I was very disappointed! I pre-ordered the food online (vegetarian option) but when it arrived it was cold pasta as a side snack and as a main meal it was hot pasta in tomato sauce. The menu gave to us was out of date and the air hostesses apologised for the wrong menu they gave out to us all. I know I am a vegetarian but it would be nice to have variation of food and not just pasta pasta and more pasta. Vegetarians eat other foods as well. During flight V93 to Mexico they gave us no wash bag (with toothbrush and toothpaste). We had this on the return flight but not going. On the return flight V94 the vegetarian lasagne was disgusting and the breakfast was just a hard cob roll with jam. We were given no butter or nice breakfast pastry as it said on the menu. Drink wise for the night flight there were no hot chocolate or nice crackers and cheese. I really feel the food has taken a turn for the worse and the food needs looking into especially the vegetarian options and breakfast meals.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,3.0,I had two different impressions of two flights with VA. The first flight was from London Heathrow to Los Angeles Premium Economy and it was great even though the seat I had wasn't the most convenient in term of its location. I didn't sleep and for the whole flight stewards were always there asking if I need something else offering drinks snacks ice creams. The second flight was back home from Los Angeles to London Heathrow Premium Economy and that was a totally different story. It all started from the delayed main meal. In the Economy they were already finishing their meal but ours wasn't even served. Then the meal was served eaten and we had our dirty dishes in front of us for like an eternity. Nobody seemed to care about collecting the dishes the stewards seemed to be hectically busy with something behind the closed curtains - but with what? At some point a lady in front of me decided to recline her chair and doing that she squeezed my dirty dishes so I had to call the stewards and request to remove them. Then we were waiting for a coffee - for more than an hour. I reminded about a coffee a couple of times but again the stewards were just too busy with something not related to serving the passengers. Then there was another lengthy period more than an hour of waiting for liquors. The light was already switched off and most passengers were asleep when at last some brandy was offered. And then the Premium Economy stewards simply disappeared and didn't show up until closer to the end of the flight. Nobody was offering drinks nobody was asking if passengers need anything there was simply no service in Premium Economy. On the way back from the toilet I met Economy stewards who were serving drinks they offered a drink to me. Were Premium Economy stewards on strike or something? I have no idea. My rates below will reflect my experience of the return flight. I will fly with VA again in July to San Francisco Premium Economy and I hope I will never meet again the team that I was unlucky to meet on my return from Los Angeles.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,"I flew out of YVR to LHR two weeks ago. Being a nervous flyer I always hate flying and reading the recent reviews I was even more nervous to fly with Virgin! At the check-in desk however my worries began to be lessened. One of the Virgin Flight check-in staff listened as I told him I was nervous about flying and helped find my children and I a seat in the bulkhead. At the gate the staff allowed ""people who need a little more time to board"" on first and we settled easily into VS96 on that night a really modern looking plane. Couldn't fault it - it looked clean and colourful. The flight itself was smooth and even though the air stewards were not perhaps as proactive as on British Airways when I asked for help with getting a drink for the kids or something along those lines they helped straight away and without complaint. The only less than stellar thing was the kids' meal - which looked like the adult version of a meal but it was a late flight and the kids had already eaten so I didn't care too much about that and neither did they. No kids flight pack either - but to be honest that didn't bother me either - less junk to carry around post flight. When the plane landed 9 hours later at LHR my son had an epic meltdown. One of the Virgin Angels came out and asked if I needed a hand with my bags (I had one child under each arm and was kicking my bag along with my foot): I gladly took her up on her offer and she accompanied us all the way to customs bless her chatting all of the way.

We called the airline three times before traveling and waited on hold for 2 hours each time. The desk agent at JFK was extremely unpleasant and borderline rude. We had booked seats on the upper level of the plane one of the calls was to confirm that this was allowed with a child also traveling in the party. We were told to go to the desk at the gate prior to the flight to have her seat assigned with ours. The gate attendant gave us a glare and informed us that this was not allowed. After being spoken to condescendingly several more times we were eventually reassigned to our original seats. Once on board service was sub-par. Drinks (including water) were not offered for over 1.5 hours into the flight and we sat at the gate for an hour prior to taking off due to a ""minor"" problem with the fuel pump. When the man sitting in our aisle asked for a glass of water about 1 hour into the flight he was given a look and told that he would need to be patient as they are busy. I understand that they are busy but he was extremely polite when asking and a simple response with the same polite manner would have been more appropriate. Dinner was served with the drink cart trailing behind a drink was offered shortly after dinner arrived and then the drink cart was not seen again. The meal was standard economy fare the roll was frozen solid but the main meal was edible if not 90% rice. They came through to clear meal trays and offer hot chocolate or tea then the lights were turned off. They never came through to offer water during the flight which would have been nice (and was done on flights with another carrier). I could have hit my call light (as I had a sleeping toddler on my lap) but really didn't care to interact with the staff any more than absolutely necessary. The staff never smiled or looked even slightly pleasant. I was extremely disappointed in the service. They should be less concerned about their attractive uniforms and more concerned with providing standard pleasant service to all of their customers - including economy. We did arrive safely - which is their first priority - and I respect that.",nan,2.0,nan

I got a coach class ticket but unlike KLM they don't upgrade you for the paltry 3 inch legroom for free for Platinum Medallion Members! KLM and others do. Wish South African Airlines was a partner.

The controls for the entertainment were in the arm rest which as you were squashed in your seat were very difficult to reach. My wife is a size 8 and I'm 13 stone so were by no means obese! The TV screen reflected the light and wasn't easy to view and they served dinner instead of breakfast at around 8am which I couldn't stomach that early but was then hungry later. The food was poor even when I could face it on the way back. No choice small meals and butter just covered one side of the roll. The plane and entertainment system both ways felt old the seating was cramped and uncomfortable the food was not nice although the service was fine.

I rarely write reviews and it is regrettable that I should have to write this one. Firstly I would like to say however that the airline crew were a delight unfortunately the food they were serving was not. I appreciate I have gone straight to the food however when you are on a long haul flight this is a significant factor in your journey. We travelled with Virgin twice whilst on our honeymoon and both times the menu did not match what we were served - once is a mistake twice is not goo enough. The 'starter' was bland and the 'main course' contained so much salt that I felt dehydrated after every bite. The snacks were far beyond creative. Whilst the entertainment was diverse I felt for the chap sat in front of me due to the weight I had to put behind my film selection causing his head seat to bounce back and forth. I could continue down this road but I think it is important to reach an early conclusion - I was disappointed with this journey. The years have not been kind to Virgin Atlantic.,nan,2.0,nan

They assured everyone connecting at LHR that they had already called ahead and would hold flights for us this was a huge relief as we had to catch another flight immediately. The cabin crew was lead by a very friendly steward who noticed immediately I was a nervous flyer and checked if I was alright as soon as he was allowed out of his seat I have never had this happen on a flight before. The seats were very comfortable and roomy for the type of aircraft being used an A320. The complimentary bacon roll was delicious and a very nice little touch to a domestic flight.

Flights booked with Virgin because of very impressive Atlantic flight some years ago from which I never stopped praising Virgin for their excellent service I also paid extra to be able to fly Virgin this time however that is now out of the window completely and they will be way down the list of recommends now. The outbound flight was not pleasant with a seat that was about on par with the general charter 2 hour holiday flights probably the seat on the inbound did not seem so bad but still uncomfortable in comparison with what is generally available now days. There was generally a number of things that are not now acceptable eg main meal that was decidedly mediocre with rubbish box of claggy breakfast come tea a menu on outbound that had no relation at all to what was served with just a brief apology a cheap drinks regime of pouring from a large bottle but generally just substandard. The worst thing however was the entertainment screen for me and many other travellers I suspect this is one of the most important items as I do not sleep on aircraft's so I look forward to relaxing and watching films etc throughout the flight and I was disgusted that the screens on both flights were so dark that in many of the screens all you could see was a few flashing lights this was made worse when the person in front put the seat back and the screen could not be pulled out sufficiently to get the best view available in fact on the outbound flight it not only would not pull out sufficiently but as soon as you let go it sprang back into the seat. The selection of films was also rubbish with not much choice except that didn't matter in end as they were impossible to follow and on the outbound the films all started at set times and could not be paused or re-started. In general I would say that Virgin have paired down their service to a minimum which is now not anything like acceptable I have flown in several carriers in the last year and found eg Emirates Air New Zealand BA etc vastly superior.

The B747 was almost full as was the Upper cabin with all 14 seats being occupied. Even with the Upper cabin being full we were made to feel that we were the only people being looked after (we know everyone was also) but it's the attention to detail with things like the service which make such a difference.

Seats have three positions: upright slight recline and flat bed. Upon request the flight attendant will reposition the seat into a bed and provide a duvet and coverlet with pillow. The bed is satisfactory for sleeping but it is not possible to readjust to a seating position without vacating the seat and removing the linen. The entire configuration is uncomfortable and impractical. When the seat is configured to a flat bed reading and watching TV is near impossible. A far better seat would allow the passenger to readjust the bed to a comfortable recline which would permit reading watching TV or eating which is the case with most other carriers.

Flight crew were fantastic and really friendly punctual landing into LHR. And free love hearts - quirky fun and really give the airline a character. Return flight was slightly marred prior to boarding when I was asked to put my hand baggage into the hold as it was large (not over the limits) and the flight was very busy. In fact there was plenty of space on the plane for my bag so this did little more than delay my departure from Aberdeen. But again a really nice flight and very quick. Friendly crew again and a complimentary drinks service (including alcoholic but unfortunately I was driving). Overall great value.

Outbound flight delayed by an hour due to passengers disembarking an AirNas flight. It was not possible to board the Virgin flight as there was insufficient space in the walkways! Seated in row 23 Premium economy. Friendly cabin crew handed out pre-flight drinks and menus. Good entertainment system with good choice of movies. Pre-dinner drinks served promptly. Meal service commenced and I was disappointed that my choice had already run out by time they served me leaving me with the vegetarian curry. I did not expect not to be able to have my choice in Premium economy. Uneventful flight which made up some time across the ocean. Return flight departed on time and landed early at Gatwick. Dinner was a creole chicken dish which was actually quite tasty. Cabin was far too warm making for quite an uncomfortable flight and too hot to sleep. Breakfast was pretty good - choice of continental or full English. Having landed early the gate was occupied so we had to sit on the aircraft for half an hour which was quite frustrating.

On my outward flight the experience was well cattle class at its absolute worse. The return trip however was far worse and just dire! So starting with little things the aircraft was really tatty with the pouch in front of me containing all the brochures falling forward because the stitching was broken - this on observation was the case with many seats around me ensuring that the pouch was resting against my legs for 11 hours - tatty! The films were old - out of date and the food was awful. The return flight was staffed by stroppy staff - no smiles at all.

Seats have three positions: upright slight recline and flat bed. Upon request the flight attendant will reposition the seat into a bed and provide a duvet and coverlet with pillow. The bed is satisfactory for sleeping but it is not possible to readjust to a seating position without vacating the seat and removing the linen. The entire configuration is uncomfortable and impractical. When the seat is configured to a flat bed reading and watching TV is near impossible. A far better seat would allow the passenger to readjust the bed to a comfortable recline which would permit reading watching TV or eating which is the case with most other carriers.

This year on our annual Florida holiday we decided to take a direct flight back usually we like a break and fly via another US city. However for speed we thought we'd fly with Virgin. Our disappointment was almost immediate as we stepped on the plane and found our seats we expected a nice friendly welcome from the inflight staff but the surly stewardess couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge us. When I sat down I discovered that we were actually on a chartered flight as I'd never been on a scheduled flight with such a tight seat pitch. Inflight safety was almost criminal neglect as no one onboard would be able to stomach what passed for a safety video. Food was next and it was sparse and terrible. So here is my message to anyone thinking of flying with Virgin to Florida - do not do it - you can have a much better experience by booking a one stopper through a US airline. We have done Delta US Airlines and United in the past few years and whilst the staff are surprising mature they are extremely attentive provide great service and know how to feed you. They also have enough between their ears to have a sensible conversation with.

The wait time to get off the plane on arriving after a nine hour flight was over half an hour the excuse given was the airport was too busy to accept us immediately. On the return to Manchester we were also left sitting on the plane for more than half an hour this was due to parking the plane off stand and waiting for buses. The excuse given was the airport was very busy which was obviously not true because we were the only passengers going though passport control.

It's only 3 inches but it's shocking how much difference it makes. That said I still tried to upgrade to PE but it was full. The outward leg was on the 747 named Lady Penelope (the oldest 747 in their fleet). It couldn't be more obvious that they are phasing these planes over the next year or two. The interior was worn out and broken down looking every bit of its 25 years. Service was normal and polite as usual and we were no worse for wear upon landing. The return journey though was quite enjoyable in the same EXLR seat on a A340-600. Again PE was full while the UC seems like it takes up half the plane looked half empty. The interior was much better but the IFE is woefully dated and almost impossible to see in anything but complete darkness. I feel like I'm ticking off a lot of negatives but really it was the return journey service that stood out. All the ladies on VS23 (13/09/14) were polite and helpful. They were moving through the cabin the whole trip checking on passengers while offering water and juice 3-4 times in between meal and snack service. I rang the bell and the flight attendant was there in seconds. Maybe this kind of attention is normal on other airlines such as Emirates or Cathay Pacific but I have yet to experience it. I just know on this particular flight I felt like I was treated like an UC passenger. Once Virgin turns over their fleet and moves to the 787-9 they will be back up in the upper echelon of European airlines.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,2.0,nan,5.0,no,nan,2.0,"09/09/14 VS016 from MCO 19.35 (Delayed until 21.20). I have flown with Virgin a few times and they usually a good airline to fly with (and I have written positive comments accordingly) but this last flight the attendants were completely disinterested in their customers. Such a shame to see how much the staff on this particular flight have let their company down. We were sat in the emergency exit seats and a staff member seemed more interested in using the exit door as a ""beat box"" with his hands and yawning without having the courtesy of at least putting his hand over his mouth. Our friends on the other side of the plane were served with the same amount of interest. Come on Virgin Atlantic where is the professionalism?",nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,I don't usually complain but feel Virgin need to up their game to match the reputation they have earned. My partner and I booked a package with Virgin holidays to New York from London Heathrow. We booked with Virgin specifically because of the reputation and quality assurance it gave us and didn't mind paying the extra for that added security. Having just returned I can say that while I am thankful we arrived safely each way the experience was nothing special and was actually comparable to a budget airline. Leg room is not great and we both had problems with our entertainment systems on each flight. Food was ok at best on the way out but was terrible on the return (and my expectations of the food were by no means high). The organisation of the return flight was a sham people being moved into other people's seats which caused a domino effect of problems with one young single traveller being asked to move three times to accommodate others. The most disappointing part for me was the poor attitude of the staff particularly on the return leg. A simple request for a soft drink left me feeling that I had very much caused an inconvenience and left me feeling reluctant to make any further requests. Our experience has been poor and regretfully I will not choose to fly with Virgin again. Our best experience for long haul flights to date has been with New Zealand Airways (London to LA). Lots of work to be done at Virgin sadly.,nan,2.0,nan

Raised the issue to numerous cabin crew who were unhelpful and ignored call bells. Staff seemed stressed as apparently 80 of us were without inflight entertainment and were told ""it would make their life easier if it worked"". I was more concerned in making my flight more bearable than their life easier. Eventually and after a very bland meal it was announced that the inflight entertainment system would be re-booted which meant shutting down everyone's for 45 minutes.

The meal was edible by airline standards which isn't saying a whole lot. My biggest problem with the whole flight was the general total air of non interest from the cabin crew!

The aircraft was the B747 return must admit we enjoyed being seated on the upper deck more on the outbound but the seats downstairs were just as comfortable. Would definitely recommend Virgin to family and friends the crew were happy to get you anything you asked for and more. I often think people complaining about service on here must be expecting one on one service. the crew didn't stop and if you did want a second third or even forth drink you were welcomed in the galley to ask the crew even when they were having a meal break.

I've used this route quite a few times since in both directions and have always been pretty impressed with what was on offer. On the most recent occasion and through necessity my return booking was made less than 24h. before departure but still only cost some £98 return - when BA was quoting something along the lines of £300! There's really no differentiation in service and I've always found the staff - both in the terminals and on-board - to be friendly accommodating and pro-active. It's a real pity that rumours and speculation regarding the future of this operation continue to circulate which no doubt must impact upon forward bookings.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,We flew with Virgin Gatwick to Orlando. We had initially booked economy however decided to upgrade to upper class at the last minute. Not a problem for the return flight however we could only secure one upperclass seat for the outbound journey. I let my wife take advantage while I started the journey in economy. When the stewardess was made aware of the situation I was handed a pre flight glass of champagne to the bemusement of other passengers! I was also told I could join my wife in the upperclass cabin and enjoy some drinks at the bar. A nice touch I thought. Economy food was bad in fact I can't remember having food quite so bad on any previous flight we have taken. What a difference upperclass is! Only 14 seats really gives you the impression you're the only passenger the cabin crew have to look after impeccable service lovely food linen table cloths salt and pepper shakers proper cutlery great tasting food plenty of drinks and snacks. It really is another world. After spending the majority of the flight in upperclass I reluctantly returned to economy only to be quizzed by everyone around me as to what its like up there! The flight home was superb it helped that both my wife and I were officially in upperclass this time. Outstanding service wonderful food the IFE is poor regardless of class. Virgins lie flat seat is ok nothing special. Would we fly with Virgin again the answer to this on completion of our holiday was 100% yes but only in upper class. Since our holiday we have tried to book another with Virgin however they are currently advertising upperclass sale seats on their website up to 13th Oct 2015 however when you try to book them the are unavailable.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,Flew on VS7 from LHR to LAX on 21st September and back on VS8 on the 9th October (upper class). The return flight was exactly the same price (to the penny) as BA business class which I have used before on a different route. I chose Virgin because the seat layout is better. Check-in was efficient at Heathrow and was given directions to the Clubhouse lounge. It’s in a different league to BA business class lounge. Super food great at table service great ambience. The flight was an hour late departing with late arrival of the aircraft as the reason. But we watched it arrive 2.5 hours before the scheduled departure time? The gate was chaotic and they started boarding premium economy before Upper class so we just walked through onto the aircraft (didn't pay a small fortune for this). On the plane the staff were great. Very friendly and helpful. Replaced my main course which was inedible (braised beef) with a delicious piece of salmon. The seat was very comfy and went completely flat. The entertainment system needs updating. The screen is small and picture quality and audio is poor my system needed a re-boot twice. Returning on VS8 we arrived at terminal 3 check in early (4.5 hours before departure as our connecting flight landed on time from Tahiti). The check in desk was closed and we had to wait for an hour and a half before we could check in. Not a fan of LAX staff are cold bordering on rude but the biggest gripe is a complete lack of seating. Standing around with luggage for an hour and a half is not fun. Once check in opened it was ok. The lounge is the Air New Zealand lounge which is ok. Boarding was fine and properly prioritised. Onboard the aircraft the staff were great in every respect. Again the food was only ok. We had a main course of fillet steak which was great but a starter of 2 small cold scallops with some puree was very poor. Breakfast was a disappointment. The bacon was cold and the sausage tasted bitter. Would I use Virgin upper class again? Absolutely but they need to up their game with the onboard food and entertainment system.,nan,4.0,nan

Apart from the usual poor food and narrow seats our major complaint was with the terrible entertainment. Terrible because the whole system had more or less broken down - including the sound and despite several attempts to reboot it never worked properly and we were not able to watch anything. The return journey which was a night flight was awful. Again the entertainment system was faulty and the hand remote controls failed to control anything. When I tried to plug in my headset I couldn't because another passenger had jammed a piece of their headset in the hole so mine couldn't plug in. We were told that most of the screens were faulty on the plane and efforts would be made to reboot the system. When after an hour we asked what was happening we were told by a stressed attendant that as there were only 4 of them to look after 250 of us we would have to wait. I thought this was odd as previously the Captain had stated with pride that he had on board 16 attendants for the flight. When I mentioned this to the attendant he said through gritted teeth that the other 12 were looking after upper class. So poor food no entertainment and people in next row in front with children who were allowed all through the night to move about talk loudly and generally behave with absolutely no consideration for fellow passengers. The flight attendants kept well away but were only too much in evidence when time came to push the duty free at us. We travel regularly to the States as our son lives there but I can assure Virgin we will be flying with BA in future and not darken Virgin's door again.,nan,3.0,nan

The FA's were excellent very attentive helpful and very pleasant. The food and drink was very acceptable and the in flight entertainment also very good with lots of choice.

Check in and private security channel a breeze at T3. Heathrow Clubhouse every bit as good as the reviews say. Airbus aircraft on outbound with new style seating which is comfortable and easy to use. New style IFE is also good although not up to Emirates standard. Prior to return we received a text and email warning of severe delays to our flight (due to adverse weather at LHR on 21 October) and offering to move us onto another flight if we could get to JFK. We transferred from VS10 to VS46. VS46 uses a very very old 747-400 with the old style seating and IFE. The older seating is wider and a little more flexible but the old style IFE not as good as its younger version. Despite the age of the plane everything worked well. Virgin really looked after us and I would not hesitate to use them again. Staff were great and food onboard and in the lounge was better than recent experiences with BA.,nan,5.0,nan

Cheese was returned without even tasting it. Even though the quality of wine was fine they did not matched with the meals proposed. We discussed the meal quality with the main cabin hostess who insisted to comment this on arrival home.

Don't worry though we've teamed up with our friends at the airport or another airline to provide you with a clubhouse which is as good as our own "". At the counter we were directly informed that there was no food in the Miami lounge. We received a voucher of $15 a person for a meal. Of course this huge amount did not cover our expenses and we had to add money to pay the total bill. Experience on board was worse than our incoming flight. An announcement was made that there was a lack of 2 crew members. Resulting in the fact that service was very slow. I already finished my dinner (another salad) and my husband was not yet served. To make the experience even more perfect only one toilet in Upper Class was working so we had to cross half of the plane and queue in economy class. On arrival I contacted customer service of Virgin.

Outward flight VS15 747-400 in PE which was OK the food was acceptable and there were several little extras throughout the flight including ice cream sweets and squash offered. Priority boarding and a welcome glass of bubbly started the flight quite nicely and the inflight service was generally attentive and friendly. The flight attendants worked solidly throughout the 9 hour flight they were understaffed and it was clear that they had little rest. The cabin was disappointingly a bit grubby though dust around the air vents and crumbs around the seat. The seat was comfortable and plenty of legroom. The IFE worked well. On the whole not a bad experience and the benefit of a smaller cabin at the front of the aircraft makes a lot of difference. We couldn't get PE for the return flight so ended up in Economy towards the rear of the plane. What a difference! VS28 another 747-400. A disinterested cabin crew more concerned about fancy hairdos than their jobs arrogant and dismissive attitudes dreadful food. The main cabin lights were switched off for the entire duration of the flight (apart from the 'food' service) and we took off at 7.30pm hardly bed time. I think this was to get people to go to sleep so they didn't have to do anything! In fact the attendants disappeared to the back of the aircraft for some 'rest' when perhaps they could have been attending to their passengers. They were not interested in collecting used drinks/rubbish which languished on my tray until I got up and returned them to the galley. The seats are crammed in 459 passengers on this flight although not especially uncomfortable for me (I am 5ft 5) but for a taller person must have been hellish. The food choices had run out by the time they got to us so adding insult to the injury of being stuck in the bowels of the plane - first dibs on the food would make that a bit better!

Our most recent trip change that. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours but they did send an email and text about 8 hours before the flight to let us know which was great. The text gave a number to call if you had a connecting flight which we did. I called the number and after listening to many options had to chose the general ""wait for assistance"". I did and was still waiting 15 minutes later. Tried again with the same result so decided to email which was a form that required you to put in all your details. When I hit send I got a message to say they would get back to me in 28 days or less! I was getting a bit stressed by this point as our connecting flight was going to be tight due to the delay. We got to the airport early and I went straight to the Virgin desk to explain. I was asked if the connection was with Virgin and when I said ""no"" I was given a shrug and told there ""probably won't be a problem you should make it"". I asked if there was anything they could do and was told to check onboard to make sure we got off the flight promptly. On the plane and we were told ""you should be OK because you are amongst the first to get off"". When we landed it was clear that they were not disembarking in any systematic kind of way. As it happens it wouldn't have mattered if we were first off as our luggage took 55 minutes to appear. Customer care was one of the reasons we used Virgin in the first place but it is obviously totally superficial and as soon as you have a problem they really don't want to know. My dissatisfaction was made worse by the experience on the flight. We were seated upstairs and although this seemed a good option I would not chose to sit there again. This was our return flight and everything was inferior to the outward flight. The foot rest seemed to be in a misaligned position so are not as comfortable. The cabin is split one part premium and on part economy and everyone from economy walked through the premium cabin to queue for the toilet. Trying to sleep with people standing beside you waiting for the loo is not great. The usual format for Virgin is drinks service after take off - didn't happen. Food - extremely poor quality. Liqueur service after the meal - didn't happen. On the outward flight we were given ice lollies and then sweets on landing. None of that. I asked for new headphones as mine were faulty and I'm still waiting. I honestly felt like we were on a different airline from the one we flew out on. Very disappointed and really wouldn't recommend Virgin to anyone. I know you pay your money and take your chance but there is no excuse for poor service and the attitude from staff was awful.

Didn't get my vegetarian meal and eventually got one on a tray from economy with no bread and plastic cutlery. Not good for premium standards. Entertainment system worked ok and film choice was good.

Virgin now allow their economy class exit row seats to be booked at the time of reservation so we booked economy plus paid £60 per person for exit row seats. We made our reservation on line then spoke to their call centre to pre paid for the exit seats all very easy and efficient. Seat numbers were assigned I think around 3 weeks before we travelled which was excellent and reassuring. We checked in online as usual and arrived at the bag drop at LHR T3 around 2 hours before departure and we were having breakfast in the departure area 15 minutes later. The flight departed on time. The seats themselves were a little narrow but acceptable however the leg room was what we had paid for so all was ok however there is no way I could travel for more than 30 minutes in a regular Virgin Atlantic economy class seat the pitch is appalling. The flight itself was fine food and drinks ok good service from the cabin crew and good inflight entertainment.,nan,5.0,nan

The aircraft was a 747 with the interior really starting to show its age. The IFE screen was very poor quality which meant it was very difficult to work out what was happening in the films. Food was regular and average to good which was pleasant. Aircrew were polite and went about their work in an efficient manner. Premium Economy on the whole is starting to look a little expensive for what you get. The return from EWR to LHR was in economy with extended leg room and I felt that there was little difference between the the two. In short I would fly again but will start looking at airlines that are offering more modern aircraft which are more comfortable with better IFE.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,Flew with Virgin Little Red from Manchester to London for a connection to Virgin Atlantic for a flight to Newark in Premium Class on an A330. Used the Number 1 traveller lounge at discounted price using Virgin flight reference which whilst no where near the Virgin Lounge quality was excellent and way above the normal pay for Exec lounges. Flight to Newark was very good plane in excellent condition and staff attentive polite and helpful. In flight entertainment was adequate with plenty of options. The meal was well presented and again the presentation was excellent. On arrival in Newark the Priority baggage did not materialise and it was the usual 'dog fight' to wait for luggage. Our return flight (after a cruise) was via Orlando international direct to Manchester on an old B747 in upper class. The Delta lounge was offered as a code share and was a nice quiet oasis although these American lounges are not a patch on the UK lounges regards food etc. Escorted by a Virgin staff member to the gate when the flight was due to be boarded and the upper class area was excellent The seating was not the new seating product as used on the new A330 fleet and the newly arrived 787's but was still very nice and the best way one can travel 'Red Eye' back to the UK. The staff were so attentive nothing could be too much trouble the novelty bar was just that a novelty for some the food was excellent the Beef Filet excellent as was the cooked breakfast. The fold out bed with mattress was a great feature and the Virgin pyjamas. The bed itself was quit hard but I was still able to have a nice sleep. Overall despite some adverse reviews recently My wife and I found the service to be excellent although I do think the US Airways Envoy 'Product' is better.,nan,3.0,nan

I have given Staff service 1 star but only because the option to give none is not available (like a lot of onboard services). On trying to book in there was a long queue which did not move. No announcements were made and eventually another passenger told us the computer system was down. The ground crew were exceptionally rude and our party was split despite having reserved seats before we left the UK. The cabin crew were almost invisible. They disappeared to their rest area shortly after serving the meal. Call bells were ignored. When they did appear they were disinterested and barely polite. The meal was unappetising. Perhaps if Virgin spent some of the money they spend on advertising and hype on training staff and updating very tired and worn aircraft passenger satisfaction would improve.,nan,1.0,nan

It was very nice and new with new lighting colours and various patterns across the cabin. The seats were very new and modern and the bed was comfy. My suggestion is that these seats are only on the A330-300 but to give everyone this modern even more luxury experience I think it should be released across the whole fleet (not A320).

While new to the Virgin style I found the set up a bit confusing. The flight attendants actually had to make people's beds as it was impossible to figure out how to do it yourself. On the way back from London I had ordered a starter main course and dessert when requested at the beginning of the flight. When the dessert time came the flight attendant said there was no more left of what I had ordered. The dessert itself is irrelevant but the fact that they ran out of anything for people paying thousands of dollars for this service was enough to make me angry.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,A great disappointment. We traveled with Virgin Atlantic a few years ago and the economy cabin was comfortable and the service good. Not any more. Shabby and cramped seats with very little leg room unless you pay for an extra couple of inches Virgin seem to have lost the plot with economy passengers either that or they just don't care! Food was inedible on the outward flight from London to Boston the cabin crew were over stretched and took nearly two hours to serve the meal. This was not a problem on the way out but the return flight was delayed by four hours and left at 1.45 a.m so by 3 a.m. they were still offering poor food to people who just wanted to try to sleep. BA who were subject to the same delay in London managed to turn their flight round much faster and were only two hours late.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,2.0,I recently travelled Virgin Premium Economy from London to Hong Kong and my experience was not what I had expected for the price. Having been upgraded to Premium on a return flight from New York to LHR I was looking forward to experiencing Virgins mid level class as the BA version was absolutely wonderful. Comfort is my primary priority on long haul as I really need to sleep in order to arrive feeling healthy. The Virgin website shows a video of what to expect in PE and I was gleefully looking forward to what was described by many as an even more luxurious level of comfort than what BA offered. Unfortunately those expectations were dashed when I sat down in the elderly Boeing aircraft to find a dirty poorly maintained and cramped environment. I was who shocked to find that my legs were blocked by a rigid plastic barrier beneath the seat in front ensuring that I wouldn't be able to extend my legs fully (this ridiculous design feature appeared to be in place throughout the PE cabin but not in regular economy). The promise of greater levels of comfort were further reduced by the large metal footrest that dug itself into my lower leg. Pulling it down so I could actually use it resulted in my legs being hoisted so high in the air that my knees where above my stomach. The armrests were large ugly plastic topped designs that were static preventing my partner and I from sharing our combined areas (a feature available in most economy cabins I've flown in). So I put my earphones in to watch an inflight movie and was promptly deafened by the pilots announcement as they had set volume level to maximum independent of the local level I had set. I complained to attendant who very politely said he'd get it sorted. I also asked why the PE cabin I was in didn't reflect the one I had seen on their website when I paid for it. He explained that only the more recent fleet of aircraft were fitted with the new trim and these older planes were not considered for upgrading as they would be replaced in the next few years. I would have expected more clarity when parting with my hard earned money so I could have been better informed about what I was actually paying for as the resulting experience fell way short of what I was expecting. I certainly won't be making that mistake again.,nan,2.0,nan

The flight was on time the aircraft seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was good. The flight crew were hard working and pleasant. The flight was spoilt by someone a little worse for drink who then starting abusing his partner and the cabin crew. This was dealt with very well by the staff in very difficult circumstances. The man was arrested at Manchester. We felt very sympathetic with the flight crew because they were only doing their job and did not deserve the abuse.

First time using a full service airline domestically after mostly using EasyJet for couple of years and this Little Red offshoot of VS didn't disappoint. Aer Lingus should given a massive pat of the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic. Flights were on time and inflight service was more than one could ask for a short-haul domestic flight with friendly and attentive staff. I was delayed inbound back from Edinburgh but that was due to a security scare at that Airport and I was notified with plenty of time via email and text and allowed me time spend a few more hours with friends in Edinburgh. The one Achilles heel is Heathrow I haven't used Heathrow in 16 years - and I have to say it didn't leave me want to back in a hurry unfriendly and poor management of queues for security - for Britain's premier air gateway it is shambolic particularly when you see the improvements that have been made at Gatwick. Virgin should be proud of the service they are delivering here though I am using them again in January on this domestic route and will be sad to see this end in September 2015. Great service and excellent value - highly recommended.,nan,5.0,nan

Unfortunately that is where the good points end. The flight itself was OK albeit a little late. The seats were just about comfortable enough as was the legroom. However the flight crew missed out our entire row when serving the evening meal and the only way we got served was to ask for the food which was only just edible. We flew back to Manchester on VS76 and paid for extra legroom seats in the hope of getting some sleep on the overnight flight. These extra legroom seats were immediately outside one of the galleys and whilst the legroom was more than adequate the constant queue of passengers asking for service (the flight crew only came around once during the flight to offer drinks) together with the additional light from the galley made sleeping virtually impossible. Again we were missed out during the dinner service and had to ask for the food. We were then missed out again when the dessert was served and had to go to one of the galleys to ask if here was a reason for us being missed out. After finishing my main course (the food was again barely edible) I asked one of the crew if I could have a second glass of wine. Thirty minutes later I had still not received it and had to go to one of the galleys to ask again. All in all the plane was OK as was the service from the ground staff. However the flight crew were not remotely up to the job. I don't I know whether they were short staffed inadequately trained or just didn't care but basically not good enough and nowhere near the level of service promised by your advertising.,nan,3.0,nan

(I don't fly for the food though!) For instance the afternoon tea (served in a cardboard box) consisted of half a sandwich and a very small slice of caramel chocolate cake. I didn't find the seats that comfortable. On the return trip (also full to capacity) we were offered extra legroom seats for an additional $60 and took them as this was the only way we could sit together. The catering was better also (presumably provided by an American company). It amazes me what people turn up with for ""carry on"" luggage these days. My bag was very small but some others were about the size of an average suitcase! Consequently locker space is denied to those people boarding later.

Priority boarded and glass of sparkling wine offered seating is 2-2 on the upper deck seats are a decent size and legroom is not to bad only complaint is when the person in front reclines it significantly reduces your legroom and the person in the window seat has problems getting out. Food was acceptable beef stew or Chicken and Rice meal offered bit over cooked but still tasty and then a hot breakfast served prior to arrival. Drinks service offered prior to meal during the meal and juice/water service during the night. Friendly and helpful cabin crew nothing seemed to much of a problem for them. On arrival at Gatwick the luggage was already on the carousel as we arrived so from the plane arriving on stand to exiting the airport was about 15 minutes which is outstanding. 1st time on Virgin Atlantic and would definitely use them again.,nan,5.0,nan

I purchased “seat plus” on the way out so had to use the check in counter. There was no queue in Gatwick. On the way back I did online check in so just needed to print out the boarding pass then proceed to bag drop. The airplane was a refurbed B744. It has a nice interior. Seat was comfortable and was better than I expected. However pitch and width were tight if the passenger in front reclines. The entertainment is up to date although the choice of movies / TV not as good as other airlines. The on demand system with a touch screen will keep you busy throughout a long journey. Personally I still prefer the touch screen but with a remote/console so that you don’t feel the person behind you is constantly “pushing” your seat back. Food onboard was a weak point. It was a nice touch to be given a menu but the food quality was poor. On the way out I pre ordered low fat meal but was served normal food. I noticed the crew who said they would try to see what they could do but then disappeared entirely. There was no sandwich or drink in the galley so in my case it was a 10 hour journey without food. On the returning I was served normal food again and I had to remind the crew that I’d pre-ordered special meal – that didn't seem normal in my experience where all other airlines will give passenger their special meals before others so they don't get confused. Breakfast was also poor – an orange juice a yoghurt and a very dry croissant. Service was overall friendly but not as professional as other airlines. Toilets weren't cleaned and some were out of order. Overall an acceptable flight experience but I will still choose BA over Virgin.,nan,3.0,nan

Bread with the meal was a piece of cold stale roll. Drinks offered were few and far between - only twice throughout the whole flight.

I have used Virgin in the past when travelling business in Upper class but used this flight for a family holiday with accrued virgin miles - Manchester oddly seemed to be the only flights to the Caribbean from the UK where both miles seats were available and at the right times for us so we booked. I ordered a Hindu meal in advance (usually better quality and it arrives quicker that the normal food run) - it was average quality and very small. The family members opted for the normal menu and were pretty disappointed with what they received both in quality and size- looks like cost cutting in action. pre landing snack was minuscule for both the Hindu (single bread roll and butter!) and normal (cheese and pickle). Not the end of the world for an 8 hour flight but a slight let down. Entertainment was OK but most films were not ones I had heard of before and I'm pretty clued up on these things. Return flight food was much better for both options. Additional leg room seats on exists are severely restricted in ""A"" seats due to size of door base impeding on length of stretch - avoid this if possible. As usual the heavy construction of the exit seats can be much more uncomfortable with no ability to raise / lower arms for comfort and controls wedged into the arm and can be hard to reach. Just something to be aware of if you pre-book additional leg room options and have some choice over location.

You want for nothing and everywhere you look a happy smiley face in smart red uniform is on hand to attend to your every whim. I also took advantage of the complimentary treatment in the spa with a scalp message. The call to board came all too soon as I could quite easily have stayed in the lounge a while longer. Turning left on the plane and walking through premium you are met with ambient mood lighting and a glass of champagne.

Our first leg from LHR to Jo'Berg was in premium economy which was comfortable enough but the plane was just a little tired and where had all those lovely girls off the TV ad gone ? Anyway we completed our travels and were looking forward to a great trip back especially me as I'd upgraded us to upperclass when I'd first booked so it was going to be a lovely surprise for my wife. Having travelled with Virgin years previously in their prime I was expecting something pretty lush. Alas yet another 'tired old donkey put out to graze'. Don't get me wrong it was certainly a step up from premium and the staff were excellent but it certainly didn't warrant the prices being charged (luckily I'd picked them up 11 months previously at almost the same rate as premium so it wasn't such a loss) and it burst the balloon quite a bit. The audio/video system needed a little bit of a makeover too. However the biggest disappointment was the food. I have eaten better quality food on budget airlines within Europe it was terrible especially for upperclass I even politely rejected the breakfast run (In fact it was only a slight improvement on Air Mauritius which was absolutely appalling). I will travel with Virgin again only simply due to the amount of air miles I have amassed for upgrades but I'll make sure I've got my Ipad full of music & movies and a few bags of crisps to eat.

Flat bed idea is great but choose a seat further away from the bar so you can enjoy a decent nights sleep which I thought was what you were paying for!

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,Not nearly as bad as I would have thought given those reviews written here. Travelled from LHR to JFK on Jan 24th in Economy. First of all - heard they have an excellent newspaper selection - and found that to be true. Also heard they have very cramped seating in economy - and also found that to be true. But on the positive note - there were plenty of extra seats available so people could move around and switch places. As for the famously bad food - I opted for veggie option out of fear and wasn't disappointed. The only thing was the small portions - everything was tiny. The entertainment system was all right but mostly commercial Hollywood films on rotation. As to the famously unsmiling stewardess - some of them did smile making up for those who did not. Lots of drinks were served with juice and water on constant rotation. Landed safely and on time.,nan,4.0,nan

Today's service is a far cry from what it once was. Today's plane was old the in- flight service below standard and the on-time take-off/arrival non-existent. As bad as the Delta flight was going to India as it was 90 minutes late to depart and arrive in Paris for the connection the plane was newer and therefore the entertainment much better as were the attendants.,nan,2.0,nan

Second time using this Little Red offshoot of Virgin and extremely happy to have received the same fantastic service I received the first time. Inflight service was the usual Little Red complimentary offer and was again nice to be offered a Tiger Beer and Tyrell Crisps which was part of the joy last time - the additional round of Love Hearts distributed was a nice touch too! Staff on both outbound and inbound flights friendly and attentive outbound my seat had been changed from the seats I pre-selected online flight wasn't full however and staff were happy for me to move to another empty row by a window. Inbound flight was on an Aer Lingus branded plane substituted for a faulty VS one which was fine although that plane did look a bit tired - I think if anything Aer Lingus should learn a thing or too from running this service on behalf of Virgin and the polish and joy that they manage to pull off - if they applied it to their own service I think they would be to an industry leading product especially by European airline standards which have lacked somewhat in comparison to their Middle- Eastern and East Asian counterparts. Once again however Aer Lingus staff should given a massive pat on the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic - Purser on my Inbound flight was the same gentlemen as the last time I went to Edinburgh and his enthusiasm and attentiveness should be commended. I am still not enamoured by Heathrow but do appreciate the improved Terminal 2 and on this occasion it wasn't such a bad experience due to it being particularly a quiet time during the day. Virgin however should be proud of the service they are delivering here though will be sad to see this end in September 2015 it is a real shame.

I usually fly premium economy but was unable to do so this time - never again. There's just so little room all round and for 9 hours plus it's no joke.

The inflight entertainment was good but the film library was not extensive compared to some airlines. The cabin crew were attentive and I must say, I liked their uniform.

I was told this by an incredibly helpful lady that I spoke to at the ""Flying Club"", where it also turned out that they had kept my membership online, even though my last flight with them must have been the best part of 20 years ago.  Where it falls down for me is in the economy seating. I know airlines spend a lot of time and money on seat design but this seat is dreadful. It is narrow and uncomfortable. If the person in front reclines, it is virtually impossible to eat your meal - this on one of the world's latest aircraft! No issues with check-ins or cabin staff.

In October 2015 I booked my holiday with Virgin Atlantic and also a few days later I booked and paid for my seats to be pre booked which was £200 for 4 people there and back only to realise that when I looked on my booking on the Virgin Atlantic web page they took all my seats that I had booked and paid for and give them to someone else. Apparently if the flight time changes all seats get cancelled, stupidest thing I've heard yet!  While being on the phone to customer services I wasn't happy with the mans attitude so I asked to speak to someone higher like a manager but was told no, no one else in the office to talk to apparently. I feel sorry for anyone else who has paid extra to pre book their seats because unfortunately if you booked them before February 2016 then this has most likely happened to you.

The first time I'd flown Virgin for many years, and I haven't missed anything. LHR - JFK : Lounge at LHR fine : poor welcome to the dining area but excellent service and food once there. Called to board way too early. Aircraft clearly old and seat extremely cramped (and I'm not fat) with very poor provision for storage. Disliked the herringbone layout with back to the window. Crew very much style over substance, with ridiculously choreographed safety demo (they looked like they were either auditioning for a group number on Strictly Come Dancing or for a synchronised swimming competition, complete with excessive make-up). The meal portions were small: my chicken biryani had 1 piece of chicken. When I pointed this out there was no apology and no replacement offered. Disappointing wine choice for the supposedly premium cabin. IFE clunky to operate. Atlanta to London Heathrow the same coffin-like seat, although the flipped over bed was comfortable to sleep on. Service somewhat better, though food still fairly average. Cabin was filthy: there were used earplugs and other detritus on the floor near my seat where there had clearly not been very thorough vacuuming. Quite why the designers feel the need for a focal point of what looks like a diamante bracelet from Clare's Accessories to be spotlit at various points in the Upper Class cabin is beyond me: just added to the feeling that VS Upper Class is appealing to TOWIE types rather than serious business passengers, who need space to work and the right storage to help them do so.

Boeing 787,Premium Economy,1.0,April 2016,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,LAX to LHR,1.0,"Flew Los Angeles to London Heathrow. It's been a good few months since I have flown with Virgin Atlantic and I have already noticed a huge change and this is definitely not for the better. First of all without even being aware that the Cabin Crew numbers on the aircraft have been reduced, the lack of service at check in through to being on board is shocking. The new Boeing 787 is a nice aircraft and a great product, however Virgin have really squeezed in as many seats as possible on their 787 fleet. The Premium Economy and Economy cabins are cramped and the seat in Premium Economy is not as good as on other fleets for sure, the headrest does not even bend around to hold your head in place whilst you try to sleep. The aircraft looks very nice initially yet the seat really is not great and I can't help but think it is all for show and might look nice but underneath overall it really isn't a great product. There are no 'dedicated' Cabin Crew serving you anymore in the Premium Economy aircraft, these Crew have been removed which is a real shame and this really affects the product they are trying to create, resulting in very poor service in this Cabin. I am aware that two Crew have been removed from Virgin Atlantic aircraft to try to save the company money on their wage bill, however I can't help but think this move is catastrophic for the service and brand that they have always prided themselves on. The food was shocking, no choice either as I was sat towards the back of this cabin so was served last. The ticket was not cheap and not good value for money in terms of the product and service I received at check in. The Cabin Crew on board really do try their hardest, I can tell they do try and they are extremely polite, however it is tragic to see them scraping around for food and drink to serve the customers, you can't even get a G&T with your meal, I can tell the budget really has been slashed. The inflight entertainment was good at best (when it worked) my screen kept going off and rebooting itself. I can't believe Virgin expect you to pay £15, yes £15! to use the WiFi on board in the Upper Class and Premium cabins, this is shocking that they do not give you this when you have paid so much money for a seat. Virgin Atlantic (I foresee) really is a failing brand these days, the days of them trying to get by on a young trendy image is lost when the reality when travelling with them is nothing but bog standard at that. I have used Virgin for years but I feel this is probably my last flight with them and I will choose another airline in future over Virgin Atlantic with a better product and more personalized service where the crew do not appear harassed and stressed out.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

Flight arrived 10 mins early, US immigration not too long, also friendly and baggage off swiftly. This flight was a great advert for premium economy on Virgin Atlantic. Return (night) flight with B787 just as comfortable with fully operational entertainment system. Security in SF close to humiliating, and passport control at Heathrow an embarrassment with huge queue and long delay, saved only by the actual passport officer who clearly had a sense of humour. Baggage reclaim fine, in that it arrived immediately we were through the delay at passport control. Check-in at SF and cabin crew on the flight appeared to be going through the motions. Menus lost, no explanation/apology, new premium economy snack system not explained. Food on this flight no better than adequate. Flight arrived 20 mins late, not helped by long period between leaving the gate at SF, and actual take-off, then stacking before landing making this flight slightly disappointing overall.

We were told they would make sure it would not happen on the way back and confirmed seats on the email I had received. Guess what - same thing on return journey. £10k to be seated all over the place and to top it off we didn't get the child meals requested but did get charged for the 3 tubes of pringles I asked for. The plane was scruffy and not comparable to business class on BA or Emirates. The attendants were excellent trying to do what they could to seat families together and apologising but Virgin Atlantic need to sort themselves out. If you are considering buying upper class there is nothing upper class about it. Seats don't recline very far so you have to get up and wait for the stewardess to make up a flat bed that is uncomfortable and then wait for it to be changed back.

Boeing 747,Economy Class,2.0,June 2016,2.0,4.0,nan,no,LGW to LAS,3.0,"London Gatwick to Las Vegas with Virgin Atlantic. Having flown with Virgin annually for 20 years, we have noticed a steady decline in quality overall, from food, systems and customer service, all of which is a real shame. We cannot remember when a flight last left or arrived on time. Things were looking good when we flew out - easy and quick boarding, on time too and then we were told there was a delay and were sat on the tarmac for an hour. Coming back from Vegas, the flight was delayed by 2 hours - it was good that they emailed us to advise, so we weren't stuck at the airport for the extra hours. Apparently, the delay was a policy decision, our perfectly good and on time plane was given to an alternative Manchester flight, whose plane had a problem. This meant they left on time with a fully working plane and we were heavily delayed with a substandard one. When the delay was over, check in and boarding was fine. However, the entertainment system did not work for the whole 10 hour flight. Several reboots of the system didn't help, so that was that, apart from frequent ""sorry about the delay, sorry about the entertainment system"" announcements, not sounding very sincere at all. Turbulence didn't help this flight, which wasn't their fault, obviously, but it all added up to a fairly miserable experience. No tea/coffee service as they wouldn't take trolleys out with hot drinks during bumpy bits but it was ok for passengers to go to the galley and get their own hot drinks, meaning they would be tottering down the gangways with hot liquids instead, without a trolley for support. The icing on the cake was at the end of the journey - another ""sorry"" announcement, with added bit about ""staff will be handing out 'Sorry Forms'"". What's that then? It is a pre-printed leaflet apologising for the broken entertainment system, offering £20 off the next Virgin holiday, or 4000 frequent flyer miles. Two things: concerned that they have pre-printed forms ready and waiting, implying this happens a lot and also, how insulting is a £20 discount? What about those of us who didn't book direct with them? Better to not offer a paltry sweetener and deal with the busted system instead. Unfortunately, we can't recommend Virgin Atlantic any more and will avoid them in future. They need to stop saying ""sorry"" and deal with the problems - insincere apologies just aren't good enough.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

To begin with at the airport check in our suitcases were just piled up and handles by hand, leaves you wondering if you are going to receive your luggage on arrival. Staff on board were with such attitude. We had a vegetarian meal requested two months in advance,which wasn't served and just a ""sorry"" was offered. It looked like none of the attendants wanted to be at work and they could be anywhere else but not on board. The majority of the buttons were flashing requesting service and none of them will show up. At one point the flight became self service where you would see people getting off and going to the isle to request drinks. When I went to request a drink and asked for a bloody Mary (which on a flight will usually be some vodka and tomato juice and nothing fancy) a flight attendant turned and said to me ""you couldn't have an easy drink, could you!"". For a 10 hour flight only once a meal was served and we were stuffed with plastic like sandwiches for the rest of the trip or dry biscuits. The entertainment system is very poor and monitors are just rubbish (super small and touch screen works once in a million tries) Bottom line, I would really think twice before booking Virgin Atlantic again.",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

It's not the norm in any country to serve warm white wine and it's not difficult to keep it chilled.

Seat comfort was good, width and length, better than other Premium economy I've used. Impressed with IFE, lots of good up to date choice.

There were 2 restrooms for PE cabin (front location on Dreamliner, back on A340). We were offered Prosecco or OJ as soon as we settled into our seats. The seats were very comfortable with regards to seat pitch and width. The seats did recline back a good distance. The tray tables are stowed on the side of the seats. Seats also had individual charging outlets. The in-flight entertainment system (Vera) had plenty of movies/shows to choose from. Screen size was quite good (10 in.). These were touch screens on the 787 but not the A340. One of our entertainment screens did not work on the A340 but the crew gave us a pre-loaded tablet as replacement. Meal options were quite satisfactory and included chicken/beef etc plus red/white wine and all the other staples. The food tasted good. A post-meal drink- Cognac and/or Amarula (like Bailey's) was also offered. It was nice to be served with proper cutlery, coffee/tea mugs and glasses for wine/juices/soda. One of the other cool features was the ""Wander Wall"" in the galley area of the PE cabin. A wall where snacks such as cookies, chips, apricot bars, caramel popcorn and jelly beans were stacked along with juices and sodas, complete with pink lighting. This feature was missing in the A340 although all those goodies were still available. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience with Virgin and its PE product. All the flight crew and ground staff were very professional, courteous and helpful. We did feel more relaxed and rested after our flights. I did like the 787 experience better than A340 because of the newer planes, Wander Wall, touch screen entertainment systems and cool lighting. Will definitely consider Virgin Atlantic PE for future travel.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

The staff was rude and condescending. The poor treatment began from check-in. The lady tried to force me into sitting in Economy and getting a ""free return ticket from anywhere in the world"" (which is ridiculous; most sophisticated airlines would provide monetary compensation. Why would I take a free return ticket? That means I have to pay for a one-way ticket which is not worth the price especially since I don't normally fly with Virgin). I explained that this would not happen because I paid for the full ticket and I was in the highest premium economy booking class and had booked many months in advance. It took a lot of hassle for them to accept that they would not be able to force me to take the economy seat.  On the plane, the attendants were rude and unfriendly. They didn't smile and when I asked for a glass of water, the staff glared at me as if I was being an inconvenient. The food was of a poor quality for what I would expect of premium economy. Their website is faulty and when I tried to online check in two days before and change my seat I couldn't. The website said that there are 34 seats available, but I can't seem to click on any of them. I called their USA hotline and it turns out that I'm not allowed to change my seat over the phone - I can only do so at the airport. I'm sorry but what sort of backward system is this? On the bright side, they had a snack bar with bounce protein balls. But I could have just bought the protein balls at WH Smith and flown with another airline. I think Virgin Atlantic should rethink how they train their employees when it comes to customer service. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Worse still was my seat 7A did not even have a window. Sleeping is very uncomfortable and there is extremely limited storage space. However the service makes up for these issues. The crew were friendly and professional. We took off on time and landed ahead of time. IFE was very good and the meals were very nice and plenty.

They do a great job in their lounge with waiter/waitress service for breakfast and drinks. I was so looking forward to trying out the 787-9 that I actually decided to fly Virgin rather than American. I am an Executive Platinum member with American. Once I boarded the plane, I thought it looked very nice. The color of decor is very pleasing. Once I sat in my Upper Class seat, I instantly realized it wasn't as good as American's new business class, like on their 777-300 Worldliner. It is very narrow and feels very tight. Soon after takeoff, I reclined my seat. It barely reclines 45 degrees, the next option is to turn it into a flat bed, so the range of recline is limited to barely 45 degrees to 180 degrees. That's not so great for watching a movie. I was so disappointed. I did like the larger windows with the dimming feature, but I really couldn't look out since the seats face away from the windows. The whole herringbone set up is not great. American's 1-2-1 configuration is much better. Also, even on their older planes, AA's non-flat beds in business class are even better than these. You have so many options of recline versus the Virgin Upper Class. I thought the food was good, but potato chips (crisps) are not my idea of premium service. The wine selection was ok also. I will say that the flight attendants were very good. They took good care of us. They also look great wearing the same uniform. The 787-9 was nice but wasn't as quiet as I thought it would be, I do think that the air is better on this plane, but other than that, not worth the cheating.

I was flying Virgin Atlantic from Los Angeles to London Heathrow with a connecting flight to Mumbai on Jet Airways (code share with Virgin). Since all segments of my itinerary had 'VS' flight numbers, I was eligible for 2 free check-in bags in economy. Unfortunately, the ground crew wasn't aware of that, and I had to remind them of Virgin Atlantic baggage policy on travel from US to India. At the end, they let me check-in two bags for free. Boarding process was smooth. When I entered Virgin Atlantic's 787-9 Dreamliner, it felt like an upscale nightclub. They gave an amenities kit with socks, toothbrush, toothpaste, ear plugs, and blindfold. The amenities kit is not provided on the return segment from LHR to LAX. The food was outstanding. I am vegetarian and had no need to order a ""special meal"". Virgin Atlantic had vegetarian options by default, and they were delicious. The touchscreen in-flight entertainment system on 787-9 is very fast and responsive with good content.

The entertainment system was buggy and despite being rebooted twice didn't work properly so flight attendant provided an i-Pad with movies and TV shows. Most frustratingly, after paying over $25 for Wifi the system remained almost impossible to use. When one did get on it, it was so slow as to be essentially useless. The flight attendants admitted this was an on-going complaint of passengers and were apologetic. It is unacceptable that Virgin Atlantic clearly knows about the huge deficiencies in its Wifi and yet still pretends to provide a service that essentially scams passengers for $25+. The food was OK, but it seemed like 40-50% of passengers were not provided their first choices, as witnessed by apologetic flight crew going seat-by seat to give them the bad news. With 4 hours to go, they were out of ice, rendering beverage service, especially for cocktails essentially over. The entertainment selection was very good in comparison with U.S. airlines, despite the fact that the in-seat video was broken. The Virgin seat remains the same. It's fine, but requires you to stand and commit to the bed option rather than be able to ease into it through various points of recline. Overall, the Heathrow ground-service and clubhouse remains the single most valuable aspect of the Virgin brand. The actual inflight experience however has seriously declined over the years. This latest flight was the worst, and rendered Virgin no longer the best in business class travel from the US to the UK which is a shame.",Business,3.0,1.0

I am generally a fan of the Virgin brand but the new Boeing 787 planes in economy are absolutely awful. The seats are without doubt the most uncomfortable I have had the displeasure of sitting in. They are incredibly narrow, the seat cushion is too short cutting into your mid thigh causing real discomfort after a few hours. When the person in front of you moves their seat back it's game over. Unless you do the same you are so close to the IFE screen it's ridiculous. On this flight my seat cushion wasn't fixed down so would move about as I moved to try to find a comfortable position - impossible by the way. The planes was so new everything squeaked throughout the night flight. By the end of the flight there was the somewhat amusing site of red napkins stuffed into gaps all over the aircraft after the flight attendants tried to quieten the squeaking racket down - they didn't work but credit to them all for trying. 4 toilets for the 190 odd economy passengers?! You can only imagine. Brilliant design of the seat back trays - the are basically slides. When you put your tray on your table it slides off into your lap! Again the poor stewards having to hand out dinner and explaining that 'you'll need to put your tray on top of your blanket' so it doesn't slide onto your lap. It's a brand new plane. How any of the above can possibly be viewed as acceptable by the management of Virgin is utterly beyond me. I have made a direct complaint to VA about my flight but given I've had no response to that after 3 weeks I felt compelled to share my experience with others. Generally VA are great - I like the young, friendly staff, the food and service is good.

The coach home had a better head rest and was the only sleep I managed to get in 24 hours. Generally as well I would say that when there was a lot of turbulence, which as a nervous flyer, I would appreciate a warning of this.

Having travelled Qatar a few weeks earlier, the difference in quality of service, meals, and plane was a million miles. Tired, short tempered crew with Virgin clearly dreading having this sector to London for the Christmas period coincoded with serving bone dry chicken and poor food options.

I've heard Virgin are likely to be subsumed into Delta and focus on their US routes on this journey (with a half empty plane also), the staff wouldn't seem to mind, and passengers have plenty of other options to connect.

In fairness to the airline they did rectify this onboard the aircraft. The choice of movies was not great and it was the same both out and inbound. Airline food is generally not nice and in our experience this airlines was really below par! The seating arrangement was so cramped and the in flight additions such as blankets and pillows are rougher than normal airlines. The aircraft was an hour late both in and out to Las Vegas. Finally on this 10 hour flight there was no option to get online like most other flights nowadays.

The return flight had the advantage of being on the A330 with their newer IFE and a slightly more comfortable seat. Their older aircraft are starting to look a little dated inside (especially due to the IFE system) but still a comfortable way to while away a few hours above the Atlantic. The Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse at LHR is the best airport lounge that I've been in, with some of the BA ones coming a close second. There was a wide range of food and drinks available and the staff were attentive and friendly. The priority security arrangements at LHR are also fantastic, with the security staff seeming a little more jovial than the ones dealing with huge crowds. Boarding calls are made in the lounge, but only after the rest of the passengers have boarded, so you spend very little time hanging around the gate. We were given a glass of a champagne as we boarded and cabin crew took coats and such away. The Upper Class seats (even on the older plane) are great, and being able to sit reclined with your feet up during take-off is a big plus.  A nice touch on the older A340, but not carried over to the A330, is that the footrest of the Upper Class seats has a seatbelt and can be used as a seat to allow people travelling together to eat at a table facing each other, rather than in their own little 'pod' which isn't really conducive to chatting with your co-traveller during the flight. Interestingly on the A330 the clip was there, but not the belt itself, so I wonder if these have been removed for some reason. You can, of course, still sit there - but not if the seat belt sign is switched on.

They could not find her locator, I even had the Delta app showing time to check in, as the return flight was on Delta from Tampa to Atlanta. Virgin had to wait for Delta counter to open, and 10 mins before the gate closed, a paper ticket and boarding pass was given (written one). Therefore if you can't find your reference go early.

I found their service no better than any other economy flight. The queue at Havana was ludicrous. They lost 12 passengers in the tiny airport.  A vehicle broke down so they couldn't push back. Announcements on the new aircraft were inaudible. But my main gripe relates to their service at the call centre. We had to return 2 days early because of a family bereavement. I phoned the call centre and explained the situation. I was advised there was space on the earlier flight but the cost needed confirming so I would get a call back within 15 minutes. My calls cost £1.50 a minute from Cuba. After half an hour of waiting I called again. A different person advised that the cost would be an extra £150 per head. But I could claim this back if I presented a copy of the death certificate. I duly if grudgingly agreed and gave my credit card information. Then I waited for 12 minutes listening to music while they tried to get the ticketing team to confirm everything. At £1.50 a minute, which I had told them. Finally, ticketing said it was a weekend, so there would be a further £15 per person to pay. If I didn't agree, I couldn't travel on the earlier date. So I moaned, and agreed.  The helpful assistant told me to ""have a nice day"" and signed off. At Havana, no one knew about the change, so when I finally got to the check in desk, having queued for an hour, we were escorted to the airline office and, thankfully, some helpful sympathetic local reps sorted things out - the UK office had forgotten to process the payment so we were not on the boarding list. Not good customer service. Not helpful or understanding or sympathetic. And yes, exploitative and greedy.  I will avoid them wherever I can in future.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

The service was excellent, attentive yet not intrusive and unlike BA the cabin crew remained awake during the flight. The food quality was pretty good, I only ate breakfast choosing to sleep not eat on the night flight. My only gripe is the seat quality, the flat bed style is ingenious, the way it tips forward to become flat. However, it is just a flat surface, like lying on a table, even lying on top of the mattress protector and duvet didn't soften it much.

It was a horrible flight experience and I arrived in Hong Kong feeling dehydrated and exhausted. The flight back was slightly better though freezing cold most of the night. A lot of people had coats and scarves on the whole way. I can't comment on the food as it was a night flight and I don't eat at those times but there were cooked breakfasts on offer.

When my son arrived at the airport he was told they could not find his booking and as it was with Virgin, Singapore Airlines couldn't access the booking details to find out what the issue was. When I was eventually able to contact Virgin customer service in the UK (I live in Australia) they said it was an error on their part that had cancelled my booking weeks previously and hadn't contacted me. My son was left stranded at the airport and had to return back to my apartment at our expense. I had to claim back the cost of the original ticket and book a different flight. They still can't tell me why this happened, wouldn't pay taxi fare as my son didn't ask for a receipt (as he wasn't expecting to get turned away at the airport!).

Boeing 787,Business Class,2.0,January 2017,1.0,4.0,nan,no,London to Hong Kong,1.0," |  London to Hong Kong return. The worst business class product I have experienced. Virgin Atlantic has a number of good points but they all end the moment you leave the departure lounge. The herringbone lay out slots you in like battery hens, there is no privacy and the seat converts into a narrow, flat, hard and uncomfortable bed. The seat is badly designed if comfort is the objective. Also, despite being a fairly new aircraft it is already getting very tatty with chipped facials and inoperable tables, duct tape already in use. Add to this cheap food (the menu from HKG to LHR offered bass and chicken thighs) served to an inflexible schedule by an indifferent, impersonal crew didn't help. The overall impression is that Virgin Atlantic has down marketed their product to around premium economy whilst maintaining prices. The product compares unfavourably with Emirates, Etihad, Virgin Australia, Malaysia, Asiana and even Vietnam, with whom I flew last year at half the price but with twice the comfort. I fly regularly to Australia and this review relates to London to Sydney via Hong with the second leg flown with Cathay Pacific. The difference is huge with Cathay offering a genuine business class service. I look for reasonable comfort and decent meals so that I can arrive relaxed and rested. Virgin Atlantic has a truly awful product that is the sort of business class that you would expect from Ryanair, if they offered one- cheap, cost cutting, passengers crammed in with little regard to comfort and service. The same poor standard was applicable to both outward and inward flights, both overnight travel. Avoid Virgin Atlantic if you are looking for a premium class airline - it is 2 star at best in it's so called Upper Class.

The morning of my flight just hours before my taxi was due to come, I received a text which woke me out of my sleep informing me that the flight would be delayed 1.5 hours and my new ETA time. Annoyed, I rang the taxi company who were happy to change pick up time. Arrived at the airport and waited to board flight. We were supposed to be boarding at around 11.50 - 11.50 came and went. I asked the airport staff for info and was told that the plane was delayed coming in so that we would have to wait. The flight time came and went, no update on the board, still showing a boarding time which had long passed. Had to go to the airport info desk again and was told that there was a technical fault and we would have to wait. In this time no one from Virgin Atlantic made an appearance, no idea of new ETA time, and the airport info desk barely knew anything. I ended up having to call Virgin Atlantic customer services twice for information, which I find appalling considering I was right there in the airport and all it would have taken was for a Virgin Atlantic rep to come and say something. All in all delayed 3 hours. I understand flights have issues sometimes but the lack of communication was very frustrating and disappointing. Luckily the plane was half empty so as soon as we took off the guy next to me moved seats and I had both windows seats to myself which was nice.  I will be flying Virgin again in 6 months so hoping it goes well.",Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0
nan,Business Class,3.0,December 2016,1.0,3.0,4.0,no,ATL to LHR,3.0," |  Atlanta to London. I've long been a fan of the Virgin brand and was a loyalist to Virgin America before it was recently acquired. Yet, after this trip, I'll be canceling our Virgin Atlantic credit cards, spending our frequent flyer miles (on Delta) and never flying Virgin again. I was willing to overlook the somewhat worn and wonky parts of my seat. The meal table wouldn't close completely, the seat was coming apart at some of the seams and the entertainment system was a near nightmare to operate properly. It didn't register half of my touches and with the ones it did, often scrolled far past my desired choice. However, I empathize with a system that was years ahead of its time; it's due for a usability upgrade and I wasn't going to bemoan it's '90s-like tacticity. Had the problems ended there, I would have smiled and moved along. Typically when I fly long distance, I arrive with a belly that is so full, it aches. So this time, flying business class for 11 hours, my wife and I decided to skip our daily meals and await the veritable feast that was to befall us. This belief was reinforced by the amazing looking menu appropriated to my seat before I even boarded the plane. I chose carefully; a salmon tartare starter and the ""Deconstructed Beef Wellington"" main. I was salivating at the thought of them and sadly, still am (I'm writing this from my very seat shortly after the meal). Not long before my meal was to arrive, the stewardess informed me that they were ""having problems"" with the meal options and that the beef was not going to be available. My alternatives were nowhere near as appealing and I ended up settling for the linguine with prawns. When the starter came, it was basically a salmon version of tuna salad. This was a far cry from the description and yet I wolfed it down because I was so hungry. Unimpressive, yes, but there was room for correction, as to be completely fair, the cheese roll served before it was delicious. My main was an example of every way not to make pasta and prawns; everything was soggy and tasteless. And while I've been taught to never waste food, I couldn't stand to finish even the second bite. A bit later I took a trip to the restroom, where I had to hang out in the galley, as it was occupied. It was there where I observed a list of the meal selections for passengers on the opposite side of the plane. Several of them had the ""Beef"" listed next to their names, with one near the back of the first class section crossed off and replaced by ""Seafood"". That caused me a disgusted chuckle. You see, when I originally booked this flight, I put my wife and I at the rear of the business class cabin, in a desire to have additional privacy. Weeks after doing so, we had a plane experience where we were denied our choice of food because it was chosen by too many people seated in front of us. So I relocated our seat selections for this upcoming flight to rows 1&2 of business class to ensure that such a situation would not befall us again. Having experienced this before, I was already glancing around the plane when the food came out. The guy behind me by one row and across the aisle (but still on my side) had the beef meal served to him. So it would seem that they selectively chose me to not receive my desired meal. Here I sit in a $3,000 plane seat in the dead of night; hungry, angry and restless. The polar opposite of what one is spending three thousand dollars to feel like.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Great Lounges and the Upper Class Wing at LHR, but once you get on board (where it really matters) the offering is simply appalling. The herringbone layout just does not work. It is claustrophobic and narrow and you are stuck with crossed feet sticking out into the aisle to be knocked by every trolley or passer by. The lie-flat bed has to be converted by the crew which is then like lying on an ironing board, which once you realise, you have to call the crew again to make it back into a seat. The experience was made worse by an inexperienced crew, poor food and an overheated cabin. Never again.

Upgraded to Premium Economy at check in and glad I did having looked at the economy cabin which was reminiscent of charter airlines in the late 1980s - cramped and just not suitable for a 12 plus hour route (14 hours on return from Hong Kong). How Virgin Atlantic think their Boeing 787 economy cabin is acceptable for a long haul route is beyond me. Premium is also expensive for what you get. Slightly wider seat, footrest, glass of something fizzy (definitely wasn't champagne, despite what I was informed at check in!), wider arm rest and access to their very uninspiring ""wander wall"" which offers a very limited selection of snacks. Compared with Singapore Airlines A380 or Cathay Pacific 777 on the same route, Virgin Premium economy on the 787 is a rip off becauae it feels like normal economy on Singapore or Cathay. On both SQ and CX you get decent legroom and recline and access to the rear galley for snacks etc (and a greater selection I might add!) so I would rather fly economy with them than waste money on Virgin Premium Economy in future unless they change from the Boeing 787 to a more appropriate aircraft for what is after all, firmly a long haul route that demands passenger comfort. What has happened to Virgin? I used to regularly fly economy to Japan on their A340s and it was always excellent. Far cry from this recent 787 experience.",Business,1.0,nan

Going to South Africa our flight was canceled and rescheduled for the next day (OK - that happens) but the lack of ground staff to assist passengers, the misinformation, and lack of planning led to anger and frustration. How can you walk passengers around Heathrow for almost an hour not knowing where the bus is that you've arranged to them up to take them to their hotels? How can you not load the plane with enough food for the flight? And why won't your computer system work to generate new boarding passes? Why make passengers load a plane you know doesn't have clearance to land in South Africa and make them sit on the tarmac for 2 hours? We arrived at Jo'burg hoping our return journey would not be as stressful. Well guess what? the return home has been more stressful. The flight was delayed leaving Jo'burg because we were told by the captain that they were hand loading the baggage (conveyor belt broke) but much to our surprise only 50 of 300 bags were loaded onto the plane. We were only informed 30 minutes before landing in London that most of the bags were still in Jo'burg. The minimal (only 3 agents) Heathrow ground crew were less than helpful and would only say that they didn't know whose bags were on the plane and that we would have to wait until we got to LAX to find out the status of our bags. Well the service at LAX was even worse! At LAX there was one woman to assist. We waited in a queue for over an hour to file a claim. The woman wrote down the wrong information which I corrected with the baggage tracking personnel the next day. However, they still did not get it right. Bottom line is it is now over a week later and they still don't know where one of our bags is. The lack of customer service this airline has is why I will never fly with them again.

We are surprised that almost a month has passed and we have had no apology from Virgin Atlantic with regards to our delayed flight.. Our flight was due to depart  18h55. We checked in with plenty of time to spare and went through passport control and did some shopping. We went to check what our gate number was to find that the departure time was flashing from 09h55 to 10h55 and back and we realised that our flight had been delayed. We battled to find someone to assist us and was directed down a corridor to a door which we had to go through. If there were no other passengers to follow we would never have found the door through which we needed to go. There was no announcement and no staff to assist us. We had a very long walk through the terminal all the way back to arrivals where we were instructed to fetch our luggage and proceed back to the departures terminal. My husband is over 72 and he took a lot of strain having to walk all that way. Still no Virgin Atlantic staff to assist us or give us an explanation. All the passengers had to then stand in a very long queue and wait, and wait and wait. Still no explanation let alone an apology from any staff. Slowly news filtered down the line that we needed to go across the parking lot and wait under the “pink” light for a bus to come and collect us and take us to the hotel. By now it was raining - there was a row of “pink” lights in the overhead walkway from one building to another. Which pink light were we supposed to wait beneath? We waited on the pavement for a while and a Heathrow staff member told us that in order to catch the bus we were in the incorrect place and showed us where to go. The passengers that were there, traipsed through a walkway to get to where the buses were due to arrive. Another Heathrow worker told us we were in the wrong place and directed us back to where we were in the first place. We no sooner got there when a Virgin Atlantic staff member arrived and advised that we were in the wrong place and directed us back through the walkway again. After some time the coaches finally arrived and we were transported to our hotel. We had to then queue again to check in. By the time we had checked in and gone up to our rooms it was already 21h00. There were quite a few young mothers with babies that were in tears. They did not have enough formula or nappies to last them till they got home. I take it that these mothers were assisted as far as this was concerned. But to have people put under such stress is no joke. We had been at Heathrow since 15h00. We were told that we would be collected at the hotel at 08h00 for departure at 10h55. We arrived back at the airport and once again had to queue. After a very long time, and no movement in the queues we were told that they were off line and that we would have to be checked in manually. At least the staff on duty that morning were full of apologies – I guess better late than never. We were finally checked in and boarded the plane.

I booked this trip on Delta website and have always been happy to use the Virgin Atlantic codeshare for this route previously. I always found Virgin's onboard service and cabin environment marginally better than Delta's, but not this time. I have travelled enough over the years to not expect too much, but still want at least a meal on board, especially on a reasonably early flight from the eastern seaboard. What we actually received was a joke. Firstly I and my son chose the xmas dinner, but it was no better than a TV Dinner and quite disappointing. My wife's was even worse in as much as she wasn't able to choose an entree as the catering service had not delivered enough food to cater the plane. Not really what you'd expect from business class. Granted it was xmas day, but that is no excuse. The crew tried to make up for it by giving my wife a bottle of champagne when we departed the plane, but Virgin should really have made adequate arrangements for a full cabin. I also couldn't use the 'sky bar' as there were 4 or 5 other passengers monopolizing it for most of the duration and the cabin crew weren't really in a position to ask them to vacate. On top of all this the cabin temperature was stifling hot and none of us could sleep. On arrival I also had to endure a fairly significant wait for my priority tagged bags while a good amount of untagged bags made their way around the carousel. Not exactly Virgins fault, but does make a mockery of the priority tags. I've flown enough over the years and these kind of events hardly ruined the trip, but they are annoying none the less and I would question my decision to use Virgin on this route next time I have to fly to UK.

The extra width of the seats made it much more comfortable for both of us, and my wife slept quite well.

After learning that I had lost the extra legroom seats, I proceeded to see if it was possible to upgrade my tickets to a premium economy seat. It was at this point that the real problems and frustrations began for me. Initially, I spoke with Singapore Airlines to see if I could do this, as I had previously been able to purchase extra legroom seats directly from them. However, they told me that I would have to speak with Virgin Atlantic as there was ""nothing that they could do"". Therefore, the next day I called Virgin Atlantic to ask if it was possible to upgrade my seat to Premium Economy, either with Airmiles or by paying the upgrade price. I was told that due to a ""System Issue"" Virgin Atlantic were unable to see the seat availability on the Singapore Airlines flight and that they were sorry, but there was just ""nothing that they could do"" in this respect because of these issues. It was suggested that I could speak directly to Singapore Airlines to see if I could do the upgrade through them, and so next I rang them again. Singapore Airlines told me that there was availability in Premium Economy, however, because my ticket was booked with Virgin Atlantic, Singapore Airlines were unable to do anything with that ticket, and I was advised to go back to Virgin Atlantic. I explained about the ""System Issues"" that Virgin Atlantic were having, but I was told that there was nothing that could be done. Next, I called Virgin Atlantic again and told them that I had spoken with Singapore Airlines, and that they could not help me, but that they did have seats available. Virgin Atlantic again told me that even if this was the case, they could not sell me an upgrade because of the system issues, and that Virgin Atlantic had to be able to see the seats to be able to perform an upgrade. They were sorry, but there was ""nothing that they could do"". In mild desperation, I had one final conversation with Singapore Airlines about this, which was of course completely fruitless. And again I heard the sentence, ""they were sorry, but there was nothing that they could do"". However, I was given a glimmer of hope and told that I would be able to purchase an upgrade at the airport when I checked in for my flight. When we arrived at the airport, I went to the ticketing desk to ask if it was possible to upgrade my seat. I was greeted by a very disinterested woman at the desk to whom I explained my situation and why I was there, and that I wanted to purchase an upgrade on my ticket. She firstly had a look and confirmed that there were premium economy seats still available before then looking at my booking and apologising and saying that there was ""nothing that they could do"" as the ticket was issued by Virgin Atlantic and that I should speak to them.

The lady at the desk just replied that there was ""nothing she could do"" and perhaps I could try calling Virgin Atlantic. This was 70 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave! I suggested that perhaps she could call and speak to them as I had already spoken to them on numerous occasions with little avail, but she gave me an excuse that they could not make international calls.

There is a distinct lack of storage space around your seat. I've flown with other airlines that have this type of seating configuration and I quite like it but the Virgin Atlantic offering is not as good as Air New Zealand, where there is more storage space and pod space so the cabin feels less cramped. Overhead lockers are only on the window sides of the aircraft. There is enough space and it does give the cabin an open feel.  Didn't get my first choice of main meal which was a bit odd as there were only four of us with that choice on the stewards list. The chicken was ok, but not what I really wanted. Speed of service was a bit on the slow side. What the service really lacks are the little touches like chocolate with your coffee. On the plus side the staff, on the downside storage space feels a bit cramped compared to other premium cabins but still better than BA. On balance would travel with Virgin Atlantic again if they were offering a flight on a route I wanted, but would look at alternatives based on price. Lacks the wow factor I was hoping for with the Virgin brand.

Boeing 747-400,Economy Class,5.0,January 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Gatwick to Orlando,3.0," |  Gatwick to Orlando. First time with Virgin Atlantic for 28 years. Paid extra for exit row seats on the upper deck cabin, a good choice. Friendly crew, tasty food, generous with the wine and a good selection of music on the IFE made the nine hours pass reasonably quickly. Only downside was that the seat, being narrower on the exit row, induced 'numb bum' after about six hours. Overall though, an excellent flight.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
A340-600 / A330,Economy Class,5.0,February 2017,1.0,3.0,3.0,yes,London Heathrow to Lagos,3.0," |  London Heathrow to Lagos return. I paid extra for a seat with more legroom (A340) and I needed it as I am tall. Aircraft was fairly clean although there was evidence of bits of food etc near the base of the seat. Departure was on time, flight was satisfactory and crew friendly. There is a menu card which reads as if the food would be rather tasty, but the actual food bore little resemblance to the menu card-por quality, small portions and very plain. Return flight was on an A330. This time I selected an aisle seat (standard). The seat was very narrow and there was no legroom at all. My knees were up against the seat of the passenger in front of me. This is where Virgin Atlantic deserves some praise. Before take off I spoke to a member of cabin crew and she noticed that I could only just squeeze into the seat in terms of height. After take off she returned to my seat and upgraded me to Premium Economy. Crew do not have to do this and it something that is greatly appreciated, and makes you think that the cabin crew really can improve the image of the airline (she was the senior person in charge of Economy and Premium Economy). Unfortunately the same elaborate menu appeared - this time it was a lunch menu. I did not expect Premium Economy food and that was fine, but the meal again hardly resembled the wording on the menu and was dreadful. Departure was on time and we arrived early-so a mixed bag, but full praise to cabin crew.",Business,3.0,nan

I was in economy but my seat was fine not too hard like some can be and at 6""6 I didn't struggle for leg room so that was a bonus. The plane was newish and cool, well air conditioned without being freezing, and the food was great; nice touch offering an ice cream late in the flight. But what really set this flight apart was the attentive and personable service the British based crew provided, not just to me but to everyone within my ear shot. These people seem to genuinely like us and appeared to really be into our reasons for travelling to NY; great to be asked but better still to be interested. They couldn't do enough for us and I was blown away. Well done, too often I get disinterested, tired or bored service and Virgin was a very welcome and refreshing exception.",Business,4.0,4.0
nan,Premium Economy,1.0,March 2017,1.0,3.0,5.0,no,Johannesburg to London,1.0, |  Johannesburg to London Heathrow. Having flown to America with Virgin Atlantic on a number of occasions I was very disappointed with this journey. Leg room was nowhere near as good as on previous flights and the seats themselves were very uncomfortable. The footrest under the seat in front stopped me being able to move my feet forward and when that seat was reclined I was trapped - unable to move my legs at all - for a 9 hour flight! But apparently I was on the Boeing 787 and very lucky to be on such a marvelous plane - the return flight was just as bad and I had an armrest held together by sellotape! The return flight was delayed by an hour because the flight crew did not arrive on time! No apology was made this and the crew obviously did not want to talk about it. The food and service was mediocre at best so thank goodness for the entertainment system which was first class!,Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

The crew were very well presented and friendly. Although I could have had more to eat, the low-fat meals I ordered in advance were good - dinner out of Miami especially. Breakfast coming into Heathrow was a bit skimpy; but I am glad that I did not have the ordinary breakfast, which seemed to include an over-the-top pain-au-chocolat - many people did not eat that.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,April 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,San Francisco to Manchester,1.0," |  San Francisco to Manchester. I paid a good bit more money than I needed to, as I get older I need more comfort and price is no longer the only indicator. I hadn't know it was to Virgin since they've knocked down costs and therefore I got the same and worse than I would have on a cheaper airline. I was fooled into thinking Virgin would be better. No way. They announce at the beginning, in their own fashioned wording, not to expect a full service airline and that alcohol would be served very much in moderation. It came true, just two alcoholic drinks were given on this 9.5 hour flight. I'm no drunk, but please.  Then the food - a tray of food so small it would feed a 12 week kitten. Three pieces of chicken, 2 tbsp of packet mash and 1 tbsp of kale. You get as a starter a mini bowl of leaves and carrot. No oil, no vinegar, nothing. You are expected to eat it all dry.  No bread, cost cut. Hence no butter. Two teeny crackers and when I say small, I am talking 1"" by 1"". A portion of cream cheese. That's it. Four hours into the flight I was starving and 8 hours in we got breakfast. . Mini bowl of fruit with say 6 chunks donated to neighbour who was ravenous. Yogurt was full of fruit. I got a cold croissant. A mini cup of coffee which being in the last row was also cold. I asked for anything else and was curtly told there was nothing, even though some pax were given a mystery foil wrap with a blue line on it. The most pathetic array of nothingness I have ever witnessed on a flight. Now to the IFE. Nothing I wanted to see but had to choose something, but the jack was broken so it crackled in one ear permanently and the other ear came on and off every two or so seconds. I then put my own earphones in which changed nothing, but because the jack is on the inside of your seat rather than facing outwards, and with their being zero room to move, that snapped off when I stood up, my £30 earphones bust. I left the plane starving and ate in T2 arrivals. An unbelievable airline, you'd think it would be great, but just the same as the budgets if not worse. Plus Wi-Fi was amazingly expensive but can't recall how much. Never again, take a full service airline like Emirates or Qatar Airways etc.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

After checking out the cabins behind Upper Class, the Premium Economy looked far more comfortable than Upper Class was. The business class seat is confining  with deep narrow walls and inability to even turn over under the seat belt. On top of all that even in the upright position the seat was so confining that you had difficulty reaching buttons, controls or even the tray table. The IE was fine and certainly comparable to other airlines. The cabin crew were mixed but below expectations in a business level product for this one flight. The most impressive experience was the ambiance in the UC Club lounge",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 787-900,Economy Class,4.0,April 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,London to Los Angeles,3.0," | I have many fond memories of flying Virgin in the past, but I had read some rather negative reviews online recently. I also had poor experiences of flying on a Dreamliner with other airlines recently. I much prefer flying on 747 aircraft. I was therefore quite reluctant to fly with Virgin from London to Los Angeles, but as they were £300 return cheaper than BA, I would have been a fool not to have flown with Virgin. Having paid to reserve seats, Virgin suddenly changed the aircraft without telling us and we had to re-book the seats. However, they re-booked the seats for free. Check in at Heathrow was not bad. I only had to queue for about 20 minutes. The aircraft was quite pleasant when I boarded. They offer you a bottle of water as soon as you get on, which other airlines do not really do. Being a very new, Dreamliner, the aircraft was very clean and stylish. The seats are quite narrow, however, and there is not much legroom. That is why I prefer the 747. The seats are also quite hard and the head rest is a bit uncomfortable. I really liked the fact that they give you a menu early in the flight. That is quite rare for economy class. I also like the fact that they give you a hot flannel. Food and drink is served promptly. The desserts are really good. The food is generally very good, but the lemon salad dressing leaves a bit to be desired - a small problem! The tray table is not great. It is small and the food tray slides down it. You have to hold your food container in your hand. The inflight entertainment is pretty good. They have a lot of brand new movies, buy they do not have quite as many films as you may find on other airlines. You are given an ice cream and then a toastie and then afternoon tea as the flight progresses, which is quite generous. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The flight back was also very good and I liked the fact that they give you an amenity kit with eyeshades. This is not something you often see in economy these days. All in all, Virgin are as good as they ever have been. I was impressed by the flights. They are excellent value for money and I would recommend them.",Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0

A340-600,Economy Class,5.0,April 2017,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,London Heathrow to New York,5.0," |  London Heathrow to New York. Having not flown Virgin for a long time but having enjoyed it previously we were a bit concerned about some negative reviews but any fears were groundless. There were no check in no queues at all at Heathrow and it was pretty much straight onboard - the crew were cheerful and the uniforms looked great.  The cabin and seats looked pretty good and classy. I'd booked emergency exit seat 31K which was great for an extra £45 - endless legroom (top tip - buy a £7 inflatable footrest and you pretty much have a comfy bed). My wife and daughter were in 35H & 35K which had enough extra legroom to be well worth an extra £40 each - pretty close to premium economy. The only downside is the AVOD which didn't work for the first 90 minutes and then has poor quality screens. The content is excellent so a shame that the viewing experience doesn't match it. They hand out iPads to those who get in first (perhaps telling about the reliability of the system that they feel the need to carry them) and the difference is marked. To their credit the crew (including the captain) did keep us informed about the problem and handed out vouchers to claim 4000 miles as we left the plane. The initial drink service was quickly and efficiently delivered followed by a warm towel - nice touch in Economy. Food with wine was also served in good time - I had chicken curry which was excellent. The only gripe was a strange lack of dressing on the salad - first world problem to be sure. As a treat I got us a £10 bottle of champagne each which was served with an appropriate flourish and in a glass flute - again nice touch. Bar a tedious check in delay of about 30 minutes at JFK the return was of the same high quality - bouef burgignon recommended but still no dressing on that salad! Landed early at Heathrow to wait an hour to get through passport control. Sigh. In conclusion we though that Virgin were excellent - fun, funky, engaged and perfect to top and tail a holiday. We normally fly BA and Virgin knocked spots off them in Economy - especially the crew. We thought the extra room seats were well worth it - it looked a bit grim in the 4 middle seats but 2x4x2 gives you plenty of scope to avoid it. Also being at the front of the cabin means early drinks, full choice of meals and first off. Point off for the low res AVOD - I'll let them off for the lack of dressing on the salad!.

A key issue is the cleanliness and hygiene of planes. I found gum which was pretty hard and stuck on the arm rest, crumbs, dust, hair and gunk on the floor, the fold up table was dirty. The touch screens touch function was compromised as the screens were smeared. The toilets gathered water on the floor during the flight and at the end was a large moving puddle. Customers should not do this and I feel for the staff who have to clean but it should have been addressed especially with so many kids using it. There is no clean up policy at the end so walking past rows there was just tons of mess everywhere. This was the first time using another airline other than Emirates. Great film choice though.

The Virgin Clubhouse is one of the best lounges at LHR, service was very friendly, meal to order I had a signature burger which was very nice. Lounge staff on hand to offer drinks or more food options. Boarding through Gate 20 was okay bit of a wait on the airbridge, once on board seated in 2A on a new looking Boeing 787, drinks offered amenity kit and PJs supplied. Meal orders including breakfast taken prior to take off, departed about 1 hr late however once in the air service including a light meal of beef was very good. Provided by a very friendly crew. I fell asleep for around 6 hours after service with the seat in recline so never actually converted the seat to the bed. Woke around 3 hours from JNB offered a coffee watch some TV before breakfast which was fine. Despite departing late the flight actually arrived 10 min early, bags where off within 20 min. I like flying Virgin and would use far more! I fly around 12 times each year internationally probabably around 26 flights a year in total, I use BA but to be honest if Virgin could do something with their Upper Class seats which face away from the window, they would probably get my business.

The ground service and boarding process for me was courteous and swift. I find the upper deck where I was seated is the most comfortable and relaxing. It is a 2x2 seat configuration with extra side storage if you are seated by the window. Even whilst sharing the upper deck with fellow passengers in Economy I found it not to be an issue. The beverage and meal service to be well timed and tasty. The entertainment options were plentiful to occupy myself for the 10 3/4 hour flight. Most of all, the two female cabin crew serving the Premium Economy passengers had presence and personality and looked like they enjoyed whatever they were doing throughout the flight.

I have wasted in excess of 2 to 3 days of office time over a period of 2 months trying to login into my account with no one in the IT backroom being able to 'fix' my account so I could use the 300K+ air miles in my account to book flights. No apologies from the IT office, who put the front of house team who are generally excellent into a terrible position with clients phoning in. Latest firago is that the 'computer' has moved my seats on both outward and return sectors to opposite sides and ends of Upper Class and again no one can fix this. It also made me 17 years younger, deleted all of my passport details, made my travelling companion to have no gender, wrong age and also no passport. I have travelled with Virgin Atlantic from the very beginning. Always loved both the flights, the lounge and the bookings staff. Now their customer service when booking over the phone is grossly undermanned - average time to answer is 10/15mins+ and the bookings staff are virtually powerless to do anything with regards to bookings made via the website.

You wouldn't get any of that with BA - unless it was an M&S meal deal at a cost! The IFE was ok if a little difficult to use at times - the touch screen either too attentive or not responsive.

But sure enough, I was able to book upstairs for our Gatwick to Orlando flight, despite not flying First or Biz class. The small upgrade fee to snag one of these econo seats upstairs is well worth it. Everyone we encountered from the gate agents to the flight attendants, were friendly and professional. So pleasant. Mostly I appreciated that they were not frazzled the way a lot of U.S.-based attendants I’ve encountered seem to be lately. Plus, VA’s stew uniforms are snazzy. Flight service, especially for economy, was excellent. Drinks (including alcoholic with no additional charge), a hot meal, afternoon tea service with sandwiches, hot towels, pre-boarding bottled water, blankets, pillows, headphones were all included and all very nice touches. The seats were comfortable, with better-than-average legroom and recline for economy. The 747-400 is grand old bird, but even after VA’s refurb, this plane feels a bit dated. If you’re someone who wants a spit-polished, 21st-century plane, this flight might not be for you. On the other hand, flying in an old 747 is like riding in a vintage Cadillac Eldorado.

Last year I booked my honeymoon to New York with Virgin Atlantic. 3 months later I found out I was pregnant and wouldn't be able to get married or go on my honeymoon as baby is due around the same time. Virgin Atlantic refused to give us a refund. Furthermore when I asked for miles or credit instead they also refused. The only option they offered us was to change our flight for a fee of £150 per flight. I explained that as I will have a new born not only can I not afford this but don't feel comfortable taking my new born to NY. I spoke on the phone and emailed to try to get more information from Virgin and to see if I had any other options. From February to May they refused to respond to any of my emails and hung up on me. Finally at the end of May I got through to someone who seemed reasonable. She offered us a change of date free of charge. I thought that is the best I can get. I called today to change the date of the flight and they said they can no longer offer a change of flight free of charge furthermore I told them the name of the customer service person I spoke to and was told to expect a phone call back. It is now almost 10pm and no call back from Virgin. All in all incompetent customer service. They don't respond to emails nor do they stick by their word and finally they don't call you back.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2017,2.0,4.0,4.0,no,Orlando to Gatwick,2.0," |  Gatwick to Orlando return. Inconsistent to say the least. Outward leg I could not fault & reviewed accordingly. Unfortunately the return leg will ensure I will not be travelling Virgin again. Not turning this review into vent fest just going to keep to the facts that irked me so! Firstly comfort was an issue, I get its a night flight and passenger in front had seat back before the seatbelt sign went out! & never put into upright position during meal and nothing said. Even 15 minutes to landing I looked around to see where the crew were as tables still down with rubbish from breakfast and they were still chatting away in jump seats as they had done whilst discomfort continued felt so claustrophobic as never before on any flight. Lights could not be dimmed due to fault which made it difficult to sleep. But my biggest annoyance came when we arrived back in Ireland and no bags! The tiny regional airport we transferred to had 1 carousel and no baggage desk so I rang Gatwick to find where bags were. The woman I spoke to was unbelievably rude and unhelpful to the extreme. She kept trying to redirect me to a baggage desk that did not exist! & pawn the blame on Aer Lingus (who incidentally were fab & as it turned out not to blame). I told the lady that 5 cases did not transfer and for peace of mind I just wanted to know they were at Gatwick she told me she wasn't at Gatwick so I asked could she then make a phone call to the handlers as I did not have that number and had called the Virgin number for baggage queries and then the conversation got strange as she again said she could not help no apologies for inconvenience nothing! no open disclosure here! I asked what was the point of the service and telephone number provided for baggage queries if she could not assist in anyway and she told me I had got personal to which I replied politely not to flatter herself as all that concerned me was where my families luggage was and why Virgin were so appalling in providing assistance after 18 hours without sleep I just wanted to know were the bags in Gatwick or Orlando. I can emphatically state that at no time was I rude abusive or raise my voice (which took great control under circumstance!) yet she hung up on me! Got bags back 2 days later, apparently a common occurrence if transferring to Ireland, Virgin just don't bother transferring bags over after gone through customs leaving onus on connecting airlines who are getting mighty peeved with this regular practice. Last part of my complaint is the main reason I would not travel with Virgin again. Travelling with my autistic son he had his sennheiser noise cancelling headphones which had to be taken off for landing. We were in upstairs area of aircraft & waited for everyone to clear before getting off. I thought another family member had put headphones into bag and vs versa and of course they weren't put back into his bag. Contacted lost property & they were not handed in & was met with attitude again from another Virgin staff member in rudest of can't be arsed manors that it was my responsibility and this would have been announced re belongings. Yes I get it, it was my responsibility by proxy to ensure we left with said headphones but these things happen however the way I see it is one of two things - Cabin crew are not doing job correctly and completing post landing security check as it would have been discovered or dishonest staff kept for self either cabin crew or cleaners.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
A340,Premium Economy,5.0,July 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,New York to London,3.0," |  New York to London Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic is small with a small fleet of aircraft and many are very outdated. On their web site for Premium Economy (which we paid for) they say they have a great entertainment system, great meals, wifi, in-seat power, etc. They also give their seat dimensions. Okay, you do the the bigger seat. But that is all. The remainder of the amenities listed were unavailable on our flight. The entertainment system was, first of all, down on our outbound flight (NYC to LHR). The attendants rebooted it over and over to no avail. They then gave us small iPads to use (they obviously know their system is unlikely to work). When the built-in system (VERA) did work, the screens were so bad you couldn't see. The flight attendants called them ""rubbish"". Good word choice. The meal going to LHR was extremely meager (we are not big people and don't eat a ton and we were starving). On the return flight you get both lunch (for us this was a tiny salad, about three tablespoons of chili and some lukewarm rice, which is one of the best ways to get food-borne illness so we won't eat it). We brought our own sandwiches aboard and were so glad we did (on a $1200 flight?). They did serve a nice ""tea"" service before we landed. We were not offered anything like earplugs or eye covers, although their web sit says those are on hand. I brought all of this to the attention of them. They offered us a tiny number of miles as compensation, used the ""old equipment"" excuse, and basically just made it worse. We'd considered upgrading for a sum over 600 pounds each way to their upper class. So glad we didn't do it - the equipment was so old it would have been a total disappointment. If you are going to fly VA, be sure what aircraft you are on. Other than the slightly larger seat (definitely not as big as a business class seat), the other things they are promising are definite ""maybes"". Due to our experience and their terrible customer service, we won't fly them again. Lots of other choices going to London!",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
A340-600,Premium Economy,4.0,May 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,no,New York JFK to London,2.0, |  New York JFK to London Heathrow. After the last time we flew with Virgin I said never again. But I had a voucher to use so decided this time to go in Premium. Check in was fine at JFK we got to our gate for our flight and waited to board. We were one of the first but after a while it started to look like chaos at the gate as we had to take a bus the gate. Since we had priority boarding we got to go first. It was an older A340-600 and showing signs of its age. The seatback pocket in front of me was ripped as there was a lot of stuff including water shoved into it. Staff on board were friendly. Once we took off the man on the front row decided to recline his seat and it crushed my knee. Now im only 5 foot 7. We could not see the TV on the back of the seat either once the seats were reclined and this was a day flight so meant 7 hours of boredom and pain. I think his seat was broken and reclined more than it should. The crew told me this was a spare aircraft which isn’t used often. Our return flight was much better on the 787. We wrote to Virgin customer care and all they could offer my wife was a £100 voucher. To be honest after this I don’t think I want to give them another go. Terrible customer service.,Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

The plane I was on we outdated, and the screen had odd controllers, the one at my seat didn't even work properly. The food wasn't good, and the staff was rude. I sat at an aisle seat and would constantly get hit by staff running down the aisle. One of the staff knocked over someone's drink, and it was sitting on the tray, and rather than cleaning it up then asking if they would like another they kept going and the person had to clean it up themselves. In contrast to Delta where ""Thank you"" is followed by ""You're Welcome"" I did not hear those words come out of the staffs mouth once. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

Remote gate boarding at Manchester due to work on the gate area despite this boarding was good and dealt with in priority order. Nice welcome drink on boarding we were seated in the upper deck seats were comfortable with plenty legroom in premium economy. Food was good main meal served then a pasty snack half way followed by afternoon tea prior to landing in Vegas in addition several drinks runs were made by good friendly crew. IFE good choice but screens were old style (not touch) with poor definition and in need of upgrade or its time for Virgin to send some new planes to operate the Manchester routes. Return trip IFE newer touch screen type which was a big improvement (same old 747 400 aircraft) crew again good only issue no hot breakfast serve before landing only a continental offering, this smacks of BA like cost cutting.

I made the decision to fly Virgin Atlantic Premium Economy because my experience with Virgin America was one of the best experiences I had ever had flying. The Virgin America staff was attentive, enjoyable and personable. I was suprised not to have the same experience with Virgin Atlantic. I was very disappointed in the outdated planes. The decor, technology and safety video was sad to say the least. The description online indicated the ""wonder wall"" would be available. I was embarrassed when I attempted to request a drink at the bar, assuming it was just a outdated version of the ""wonder wall"", being told it was just for upper class. I would recommend advising customers when a flight does not include this service. I would also recommend to ""take a page"" or two from Virgin America and update your technically, the ambiance of your cabins and more informative staff. In the future, I will be booking Premium Economy flights with better rated airlines.",Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0

Flight was delayed because some paperwork was forgotten to be signed by the captain and we had to return to the gate when in the queue of taking off. The meal service was great with one main meal, afternoon tea and a drink service at the middle of the flight. Everything was delicious, and I didn't feel hungry at all during the flight. The A340-600 was a very old model with old entertainment system. Seats are really narrow although legroom is normal. There are entertainment boxes scattering the plane under the seats in front of you and it's really hard to avoid them as some literally occupies half the size of the room under the seat. The entertainment system was ok but I found the movie selections not really great. When the front seat leaned back, I could not see the bottom half of the screen due to position and quality of the screen in front of me. Overall I would fly with them again.",Family Leisure,5.0,5.0
Boeing 747-400,Premium Economy,5.0,June 2017,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes,Gatwick to Orlando,4.0," |  Gatwick to Orlando. Flew on the outward leg of the journey in the upstairs cabin. As we were flying with our baby, we had the front row upstairs. Welcomed on board with a drink and a member of cabin crew giving us a belt for the baby and explaining the sky cot to us. Seat was a good width and quite comfortable. The tv was a tad awkward to remove from its stowed position. The IFE was really good woth the touch screens being present. Played a few games which others on the flight were playing too so aiming for the top score added to the game. The food was ok. Have had better however no complaints and the post dinner brandy was a nice welcome. The only issue I had was that the baby change toilet was located downstairs. I know not an issue for everyone but it played a big part for us. Flight went withiut issue, arriving on time. Only issue I have is it is now a free for all to get off the plane. Previous flights it was business and premium economy let off first. The flight back was again on the 747. This time we were downstairs front row of premium economy. We much preferred this as there was more leg room and more overhead luggage room. Also for us, the baby change toilet was right beside us. Although the downstairs premium economy is a bit more open with more seats, we much preferred it as you only ever saw premium economy passengers where as upstairs, economy passengers were walking through to use the only upstairs toilet. The IFE on this aircraft was the older style and not touch screen but still a good selection on offer. The food on this flight was nice and tasty but breakfast was a bit of a let down. The cabin crew were the ones who made this a great flight. Very helpful with the baby and even carried her around the plane and played with her a few times. This flight restored my faith in Virgin Atlantic. Aircraft looking a tad tired and just looked like it needed a good clean and brightened up but I am not sure how long the 747's will be used for so they may look like this for a while yet.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Busy throughout flight with drinks, treats etc. The lunch I really enjoyed, tea would have prefered chutney in sachet/pot to give choice. Entertainment choice excellent.

Outbound crew were outstanding in their customer care. Return were good, however this probably reflects short night flight means they under tight time constraints on drinks/meal service to maximise potential sleep time for the passengers. The only bad is aspect is Virgin's arrogant view that it knows what passengers want to listen to music at night club noise levels while boarding and disembarking. This amounted to nearly an hour leaving LHR (problems with last bus), nearly an hour leaving BOS (problems with paperwork), nearly half an hour arriving at LHR after waiting half an hour to find a parking space.

I had heard a lot about virgin Atlantic previous to my own experience during this flight. I have to say, contrary to all the marketing and publicity their service is pretty low class. I do not expect a lot from economy class, however having travelled in economy class with other airlines this was the worst experience. The crew is very judgmental toward the passengers and i had a feeling they were always prepared to chin off any request made during the flight. It all started from the drinks, we were given a tiny pack of biscuits.  I  requested an extra drink, the crew said she will come back with the drinks, but never did. I requested a drink again and was told we are going to serve food soon so was not given any further drinks at all. I am a vegetarian, so I requested a Veggie meal onboard the flight, to my surprise, she said, ""i dont have any more veggie food left and there was only chicken left in stock"".  Finally after serving everyone on the flight she came back to me with a veggie meal. When she handed me the veggie meal, she said to me that ""Next time book your veggie meal in advance"".

Boeing 787,Economy Class,4.0,October 2017,4.0,4.0,1.0,yes,London Heathrow to Hong Kong,4.0," |  I did the round trip from London Heathrow to Hong Kong. I haven't flown Virgin Atlantic for a few years, but having experienced shockingly bad service from British Airways I thought it was time to look at other airlines. Virgin Atlantic have always been a good option and I was really curious about their new 787. Service wise, Virgin Atlantic did not disappoint. The staff were helpful and the food was pretty good. What I didn't like was as follows. The policy on personal luggage. I had to empty out 2kg of my possessions from my small case because it was over weight and put into my backpack. I mean does that change anything? The dimming on the windows was a fail. Interesting concept, but in reality it was a nuisance. The dimming switch on the row in front broke and they had to cover it over with a plastic sheet and involved 6 members of the cabin crew. The headphone socket was on the seat back next to the screen. I found it hard to eat and listen to music etc. The onboard entertainment system is limited and I dislike having to watch 5 minutes of Richard Branson waffling before the start of a new film. The toilet seat can't stay up. The flights were on schedule and the service was good. I could live with a lot of these issues and I wouldn't have a problem flying again with Virgin Atlantic.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0

After flying with Virgin Atlantic many times, we were amazed at the poor quality of food and beverage. Nobody expects high quality when flying economy, but normally there is enough keep you going. There was no ""token"" starter or bread roll, the main meal looked as if it had been tossed around the cabin, and found quite uneatable, a sweet the size small eggcup and two children's butterfly biscuits for the slightly odd two bits of cheese, and that's it!! when pointed out to the staff, best we got was a shrug of shoulders.

All flights on time. First impressions on boarding were very good, the aircraft was pristine (as to be expected given its age) and the mood lighting very inviting. My seat was comfortable and had sufficient legroom for myself, I appreciated the movable headrest. Only negative would be that people are inconsiderate when they recline, but not really something specific to VS / something that the airline can change. Entertainment was vast and the system very responsive on both flights. In terms of service, the crew could not do enough for you. On the outbound there was at least four drinks services, a main meal service, ice cream, pastry service and then afternoon tea! Certainly did not go hungry! I can honestly say that the main meal was the best I’ve ever had in economy. On the return, the service was somewhat more reduced, I guess because it was a night flight. But the crew still did frequent water runs and were happy to serve drinks/snacks in the galley in addition to the evening meal and breakfast services. Overall, Virgin did a fantastic job on both flights and really put BA to shame. I redeemed Flying Club miles for both of these flights, and think the scheme offers good reward flight availability and reasonable taxes/charges. I will be using Virgin Atlantic for my next trip to the States in 2018 and would highly recommend them.",Family Leisure,5.0,4.0

Got a good deal on our Virgin flights so returned from Miami in Upper Class (having flown out Premium Economy). Got told with several others that my seat was not fully functional electronically but could be manually adjusted by FA's - this actually did not matter because the seat was in a very comfortable position, and could still be made up into the bed. Welcomed with glass of champagne upon boarding. Very comfy seat with decent video screen and the latest VERA entertainment system. Great team of FA's made sure you wanted for nothing. They also had time to chat with the passengers - so different from Economy or Premium Economy where the pressure is on to get the meal service out etc. Meal was OK - the steak was tasty but just a little overcooked - my wife's chicken curry was very good. Terrific full English breakfast about 1.5 hours out from Heathrow. The bed was a little narrow but comfortable and felt much better than the BA Business Class. Flight left Miami about 3/4 hour late (probably due to the problems with the seats) but actually arrived 20 minutes early at Heathrow. Great flight, great crew.

Nice to fly with them in Premium Economy again - plenty of room in the seats and a better product than BA World Traveller Plus. Decent (for an aircraft) meal and good FA's who were attentive with the drinks runs etc. Flight left about 1/2 hour late (paperwork apparently) but made most of it up so touched down in Atlanta nearly on time. Decent (for me) choice of films on the not-quite-the-latest edition of VERA, their inflight system. Flew back Upper Class from Miami (separate review done).

We were treated like royalty by a wonderful team of staff, food and wines were excellent (much better than we expected) and the seats were superb. Our return transfer Delta to Virgin also worked seamlessly. All 3 flights were marvellous and we would not hesitate to rebook. The only pity is that the upper class service does not extend to getting through US customs. Just 2 quibbles. The chevron seat arrangement in upper class is a bit odd. We both had window seats which meant that we had to knock on the window to speak to each other. We would probably preferred to sit opposite each other but were not given the choice. There is a vast music selection available but you have to scroll slowly from A-Z to see it rather than, say, select an artist/album. Not much to quibble about.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
A340-600,Economy Class,4.0,September 2017,4.0,1.0,5.0,no,Los Angeles to London Heathrow,4.0," |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Flight delayed 2 hours, missed connection in London, lost luggage, apathetic customer service. A pretty airline doesn't mean they do their job well. Virgin seems like a great airline - young, modern, and hip with an array of features on their late model planes. You feel good on the plane and the staff on-board is quite nice and accommodating. Food is tasty with good options to fit a variety of palates.  However, the excitement quickly died before I even took off with my Virgin Atlantic flight out of LAX. The flight was delayed for 2 hours. This in itself is pretty awful for any airline. But for a long haul flight to London's Heathrow Airport where most people transfer to other flights, this is the worst news. As expected, we missed our connection flight in London with British Airways. We arrived in Heathrow frazzled because the crew and support staff gave no help in getting us to the right desk to sort out this missed transfer. As far as they were concerned, their job was done in getting us to London and we were on our own. We got to a BA desk, arranged a new flight to our final destination in Milan and arrived their 4 hours later than we were supposed to. How could it get worse? Virgin and BA lost our bags. A traveller's nightmare come true. I felt disgusting having travelled for 16 hours and had no clothing to change in to or toiletries to bathe with. Why I give Virgin 1/10 is because their customer service took no responsibility for any of this happening. My complaints fell on deaf ears and they played the finger-pointing game of blaming British Airways for all of my issues. The flight left 2 hours late. That's a fact. I will not fly Virgin Atlantic again and recommend others to stay away. Most importantly, I cannot fly with a company that wont own up to their mistakes. I'd figure that we've gotten past this idea that all airlines are uniformly horrible and because of this, there's no catalyst for change. But airlines have become more competitive in trying to attract customers with better service and Virgin may look prettier but if they can't get the basics down (getting you to your destination on-time with your luggage), then I don't care how pretty you are - you suck at what you do.  If they can't get you to your destination on-time without losing your luggage, you shouldn't fly them. Simple as that. Don't even bother with Customer Service as they'll just send you canned statements and empty apologies.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

There was a little mishap with my baggage and I had to be pulled aside (because they were misplaced in transit) once I could confirm my baggage, they took me to the aircraft skipping queues, making up for the errors. Once on board my Economy seat had a blanket, pillow, a bottle of water, a flight kit which had things to freshen up with, pen, flight socks and a sleep mask. Very good entertainment system, easy to use. The dinner meal service begun right away, followed by tea/coffee, hot towels and then it was lights out for 10 hours. When we were woken for breakfast we got the same order, meals, drinks and hot towels. The meal options were good. I was sick during the flight (migraine) and the flight attendants were very accommodating. They checked on me every half an hour for the duration of the 13 hour flight.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Manchester to Orlando,1.0," | I last flew with Virgin Atlantic about 6 years ago when I made this same flight from Manchester to Orlando. My opinion then was that the service was good. However in those 6 years it is abundantly clear that there has been a severe lack of investment in the services provided by Virgin Atlantic and considerable cost-cutting affecting the quality and experience of this airline significantly. Meanwhile the price for the same trip has soared by some 25%. I would not recommend Virgin Atlantic over a low budget airline and in future would not fly with them. The response I received to my complaints to the company also suggest to me that there will be little changing in future. My complaint about Virgin was manifold extending from the quality of the meals provided inflight (particularly for those with specific dietary requirements), the decline in quality and size of the snacks provided, an entertainment system that is now out of date (and largely redundant) and the decision of the company to provide a WiFi service but to ask customers to pay to use it. The latter point being that through WiFi it is now possible for individual passengers to access far superior entertainment packages through personal subscriptions. Therefore why doesn't Virgin just provide the entertainment panel and provide free access WiFi to improve the experience of its customers? One would have thought such an obvious innovation would have been a well regarded suggestion and perhaps more cost effective than its current offering is. Alas, the airline appears to have stood still in a market place where it is now possible to find superior offerings from low-budget airlines at a fraction of the price charged by Virgin Atlantic. Based on the inflated cost of flying with Virgin Atlantic, the major decline in the quality of its service, the continual normalisation of miniaturising food and beverages and attempting to justify this as progress towards a healthy society (thanks nanny state), I have decided to score Virgin with 1/10. The fact that it has a customer services department that actually did respond promptly to my complaints I will recognise. Nevertheless in light of my complaint I had thought that Virgin Atlantic, at the very least, would attempt to compensate me for my experience. Yet they didn't even bother with that form of tokenism.

Wasted 3 days of my vacation chasing a bag that should’ve been on the direct flight.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,December 2017,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Gatwick to St Lucia,4.0," |  Gatwick to St Lucia in economy class, paid for extra legroom seats (a sore point, my partner is 6'7"" and does not fit in most 'regular' seats, yet we had to pay a total of £80 for the luxury of him not being doubled over). The aircraft is very pleasant, soft lighting, not too many seats per row. Cabin crew were some of the best I've experienced, very friendly, helpful, chatty with passengers, etc. The extra legroom seats were an absolute godsend. However, we were fairly put out about the fact that other passengers spent the entire flight trying to climb over us to get to the other aisle. There is a galley just a few rows down for them to do this, and it meant we spent half our time moving our legs for people. The cabin crew had specifically stated that this area isn't meant to be used as a walkway, so I wish they had actually enforced this with passengers as it disturbed the flight quite a bit, and it wouldn't have hurt anyone to just walk a bit further down (if anything it's better for the circulation to walk a few extra steps!). Food was fantastic, although they ran out of a couple of beverage choices less than an hour into the flight and didn't have any spare which seemed a bit short-sighted. Entertainment, a huge choice of films, TV shows, music etc, but (and I find this on all aircraft) the touch-screen TV was bad. So was the remote. In an age where touchscreen is now the norm, you'd think they would be able to get this right. Also, the wifi was down for the entire flight - not the end of the world but not what I expected from Virgin. Overall, a pleasant enough flight.

They give no consideration or sympathy towards anyone or any situation, unlike me, they don't care about loyalty. I booked a flight going from Atlanta to London and paid $7549 for business class. I spent 3 hours on the highway and missed my flight due to a car going up in flames on the highway. When I got to the airport the Virgin desk was closed so I went to delta, the agent was extremely helpful and tried her very best to get in touch with Virgin, when she finally got in touch they told her she could not touch my ticket and I needed to call them direct (even though Virgin operates through Delta from ATL and it's an actual Delta aircraft). The Delta agent let me know there was another flight leaving in an hour and 45 min and it had plenty of seats available. When I called Virgin and explained my situation, it was like the agent did not care or even bothered listening, he told me there was nothing he can do because the ticket was booked through an agent. I was lucky enough to to get a hold of the travel agent I booked my ticket through who after a long wait finally got through to Virgin, they told him I would have to purchase a new ticket to get on the next flight and pay and additional $3k + $400 change fee. The agent was surprised they wanted me to buy another ticket given the situation. Finally we decided to rebook on coach as I had 15 minutes to check-in, for which Virgin still charged me $400. When I came back to to the Delta agent to check in she was absolutely horrified that after paying virgin $8100 I got an economy seat at the back of the plane while there were several business class seats available. She said that would have never happened with Delta. When I got to the gate to board the flight, the Delta agent there had the same reaction, I could see how bad they felt for me but again even this agent said that they are instructed by Virgin not to modify their tickets. So thanks Virgin for taking $8100 and giving me no lounge access and putting me on the back of the plane for 9 hours! ",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0
A320 / A340-600,Business Class,5.0,November 2017,4.0,1.0,2.0,no,Orlando to London Heathrow via New York JFK,2.0," |  Unable to checkin on line, could not get the system to work for us, Delta could not provide boarding passes for our Virgin Atlantic flight at Orlando or JFK. Delta lounge at MCO was fine. Flight to JFK was also fine, however had no warning at all that we had to change terminals at JFK (Terminal 2 to 4). Arrived on time at JFK, still not aware of the terminal change then there was a scrum of people trying to obtain information and then being directed to a transfer bus and taken to terminal 4, a trip of about 5-10 mins. Managed to get boarding passes for our transatlantic flight. Wasn't impressed by the Virgin lounge, seemed as though you have to order everything, no buffet, first time we have experienced this. Boarded our aircraft and suddenly realised that my Wife and I had been split up and were on completely different sides of the aircraft to one another whereas we had been sitting next to each other prior to that day. Not prepared to accept this we were just standing in the way of everyone else boarding with our cabin bags until staff could resolve the issue. It appeared that my Wife's seat had electrical problems (had been like it for several days apparently) and they moved her and upgraded someone into the broken seat, but didn't talk to us. We had paid a lot of money, 80% of business passengers on this flight were travelling alone yet they split up a married couple and what is worse they don't tell them! They did resolve the issue, eventually, another passenger moved voluntarily. Food was fine, aircraft a little tired looking with a media system which was showing its age and was slow. Staff excellent! I did complain and whilst I asked for a partial refund on the price of the tickets all I got was points. Not impressed with the whole shambolic experience, will think very hard before flying Virgin again!",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Dubai to London,1.0," |  Dubai to London. Disgusted to find out that after spending my wife’s 40th birthday in Dubai that Virgin Atlantic have changed the plane and separated us without any prior notification! We paid an extra £110 for more leg room, so to keep us with the extra room they have now separated us to other sides of the plane when we booked seats together. After calling customer services to get this sorted out, they said and I quote “we can put you together but you will lose the extra leg room and the money you paid for this! ",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

It was a day time flight and they control the windows and throughout the 9 hours we were sitting in the dark, when I asked I was very rudely told that because of entertainment. As a passenger we should have a right to have daylight. There was one meal served and when I asked for second drink glass of wine I was ignored. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

nan,First Class,5.0,August 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,London Gatwick to Barbados,2.0," | I was pleasantly surprised with Virgin Atlantic flying from London Gatwick to Barbados, largely due to the excellent cabin staff. I haven't flown this airline for seven years after a terrible experience but decided to take the risk as a good deal came up. The cabin staff were convivial and the food was absolutely fine and if there was a deal I would fly with them again. However, and this is a big however the planes are cramped and the layout truly dreadful. I cannot imagine who designed the upper class cabin which is constricting in every aspect. The front toilets cannot be used when the crew are serving food due to health and safety which results in people queuing for the toilets - something I do not expect to do if flying upper class - because of the high fare Virgin charges. I ended up getting dressed under my duvet as the queue was never ending for the toilets. The seats are narrow but comfortable when laid as a bed - but I am only 5ft 2 and small build if you were taller your feet would be hanging over the edge. On a day flight I would fly premium economy. That cabin boards the same time and at least you can talk to the person you are travelling with.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan
A330-300,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Gatwick to Tobago via St Lucia,1.0," |  Gatwick to Tobago via St Lucia. The cabin heating was not working. After 30m ins I asked a stewardess why it was so cold. They said that it took 20 minutes for any adjustments to take place in these aircraft and they constantly had to fiddle. After about 2 hours everyone had put on their jumpers, hats, coats and all spare blankets were taken from seats and lockers. After 4 hours all the cabin crew had their jumpers on. The only talk on the plane by this point was how cold it was. After about 6 hours I lost feelings in my toes which only came back after 20mins in Tobago. When we landed st St Lucia, the air con was still on and the heat from the open doors came in the cabin, turning the air on into streams of cold mist tumbling to the floor. A complaint to Virgin the following morning brought this reaction: “We’ll always choose a general temperature for the cabin that suits everyone, however, we can usually address individual customers’ needs by adjusting the temperature in that location or providing additional blankets. If there was a problem with the heating onboard, our crew would have also been affected and so would note this for the wellbeing of all future crew and customers onboard. However looking at the reports, there is no documentation of any heating issues or complaints being raised at the time.” So as you can see, it appears they know how serious this was so they are denying it even took place. Now looking at this chart below, how can I rate the problem? The cabin crew were great, although they lied about the problem, and everything else was great. Except the cold which was dangerously low. So I’m going to have to give zero for everything to highlight the problem. Maybe you can have another setting for cabin comfort?",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
Boeing 787-9,Economy Class,5.0,March 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Los Angeles to London Heathrow,5.0," | I flew Virgin Atlantic on my return flight to London from Los Angeles, and it was a pleasant experience. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful, the food quality very good and good selection of films, including some very recent pieces. The seat was comfy, and the plane modern whilst there was plentiful opportunitity to request for refreshments. My only comment is that WiFi should be free, given Virgin is a premium airline.",Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0
Boeing 787-900,Economy Class,4.0,March 2018,2.0,3.0,5.0,no,Los Angeles to London Heathrow,2.0," | Flew Virgin Atlantic from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Food was terrible, no appetizer/starter. They are getting very cheap with their food. Tiny portions. Seats hard. I paid extra for seat 47H with extra legroom. Otherwise it’s miserable. Crew Ok, they did a good job as they were short staffed. This airline is definitely all hype. Like many other airlines their economy product is get cheap and minimal and all the $$$ goes into the premium class cabin. Definitely not what they were a few years ago.",Business,5.0,nan
Boeing 747,Premium Economy,4.0,February 2018,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,Havana to Gatwick,4.0," |  Having arrived at Havana airport for my flight back to Gatwick, I quickly checked in a couple of minutes (though the economy queue was very long). However, I found boarding to be haphazard with no clear sense of direction and very few instructions from gate agents. Fortunately, I was able to get on relatively quickly and get to my seat, 22H, on the upper deck. The seat was very wide and in theory had a reasonable amount of legroom- though, when passenger in front reclined, it was certainly not as roomy as before. The VOD system was great with quite a few options, though perhaps not as amazing as some of the Gulf carriers. The service was fairly good with the flight attendants attentive at all times. On the other hand, the food was disappointing; there wasn't that much choice and it lacked sophistication. The beef bourguignon was incredibly oily and I even felt bad the next day. The 747 is very noisy and prevented me from sleeping at times during the night- I hope they will be phased out in the future or made less noisy. Once we had landed, the pilot came out of the cockpit and had a bit of a chat with the passengers, which was a nice touch. While I certainly preferred Premium Economy, it didn't impress me to the extent that I would pay extra again, especially on the main deck where PE is still in a 2-4-2 configuration. In addition, I would endeavour to fly out of Heathrow in the future as the service and aircraft is much better on those routes.",Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0
