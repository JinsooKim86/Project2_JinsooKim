nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,LGW-JED-RUH on April 26 2014. Business. FlyNas is the low cost carrier of Saudi Arabia and recently added intercontinental services and enhanced cabins to its range of domestic and regional routes. I flew from London Gatwick to Jeddah with a connecting flight to Riyadh. The aircraft had been full on arrival at London but the passenger load was very light returning to Jeddah. As a result the level of service was terrific with a high ratio of crew to customers on board a very clean and smart A330-200. Business passengers can use Fast Track at Gatwick and have access to the Aspire Lounge. The seats are angled lie flat and very comfortable for a six hour sector with large pillows provided. The on board entertainment was supplemented by iPads with new release movies pre-loaded. Fares on FlyNas are lower than the full service flag carriers when booked well in advance and this was reflected in the meals which were average served in economy size foil trays with none of the fuss or flourishes of the five star Gulf airlines. This was fine for the price paid. Saudi carriers do not serve alcohol but there was a good range of soft drinks. An afternoon tea was also served not long before landing. The Saudi experience apart from the customary reading and blessing at the beginning of the flight did not really begin until King Abdulaziz Airport because the aircraft and entire crew is Portuguese hired from HiFly. They worked very effectively in both English and Arabic and were hard-working and friendly. The connecting FlyNas flight to Riyadh was a very typical low-cost service on board an A321 fairly tight for space full to the brim with purchases available from the trolley. Seating is allocated and there is the option to buy extra leg room or a larger seat at the front of the cabin but flights between the main cities in Saudi Arabia are not longer than a couple of hours so a standard seat was fine.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,RUH-JED. Check in at Riyadh Airport was ok staff helpful boarding pass says a certain gate however the screen stated another gate. Flight delayed almost 45 minutes but were not informed screen was still showing on time. Plane was ok looked a bit tired crew seemed helpful. Seats looked old I don't like the leather seats but it seems a Saudi way of expressing luxury. It is a pay for service airline so didn't expect much space between rows is narrow and I felt the seat itself is smaller than regular airlines was not really comfortable but for a short flight was ok. Upon arriving in Jeddah couldn't find the belt for luggage however we finally found it but with a different airline logo and different destination.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,"RUH-JED return. Check in a breeze no queues staff efficient but a few smiles would not go astray. Boarding quick new A320 with 29-30"" pitch. Interior clean new looking pay for service was good value if not limited. Flight on time and bags on the belt within 5-10 minutes. Both flights full and cheep and cheerful at only 390 riyal about 70 euro - cannot go wrong with this service especially with no hidden extras (bags go free no issue with hand luggage etc). One negative was the safety on landing but I think it s just a middle east thing - why do passengers get up and start taking bags etc from the bins when the pilot has not turned of the seat belt sign at the stand? Cabin crew do not ask people to sit down.",nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,RUH-JED. Another good flight with Nas Air. The flight left on time was not too crowded and an emergency-exit seat was definitely appreciated. The Arab and Eastern European cabin crew made an effort to seat us comfortably serve promptly collect rubbish and smile throughout. While the plane was old (it seemed to be a second-hand ex-Spanish Airbus) it didn't have the tired feeling of many other discount carriers.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"RUH-JED. Flight cancelled before hand but only told when arrived at the airport at 5am for 6.45am departure. Promised seats on 10am flight but refused to check us in when we tried at 9am as there were ""no seats"" customer service policy seems to be to lie and then go off duty and let someone else sort it out! Rude and clearly incompetent not sure they know how to run an airline.",nan,1.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,JED-RUH with one of the new Saudi discount carriers Nas Air. I had booked a super-cheap airfare for about USD $30; unfortunately I did not read the fine print and after the cab driver taking me to the wrong terminal at King Abdul Aziz Airport in Jeddah I ended up being five minutes late for the 45 minute boarding time... and Nas has a strict 'on-time' policy. I was a bit annoyed that five minutes seemed to make the difference between my getting the flight and not but I guess I agree with the rule in general. As a result I ended up having to return to my hotel in Jeddah for another night and booking another flight the next day. This one wasn't so cheap - but still quite reasonable at about USD $90. When I finally did fly I thought the airline was good for the price. The older Airbus 320 needed a new fit-out; the seats were tatty and overall the cabin looked quite old. The seat pitch was very bad but I have experienced that on other discount carriers like Jet2 and easyJet so I expect that. The stewardesses seemed to take forever to get to me with their drinks and snacks cart (all for purchase) but then seemed to whizz past a whole few rows without even offering us anything to eat or drink! Very odd. Luckily I caught them on the way back. The stewardesses otherwise were reasonably friendly I have flown Saudia before and thought that Nas Air attendants were nicer. The level of English of one of them wasn't so good but I noticed that they were Arabic speakers - which I don't think is the case with Saudia. All in all I thought that the airline was okay - I would fly them again for the price they are charging.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,April 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Jeddah to Riyadh,nan, |  Jeddah to Riyadh. They simply announced that the flight is 5 hours delay and no other option than wait. Without suggesting putting us on another flight or other company or even lunch or snack voucher or anything like respectable companies do! First and last experience with these people and would do my best not to recommend.,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,April 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Islamabad to Madina,nan," |  I wanted to travel from Islamabad to Madina for Umrah with my family. Obviously they offer cheaper option so I googled it to find out whether they accept umrah passengers? The response to qurry was in affirmative so I booked from the website using credit card. Nowhere during the process I was alerted or warned about anything. As I reached the airport before departure, I was told at check in counter that I was not permitted to travel on Umra visa through flynas. I returned home to process modification or refund. The website does not offer any option to launch complaint or cancel the booking. I contacted customer servive at Saudi Arabia where I was told that Flynas does not offer refund as per policy however, they will offer me credit for subsequent travel on flynas for which I should call next morning. I called customer service centre again next morning. I was told since I had booked on website in light category so airline does not offer any change or cancellation and my money of almost $1100 stands wasted. I was also told that cancellation is offered only to the passengers travelling by business and first class. It is shocking that people travelling by economy (light or premium) class are otherwise underpreviliged and even they are made to suffer by skimming their money. So an extremely miserable and tortourous experience with the airline. It does not warn u before booking your journey. Lures you with cheaper offers and subsequently grabs your money. Completely shocked once customer service centre told me that we have grabbed your money and have no way out for you. Never choose this flight.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,1.0,February 2018,nan,1.0,1.0,no,Dammam to Jeddah,2.0," | My flight was canceled on arrival at the airport and I understand these things happen. The staff however were very unprofessional and don't care about their customers. Just a (sit down there and wait for the 9.30 flight). No apologies or explanation, nothing. The 9.30 flight was now jam packed and I was told to move from my seat I booked and asked why. I was told to get off the plane if I do not move. I will move if they give me a proper answer but this was ridiculous. I will definitely not fly these airlines again.",Business,3.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,nan,September 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Jeddah to Riyadh,nan," |  Jeddah to Riyadh. My flight was supposed to be 1200 but I'm still in the terminal. Because of delay. What makes me upset are that they never made an announcement about this delay and they removed the flight info from the electronic screen so we have no idea when the adjusted departure time. Because of no announcement and no info, all of us have to proceed to the other gate to ask Flynas ground staff and the way they answer me is so rude.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,April 2017,nan,4.0,nan,yes,Riyadh to Dammam,4.0," |  Flew Riyadh to Dammam with Flynas. On time departure and good service from online check-in to boarding. The A320 aircraft was fairly new, clean and ticked all the boxes for a one hour domestic flight. Crew seemed reasonably friendly and courteous. A good low cost airline with reasonable prices.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,February 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Jeddah to Riyadh,1.0," |  The flight from Jeddah to Riyadh was diverted to Buraidah due to a bad storm and weather.  My complaint is that the stewardesses refused to offer coffee or tea even though I offered to pay as per the Nas Air policy. They became very rude. Many frustrated customers were complaining, but the staff were not interested. ",Business,2.0,nan

One of the worst airlines, last week my wife and two daughters traveled by Flynas, They charged for meals but they didn't supply even a glass of water during the flight. When my wife check with crew of cabin they no apologize but said today their company couldn't supply passengers meal and soon will refund the money (meals). However, until now no refund. They attract people by saying the slogan of Cheap flight, when it comes to domestic its no longer cheap when compare with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Terrible service.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,February 2016,nan,1.0,nan,no,DXB to JED,2.0,"Dubai to Jeddah with Flynas. Seats are okay, and the staff is okay. We had a stroller / baby cart. When we got out of the plane, they didn't take out the stroller. It also did not come out with the rest of our luggage. We had to wait good 45 minutes for Flynas representative to get to his desk as he was on a ""10 minute break""? Finally, he informed us that the stroller is in the other terminal. There is no way for them to bring the stroller to us, so we had to go to the other terminal by a taxi and get the stroller ourselves. This cost us 2 hours and; 100 Riyal extra as the taxi driver had to wait for an hour for us to finally find our stroller. Why couldn't they bring the stroller out when we were getting out of the plane or even send it through the luggage area. Would never recommend this airline.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan
