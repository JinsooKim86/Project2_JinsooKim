Wearing the same clothes since we flew on the 27 July 2018. Said they were able to deliver the luggage 29 July but it was just a word with no meaning.  My family including my child having really hard time without our stuff. No empathy, Very irresponsible I will never recommend for anyone.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Plane was not full, and cabin crew were largely professional & polite. There is room for improvement for the entertainment system, with lackluster movie options and only Indian music on offer. Dinner and breakfast were served on this red-eye flight - Food was standard airline fare. Departed on time & landed slightly before schedule.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

While the 1st leg was operated by a much more spacious B787, this leg was operated by a smaller and more cramped A320. Flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of aircraft. Only lunch was served on this afternoon flight - food was largely average. Surprised to find no inflight entertainment on board despite Air India not being a low cost carrier.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,4.0,July 2018,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Coimbatore to Mumbai,5.0," | Air India was actually excellent to my surprise, and heavily contrary to the views I have heard about it. I am a Star Alliance Gold member, and hence I was lucky to board with Business Class passengers. I thought I would fly with Air India in a domestic flight and it was great for Air India to join the alliance as passengers like me want an opportunity to accrue miles from star alliance flights. Check in was smooth, ground staff were courteous and kind at Coimbatore Airport and they even gave me a lounge pass for me and my mother, although there was no Air India contract lounge in Coimbatore Airport. Boarding was smooth and in a sequence with priority passengers first. Also, the crew greeted us well and the aircraft had clean interiors and clean lavatories. Food was excellent too. There's no Star Alliance carrier in North America (United/Air Canada) that offers complimentary meals on a domestic flight. Also, the legroom was excellent, especially for a person who is 6 ft 4 inches. The crew were very kind to offer my mother a blanket and some medicine when she felt sick. Overall, I enjoyed it. Hats off to Air India and hope they improve more even further! Only thing I suggest is at least provide in-flight wifi either for free or for purchase to not bore passengers.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

My family and I had to wait for more than 3 hours because the numbers on our tickets didn’t match theirs, even though we were still on their list of boarding passengers. Our tickets were issued from Turkish Airlines since we had a connecting flight from Istanbul, Turkey to Mumbai and then to Ahmedabad. We have previously dealt with this same situation when we were going from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, but when we called Turkish Airlines and explained this situation in front of the Air India staff, we were immediately given our tickets. However, this time, we had to pay for our tickets again. Air India was simply cheating us by making a huge deal out of a small mistake that they themselves have made with our tickets. We had to pay double the amount for our tickets only to recieve the same treatment and service. I would rate Air India zero stars if I could. I will never board Air India ever in my life.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

The web check in worked well and so was able to print the boarding pass in advance without any technical issues. The flight itself was a pretty full flight and the flight was delayed by 40 mins which was a tad disappointing but of no real consequence. The crew and staff were very friendly and courteous and were quite prompt to respond to requests. The seat was quite comfortable with great seat pitch which has to be one of the biggest plus points of the carrier. During the flight breakfast was also served which was good and filling followed by tea/coffee. Touchdown was very smooth and the disembarkation process and retrieving baggage was no hassle. Would not hesitate to fly again.,Business,4.0,nan

They didnt let around 20 people to board the flight even when we were on time. They wasted our time so that they can mark us late. They wont even refund your money The worst part is they wont even let you exit. Even after cancelling your flight they got problem with you exiting the airport. There are other competitive flights with customer friendly staff. I would prefer to use other airlines to avoid all the drama.,Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Traveling for first time with Air India on international sector and I think this is the worst of all flights i have taken internationally. Unfriendliness of staff is  seen even before the flight has taken off. On top, they seem so rude. I am traveling with a 6yo and every other flight I have taken so far with my son (Delta, Air France, unites, Lufthansa, American Airlines) have been so friendly and helpful but it’s a different story here. Plus the flight seems so uncomfortable. It’s so hot, on asking they have been asking to wait since half an hour now. My son has asked for water 3 Times now but alas no one is listening us.

It all started when airline agent didn't check the baggage through to the final destination and I had to pick up the entire lot (6 bags) plus 2 hand luggage, baby changing bag and the laptop bag also while handling a toddler. Add to that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours from Delhi to Birmingham and the onward flight from Birmingham to Belfast missed. Had to wait for several hours before some lady with half information and no patience booked a hotel for us to stay overnight and booked the next flight at 18.45 next day (even when there were 3 other flights from the same airline available at earlier times). Add to this, we were kicked out of the hotel by 12:00 forcing us to go to the airport 7 hours earlier and spend time with a toddler till the flight came. Flight was delayed by 25 min...(fortunately it didn't get cancelled) and we reached our destination 24 hours later than planned. Worst airline, worst service and absolute indifference from the staff.",Family Leisure,3.0,2.0

The transit in New Delhi was quite easy and seamless. Food provided on both the flights was pretty decent for an economy class. IFE is very good. It has a huge collection of bollywood movies.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,AI 675 Mumbai - Kolkata on 17th January 2015. The aircraft an A320 was in excellent condition. It was spotless and the seats were very clean and so was the entire cabin. The crew were excellent always smiling and helping the guests. The seats provided extreme comfort with ample leg space. The only suggestion that comes to my mind is AI should make sure that they change the menu because the last time I flew AI 675 in Nov' 2014 the same breakfast was served (Non Veg). The flight was extremely comfortable. The return leg was on 23rd January 2015 (AI 775). The flight was delayed by about 90 minutes however I have no complaints because AI kept informing me through regular calls and texts about the exact status. The aircraft used in this leg was an old A319. The seats were torn and in some cases even the back rest was not upto the mark. I don't understand if AI can use their 787s in other domestic routes why not in the BOM-CCU sector? If not then why can't the A319s be replaced with the A320s which provide much better comfort. This is just a suggestion as I love flying AI. I would also like to appreciate the fact that in spite of the flight being delayed by 0 minutes we were served dinner on board. The dinner was excellent. Last but not the least I'd like to request AI to please reintroduce the entertainment system for the domestic sectors also so that we can enjoy the flight even more.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,AI607 Mumbai-Bangalore on January 3rd. Flight was delayed but not so much by Indian standards. Plane was very very old. It felt like going back in time with some seats requiring quick repair before take off. Flight was a little unpleasant also because of the strong turbulence and a bunch of young crying kids. FA's were a little rude at times but always available. One very good thing is that a proper meal is served in a flight that is just over an hour long. While not my favorite I would still use them for flights within India in the future.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,5.0,BOM-DEL-FRA: Domestic sector was served by a mediocre A320 whereas International sector was with 787 usual. Surprisingly both the sectors went smooth as compared to my first experience (read below). The crew were polite and accommodating and breakfast served on domestic sector was tasty although tea and coffee was like black water. International leg had only 30 passengers so was a very light flight. Crew made an exceptional job with very polite rounds of drinks lunch snacks and special plum cake served always with smile and were more than happy to serve larger portions. The younger crew made all the efforts to make flight comfortable by dimming the window and switching off unwanted TV screens and always attended passengers request. AI 787 Dreamliner have great legspace that beats all European Airlines although AI should urgently update their entertainment system. Just one tip AI should make more efforts to keep aircraft clean as they are brand new though looked outdated and dusty carpet. This flight was a great experience and looking forward to served in similar manner.,nan,4.0,nan

Maintenance seems poor and seats dirty as well as hard though space is good. Very poor staff service and as remotes are broken you can't call attendants - deliberate? Toilets are very dirty and we ran out of toilet tissues. Had to remind staff. No cleaning of toilets as on most other airlines. Staff are lazy. Some exceptions but did not make up for non attentiveness. Could not believe poor movie choice - latest movies were two years old and most between 5-10 years. Issued good headphones but I used my Bose and relied on my own entertainment. We usually left late and the plane system is very poor in showing estimated arrival time. Food was poor. Was expecting some dinner and got served a snack which was terrible. Suspect I picked up Delhi belly on flights as well despite using my own hand cleaner. Will only use them as last resort. There are many better options. Use at your own risk.,nan,4.0,nan

We had a very short trip from Udaiper to Mumbai. The flight arrived late they did try to make contact about this but the email arrived after we arrived in Mumbai. My main issue is that the stewards seemed to be totally indifferent towards their customers which I found to be unusual.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,AI120 26th December. Arrival at FRA – discovered we could use any of the LH business lounges. Arrived at terminal A so used the brand new A lounge for a couple of hours (had a 6hr layover). Then took a trek to terminal B popped in to the lounge for an hour or so. Similar layout and food. Reception staff very pleasant. LH lounges are pleasant enough good selection of drinks food is at best minimal and quite uninteresting. WIFI is good – easy connect and quick enough to video skype. The B lounge is right next to the gate so it really is a 1 minute walk. No calls though and the monitors only show the boarding times so be careful! We strolled to the gate to find we were the last to board. Greeted very politely by the crew issued new boarding cards and shown to our seats which were taken. The interlopers were swiftly moved on and we sat and made ourselves comfortable. A choice of drinks was presented along with a hot towel and some eye masks. The crew were really nice a mix of ages and all were very pleasant courteous and helpful. Cabin décor leaves an awful lot to be desired but the seats are spacious and very comfortable. Not as garish as some of the pictures but definitely not easy on the eye. No sooner had we levelled off then the crew came round offering pre-dinner drinks and shortly after this it was time for dinner (it was a late flight). Flight crew arrived with cotton tablecloths and served either a chicken shashlik or prawn curry served with the usual naan rice and vegetables. Vegetarian options also available. Prawn curry was yummy. Washed down with a decent red wine. Slept the remainder of the flight to Delhi. 2nd Sector Delhi transit is a right PITA. Slow cumbersome numerous passport and boarding card checks. Eventually made it through (luckily at the front of the queue – if you had a short transfer you'd be in trouble). Lounge is pleasant. Except for some building work going on just outside. WIFI is incredibly difficult and awkward to connect to. Couple of PCs available. Didn't eat whilst we were there so can't comment on the food. Found a couple of recliners and slept for an hour. 10 minute walk to the gate boarded and departed right on time. Again the crew on board were really pleasant and very attentive. Mixed ages again. Greeted with drinks and hot towels. Limited movie choices. Again the food choice was limited but what was provided was delicious. A decent white wine this time and copious G&Ts combined for the next important stage of the journey – sleep! Seat is again a proper lie flat. Padding a bit thin but if you sleep on the duvet they provide this cushions the seat cover. A thin blanket (also provided) is enough as a cover as the cabin is warm. Got woken about an hour or so before landing and had a really nice chicken biryani for breakfast. Bit odd but not much else to choose from. Landed smoothly but unfortunately no priority bags on arrival. Not a big issue but would have been nice. We consoled ourselves that the bags had arrived at all. Overall – great value great staff delicious food very comfortable flight on time and safe. The whole experience was surprisingly pleasant and I would use them again.,nan,5.0,nan

Flight from New Delhi to Melbourne delayed in 1 hour increments with no final departure time given. Air India ground staff had no idea when the flight would eventually leave and weren't bothered about it either. After about 5 hours in an attempt to force Air India respond to the situation the other passengers began physically preventing the one remaining ground staff at the gate from leaving and then blockading the other Air India gates in the terminal to prevent boarding. By this tactic several other flights were delayed amid lots of shouting and chanting of slogans. Eventually a crew was taken off a Hong Kong flight to operate the one to Melbourne and we departed 9.5 hours late. The on-board service was mediocre and the IFE not fully functional on two flights. The seats folded into a horizontal flat bed (B787 aircraft) and were quite comfortable.

Surly cabin crew who had a feeling that they were doing a favor to passengers. On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation. With this kind of flight experience it is no wonder that most of the traffic on the Gulf routes from India deviates towards the Middle Eastern carriers.,nan,4.0,nan

Hot meal served on board. They ran out non-veg selection after a while and when queried by one of the passengers the answer given was that they had loaded more veg meals with the assumption that not many people would take non-veg on a Thu.

This happened on one occasion however due to my family members travelling on the same flight on different dates within the space of two weeks they also experienced the same delays for again no apparent reason. There is no communication from the airline and there is no concept of customer service. I experienced further problems on my return flight from ATQ to BHX on 15/3/15. My domestic flight from ATQ to DEL was fine on time and a pleasant flight all to become disastrous on my arrival to DEL at 11.20am. We (ATQ passengers to BHX) were left on board the plane as the plane was to continue on the BHX. The flight was due to leave at 13.15pm however this was delayed by over 2 hours apparently due to a missing manual which it was apparently unsafe to fly without. My family and I were left sitting on a plane for over five hours with no communication food and general ability to move around. On asking flight attendants for information and food both requests were denied. Bigger doesn't not mean better and this was most certainly the case with Air India.

I asked how that could be when I had a ticket for the 13.30 flight and yet it wasn't showing on the board. He then said that there was no 13.30 flight and that there wasn't nothing he could do. I was looking at eight hours in Delhi airport. No apology no explanation. I then asked where the left luggage store was that is advertised on the airport website. He told me it did not exist. Staff insisted that I would have to check the bag at a cost of 30000 Rupees (£300). All staff were unhelpful and rude. Eventually a guy working at the suitcase wrapping stand told me where to find the left luggage store which is in the Metro station. I checked my suitcase for a week for 3500R - £35). Flight was delayed by another two hours - I arrived in Kochi at 1am and missed the beginning of my organised tour. Return flight was just the same - arrive at the airport flight doesn't exist. Not just my flight - lots of passengers had booked on earlier flights but simply been moved. My plane should have left at 4pm giving me lots of time for my connection at 3.40am. We were still sitting at the gate in Kochi at 10.45pm. We only got on the plane after there was a near riot and passengers insisted that the plane not be cleaned but that we should just be allowed to board.

But we were then held on the tarmac for more than 4 hours with no water and with two of the bathrooms out of order. We got very little information and crew did not push for our release. I understand the Chinese ground staff just didn't come but Air India has to fight for its passengers rights - more than 4 hours with no food or water! We could not use the bathroom!

Onboard: The crew served snacks and water but I needed more water I was searching for crew but couldn't find them. The crew returned after some time and served more food and drinks.

So that was decent of them but no apology for the delay and we lost half a day in India. Seats had uncomfortable cushions and were tightly spaced. Luckily the flight was quite empty so most people had 2 or 3 seats to themselves outbound. In-flight AVOD could be good but the touch screens were not working so well and the hand held device was worthless. Flight back was delayed by nearly an hour due to late arrival.

This happened on one occasion however due to my family members travelling on the same flight on different dates within the space of two weeks they also experienced the same delays for again no apparent reason. There is no communication from the airline and there is no concept of customer service. I experienced further problems on my return flight from ATQ to BHX on 15/3/15. My domestic flight from ATQ to DEL was fine on time and a pleasant flight all to become disastrous on my arrival to DEL at 11.20am. We (ATQ passengers to BHX) were left on board the plane as the plane was to continue on the BHX. The flight was due to leave at 13.15pm however this was delayed by over 2 hours apparently due to a missing manual which it was apparently unsafe to fly without. My family and I were left sitting on a plane for over five hours with no communication food and general ability to move around. On asking flight attendants for information and food both requests were denied. Bigger doesn't not mean better and this was most certainly the case with Air India.

I wanted to purchase some duty free products on board and I had to call the cabin crew, no one responded for nearly an hour, I found them chatting with their colleagues and when I asked for the duty free brochure list I was told, ""Sorry Sir, we are going to land in 45 minutes and the duty free shop is closed"".

Flight left on time, the service was friendly with many smiles, seats comfortable, clean cabin (don't know about the toilets), drinks followed by dinner was better than average, water offered every hour or so during the flight. The only negative is that the movies were dated - but I was okay with a re-run of Batman, which just about put me to sleep.

The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations.

Lunch, frozen curry, frozen salad and an ice cold bread roll, really appetising to say the least. The cabin crew warmed the meal up twice but it was still frozen.

Of course without even getting up, she concluded that there was not any place for me to charge my laptop.

nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,5+ hour Flight from New Delhi to Singapore started badly when we were seated in economy rather than the business class seats booked and paid for 6 months previously. Told they couldn't move us despite there being empty seats in business class. After a great deal of fuss we were moved forward. What a mistake - should have stayed in economy where the seats at least had a bit of padding and the service must have been better. No food served to anyone in business class but I assume you could have asked for it. Drinks offered once by a hostess that had difficulty with English so a red wine became a straight whiskey. After serving this the hostess and the cabin manager went to sleep in their chairs behind the curtain. In 40 years of travelling extensively this had to be the worse experience of any flight for comfort and service.,nan,1.0,nan

Flight was inbound from Seoul and even though we saw the plane for 2 hours + at the gate we were still late. Security boarding was extensive and a joke. Seat was broken but was found another. Flight attendants were grumpy. When we finally took off bar service started with tray table unceremoniously taken out in front of you with a bang. You had to have a drink no question. Then the food came. Was told prawn curry or vegetarian. No menu. No choice. It all came on 1 tray. Flight had not been provisioned correctly so 1/3 of business class got economy meals. Seat went back all the way to horizontal so I slept but cabin was freezing. Arrived in Delhi late. Disembarking the galley floors were flooded/cluttered which was awful. Transfer to connecting flight was badly handled. AVOD was a joke. It was very complicated and a choice of all of 4 new films.,nan,1.0,nan

Boarding was quick and well organised. Once onboard I found that no IFE available in this 5-hour flight so passengers were left without any entertainment except magazines and newspapers. Cabin crews were efficient however did not seem enthusiastic in interacting with passengers and hardly smiled. Call button answered promptly.

All flights on time check-in and embarkation monitored by cabin crews. All aircraft's clean modern and comfortable. Thanks to thin backseats the pitch seems larger than usual and to add to feeling of comfort the seats are equipped with footrests. Special mention to the Dreamliner brand new aircraft and serving several domestic destinations before entering service on international lines. The 'magic' stops here. No announcement given by captains. Average service from aircrews keeping a correct attitude and acting professionally. Food is below average both in quality and presentation. No menu given and on each flight almost the same choice of main course is proposed: vegetables or chicken with rice. Breakfast is very basic. All meals served in low quality plastic even picnic cutlery on long-haul you are afraid to break while using! Drinks are served before meals but take care as no drinks are served with meals (a mini bottle of mineral water comes in your plastic tray). AVOD delivers a basic but correct selection of classic and more recent movies Hollywood and Bollywood. All in all the AI product is simple the service minimum while acceptable as prices are on the low side. The food should really be improved and is not at the level one can expect from a flag carrier.,nan,3.0,nan

I couldn't get basic amenities like eyeshades and a toothbrush for a 15 hour non-stop flight! The inflight entertainment was ok but my screen didn't work half way through the flight!

Plane itself was nice and the food and entertainment was fine although not much in the way of films/games for children. Luckily we had done online check-in for the connecting flight to Delhi as well. I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later. For international flights AI is good but for domestic flights it is chaotic and staff are very unorganised. I would avoid Delhi airport if possible.,nan,4.0,nan

Plane was a new 777 and seats were very comfortable with a lot of legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good choice of English and Indian films. My only gripe is the lack of an Air India lounge for Business Class passengers at IGI airport in Delhi. It's unacceptable to send your premium passengers to a regular cafe with poor quality food and no WiFi where the staff are trying to charge you for anything they can get away with. Please Air India stop using Cafes at IGI and get yourselves a proper business class lounge with WiFi decent food and drink.,nan,4.0,nan

There was a breakfast service (the food was not bad) but they never came through an offered anything else - - nothing. The economy class had a second beverage service - but if you wanted something extra in business class - you had to ring your call button and then they would reluctantly come out of the galley.

Our buggy ended up on the belt in Delhi while we were in transit. Took us 90 minutes and a lot of frustration to find someone who could take the thing off and hand it over to us. Because of delay and short connection time the transit through the DEL airport was awful. Crew just dropped us of at the security check in the transit area and left us there. So collecting the transit passengers made no sense at all. The plane (B777-300ER ) was worn out and looked very tired. Our seats were very hard and uncomfortable. Meals were tasty but portions limited. No bread served. Only after take off a round with drinks was served. Once they served the food the crew disappeared and never came around again.

Wanted to try their Business Class and paid extra for the luxury on the DEL-BOM-GOI sector: very pleasant and very good service with tasty meals. On the way back it was Economy and cannot fault their service here either because the legroom was good IFE worked well and their catering was adequate. The dinner on the BOM-DEL sector was actually very good in Economy.

Entertainment: Of the 10 buttons on my console 5 were ripped out and so using the console was tricky. TV selection doesn't exist at all if your language is English movie selection is very limited.

There were 4 or 5 English- language movies in total but the TV choice was extremely poor - only Hindi language.

We had problems both on the outwards and return trips. I had pre-booked seats online - do not do this as it causes all sorts of problems which the airport systems seem unable to override. For example when we asked to change to extra legroom seats at the airport in Kathmandu - we were given a boarding card for the Delhi-London flight but in fact our seats had been cancelled - as we discovered when we came to board. We were bumped off the flight and forced to spend a night in transit hotel limbo.

The seats could have been more comfortable but a cushion between the back and the seat took care of that. The bottom line is that the flights were at least £150 cheaper than the nearest rival and so if considered as a budget airline (the long haul Easyjet) I have no real complaints. My main gripe was the attitude of the cabin crew.

There is a marked difference while flying them International. They use an A319 on their DEL-SIN route which is generally packed to capacity. Luckily I got upgraded however their business class seat is very poor. The recline is as much as that of their economy class seat and most foot rests were broken. There were PTVs but nothing was playing not even a flight plan. There was a snack served at take off (midnight departure hence I refused) which was the end of any service for the rest of the flight. A cup of tea had to be asked for before arrival at Changi. SIN-MAA on a tired A330-200. Flight absolutely packed. Service was quick and efficient with dinner served however I was very surprised that their bar only had beer or whiskey not even wine. Over head TVs showing a Bollywood movie with subtitles but terrible picture quality like they were running a pirated movie. Fares are cheap and you do get what you pay for.

Cabin crew were ok just done what they had to but call bells are NOT answered. I tried on 5 occasions. Inflight entertainment was average. Great if you like Bollywood movies. But some passengers screens weren't working. The transit in Delhi is a mess lack of organisation and going through security is chaotic not to mention the rudeness of the airport staff (not Air India's fault).

IFE was adequate for a two hour flight though it could do with a better selection. They also have an above- average inflight magazine that's worth a flick through.

MAA-SIN No boarding pass from MAA-SIN and no visa for India meant we spent 60 minutes of stress in no-man's- land while an AI staff went to get us boarding passes and clear our luggage through Chennai customs.

The food was actually better in quality and quantity than on Lufthansa which I took last month where the lunch was little more than a snack. South Indian hot breakfast and western main lunch course were both delicious. Flat seats on Dreamliner very good and Caire amenity kits which have more goodies than European airlines. I feel that Air India are missing some details and professionalism to make them really world class. For example the movies are not the latest and the entertainment system not intuitive The chocolates after the meal are of mediocre quality the male cabin crews uniforms look dated but generally the long distance product is not bad.

Air India said sorry that is only flight to Dubai so nothing they can do. They refused to transfer him to another airline out of Delhi to get him there on time.

To make matters worse we had booked this reservation through Travelocity.com so now we had a third party involved and they all blamed each other. Nobody at airport or their so called ""customer service"" number could help. My son stood at Air India ticket counter trying to get someone to help with no luck kept telling him to come back in an hour. He is now in Dubai and we need to start process all over again.

However apart from the lovely Dreamliner plane (on 3 legs of Sydney - Bangalore return) I would find it impossible to choose to fly Air India again. My flight was 2 hours late leaving Sydney which resulted in missing the Bangalore connection from Delhi. The was no information re the delay in Sydney and that was the start of us passengers being treated really badly. Because of the delay many passengers had to stay overnight in Delhi. Again no information until we got to the baggage carousel. I missed morning appointments in Bangalore etc. Delays are common - speaking to passengers on my return trip their flight out of Sydney was 8 hours. If you have an onward trip from Delhi avoid Air India at all costs. The cabin staff service was variable - some were ok others had a really surly attitude. The ground staff were terrible rude without exception. The lounge in Delhi (which you would expect to be Air India's flagship lounge) was mediocre - wifi 'not working' showers 'not working' food/drinks not worth having.

The only reason I travel AI is because of its ample legroom for a person of 180 cm like me. And the reason I chose this flight was because of the cheap fares available (2k per head) on the domestic leg of international flights (this flight operates as Yangoon-Gaya- Kolkata).

There were no TV screens for this 8 hr long flight. Cabin crew just ordering and are very rude. There is no meal selection and they just ask whether we want 'Veg' or 'Non-veg' so you have to eat whatever they give you. Once in BOM I had to get the new boarding pass for BOM-EWR sector. There was a 13 hour transit so I was told that I will get light refreshments and the dinner (they wrote this on boarding pass) but didn't tell me where to get them. So after security check I was roaming in the terminal to find an AI agent but couldn't find. I went to their lounge and showed them the boarding pass and asked where to get their so called refreshments. The person let me in and asked me to use the facility. After sometime another person came in and asked me to show the boarding pass and invitation card. Then I showed my boarding pass and he said the lounge is only for invited passengers so I should leave in 5 mins and he said the previous person let me in by mistake. So I went out and was waiting for freaking 13 hours in busy crowded Mumbai airport. Its a horrible experience. BOM-EWR AI 191.

One Air India ground staff member announced that boarding would commence for rows 1 to 15 while another commented that boarding would start from rows 16 onwards. This obviously resulted in a confused queue of people. The welcome on board was pretty average however the seating (comfort and leg space) was just fantastic a luxury I had not experienced with other airlines lately. Only tea/coffee cookies and a bottle of water was served which is really appalling given that this is a 12:50 pm departure. Thankfully I had carried a sandwich with me as I had read about the cookies in another review.

My pre-ordered gluten-free meal left the crew somewhat perplexed and I was met with the response ""veg or no veg"" as an option. 'No veg' was nice enough however the chicken main contained only 3 small chunks of meat. The IFE was not on demand and the cabin was very hot and stuffy throughout most of the flight.

Upon check-in the officials insisted that our luggage had to be checked out in Delhi and checked in again when the final destination for the luggage was clearly stated as Amritsar on the luggage tags. The same happened on our way back. My 83-year-old grandmother was with me and she has difficulty walking so we requested for a wheelchair for her. Due to this we were the last to get off so that my grandmother had more time and could get off slowly. When we landed in Delhi from Singapore for transit there was a delay in bringing in the wheelchair and the female flight attendant who was apparently in a hurry to get off told my grandmother to walk out and wait outside the plane for the wheelchair. Domestic flight attendants showed more care and were very accommodating towards my grandmother. In-flight entertainment was not working to Delhi and there was no in- flight entertainment to Singapore on the old plane which was quite run-down. Our flight to Singapore from Delhi was on 16th Dec 12.05am and we landed in Delhi on 15th Dec after 4pm for transit. When we tried to enter the international airport the security officials refused to let us in asking us to come back 24 hours later as the date written on our boarding pass was 16th Dec. They refused to listen when we explained our flight was 5mins after midnight. We went to the Air India customer service counter where there were other passengers with the same problem. She simply told us to keep our boarding pass and show them our booking confirmation instead which we did and the security did not accept. The customer service officer refused to come out of her counter and speak to the security officials for us. We managed to enter the airport 3 hours later. We also had to request for wheelchair assistance again and the customer service officer told us to wait while she went to get the wheelchair. After making us wait for 40 mins she returned with 2 cups of coffee and no wheelchair. Upon entering the international airport there was a whole new problem with the Air India officials. On reaching Singapore we realised that there was no communication within Air India for the wheelchair assistance. The air stewardess instead told us off that we should have requested for assistance earlier which we did repeatedly. Overall the experience with them was horrible as they created inconvenience for us every step of the way but certainly eye-opening to see that their service could be of this standard.,nan,3.0,nan

However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight.

Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky).

No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers.

The food served onboard was good plenty of drinks extremely hospitable and wonderful flight hostesses. In-flight entertainment was excellent. Reached Delhi half an hour before the scheduled arrival. Had a changeover at IGI T3 New Delhi. The flight from Delhi to Mumbai was an average one with good food good crew but a little bit noisy people around. I would definitely repeat Air India in the future.,nan,5.0,nan

Aircraft was clean and the crew did make you feel welcome. Captain did keep us informed when we hit some severe turbulence as to how long it would last. I had heard some horror stories about flying with Air India but my experience was a good one.

BOM-LHR on 787 was fabulous very comfortable lots of legroom pleasant peaceful cabin except for one unfortunate air-rage incident which was handled very professionally by the cabin crew.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,I recently took 4 trips on AI 1 domestic and 3 international. They were in a word a nightmare. JFK-DEL is 15 hours. The seats had their cushioning removed the entertainment panel only partially worked on 1 flight and didn't work at all on our return flight. The flight maps did not even work on any of the 4 flights. Cabin maintenance (or lack thereof) made me question their mechanical maintenance. Flight attendant service was horrible. People were still in the aisles when they pushed off for take off and jumped out of their seats as soon as we touched down - opening overhead compartments etc as the cabin crew ignored everything. Too busy talking in the galley. No comments at all from the flight crew about the 3+ hours of terrible turbulence after leaving Delhi. The cabin crew routinely locked one of the coach bathrooms for their own use which meant 2 toilets for about 200 people. They never walked through the cabin before or after meal service. As a former flight attendant who has flown millions of miles on different airlines I can say this is the worst airline ever.,nan,1.0,nan

I moved to the last empty row so my wife and I both could get some sleep however one of the crew members walked up to me and told me I could not sit there.

Our flight was cancelled at Amritsar due to weather conditions they decided to take us by coach to Delhi the coach provided was very basic and there was no Air India staff to look after passengers. We were not provided with food during the journey that took about 17 hours when it should have taken only 6 hours there were children on the bus who were very disturbed no provisions were made available. When we got to Delhi there was no Air India rep to greet us and direct us we were all lost and did not have any information we were all running around from pillar to post to find out where to go and get some info when they should have looked after us at least when we got to Delhi. We were very disappointed with the whole service they clearly don't know how to provide customer care so I will never travel with them in the future.,nan,3.0,nan

Staff were efficient and some even smiled. Flight was late out of BOM informed by SMS 2 hrs in advance (which is not much help).

Seats in B777 (LHR-DEL) and B787 (DEL-SYD) were lie flat and not too difficult to manoeuvre after a little experimentation. IFE: B777 has less choice for western tastes and the remote control was very fiddly in the end I gave up. B787 had touch screen which was much easier to use and more responsive. Service overall was very good except for one older female attendant on LHR-DEL who appeared to speak barely any English and could learn to crack a smile from time to time.,nan,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,AI 102 from JFK to DEL on their non stop service. I would rate the trip to be completely satisfactory. Comfort - This is what the trip is about. Kudos to AI team for having their Boeing 777-300ER to be configured as 3-3-3 seating instead of 3-4-3 seating which many airlines do this translates to excellent seat space and good leg room. The trip has perfect timings and usually reaches Delhi well ahead of schedule. Food - Being from Indian origin I liked the food which is hot and a little spicy. Entertainment - Now many would want a great entertainment units for this flight and even would have made plans to watch a lot of things inflight well don't this flight is great to sleep and rest. The movie selection was not great and their interface needs improvement Crew - Now there are a lot of small things that make an airline great and I do tend to see them from the captain speaking about the journey and enthusiasm of the crew with a big smile each time they serve. Transfer at Delhi was fast and breezy. Overall even though there are a few shortcomings I would recommend this flight.,nan,5.0,nan

Flight boarding from Mumbai was slow and eventually took off 50 minutes late and hence reach Delhi at 12.45 for our connection flight to Sydney departing at 13.25. DEL staff were prompt to receive us and took us to transfer desk and immigration and finally get our security clear and put us on our flight at such a short transit time. due to delay we could not enjoy new Delhi airport.

Left and arrived early. Business class half empty so the service was very good not quite as good as the Asian airlines but more than satisfactory. Seat comfort was fine and the lay flat bed made sleeping easy. The entertainment was good watched 2 movies in English. Ordered special food which was my mistake and cannot blame the airline for the disappointing food. The snack between meals (smoked salmon) was most enjoyable. The extras included a nice travel suit better than Qantas pyjamas duvet and pillows were comfortable and travel socks and eye masks supplied. Second leg Delhi to London plane service and entertainment as good as the first flight. Food. Gave up on my special meals and ordered from the menu. Breakfast (Poached eggs) was fine and the dinner (Supreme of chicken) served just prior to arrival as good as any meal I have had on a plane. Fresh fruit to finish.

Served with a light snack on the Mumbai-Hyderabad sector and a full meal on the Hyderabad-Jeddah sector. Cabin crew curt but efficient. Decent selection of in-flight entertainment though some of the touchscreens were not working. Return was a direct flight to Mumbai. Aircraft was a 777-300. Neatly maintained. Efficient cabin crew. There was a slight delay in take -off due to a temporary runway closure at Jeddah airport but the captain was prompt to keep the passengers informed of the status.

She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!,nan,5.0,nan

Inflight entertainment average 1 Hollywood 1 Bollywood 1 Punjabi 1 Comedy 1 Music channel fair for a 4 hour overnight flight. I've flown this flight many times and as usual I ordered VLML (Vegetarian Lacto-Ovo meal) and like every time on this flight it has never been offered.

I ordered a VOML (Vegetarian Oriental meal) less than 6 hrs prior to departure but my surprise it was offered to me on the plane. I must commend the Crew who make a huge effort to satisfy passengers on the plane since most of them are first time flyers and seeing Drinks/Food being free they want to extract the most they can.

No complaints. On the international leg it was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The flight was brilliant. I cant complain. The leg room was great (I flew economy). Even when the person in front reclines their seat it isn't uncomfortable. The IFE was excellent. Fast and easy to use. Plenty of movies to choose from mainly Bollywood with a few regional choices too. Maybe not so great on the Hollywood selection. The breakfast wasn't the greatest but for airline standards it was ok. Later in the flight lunch was served. It was lovely. I had the non veg option. It was chicken rice and also saag. It was probably one of the best airline meals I've had.

They had their new (plated) catering on board but still the choice and quality disappointing and the service average which is a shame as Indian food can be outstanding even the curry option was very disappointing. The cabin crew in business on whole do not seem comfortable or confident and are usually older. I mention the age issue only because I think that they have been used to a different type of service which no longer is the standard for business class. I appears that the business cabin crew are chosen on seniority and Air India needs to change this and use younger crew who can bring a new attitude and freshness to the service. Having said that the seat for sleeping was excellent with nice large pillows and good quality cotton quilts. The Dreamliner definitely delivers a much better cabin comfort and had a major affect on jet lag. We had 1.5 hr scheduled transit in Delhi which was a worry we ended up with 60 mins to complete the transfer which we did ok as we had already been issued boarding passes in Singapore. Having said that value for money is excellent. I know many have disliked the decor and I have to agree that it doesn't come up to Cathay's but its ok.

Aircraft: Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room and the seat pitch is very good and comfortable the cabin environment is nice. Food: curry was the only option and catered for Indian passengers. Very limited option (no alternatives). No child's meal provided requested at the time of booking and it was not available (so if you are travelling with children please take your own food). Refreshments only served with meals not provided in any other times considering the long flights on all the sector. Entertainment: Is mainly aimed at Indian audiences very limited entertainment and games for kids (suggest taking a tablet/DS loaded with your favourite movies or games to keep them occupied). The senior management need more focus to improve the standard and efficiency as Air India has joined star alliance they need to improve on following to be par with other major airlines and to attract more passengers with different nationalities. Cabin crew must improve their customer service. More variety of food option for all ages especially for children. Refreshments are served on regular basis on long flights. Noted that toilets are not cleaned during the long flight and some are unusable due to cleanliness. It appears that cabin crews not checking are more interested in resting in their pods for majority of the flights. Improvement on on-time performance as our both outbound and inbound flights are delayed.

I suggest taking a tablet loaded with your favourite movies or shows - but I would do this on any airline. The 787 is by far much more comfortable that the 777. Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room is normal the seat pitch is incredible the cabin environment is lovely and the atmospheric conditions are noticeably better on the 787. (I didn't think this after the outbound journey which consisted of two 787 sectors. The return journey was a 777 sector followed by a 787 sector this is when you notice how great the 787 really is). Transit via Delhi: Information around this process is extremely hard to find on the internet with mixed reviews on sites such as this. If you are an international transiting passenger (i.e. you have landed in Delhi and are connecting with another Air India flight within 24 hours) then you do not need a visa so long as you are not exceeding 24 hours and are not leaving the terminal. There are two options inside the terminal for accommodation. I have done both. Eaton Smart Hotel - transit hotel - This is the option for a transit greater than 4 hours. If you stay here you can also leave the hotel and access any facilities in the terminal - just keep you passport and boarding card with you. Sams Pods - Ideal for less than 4 hours. $10US/ hour. You have access to a bed TV and desk in a small pod in the terminal building. No access to wash facilities other than those provided in the terminal. If you have a flight with Air India and have a long transit it would be well worth you questioning your ability to get a hotel paid for by the airline. I paid for mine as advised for by my flight centre agent. All other passengers on my flight managed to get this included in their ticket free of charge. If you pay for it you are looking at $190AUD.",nan,4.0,nan

No meal provided. Next day (July 2nd) we were bussed after breakfast to Heston Hotel for lunch then to the original departure lounge at LHR. Flight was scheduled for 14.30. Then 16.00hrs. At 19.00hrs we were given meal vouchers. Finally we boarded after 22.00hrs. The flight took off at 11.30 hrs 31 hours late. At no time was information given voluntarily. Air India agents mostly left it to LHR staff to take care of angry passengers. No provision was made for passenger comfort particularly families with small children and the elderly. Passengers were made to stand for hours in areas where there was little or no seating. No effort was made to provide meals at reasonable intervals. We had to ask for vouchers. Passengers were not informed about the plan of action resulting in frayed tempers. Our luggage was not handed over to us. Aisle seat 11c restricts free passage quite severely. Passengers occupying this seat are trodden on and bumped by boarding/disembarking passengers. Except for the centre block row 11 has nowhere to stow small belongings not even under the seat. Many passengers did not know how to flush the toilets resulting in filthy conditions. Instructions must be given along with the safety check. Buttons operating screen light etc on the inside of the armrest can be accidentally knocked.,nan,2.0,nan

The first leg was a brand new 787 it is great product seating 3-3-3 and much better leg room then any other airline. I am tall 6.2 ft still I find very comfortable seating. On board we had 3 servings one drinks service with beer wine and spirits one good full meal with choice of Chicken fish or veg options and one snack before landing. For 8 an hours flight - lots of food. Good quality food and we enjoyed it and there were desserts too! Inflight entertainment was good with choice of new Hollywood and Bollywood movies TV shows sports and business section - enough to keep us busy for 8 hours. FA's were good lots of smiles and caring for kids and elders. Toilets were kept clean all the time. Flight landed in Bombay full 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The second leg was an A319 again good product hot breakfast served with choice of either Scrambled eggs and potato or South Indian Veg. We all enjoyed the breakfast.

I was in the center aisle and both seats besides me were empty I could sleep (laid on 3 seats) all the way through without any disturbance.

Seat quality is very important especially for a 16 hour duration flight. Surprisingly the seats were roomier and a bit more comfortable on the flight from Mumbai to Calcutta.

Surprisingly when we entered the plane and found that there were 8 bassinet locations and only 2 bassinets were hooked up and remaining bassinet assigned seats were allotted to regular people families with no kids.

After complete chaos and AI employees who had no clue on how to control the crowd or make a decision we were that night put on a flight to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines and from there to Bombay with the promise that Air India representative would meet us at the gate in Bombay and help me with claiming my luggage since it was left in New York with Air India transportation to the domestic airport and tickets to my final destination. No one met me at Bombay but the worst part was they refused to provide any assistance. The supervisor at the baggage claim told me in no uncertain terms ""we will not help you."" I had to file a claim for my luggage with Turkish although I never checked my luggage with them. We were so distressed and tired but not one Air India representative showed any concern and they refused to let us in the shuttle to domestic airport. The Air India representative at the transit gate told me that I could spend the entire day trying to talk to someone high up in AI or get a taxi to the domestic airport. I reached Bombay at 4.30 am and finally got the evening flight to Kochi which then was turned around half way and returned to Bombay for technical reasons.

Check-in was a mess at CDG - told to leave executive line and wait to the side - then told to get back in to executive class line after waiting for several minutes to the side. AI use Cathay lounge for this flight at terminal 2C and its really nice. 787 Dreamliner for both legs. My overall impression is that this plane is massively over hyped from a customer aspect anyway - there is really nothing special about this plane - the windows are the most noticeable difference- and while this is nice during the couple of minutes during taking off and landing - you don't notice it for the rest of the flight. Everything is plastic on this plane - the toilet door feels like an ice cream container lid. The seat is comfortable in bed mode it is wide and well padded - but there is no Z-mode for relaxation - you can put the backrest back and the footrest up but the seat remains flat at all times - its not really that comfortable for relaxing/watching TV. A sat in cushion and a larger cotton pillow are provided - which are very comfortable in addition to a duvet and a thin blanket - which makes a great sleeping experience. IFE screen is large and high definition - there is a reasonable choice of (both Indian and Western) movies and television shows - but not quite enough to stretch out for the 12 hour flight. Food was variable. No menus provided - options were stated by staff at the time of meal service. Out of CDG the supper was lobster with champagne sauce - it was dry and tough - but definitely still lobster which is great in business class. Otherwise all the other meals were curry and sandwiches were offered on the Melbourne to Sydney leg - really this should be a proper breakfast. An announcement was made that no alcohol could be served on the domestic leg from MEL to SYD - what they actually mean is no duty free alcohol can be served - its pretty cheap to stop serving alcohol just because you have to pay the duty on it. Almost all passengers immediately removed their shoes and socks immediately upon boarding - so be prepared for the feet. The staff are a mixed bunch - some are fantastic - friendly smiling communicative and anticipating requests - these staff were all female. Unfortunately the male staff were some of the most surly resentful and unpleasant people I have ever encountered in a business class cabin - attendant call button was met with a ""yes"" and a glare from these men. The lounge at Delhi was interesting - I was there at from 9-12 am this is a big lounge with many comfortable chairs but limited food and drink options. Showers were available. Wifi was difficult to access staff seemed disinterested and resentful of requests for assistance - there is clearly no customer service mentality about this place.

That request was never registered but the check-in assistant in Sydney gave me an exit row seat which I was very happy with. On the flight the entertainment system for my seat 30C was not working. I initially complained but I was dismissed by the first flight attendant and told I would need to wait for it to cut in. After an hour of waiting I approached another flight attendant who assured me he would re-set the system. Following another few failed attempts I was assured that they would register the fact that it wasn't working and that it would fixed for the next passenger. Not sure how that helped me! When it came time for meal- time the flight attendant asked me to pull out my tray and was irritated when I couldn't. The tray was actually broken. She did endeavour to fix it but it remained a problem throughout the flight. Unfortunately the entertainment system appears to control the overhead lighting as well. The result was that I had no access to movies music or reading light for the full flight which is 12 hrs 30 minutes that's a long time to sit in the dark. There was no apology or understanding from staff. The food was very basic with little variety there was minimal genuine service on the flight. Staff seemed to vanish between meals and seemed irritated when a passenger asked for something. If anything I found some of the staff quite rude. This was a very full flight I think staff need to pay some attention to the toilets during the trip. At one stage one of the toilet basins was clogged and another passenger complained to staff.

It took another 4 hours to do the paperwork to cancel the departure stamp on my passport. Then the routine of going to hotel and take the flight the next day. There is no sense of customer service or sympathy at this inconvenience. I would make every effort never to fly Air India again. The only good thing about the journey was the plane itself.

While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights.

Cons - The seats are not so comfortable firm dirty as if the covers have not been cleaned or washed in a long time. The crew members are not of the standard to be aboard an international flight. They just lack service quality compared to the likes of Emirates or Qatar. Very unprofessional. They only show up during refreshment services. Care less to see if any passengers would need assistance with anything else through out the flight. They don't clean the rest rooms or feel the need to fill in tissues once these runs out.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,May 2016,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,BOM to HKG via DEL,2.0," |  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Air India. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi to connect with AI314 to Hong Kong, departing at 11pm. In Delhi I lost my boarding pass, and alerted the crew at the gate immediately. They sent me running to the duty free to check if they had found it, but when I ran back telling them that I didn't find it, they told me they wouldn't be able to reissue me with a new one, and that I'd have to rebook on the same flight 24 hours later. I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport. This seven hour ordeal is not over yet, as I am writing this review from Delhi airport, 27 hours after initially leaving Mumbai. The direct flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong is only just over 5 hours. Air India have wasted my time, money, and have shown themselves to be a company with a culture of complete indifference towards their customers. I may have lost my boarding pass, but these things happen, and some understanding and assistance on their part would have been greatly appreciated. To add to my negative experience, two of their crew told me - separately - that they would have issued me with a new boarding pass had they been working at the desk at the time. Air India deprived me of sleep, wasted my time, and also my money, for something that could've been taken care of easily and left me a satisfied customer.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

However, my both flights were close to schedule, with a slight 20-min delay which is common when flying in and out of Mumbai. The best part of the flight was surprisingly, the crew who were mostly young and going out of their way on the service front. Food was decent too. I got to fly on the classic A320 on the return leg, which was old but a nice memory for sure. Their seats/leg room is better than other Indian carriers, especially if one happens to be above 6ft.

We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed. The shabbiness of the plane and the uninspired, almost reluctant service is not a financial problem, it's an attitude issue.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The check-in was smooth and boarding well organised. Onboard the aircraft looked tired. Flight landed 20 mins early. The best part of the flight was possibly the seat leg room and pitch which were generous for economy class and make a huge difference on a long haul flight. IFE is poor particularly if you are not Indian. I was shocked that the music channels were exclusively Indian - I mean not a single English channel. Drinks service - choice of beverages was poor. Dinner main course was one of the tastiest airline food I've had but portions were tiny. Starter and dessert poor. Breakfast was a joke - a small bowl of fruit and 2 cheap mini croissants. Tea was great. If you do not like curry, make sure to book a continental meal (Air India offer western meal as a special meal that can be pre-booked). Cabin crew were courteous and did a good job. A passenger complained of breathlessness and I saw crew provide timely attention. A flight attendant serving me had a genuine smile, helping out an elderly couple who seemed to be a bit frazzled by the flying experience. ",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap.

Outward flight on an old plane, quite tatty looking, but a nice big drink of whiskey served and delicious Indian meal. Inbound flight on Dreamliner, leaving 2.15 a.m. Good leg room and excellent screen. Toilets dirty and ran out of paper which was not replaced. No drinks offered but again, food was really tasty.

Worst part was some of my bags were missing at baggage claim which was the case for most returning passengers. One of the bags came in the mail but we waited one week for the other two and ultimately had to go to Newark airport to retrieve the bags as the airline employees had left the bags with no feeling of accountability and were not apologetic at all.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,February 2017,2.0,1.0,nan,no,Goa to London via Mumbai,3.0," |  Goa to London via Mumbai. We flew air India on the 12/13th February 2017 initially from Goa to Mumbai. The flight was delayed to Mumbai by 30 minutes, then we were told the flight would be 1 hour delayed, in the end the flight was delayed by over 3 hours resulting in our connecting flight on Jet Airways being missed back to the UK. The whole experience was handled very poorly by the ground staff at Goa, there were no announcements regarding the reason why or any updates. After 2 hours, more passengers started to arrive for the later flight so it was obvious that the two flights were being combined. On arrival and at check in, we were handed boarding passes with a capital D printed on the boarding pass, indicating delayed but the new arrivals were issued regular boarding passes. As it turned out, we departed Goa at 01.30 on the 12th February, we knew by this stage that the connecting flight was not possible. On our arrival at Mumbai we were left to our own devices with Air India totally washing their hands of our situation. The ground staff were aggressive, dismissive, rude and generally not getting involved. At one point we were sent to the customer information desk in the airport, it was not an Air India information desk, just a general desk for airport services. Jet Airways would have nothing to do with us either, blaming the other airline, (this will be another review). We ended up buying 2 new tickets on Air India to Birmingham via Delhi, (it was the only flight out that morning,) would you believe it but this flight was delayed by 2.5hrs so we missed our connecting flight once again. We were offered the next flight out to London Heathrow, we had boarding passes issued, collected our luggage, checked in again and rushed to the departure gate, managed to get on the plane and would you believe: we were delayed by another 2 hours. It appears this is a very common everyday issue for this airline. On my return to the UK, I was informed by other travellers that the exact same delay occurred on the Friday night. The flight was not the best, an old Boeing 777, dirty interior, absolutely filthy toilets that smelled terrible. The inflight entertainment system on our seats stopped working after 40 minutes, this happened on 2 occasions so we were not able to watch anything in full, not even the shorter programs. My only praise for this whole experience were the cabin crew on this leg from Delhi to Heathrow, they were jolly, chatty and polite. Since my return, I have tried to contact Air India numerous times for a delayed flight certificate, but with no reply. I'm not sure if they have any customer support in the UK but if they do, they dont want to be found. I was told to travel to Heathrow to Air India ticket office to collect the certificate. 500 miles round trip from my home, I dont think that will happen. So my overall view of Air India is not a good one, I personally would not fly them again unless there were no other carrier's flying to that particular airport. One piece of advice, if your flying to join another flight in Mumbai please give yourself ample time at least 6 hours if not more just in case of delays.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

It was good connection flight for me so wanted to try Air India. I am not fussy passenger. It was fine when I flew to Kathmandu but way back had a horrible experience. The crew members have very bad attitude and are very rude. When first snacks peneuts and soft drink was served, I requested the cabin crew that I would like to have cup of tea insead of soft drink please and she said that I have to wait till after dinner for tea.  I seated to wait after dinner. I had transit flight got headache. I went to washroom and ask a gentleman if possible to have cup of tea please, he said "" of course"". The lady who refused me before was came to me and asked why I am asking him tea as she just told me to wait after dinner. I told her that sorry but I am allowed to have tea. This is a small incident. Dinner was served. It was a different lady walking through by my seat. I stopped her and request her may I please have cup of water, she was very angry. I thought she did not hear me properly, I asked her a bit louder again. She started arguing with me why I am shouting at her. I said I am not shouting you I thought you did not hear me. I would like to have cup of water for my tablets please. She never came back. Very bad service.

Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

She then has to overnight in Delhi for 31 hours, leaving Delhi on Sat 20th May at 1910. When I called their help line to ask why she could not have a seat on the 1910hrs flight out on the 19th, I was immediately passed on to someone else, who after putting me on hold for over 10 minutes told me they could do nothing about it and to call Colombo. I have never spoken to more unhelpful people who clearly could not care less that a young woman will be all alone in Delhi and not knowing where to get a good hotel etc. Disgraceful does not even begin to cover their attitude.

They kept me 2 hours in front of the check-in that I couldn't care properly for my son. Just waiting. Without toilet, food or anything! After this 2 hours they gave me just the boarding pass until Delhi and I had to run carrying my son and all the luggage to the boarding as this had started already. Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover. And again they kept us 3 hours in front of the security check because of the boarding pass. No toilets, no food again - just hard chairs to wait on. I was really desperate as my son was just crying. They didn't care. I got more and more stressed. At the end they wrote a manual boarding pass and I had to run again to the boarding to get my 12 hours flight. Terrible! ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0
A320,Economy Class,4.0,January 2017,3.0,3.0,nan,yes,GAY to DEL,3.0," | This flight from Bodhgaya to Delhi was the latest of about 20 domestic flights sectors completed with Air India over the last 3 - 4 years. The level of service has remained consistent in all areas, with some aspects of service stronger than others. This flight was originally due to depart Bodhgaya at 14.35h arriving in Delhi at 16.25h. An initial delay to a revised 16.00h departure was notified by e-mail several hours in advance. Check-in queue management at Bodhgaya airport was poor but agent service was good once you eventually got to the check-in desk. After further delay at Bodhgaya airport the flight eventually departed shortly after 18.00h and arrived at Delhi at about 20.00h. Not a single delay announcement was made at Bodhgaya airport and the information board simply showed the word 'delay' next to the flight number. We had no idea how long the delay would be until we saw our aircraft land. Except for an expensive coffee kiosk there were no customer facilities while waiting. The flight itself was straightforward and typical of one on Air India's short-haul A320 fleet with friendly, patient, efficient cabin crew and reasonably comfortable seating in a slightly grubby cabin. A simple in-flight snack was served. No announcements from the captain except an abrupt order for cabin crew to take their seats for take off and again for landing. Cabin crew announcements included a sincere apology for the delay. Arrived at Delhi's Terminal 3 where we exited through the international arrivals section because our flight had originated in Yangon, Burma, before picking up passengers in Bodhgaya. This meant that the domestic passengers among us had to join a long slow-moving queue to clear, bizarrely, passport control, where just two desks were dedicated to clearing many domestic passengers, presumably from several flights. It took more than an hour just to get as far as the baggage hall. The lesson is to remember to leave plenty of time if you take a domestic flight with Air India before connecting to an international flight.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

IFE was non-existent as the screens were covered with a headrest cover.

Business Class toilet ran out of tissue and no one bothered to refill it. It was empty throughout the flight. Again this is simply outrageous. My entertainment system did not work at first. I reported this to one of the attendants and he restarted and it seemed to work. But in the end, the Flight Map was still broken. There were no meal menu given to us during this trip. The meals were verbally communicated to us. I paid $US2,000 only to be told what is in my meals. I had two small meals during this flight and each time I completed my meal the tray was not picked up in a timely fashion. I think I must have waited 25 minutes after I finished my meal, for the tray to be picked up. The flight attendants did not walk down the aisle as often as I think they should. Service was not a top priority for this set of crew. Meals were warm although I've had better economy international food than Air India's business class.

My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly.

Asked for a Gin and tonic, got two without asking. Just don't understand why people criticize this airline so much. It's my preferred choice in Economy when possible.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

I had taken this afternoon flight on an Airbus A321 after checking in online prior to the flight. Had dropped off my baggage at the designated drop off point and proceeded towards the boarding gate. The flight crew on this flight were quite polite and professional. Even though the departure time was 1pm, we had left around 1.15 or so. After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served. This flight had an occupancy of around 85% and we reached our destination 10 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all, it was an excellent flight and I would fly with them again.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

It was first time I have traveled on Air India on international sector. Check was smooth, Boarding as usual. Pushed back on time and arrived Delhi on time. Food on Birmingham to Delhi was good. In process of hot drink serving the way they serve hot drink without trolley is scary, they will pour hot liquid into passenger cup using a small tray at passenger space expense.

I was transferring from Lufthansa to Air India, so checked-in my bag at the designated counter for connecting passengers. When I presented my Air India boarding pass and check-in bag (which was already tagged from L.A. to Lucknow), they told me that I would have to go upstairs to the main check-in area. I insisted that they process me at the designated counter for connecting passengers, or else it beats the purpose for having one in the first place! Overall, I wasn't impressed with the ground staff's professionalism. The on-board experience was okay. I wished the Flight Attendant ""Good Morning"" while entering the aircraft, she responded ""Namaskar"". It was a short 1 hour flight with express snack service. There was no IFE or WiFi on-board. If you are travelling with a baby or sitting in an exit row, the flight attendant will ask you if you prefer instructions in English or Hindi.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Again a dirty plane, dirty roof, vents, table, entertainment control and window surround. And although I had put my seat selection in my reservation I was put further down the plane in a middle seat. The reason for choosing seat 19D in my booking was to sit beside my colleague. We were both moved. Why bother asking us to select seats if you're going to stick us anywhere you like, even as a Star Alliance frequent flyer program. I flew with Air India in 2015 from the London to Mumbai and have chosen to avoid that on my last 5 visits with the exception of a couple of domestic flights and Air India have not failed to disappoint. Not good enough Air India. I'm a frequent flyer, taking long haul flights about 30 times a year plus domestic connections and Air India is really low grade.",Business,1.0,nan

I am disgusted and appalled at the lack of basic customer service shown by the Delhi airport Air India staff.  I have travelled Air India many times and taken advantage of their ‘airport upgrade’ service whereby once can move from economy to business for a relatively reasonable fee. However, this trip I received a mail in advance saying I could arrange over the phone to increase certainty of a seat within 24hrs. I thought fantastic – but in hindsight I wish I had never received the mail. After the first 20 mins phone call they advised I was too early and so arranged call back. This was executed, but done two hours later and so again not within the 24hrs so another wasted 20mins. I called back the next day to arrange and 20mins later was advised it was completed and would see new ticket issued. It didn’t come but my CR card notified of a transaction and so I assumed all good. I got to airport ready to have an easy journey with no fuss. First off I was advised no upgrade been done, no record. I showed CR Card and asked them to sort out whereby everyone walked away and left me for 10mins until I insisted in speaking to the most senior person. The Duty Manager has not a single ounce of customer service in his body! No acknowledgement, no sorry no apology. After another 15-20mins they tell me the transaction was cancelled and refunded as they forgot to charge the GST. And so I should pay again! At this stage again no apologies or acceptance that this was their problem not mine. Then I had to go to another area and pay again with no service and no priority.  My advice to all unfortunately is to avoid this airline if you can",Business,3.0,nan

I have to admit Air India exceeded my expectations, both sectors was on time and flown on B787 dreamliner which was clean and legroom was better than QR and EK. Food was good and IFE was acceptable. The only downside I felt was the attitude of some of the flight attendants, there was no smile and looked as if they were not interested in the job. Couple of times the food cart hit my seat hard from behind and there was not even a reaction let alone an apology. Overall I enjoyed the flight and would recommend Air India.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 787,Economy Class,1.0,July 2017,1.0,3.0,2.0,no,Bangkok to Madrid via Delhi,4.0," | I would not recommend Air India if you are travelling with kids. I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read). I guess they don't care too much about custom.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Food was disgusting on the way back from India. Air hostesses were rude with attitude problems. They were hardly ever seen on the flight, when I went to the loo I saw one of them perched on a stool reading a magazine. When the plane was landing they didn't check all the overhead lockers were shut and neither did they check everyone was wearing their belts. Children were running up and down the aisles and people were getting their luggage out of the lockers as the plane landed. It was the flight from hell.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays.  In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option. I would rather pay an extra few quid to avoid the dirty aircrafts, crew and having to transit in Indian Airports.",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

I was very nicely surprised, there is much more room on Air India Boeing 787 than you get on BA, who really pack you into the Business Class section. There is more room between seats and the width of the seat is wider. Food is okay, booze plentiful and wide choice. No Noise Reducing headphones, which is normal in Business Class. They do not have their own Airport lounge but at Heathrow share the Lufthansa lounge which is nice. In Newark they share the Virgin lounge and the Virgin staff treated us very badly, not allowing us food, and denying any waitress service for drink.

Check-in at CDG was smooth and quick (web check-in). The Boeing 787 is a modern aircraft but the interior of this flight looked dull, although seat comfort and legroom were good.

Check-in at Delhi Terminal 3 was swift and efficient, the aircraft departed on time and arrived slightly ahead of scehdule. The aircraft was spotlessly clean and the cabin crew thoroughly professional (particularly in relation to safety checks) and courteous. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that despite being only 90 minute mid-morning flight, a complimentary cooked meal with choice of dishes and drinks was served and cleared away in the short time available. All this for a fare that would make the cheapest European budget airline seem somewhat expensive. Sadly few foreign tourists are visiting Kashmir these days, so the flight was very much geared for Indian nationals having cause to fly to/from Delhi, but can only conclude that with two rival Indian arilines operating this route, competition really is driving up standards. Based on our experience of this flight, we would have no hesitation in booking Air India again for our next internal flight in India.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The positives - there was good leg room on the seats, the flights departed on time. However the rest I'm afraid then went downhill. The cabins were grubby, I had to ask numerous times for a cloth to wipe my area and screen as there were finger marks of old food still on the screen. We felt that the crews on all the legs were all quite surly and really did not want to be there and anything was a bit too much of a bother. Once the meal service was done they all huddled in the galley and sat and read. On the transit at Delhi the ground staff were not much better at the customer service experience either, we were met with rude agents barking orders where to go as we had not heard an announcement due to having queued in security for an hour. All in all, not a good experience when compared with the other airlines we have flown with- Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia, Etihad and whilst they may be cheaper it may certainly be true that you get what you pay for but for us - never again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Crew started drinks service accompanied by a pack of peanuts. Drinks included apple, orange juice, whiskey, water. As I opted for the veg option, the lunch consisted of paneer kofta with rice and vegetables with a bun, salad and kheer for dessert. The meal was quite tasty and filling which was good. Afterwards, the IFE kept me occupied for most part of the flight. The IFE was not expansive but for a 9 hour journey managed to keep me occupied. The crew dimmed the windows after lunch to make passengers get some sleep. Before landing, supper was provided which consisted of a samosa, veg cutlet and panner tikka with a bun, fruits and gulab jamun for dessert. Arrival in Mumbai was delayed by 35 mins.

That was exactly my experience - inconsistent. Not sure what to expect. DEL-BKK: Boeing 787, ample leg space, acceptable IFE, acceptable inflight service, helping and offering of drinks. Flight stewards did their job, all boxes ticked, nothing to complain-nothing to write home about. All these compared to the price I paid- good value for money BKK-DEL: Morning flight, same equipment, same IFE. But the only variable factor, in flight service, fell like nine pins. Type of meal I prefer finished by the time it came to me, since this is a morning flight, they were not serving drinks (never seen that before). When requested, got snubbed down badly by flight steward. Overall verdict: good for price sensitive travelers but don't expect much from service standpoint.

Quite possibly the best legroom for intercontinental flights in economy. The crew were very polite and carried out their tasks with utmost professionalism and provided regular drinks of water/juice to the passengers. Before landing the crew distributed immigration cards and also lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course which consisted of mixed vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea.

In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat. In that seat, the entertainment system failed to work. This was a 15 hour flight that I flew business class and paid over $4000 for a ticket on. I would have rather traveled premium economy on United. The experience would have been much better.

Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM.

I always had a good opinion about Air India international flights in-spite of several inputs from family and friends not to fly Air India, however I experienced this during my recent travel. The crew were extremely impolite and not hospitable. They refused to serve non-veg when asked for. They asked me to weigh the baggage at a counter and at that point of time it was well within the baggage allowance, however at the point of check in the baggage showed an excess and I was charged a $100 dollars unnecessarily as penalty. To double check this I weighed the baggage as soon as I got home and found it was just 0.5 kg in excess. The entertainment unit is the only source of entertainment on a long flight however in spite of repeated requests to the crew of a dysfunctional monitor nobody bothered to rectify it. On the whole I had a miserable experience flying Air India. Feel really disappointed and cheated.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

The ability to play around with the window dimmer is amazing. Unfortunately though the cabin crew keeps the cabin dark all the time, even though it’s a day flight. It’s so easy for them to control it compared to the manual blinds. Service was so so, while the food was average for business class standards. The seat, however, was sufficiently wide and comfortable with USB and power available. The IFE was not as good as Emirates or SQ, but it was adequate for me.

When we initially checked in for our flight in Chicago to our departure in Ahmedabad. The policies they state on their website do not correlate what the company actually adheres to i.e baggage policy. During the flight they have the worst customer service. I waited over 20 minutes for an air hostess after pressing the button and when I asked for water when they had a chance I was scowled at and not to mention they never even brought the water.

The Delhi to Srinagar aircraft looked new and clean. The legroom was generous, and there was a newspaper at every seat. The breakfast was delicious! The flight back from Srinagar to Delhi was still good (tasty lunch and, again, friendly cabin crew) but a bit less convincing.

Boeing 787,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,London to Delhi,4.0," |  London to Delhi. Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst.

I took the morning flight when I flew to Osaka and noon flight when I returned. The breakfast was terrible, but the lunch on the return flight was quite good, a bit beyond my expectation. The cabin crew delivered the worst service I have ever experienced. No smile on their face, when I stop one of them for a cup of tea, they look annoyed and not willing to do so. Waste and garbage on all desks as the crew didn't care to collect them when they saw them. I actually brought my own tray of finished food to the crew and saw them sitting chatting.

They lost my bags at the Mumbai Airport, which is another terribly run organization and should be avoided at all costs. My bags have now been missing over 72 hours. They open a case through their Airport baggage organization, which is contracted to help Air India with lost baggage claims. It also allows Air India to evade responsibility and accountability. If you try to contact Air India customer service to discuss compensation / details of your lost bag, they tell you they can't help. They direct you to Bangkok. Bangkok gives you the Air India policy and tells you it's completely non-negotiable. They say they don't have the power to do anything, any changes must be done by Air India, and they direct you to call Air India. This allows Air India to completely evade any negotiation or accountability. So far as a business class passenger with no bags for 72 hours+ I've been given a paltry 50 pounds, about 65 USD at the time of posting. Should be enough to buy a decent pair of pants. If this company wants to call itself a premier airline, they need to go back to elementary school for customer service. I've heard that the Mumbai airport which they base out of has a huge issue with lost baggage. Save yourself the nightmare of losing your bags overseas. Avoid this joke of an airline.

Aircraft was not as clean, seats were dirty and some of the armrests quite loose. Cabin crew attitude and their behaviour with passengers  leaves much to be desired. On three occasions they served drinks or food coming from behind rather from front, no eye contact, no smile, nothing. In the first serving they gave options of non-veg/veg/continental food but in the second serving only option was Indian food which was too spicy to be eaten by a person living in Europe. I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood.

Most of the luggage lifting and its arrangement was done by them (unlike other airlines). Special care was taken of kids and elderly people. The airplanes have much spaced and are comfortable. (Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today. The ticket rates are competitive and sometimes cheaper than others.

Earlier this month I reviewed the outbound sector of my trip, this review covers the inbound sector on the 31st January. Although the plane was a Boeing 787, it was quite an old one and hence badly maintained. The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew?

They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen.

I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all.

He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom. The onboard served snack wasn't good on this one. There was dry, cold Singara and cake. The plane made some noises during the flight. This Aircraft, perhaps ,wasn't properly maintained. Anyways, landed in Dhaka after a 1 hr flight. Overall experience was really good.",Family Leisure,4.0,5.0

And after more delay it flies at 10:30 reaches Delhi. After the pilot misses the parking slot and we wait for more 40 mins and to get the new parking slot. Unbelievable it is considered to be one of the premier airlines in India. You guys are not worth it. For a journey of 60 mins we just waste 3 hours and 35 mins.

I flew back from Delhi on flight AI0111 at 14:00 on Thursday 10/5/2018. The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with Air India and will never do so in the future.

Webcheck in has absolutely no meaning, in fact the queue for bag drop off is probably more than the normal. Takes nothing less than 1.5 hr before you reach the counter and the chances are you may be asked to go to another counter and then come back - happened to 2-3 people right in front of me. At least 8-10 entertainment systems are broken in the flight and the attendants don’t care or do anything other than saying sorry sir this seat entertainment is broken. Despite being an Indian airline the food they serve is so horrible - it’s just unbelievable. So many other international airlines serve 10x better food. Staff courtesy - Ask them for a cup of coffee / tea and look at their displeased expressions. Being an Indian myself, I am embarrassed by the fact that this is our own international / national airline. Will try my best to avoid this airline in future.",Business,2.0,nan

I told him that I am not exiting in Singapore and it is a connecting flight ( layover of 2 hours) and for such transit visa is not required.  My question how these guys are not so knowledgeable when they sit in that counter. In addition he is telling me United Baggage allowance may be 1. I told him baggage allowance rule will apply on the original flight rules and not the 2nd flight. So I had a real bad experience.,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0

I found the crew very impolite and the customer service was therefore quite poor, the staff did not share a single smile throughout both flights.

Singapore to Mumbai on the 787, entertainment was mediocre. No smiles from flight attendants who seemed to dislike their job. However this leg wasn't the big issue. New Delhi to Singapore was the big issue. Paid at the time of booking to select my seat and upon check-in at the airport, staff told me that the seat has been given to someone else. When I questioned him why this was so, he said ""Yes you have paid to choose that seat, but it doesn't mean it's confirmed."". When I argued further with him on this, he resorted to saying ""It's not my fault!"". On the plane, the tray table was horribly stained with curry. Had to ask the flight attendants countless times for help until I got a few napkins from them and had to clean it up myself. The flight attendant was irritated with me and started treating me rudely for the rest of the flight. Food was terrible as well. I am not picky with airlines, as long as they are decent. I have flown many different airlines from all six continents. However, Air India the one airline that is far from any acceptable standards and truly does not deserve the title of being a Star Alliance member. I've heard bad reviews before and I thought I could handle it. A joke of a national airline.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 787,Business Class,3.0,October 2017,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi,3.0," |  Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi. My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalid…and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.) Verdict: I had quite a few other flights with Air India last year and there is always something that does not work. It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

After taking off from Washington, D.C. lunch was served around 12:30 P.M. After lunch the dinner was served around 9:30 P.M. almost after 9 hours. In these 9 hours there was no food service at all. They did not care to offer even a light snack or a sandwich. for nine hours and this was in the Business Class, we do not know what they did in the Economy Class. When asked the staff about this, we were told that they are suppose to serve only two meals in such a long flight. We can understand you serve two major meals but how about some snacks etc. in nine hours. It would have been fine but since I am a diabetic and need to eat some thing on regular intervals. But sorry that is the only food service they offer. Wanted to talk to the Supervisor about it and was told the supervisor would come to talk to you but of course nobody came to talk to us at all until we landed in New Delhi as if you simply do not care and if you are diabetic then it is your problem. We have flown in Business Class on so many different airlines around the world and have never experienced such a poor food service. Have you ever compared your business class service with other airlines? How can you compete with them with this kind of service? They serve food, drinks and snacks throughout the flight in Business Class without even asking. No wonder Air India is losing money. Who would like to pay this kind of money for Business Class and get this kind of service. It is surprising, at one time Air India was known for it's food service.

So I walked in to the Travel Lounge or something on the first floor, I showed staff my boarding pass and asked politely if I can access. She asked for my AMEX card and then she just said ""No Indian only"".  I just wanted to grab some hot coffee anyway so I went down to Coffee Bean to get one. Then I emailed to Air India's CS team, no reply after almost a week. The aircraft was pretty old and badly maintained. The food, geez.. I'll just get the coffee. I don't want to use gross to describe them because others enjoyed them I guess, but it's not delicious, like at all. I wonder why they are even a Star Alliance member airlines. Not up to standard at all from the moment I have checked in my flight. Oh, no in-flight entertainment either due to the old configuration of the aircraft. Nah, doesn't matter.

Both initial departure flights on separate days were delayed, conveniently resulting in my unexpected ""royal"" transit treatment in New Delhi! On my way to Colombo, the Delhi transit desk staff blankly told us that we had missed our connecting flight and simply would not board me on the next Sri Lankan Air with the excuse that this was a split ticket. Instead a staff member gave me a few numbers to call for the issuance of a new boarding pass. Eventually advising me it's best to purchase a new ticket as I was pressed for time. He even handed me a 'delay certificate' (w annotation at the bottom ""We thank you for flying Air India and wish you a happy journey) that could be used as proof in the event I would like to be reimbursed for the new ticket purchased! Ultimately, I was stuck at the Delhi transit desk for 5+ hours (along with other angry customers), even after paying out of my pocket for a new connecting ticket as I was made to endlessly for the issuance of a new boarding pass.
