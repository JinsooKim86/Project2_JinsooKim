New York to Sarasota. After travelling 30+ hours from Nepal on Qatar Airways with my two kids, I had a connecting flight on Jetblue to Tampa. What should have been a 3 hrs. fight, turned into a 5 days ordeal. We were on the Initial flight on the 22nd of July which left the gate and then after being in the tarmac for 3 hrs, they returned us back to the terminal because the delay caused one of the crew to be above legal flying time allowed. Our initial flight was eventually cancelled at around 2:00 AM the next day and they gave no compensation citing the cancellation was because of weather. I had to be in the line for more than an hour to book our flights for the next day. I was told we were booked for the next day flight, but when we reached the gate the next day, they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights. Same thing happened for a couple of days. Finally, after 4 days, they gave me an option to fly out to Sarasota. In between, they told me they had misplaced my luggage and was asked for me to find out where my luggage was. So, after 5 days, without any luggage, they put me in a flight to a different destination and to top it off, they put us in completely different areas of the aircraft and while I was trying to console my 7-year-old to go sit with a stranger, the flight attendant asks us to take our seat promptly. Please do not fly JetBlue, because they have zero passenger concern, they seriously need to fire the guy who manages the flights and reorganize. They were completely disorganized, desk and the person on the phone telling me I had confirmed flights, while the gate told me I didn't have any. Baggage getting lost and they had no clue where it was last scanned, rude desk people. Complete chaos.",Family Leisure,1.0,2.0

She refused to help me find another flight on another carrier. To keep my interview I have to book our new flight from different airline which can take me to Boston next day and it cost us extra $253/each ticket more.

After security we went to our original gate, where we realized it was changed to 11. When we arrived at our new gate boarding already began. As we were walking in, my wife made a humorous comment about the gate change. It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in, ""you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes"". Upon boarding, we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken. We had paid extra money to receive the ""extra legroom seats"" and we were seated in row 1. It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments. I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags, this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight. It was here where one of the flight attendants came up to me and said ""sir you cannot have your bags in front of you"". I kindly told her that there was no space in any compartments near me, she said you need to go to the back of the plane and ""find space"". Have paid extra for the ""even more space"" seat and paying to sit in row 1, I was flabbergasted when we asked the flight attendant for a blanket for my pregnant wife and she responded with ""that's $5 dollars, how will you pay?"". It was about 30 minutes into the flight when the flight attendant came through with water and asked what drinks we would like. I requested for a Ginger ale and the flight attendant wrote it down. It was 42 minutes to be exact before I received my wife's drink. I asked the flight attendant twice about the drink. Being that our seats were 1C and 1D, it was literally two steps away from where they store the drinks. They were purposely avoiding getting this drink.

Once I was told it was because of bad weather in Orlando where the plane was coming from but when I checked the weather in Orlando it was perfect with 10% chance of rain. My flight is a 25 minute flight from San Juan to St. Croix and it seems to always be delayed for hours. That just doesn't make sense. I'm waiting 8 times longer than my flight time. It is unacceptable that a company can charge hundreds of dollars for ticket with no responsibility.

OK, it was really a short round trip between Boston and New York (40 to 45 minutes each way), but from experience, this does not mean unpleasant surprises can't happen. The flight out was a new route to LaGuardia so the passengers even got a free morning snack (bagel with some jam). Unlike most airlines, Jetblue did not threaten people forcing them to surrender their cabin baggage, but instead asked for a specific number of volunteers. Our flight back was at 11pm, but we arrived earlier, and it turns out that Jetblue can try to put you on an earlier flight for free (if it's just one flight earlier). They managed to fit us on a flight one hour earlier. Both flights were on time despite going between very busy airports, and since the allotted time takes into consideration possible delays, we arrived earlier than scheduled in both times. The best part is how organized Jetblue flights are. From a boarding procedure that, like in APAC, fills the back rows first so that long queues don't get stuck behind, to the way they distribute drinks (ask first, then only bring what's needed instead of pushing the trolley for half an hour).",Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0

Fares were reasonable but the absurd $55 for two bags and $20 for one is a pure ripoff. They provided nothing except soft drinks/juice on the flight, the snacks were tiny and even the overpriced food they were pushing looked like something out of a nightmare. It seems to me that with fuel prices half what they were a couple of years ago, completely booked flights and charging for every amenity they could be a bit more generous.

However, there was an employee standing at the front of the entry line deep in conversation with a woman in a wheelchair. We waited patiently for someone to come and take care of the man in front of us as well as ourselves. Five minutes passed with no one attending the desk. One of the pilots came over so he could board the plane. He received no assistance. After waiting a few minutes. He walked up to the agent and proceeded to ask why he wasn't helping the man who was still waiting at the desk. The pilot walked away looking frustrated. The agent proceeded to turn back to his conversation leaving the customer still waiting at the desk. Eventually, the agent started to walk away from the woman he'd been talking to when the husband stepped up and entered the conversation. At that point I walked up to him, excused myself, and ask if there was anyone working the desk. He said yes and I proceeded to ask when they would be coming. He hesitated for a moment before identifying himself as said attendant. He finally asked what my needs were. The man at the attendant station still stood unhelped with a look of aggregation on his face. The agent asked us to wait, saying he'd be right back, as he walked to the desk. We followed behind him just in case he got distracted again. The first customer's frustration grew based on his look of discuss at having been completely overlooked.

JetBlue Airways attracts it's customers with low prices for airfare as well as complimentary items such as their free 36 Direct TV channels on their in flight entertainment systems. However, while complimentary items and low airfare are nice, the customer service always needs to be a priority and that is what was lacking on Flight 602 service to Boston. Even though this was a Red-eye flight (aka an all-nighter), I believe that at the least flight attendants shouldn't be screaming for people to sit down. The attendants on this flight I can imagine probably don't like their shift but taking it out on the passengers isn't right. And while I understand that they have a tight schedule to keep they are perfectly capable of saying please and thank you every once in a while.

There were no adjacent tickets available for purchase when we bought the tix so we ended up with two mint window seats and two aisle seats, each set on opposite sides of the aisle, my 11 year old son sat on his own but of course we couldn't leave my 7 year old little girl sitting alone by a window seat while my wife sat on the other side of the aisle without even full view of my daughter and have some stranger sit next to my little girl. So my wife sat next to my little girl until we could talk to the person in that seat - who we assumed would be reasonable like the rest of us. Then one of the gate staff came in and told my wife she had to move, leave my 7 year old little girl who still carries her pink blanket with her alone. I went up and told them there was no way we were leaving our little girl alone in that seat, wait for some stranger to sit there and hope the airline could work it out. The guy across the aisle was sweet amidst what was becoming a tense situation and offered to trade, which was great. I then went up to tell the pilot, stewardess and offending gate person that I was going to issue a formal complaint and rather than simply apologizing or even just saying something like ""I understand of course, go ahead"" he threatened to have our family wait for the next flight if I complained.

I understand weather and such, but delay it would have been better. I called customer service to the tune of I am sorry, nothing we can do. We had a show that was paid for months ago and important to get to Las Vegas before 8pm. They could only get us on a 6-7pm flight which put us into LV after the show had started. Considering airlines were flying out in the afternoon, when the weather was better, JetBlue could not even accommodate by adding a flight that would have helped many of us who had to scramble for another airline. Every airline we checked was full or flying out in the evening. You could imagine how upset I was. JetBlue has a high cancellation record and I have been flying with them since the beginning. Dealing with TV's that haven't worked to sometimes unfriendly crew members, I brushed it off. When customer service on the phone says this has happened to them and they didn't take it out on the person trying to help them, after asking them how would they feel if this happen to them? That was wrong. Flying home on JetBlue was terrible. Full flight and the TV's did not work. It was a new plane and they did not work. Crew was not that friendly, empty cups and soda bottles were left under the seats. I feel like they have overgrown. No regard for the inconvenience of their passengers who have to shell out hundreds more dollars for a flight with another carrier or who miss important events. If you cancel a flight, figure out rescheduling a little later. That is the right thing to do. Put another airplane into use with a crew. I will tell you, we flew out on Delta and I was very impressed. I have 2 more trips on JetBlue coming up and then I think I need to part ways. I felt at their mercy like they shrugged their shoulders. I have choices and they should understand that. Sometimes the lower fare is not the best choice. I have written them many times on their great service and flights. Now I can't say that. They price gauge for everything from seating room, $70 for more legroom and the seats are not much more comfortable. At least on Delta, seats are wider and more comfortable for an up charge.

I had not flown on this airline before nor did I have any idea what I was going to expect. From entering the Terminal C in Boston until leaving the dedicated Terminal in JFK it was a unique and breathtaking experience. When I approached the self-check-in kiosks at Logan a smartly dressed employee came up to me and assisted me through the entire process. The whole check-in area had more the appearance of an After-work-lounge than an airport facility. Everything looked so classy, like out of some Hollywood movie. There were no lines at security and I was through in a breeze. Doors were closed on time. The seats on the small Embraer jet were comfortable, even for me as a tall guy. I took advantage of the live television broadcast on the individual screens and caught up with the latest political and weather news. There was a 30-minute-departure delay out of Boston but we reached the gate at JFK right on time. In-between the young and enthusiastic crew served softdrinks and snacks of high quality.

This is ridiculous we had 3 paid seats which they gave away for a minute delay we could have easily made to the gate on time if the agent had shown a little care and checked us in. When I called the customer service center to report this issue they were not helpful and said there was nothing they could do. I am returning home and waiting to go back to airport for a 6:40 pm flight, enough of my issue a word of advice to whoever is flying and running a little bit behind make sure to take a few minutes to do online check-in so you can ensure that you are checked in 40 minute prior and then as needed print your tickets at kiosk.

Thus, there is very little we can do at this point to overcome the disappoint our family is encountering. After two hours and getting no where with Jetblue, I am simultaneously attempting to cancel all other accommodations arranged for this trip. I am highly discouraged by this airline's lack of treatment to its patrons. Customer service under provided when it could have chosen to be highlighted as unforgettably amazing! Jetblue better step up its CS game or face serious future consequences. Empower your employees to do want is right in extenuating circumstances. We are people not systems.

The earliest they'd be able to get me out of JFK on the 26th would be 4pm, so I changed my flight to depart Austin on the 26th. The same flight on the 26th was again delayed from 5:06pm to 5:50 pm and I called to ensure that I would still make my connection. The phone agent confirmed I would make the connection so I drove to Austin to catch my flight. While waiting at the gate the flight was delayed again, now to 6:25pm. Attendant at the gate confirmed that I would make my connection. As I was boarding the plane I was told that I'd have to check my carry-on. I explained that I had a tight connection in JFK, but was reassured by the gate that it wouldn't be a problem. As we approached JFK the flight had to circle until we were diverted to refuel in Philly for return to JFK. Once we finally landed at JFK it was 12:30am and thought I would have time to catch my connecting flight however, no one from Jetblue met the plane and the crew did not provide connection information. I looked at the departure boards but my flight was not listed. As I attempted in vain to search the gates for my departing flight and access the flight status option on the website (which did not work) I went to the previous gate I was told the flight would be at before it had been delayed several times, but it was not there and the only manned ""Just Ask"" station in the terminal was in close proximity but with twenty people in line. So I called the 1-800 number and it was obvious that the phone agent was not well trained and tried to inform me that my next flight was my departure flight on the 29th and all my previous flights had departed on time. She had no idea that my flights had been delayed and informed me that the only available flight was 8:36am that morning. I asked then why had I received texts that my connecting flight was not departing until 01:07am and she couldn't explain it but asked if I wanted to change my flight as if I had a choice. When I said yes, she stated that she would have to get a supervisor to allow her to make the change. That process took about 30 minutes and at the conclusion she told me that I needed to talk to an employee at the terminal to confirm the information she'd provided me. When I finally got to the front I was told that the flight had indeed been delayed and that I could have caught that flight and my bag had made it on the flight. Why wouldn't the flight be on the departure screens? So now I have no access to my bag during the 8 hour layover. To top it off, I requested to talk to a supervisor and was told that someone would come talk to me but it could take a while, I have 8 hours to spend here anyway so said sure I'll wait. Two hours later I was told that the supervisor would not be able to speak with me and that if I truly wanted to speak with one that I would need to exit security and search for one at the ticket counter. Had I known, I would have canceled my travel plans. First and last time I'll fly on Jetblue.",Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0

There were about 5 of us traveling to Honolulu who got completely screwed because we missed our connecting flight. The only option for us was to wait 12 hours for a flight to Vegas > Honolulu then a 3 hour delay before finally flying to Lihue for me. This means I missed my first night in my hotel. I was 14 hours late to my final destination. I missed my shuttle and had to pay for a taxi which was ridiculously expensive.

I am unlikely to ever fly this airline again. From my flight being cancelled (Flight 263), to them loosing my luggage and blaming everyone else (Emirates, Me, Customs, etc) but themselves, to their inundated Customer Service people spending 30 to 60 minutes on the phone per customer to attempt to get them on other flights. I spent almost 6 hours at JFK figuring out what I needed to do as their customer service representatives were so unhelpful and made almost no announcements to anyone to let us know what was actually going on. I stood in one line for 2 hours and then another for another 2 hours and at no point were we given any clear guidance as to what was actually happening. Once I finally got a ticket out of New York for 2 days after the cancelled flight, I was told that JetBlue would not cover accommodation due to the flight being cancelled on account on bad weather. There was no bad weather in New York at the time that we arrived or the time the flight was supposed to depart. I spoke to several passengers who were all going to very different destinations, Seattle, Charleston, Boston, etc and all flights were cancelled which tells me that the weather issue was not the destination or on route, it was the source (New York), and seeing that there was actually no rain an just some clouds, it seems ludicrous that they would have us believe that the flights were cancelled due to bad weather.  The fact that these sorts of things must happen every day, so for me to spend 6 hours in a airport, sorting everything from flights, to accommodation, to taxis, to my lost luggage which up to today no one had logged a ticket for, is absolutely unacceptable and it boggles my mind that they are still operating with this level of inefficiency, lack of procedure and incompetence.",Business,1.0,nan

It was not weather - it was that this airline could not handle the magnitude of flights booked for the Holiday Weekend and did not have enough Pilots. Maybe if the customer service team was a bit more caring, efficient and helpful, I would consider flying with Jet Blue, but not even one ounce of remorse or care-that shows me how valued we are as customers.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

nan,Economy Class,3.0,June 2017,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,Chicago O'Hare to Vermont via JFK,1.0," |  Based on my experiences of 6/22/2017 and 6/24/2017 I will never purchase another fare from JetBlue and I will never recommend them to anyone. In the spring I began making plans to attend my daughters graduation from grad school in Vermont. Using Expedia, I searched for a reasonable fare and decided on JetBlue. The fares I purchased included a flight from O'Hare to JFK with a short layover at JFK and then a flight to Vermont. The same package in reverse was available for us three days later when we wanted to return home. So in all I purchased three fares, one for myself, my husband and youngest daughter and altogether, we were scheduled for two flights to get to Vermont and two flights to return to Chicago. On the drive into O'Hare on the morning of 6/22/2017 I received a text message that the flight to JFK and then the connecting flight to Vermont had been cancelled. There was no reasonable explanation given. Here were all my hopes of getting to Vermont cancelled in a brief, cold text message. I called Expedia who helped me arrange for another flight to Burlington but they also told me to keep the flight with JetBlue for my return flight on 6/24/2017 as they hadn't cancelled those two flights. Bad idea. I should of cancelled it and made changes right then but I thought this kind of event was something unusual. On Saturday 6/24/2017 when we went to the airport in Vermont to depart, the JetBlue flight was delayed for around four hours. JetBlue arranged for us to get a later connecting flight to Chicago that was suppose to leave around 6.00. When we got to JFK, the flight to Chicago was on the board and it said ""on time"". I think we may have been there an hour or so and suddenly the status of the flight was changed to ""cancelled"". Again, we got no answers or help from JetBlue's customer service with the exception of telling us where we could pick up our checked bag in the airport and rescheduling a plane the next day that we later learned would supposedly leave some time around 2.00 in afternoon and get us home by 9.30 after two connecting flights. Fearing we would be stranded in yet another city we made other arrangements. Essentially, we were left stranded at JFK by JetBlue. There were no available hotel rooms this weekend as it was Pride weekend in New York City and all the hotels were booked. We searched for rooms, Expedia searched for us and after using the services at JFK we learned there was nothing available. We were given no help or direction from JetBlue that was meaningful or helpful in our situation. We had never been to New York and only expected our stay to be a brief one as a connecting flight. No room, no reciprocity with another carrier. So to be clear, three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message. I will never fly JetBlue ever again. I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance. There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an attitude of ""aww too bad"" and your on your own. I would like to thank the people who did help us at JFK but they were were from a different carrier, who actually got us home the next morning.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

I ended up hanging out in the corner near the gate's counter for about 5 hours, watching the Jetblue employees work. They seemed to be very friendly and accommodating with the flyers and I imagine it was very stressful. After sitting in the corner for 5 hours, one of the Jetblue employees asked to see my ticket and put me in a much better, premium seat and allowed me to board first because he felt bad I had spent so many hours at the gate.

I felt like I was in kindergarten with a make-believe airline. I booked through Emirates. Foolish me, instead of booking a direct flight out of IAD with Emirates, I thought to save several hundred dollars by booking a cheaper flight with connecting JetBlue flights through BOS and JFK. Big mistake. I should have paid the premium for an Emirates only booking and completely avoid JetBlue. Flight staff have the friendliness but incompetence of high school interns. Weather delay I understand. I drove through the rainstorm. At the check-in counter, I specifically asked the staff  at the counter if I would make my connecting flight to Emirates in BOS. He responded that the connection was tight but good. Wrong. At the gate, just before boarding, I and four other people were informed that we would miss our connections, and needed interline tickets. The staff at the gate spent an hour on the phone getting interline tickets for the other four passengers, and when she got to me, then after another twenty minutes on the phone, she informed me that I had just missed an interline ticket with Qatar Airways by fifteen minutes, and could only go the next day - a loss of 24 hours for me. She talked to me in the nicest department store customer service voice, but was incompetent. I missed a whole day on my vacation. JetBlue should have booked the interline ticket immediately at the check-in counter when they had told me that the connection to my Emirates flight out of BOS was tight. Returning connection JFK to IAD. I landed at JFK timely with Emirates, and put my checked bag on the connections check-in counter, and proceeded to JetBlue Terminal. I saw on the Departures Board that my connecting JetBlue flight from JFK to IAD was several hours away, but that there was an earlier JetBlue flight. I asked the staff at the Help Desk if I could get a boarding pass for the earlier flight. He asked me if I had a checked bag, and I replied that I already had checked in my bag at the transfer connecting flights counter. And so then he said that ""no"" I couldn't get an earlier flight because my bag was already checked in for the later flight and was going to be on that flight. Okay, fine. I understand. So I took my originally booked flight, my first actual flight on a JetBlue aircraft, which took off about two hours late (being a small discount aircraft flight at the very end of the day, I kind of understand that.) Upon arrival at IAD, I looked and looked for my checked bag at Carousel 10. After many bags went by, I looked around the carousel, and saw my bag sitting inside the JetBlue baggage office. It had come on the earlier flight! So here I am at Dulles at two o'clock in the morning with my bag, calling for my pickup ride, when I could have been calling for my pickup ride at a more civilized hour in the early evening! I specifically asked the staff at the gate if food would be provided onboard the aircraft. I was told ""no."" So I stocked up on some snacks at the nearby snack kiosk. Needless, I was served cookies and Sprite onboard. I shall never book JetBlue again. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I had a shuttle to catch in the morning and it cost $350 to reschedule the shuttle because I was traveling five hours away from the airport. If they had just cancelled it to begin with I could have booked with another airline to make it there on time. I ended up going to a completely different airport and flying with United, who bumped me to first class! I made it to Costa Rica on time because of them. JetBlue gave me more than a headache, it was an absolute disaster of a travel experience, a nightmare, and they offered no compensation other than a refund. They randomly booked me on another flight that I never asked for (I was booking with another airline who could get me there on time), and I had to spend over an hour on the phone with a JetBlue agent to reimburse me the money properly.

Left Richmond VA for Punta Cana, DR via Fort Lauderdale on Aug 3. #645/#173. 2.5 hour delay from FL because apparently, Jetblue neglected to assign a pilot to the flight! Called Jetblue from terminal, and was informed that I must have misunderstood gate employee as no one from Jetblue would ever make such an announcement re: the lack of a pilot! I explained to rep that we were meeting group from NY in DR to share hour transport to hotel that had already been paid for. Rep went on to explain they would need at least 5 days to evaluate who was at fault for the delay of a flight with no pilot assigned and to call back at that time to see if we would be compensated. Needless to say we had to pay another $70.00 for transport to hotel. Return trip: From Punta Cana, DR to Boston (#896) for lay over, then on to Richmond VA.(#1281). Left DR at 12:48 with 5:00 arrival time in Boston to catch a 6:50 connection to Richmond. When we were still in the air at 5:15, expressed concern to flight attendant that we would be unable to get through customs and traverse the entire airport in what was looking like less than an hour. We were assured we would have no problem. Landed and got off plane about 5:35, flew through terminal begging anyone who would listen, customs, Jetblue employees, TSA, etc. that we had a connecting flight. They couldn't care less. Even had Jetblue employee send us in the totally wrong direction dragging 3 suitcases which probably cost us at least 15 precious minutes. Thank God for the other passengers on TSA line who let us cut to front! My poor husband got through 1st and went flying to gate to beg that they await our arrival only to discover flight had already closed doors at 6:35! First we were told there was another flight to Richmond at 7:00. Then we were informed that was a mistake, the next was at 9:00 pm. Asked to speak with supervisor who was only interested in the specifics of our flight times, and then informed us that the problem was with whomever booked our flight as Jetblue always recommends at least 2 hours between connecting flights to avoid exactly what we just went through. When we informed him we had booked the entire trip through Jetblue Vacations, and shouldn't his airline know their own policy, he had nothing to say! In the middle of exchange, another employee came over, whispered in his ear and and he took off-no explanation. After waiting 20 minutes because of course, the supervisor of an airline in the middle of hearing a complaint from one of their customers would return, we went looking for him! Found him behind a counter talking to another employee. Watched for about 5/10 minutes until he turned around and saw me. This guy had no intention of returning to finish our conversation! So-long story short, we got a $40 voucher for food which in airline-ese is 2 hamburgers - found out our luggage had somehow made the very flight we missed and got home to Richmond at midnight.

Traveling back from Florida with my wife and two young daughters Jetblue sent me an email at 7:47am, 3 hours before my flight 2020 FLL-Worcester was scheduled to take off at 11:06am, that our flight was canceled. Agents on the phone were no help, only offering a flight leaving at 9:25am as an option. They claimed the flight was canceled for mechanical issues; somehow I don't believe that and this was some sort of cost saving cancellation. We rushed to the airport for the 9:25am flight only to be met by bumbling ticket agents who couldn't process customers quick enough. When it was out turn we were locked out. After running in-between terminals we were re-booked on Flight 376 to Philadelphia with a connection to Boston (yes, not our original destination). Flight 376 which was scheduled to depart at 1:32pm was a fiasco from the start. The flight boarded all passengers only to tell us that we'd be delayed as the flight had no water so they needed to wait for hand sanitizer - this wait was over 40 minutes. Stormy weather blew in, the runway was closed and we missed the window. After several openings and closings of the runway we finally took off at 3:30pm - 2 hours after our scheduled departure. The late takeoff meant we would cut it very close for our connecting flight 660 out of Philadelphia for Boston. I received a notification on my phone that the flight had been delayed till 6pm. With our estimated arrival in Philadelphia of 5:45pm I was hoping we'd be able to just make it. I asked the stewardess to speak with the captain as there were around 15 of us that had our Worcester flight 2020 canceled and were rebooked on these flights. I dreaded the thought of missing my connection because of the plane's lack of water and need for a hand-sanitizer delivery that took 40 minutes. The stewardess returned and said she spoke with the captain who would try to hold the flight. About 10 minutes before our landing another stewardess went on the intercom and told all theBoston bound passengers to relax because our gate was right next to Boston flight 660's E2, and that the plane would wait for us as the captain had called ahead. That was a major relief to hear that news. She also explained that we'd be let off the plane first ahead of other passengers to expedite our plane change. This was also a relief to hear considering my carry-ons and precious kid cargo. I nearly texted my father to pick us up at Logan (he was driving from N. Grafton in Worcester county), but I hesitated, wanting to be 100% sure. Well, unfortunately my apprehension proved deserved. When the door to the plane opened there wasn't any parting of the seas to let us through. In fact, both stewardesses who communicated with us disappeared, presumably shying away from the hidden truth. I yelled aloud whether we were being let off first but no one replied. I then looked out the plane's window - there wasn't any plane at E2 - flight 660 had already taken off! I walked down the gate corridor completely bewildered; the crew members were still nowhere to be seen. Upon exiting the gate, the JetBlue ticket agent handed me a new set of tickets. I asked where flight 660 went? The agent replied that it had taken off at 5:47, 13 minutes ahead of schedule and that we were now rebooked on the 8:41pm flight 760.

After another hour or so, all of us (including those who had already boarded the plane twice) were forced off into the terminal with all of our stuff. Five hours after the original departure time, we finally reboarded (some passengers for the third time) and eventually took off. The entertainment system cut in and out the entire trip, going dark for ten minutes at a time. There were no apologies given for that problem or the delays, just a passing thank you ""for your patience"" before the final (re-re)boarding. The crew members were pleasant throughout the ordeal, but they work for a complete joke of an airline. If I were New York, I would force it to remove the ""New York's Airline"" advertising that is up around town-to avoid guilt by association. ",Business,2.0,1.0

And I don't think anyone was charged for his drinks. On top of that, eveyone has a screen in front him/her to watch DirectTV, or if the flight is more than two hours, free movies!

They delayed it an hour at a time over seven times and then they completely cancelled the flight at 2PM. There were no other flights from JetBlue until the next day, meaning most of us lost money on hotels, shuttles, and time wasted. They did not give me a credit for the time lost, they just partially refunded me for the ticket since I was also coming back from Costa Rica flying JetBlue. I am now in Orlando, trying to get back home to New Jersey, and the same nightmare is happening again. They delayed it by an hour and a half. Now they've delayed it by another 45 minutes. They are notorious for great customer service if you can actually make it on the plane. I have never had such an absolutely awful experience, and this has happened to me twice within a two week period, at two separate airports.

So we had to wait for 3 extra hours in the airport after checking through security because even though the flight was obviously delayed they still want you at the gate at the original boarding time - how non sensical is this?

We stopped to get coffee next door to our gate (Gate 28) and proceeded to our gate more than 15 minutes prior to departure time only to see the gate had already closed and we were not allowed board our flight, yet our luggage is on the flight. There was not a courtesy page, no announcement of flight boarding, no final boarding announcement, nothing. We had to watch our flight take off in front of us. This is a huge inconvenience because this delays our trip by hours because we had to rebook on another flight which gets us to Charleston at 4:56 pm versus our original arrival of 8:40am. Poor customer service at its finest. I wish I would have read these reviews before booking with Jetblue as I see this is quite common.

Tried asking for the man's name who flagged down an English speaking employee who called his superior and stated that was the norm, yet provided no sympathy or other assistance. In tears, I went to the justask desk and asked if they could do anything whatsoever. Nope! Not even a ""lunchbox"". I didn't think customer service this bad was possible.

My husband and I had booked a trip to go to Montego Bay, Jamaica for our honeymoon, our flight was delayed multiple times without reasoning. Staff members refused to elaborate the cause very cold and unprofessional. Upon calling JetBlue customer service the representative failed to give any reasoning and was very unapologetic. To make matters even worse we had the same experience returning to JFK. I recently canceled a trip booked via Expedia due to a medical occurrence and Jetblue nor Expedia are willing to refund my money, even considering the fact I purchased travel insurance (in the event something beyond my control was to happen, resulting in not being able to travel).

The flight ended up leaving 10 minutes early and they couldn't wait a single minute to let me on it. I went to complain and the supposed ""customer service representative"" didn't care. She wouldn't even look at me when I was talking. When I was finished she tried to argue with me until her coworker said ""It's not worth arguing with him.""

No hesitation whatsoever.

They didn't even charge for the ticket change. To top this off, when we arrived at the gate, the flight attendant who recognized us from our previous flight came up to say hello. He asked us what seats we had and after realizing we were way in the back, he immediately changed our seats to the ""Even More Leg-Room"" seats without us even asking for it. No charge either!

On Tuesday, Oct 24, I flew non-stop from JFK to MBJ and the flight crew on Flight 479 was the best I have ever encountered. Staff were courteous, friendly, and top notch individuals.

Bag drop is way too slow as was the baggage claim. Their new meal packs for purchase are not worth the money. On the return checkin and bag drop were better. Crew was more average. The flight was full of screaming babies. Half the TV channels didn't work and the radio broke down halfway through the flight.

Once on the plane we could not depart for 1hr. They easily could have kept us at the gate. The satellite radio is mostly obscurities and a lot of programming for political conservatives and evangelical Christians. It struck me as a very cheap product although one has to pay for earphones if a passenger doesn't have their own.

One trip from DCA to Boston was delayed 3 hours while we sat on the tarmac waiting for the plane to be de-iced. Every other airline was taking off and landing. Jet Blue told us that we had to wait for the de-icing truck because it wasn't being used that night by the other airlines but they had a higher safety standard. They had an inexperienced pilot and that kept us grounded for an extra 3 hours. I agree that the seats are comfortable but being held for hours to compensate for untrained staff is torture.,nan,nan,nan

The ERJ- 90s are a bit uncomfortable and narrow but the A320s are modern and clean. Always pay the $25 for extra leg room.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I recently flew Boston to Tampa.

Jetblue pilots usually stand in front and introduce themselves tell you the length of the flight weather etc. This one said nothing. Legroom is great and snacks are always appreciated. Yet for the second time in a row IFE didn't work. Half the channels didn't work along with several radio stations as well. I fear they are turning into just another US carrier.,nan,nan,nan

We knew this was untrue because our other family from another city had a flight to Florida the same time we did and they were able to check in and everything. After about 30 minutes of trying to negotiate with them we decided to get a refund. Being disappointed we called in to the cruise company and told them about our situation the next day.

There was a quick check on cell phones and seatbelts but they were so no nonsense about it that it was refreshing! The biggest surprises were that they offer TV for all passengers and it's good TV! They offer food! And the best was the lack of the service cart! How wonderful it was to not have to compete with the cart or time your bathroom trips so as to avoid getting stuck behind the cart. The staff was extremely efficient about helping passengers without being overwhelming. Even when they had to make announcements it was quick concise and non intrusive.

The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks. Checking-in and boarding the flight to EWR was smooth even though there was 15-minute delay due to a deluge at the airport. The only consequence is that if you don't bring your headset you would have to pay for your own which is $2. Before they used to give them away for free but now they're charging for it.,nan,4.0,nan

In order to sit next to my 13 year old daughter I had to pay $30 extra just to have 'leg room' and be seated next to one another. Planes are supposed to be ergonomically designed to carry passengers. Passengers have legs. Why do you deem it necessary to charge extra for appropriate leg space? Why not offer better food items and charge for that? That is something people might want to pay for but can do with out if necessary esp on a short flight.

Unfortunately that is the only positive part of my entire flight from Boston to Phoenix. The seats were so uncomfortable and the flight attendants were rude. When I asked if the movie would start over if I bought a head seat she looked at me like I was stupid and said no. The other flight attendant that was with her glared at me and looked at my seat number like I was going to cause problems for them when my friend asked what was the point of handing out the headsets after the movie already started. I haven't been on a flight in quite some time but I remember it being a pleasant time when customers were treated with respect.

They handled it very well were really polite and gave me a snack box free of charge but I think I should be able to order a proper meal on a 6 hour flight.

I had only one really bad flight that was delayed for about 4 hours but that was the worst of it. There are no ""middle seats"" as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts - the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron. I like that.

When it was time to board the plane they took everybody  except the disabled persons first including children in strollers. I think a person with a kidney machine should trump a child with a stroller for boarding. When we got onto the plane I asked one on the flight attendants where we could store this somewhat heavy kidney machine. She promptly told us there was no room to store it other than the overhead bin. I told her I couldn't lift this machine over my head.

There was chaos in the airport due to the number of flights JetBlue cancelled at once and its unwillingness to assist the customers to find replacement flights. They kept announcing over the loud speakers that they had no replacement availability for several days and that customers should not even try to rebook with JetBlue's airport personnel. That is extremely inconvenient once one is at the airport with luggage. We ended up buying new tickets on a JetBlue flight 6 hrs later but that flight after being delayed 3 or 4 times was also cancelled - due to there not being a pilot or co-pilot available! That was 6 hrs after the scheduled departure time! We found a JetBlue flight that had a few unoccupied seats and a sympathetic agent got clearance to allow us to swap our second ticket for that flight. That one agent was the only helpful person we encountered at Jet Blue. We still do not have our luggage which was set ticketed for the cancelled flight.

The flight was smooth but the audio jack was overused and my headset plug was constantly falling out if I moved the wrong way. Return flight was not as smooth the gate changed 6 times at FLL and was very confusing. IFE was not working at my seat but was given a $15 voucher for future flight although it expires within the year. Flight was also moderately turbulent with no feedback from the flight crew.

Then there were maitenance issues. The part that baffles me is that there was no reason for the initial delay! In theory when you book a flight there is supposed to be a plane available as well as a crew and pilot. I have no idea how this was cause for delay aside from total imcompetance which was made up for by nothing except an announcement that there would be no running water on the flight.

Before takeoff we each enjoyed a couple of their delicious signature drinks (they're small). After takeoff we were offered more drinks a Birchbox full of gender specific spa products and dinner. Out of 5 or 6 items we were permitted to choose 3 small plates an appetizer and dessert. Honestly I found some of the food excellent and some not quite as good. They were more than happy to replace one of my choices that I wasn't too happy with. The entertainment was great live TV and free wifi. The movies are not on-demand which made it so that I wasn't able to watch one because I was too distracted with the rest of the Mint experience to pay attention to the start times. In case dinner doesn't fill you the A321 has a self-serve snack bar behind the Mint cabin for anytime bagged snacks and drinks. The seats themselves were comfortable for a 5 hour domestic flight. I liked the firmness controls and massage feature. We sat in a 2 seat bank so we could sit together but the single suites looked very nice for people traveling alone. The single seats have more personal space and a privacy door too. Jetblue really thought our the Mint product well. If you book enough in advance the introductory price is a terrific value.

Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed. The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width. You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean. The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie-flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen. As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience - you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined. Okay selection of feature films but not VOD. The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored. The wi-fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss; fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions. Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew (no pun intended) by. At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value. Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines. jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again.,nan,5.0,nan

Overall it ranked higher than most excellent business class carriers and felt more like BA First which I had just flew in on. The level of the service is high as well as the experience. Meals are better than most carriers and was completely impressed. What I liked the most was the Suite which was private and comfortable with plenty of room for a bed with great bedding. Was completely surprised by this level of service in US. The only downside was the movies were not running but there was plenty of other options. The amenities kit and head set are all top notch.

All this while the lines got longer and their staff stood around chatting. Out of 13 desks 6 were open while I counted at least 9 JetBlue staff hanging around doing nothing except chat. Finally got to the gate only for their personnel there not having a clue about getting passengers onboard in a logical order.

While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight. I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare. I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones.,nan,3.0,nan

After waiting nearly an hour to talk to the agents I am greeted by two very unhelpful or sympathetic agents. Our flight was cancelled because there was a mechanical failure on the plane scheduled for Boston so they used the Tampa plane instead. This information came from other customers in line who got it from their booking agents - not the Jetblue agents serving us. They tell me they can get me out two days later and if I want to get to Tampa the next day my best option is to cancel the return leg and book another flight with another airline as JetBlue doesn't have any partnerships. So I go ahead and do that. Book a flight for $300 with American for the next am and go to baggage drop area to collect my bag I had checked in earlier. There I was told I could get vouchers toward the hotel dinner etc. I collect my bag and am told by the agent there that since I cancelled my flight with JetBlue it is not in their hands any more and they can't compensate hotel etc. She did offer me a $12 voucher to use toward snacks at the airport. All in all this episode cost me an extra $400 (extra hotel cabs new ticket). I understand mechanical failures happen. I travel a lot all of the world.

I had really low expectations given that this airline is not a big name like others out there but I'm happy to say I had an excellent experience. Both my flights were on time they offered free snacks (no peanuts here legit snacks!) and soda/tea/coffee. The service and the whole experience was great.

As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule. We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight. It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane. This is a huge unsanitary issue that should never occur on a plane.",nan,1.0,nan

At least one lady in the row in front of me had a TV that did not work so they reset the system. Not a big deal but if you purchased content and already watching that would be a huge pain. Going to miss when they reduce the pitch as the 34' current is great. Arrived slightly early but the crew seemed a bit disinterested to passengers as departing.

One being a leaky valve and the second due to weather (out-of-JetBlues control). JetBlue worked really hard to keep me happy and remain their customer. They provided me a credit no questions asked since the delays affected my transportation routes. For them to do that shows that this type of thing does not happen very often. I will also say that the unlimited snacks beverages not to mention all the leg room was a plus. Although I did not have a perfect experience I would definitely recommend JetBlue. Things happen but JetBlue owns up to it and works hard to keep you a satisfied customer. I respect that and their business model of good customer service.

Even though we bought the tickets together and we were assigned 2 rows apart, we thought we could handle this situation at the airport, as we did before with other airlines. We arrived at the airport and went to the check-in counter to speak with someone. The lady there told us that there is nothing to do if we don't upgrade our seats for an 80$ fee as it looks like we bought the last two tickets and these were the last two places.  When we arrived to the gate the gentleman there said ""please come here if you don't have a seat assigned on your ticket in order to give you one"". And that was the moment I realized we were fooled by this company. We went there and asked, how can we have bought the last 2 tickets in this aircraft and have the last two spots in the middle if there are people with no seat assigned? And he just told me “I said you can upgrade for 80$, if you don’t just have a nice trip, bye”. They were rude and impolite, they didn’t solve our problem and it was clear that they have a software that automatically assigns you and your partner far apart just to upgrade and pay more money. None of us was assigned at the window or the aisle because it’s harder to switch places in the aircraft with someone if you are assigned in the middle (if one of us would have had aisle or window seat would have been much easier).

We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out. We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience.

I had plenty of entertainment; they give you free access to DirectTV through the screen in front of you, in addition to free SiriusXM satellite radio and free WiFi.

Not to mention, the crew were confused (albeit very nice though) and sent me to 4 wrong locations just to inquire about the switch.

This was probably one of the worst experiences I had in over 20 years of regular flying. From the beginning till the very end. We experienced a delay due to weather conditions. However, the ground staff was not helpful at all. A lot of us had connecting flights, and we asked that they contact the airlines we were flying with to check the status. They refused. We asked that they give us the telephone numbers of the airline so that we, the passengers, can contact them. They refused. And as the wifi was not working in the terminal, it was difficult to get the numbers. We got it, despite the refusal of the JetBlue staff. We asked to be rerouted to other airlines who were taking off. They refused. We had over 6 hours delay, and as they refused to contact the connecting international airlines, we missed (9 of us) the connection by few minutes. And then, the real nightmare started. In JFK, they were incapable of locating our luggage. It took them hours to tell us that finally, they can't locate it and we need to come back the next day. As there were no seats available on my connecting flight for few days, I needed to get my luggage. And when we were trying to rebook, the people standing at the counters would not take us, as 'they had to be free for first class passengers, in case they came, so they could not serve us'. For a low cost airline, this sounds like a joke. The result was a long queue before one of the counter, and at the other, the woman starring and not accepting any passenger. After 6:30 hours delay and additional 3 hours of trying to figure out what to do, this was a particularly bad experience. The next day, they were incapable of saying where the luggage is. I lost the whole day until I finally got my luggage. I heard all type of excuses: as my luggage was initially checked through to the final destination, it was difficult to locate it (do they know how t use bar codes?), or it was not clear where the luggage was, etc. I finally got my luggage thanks to the assistance from the other airline, who tried to help, as JetBlue was incapable. But they clearly said that this was a JetBlue problem. I also asked JetBlue to give me a confirmation about the delay, so that my insurance can assist me. They refused. They said that my insurance (from Europe) had to call the 0800 number to get a confirmation. But they are not providing a confirmation. I spoke to not less than 4 different people, including the one claiming to be the supervisor, they refused. Throughout the whole nightmare, the one thing that they kept saying consistently was 'I cannot', 'I don't know', 'It is not JetBlue's problem', 'it is not possible'. There was no customer service, no desire to help, no desire to find a solution whatsoever, from pretty much everybody working at this company. The result of all this is: I will never ever fly with JetBlue. They are the worst airline I've used, and the one flight with them will be the very last.",Business,1.0,nan

She also told me she'd leave a note in my file that this was something I was inquiring about.

I called again, totally willing to pay the fees just to get my father home and out of a sad situation. A woman on the end of the line was an absolute angel. She saw the note in my file and shortly afterwards, my father had a ticket booked home for day, with a seat close to the front, and for much lower than the originally expected cost.

Entertainment on the plane also was great and provided plenty of options even for a flight this short. It is a pity that the superb service on the plane did little to offset my initial impression after security check and before boarding. The flight arrived into IAD just in time for me to run from opposite ends in IAD terminals to catch an overnight connecting flight, luckily I had only a carry on and no terminal change was required. The thing is I left with the impression that the airline did little to expedite our boarding process (could have anticipated boarding for 15 or so minutes at least), showing no care for its passengers time gate.

This was perplexing, as I happened to be leaving Boston at the same time as friends flying different airlines — none of their flights were canceled. When I called customer service, I was told that the cancellation was due to weather, and that 'all the other airlines would be canceling their flights in the morning' as well. I was initially told that my only option was to take the next JetBlue flight out of Boston at approx. 1.30pm. I was then told that flight was full, my remaining option was to take a Wednesday flight, staying two additional nights in Boston at my own expense. I asked to be rebooked on another airline, and was told I would have to rebook it myself. I was offered a refund, which the representative later clarified would be only a half refund. I rebooked with American for a flight leaving at 8.00am, a mere 40 minutes ahead of my original JetBlue flight. Surprise, surprise, it left perfectly on time. Unfortunately, my new one-way ticket cost more than my original roundtrip with JetBlue. In situations such as this, JetBlue is unable to provide a comparable level of service as other airlines. They have a practice of preemptively canceling flights, especially those flights which are not full in an effort to control *potential* delays in other parts of the country. If I hadn’t had access to internet in order to rebook immediately, I would likely still be in Boston. It I hadn’t had the available funds to rebook at my own expense, I would still be in Boston without any place to stay. I must add however, that since returning home Jetblue has offered to reimburse me for the entirety of the rebooked ticket. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Even thought I explain him that I had an nonstop flight, but because of the situation of the storm they didn’t give me any choice but to accept the laid over.

From 3:49pm to 7:30pm I received multiple emails of flight delays, then corrected to on time, then delayed, then on time, then delayed from 10pm departure to 1am departure. I called the airline to complain that this did not seem as a weather delay even though it was insisted multiple times that it was, but as internal issues, seeing as they knew the plane from NY was delayed to us by 2 hours and we kept receiving multiple changes. You can track a plane on flight aware and know when it will take off and land. I explained my case and the manager states “so you want a refund”. I said I think that is fair seeing as this is clearly not a weather delay because you can track the plane that was supposed to pick us up, and the airline knew since 3:49pm it was not going to make it. She refunded my money but did not say anything about cancelling our tickets. Maybe I am just ignorant, but I thought the airline was refunding my money because they valued their clients.  Thankfully we realized she cancelled our tickets because the App no longer found our reservation. I called back to in fact confirm with a live person a manager cancelled my reservation without telling me, then had to void the refund, was charged again, and received our places back on the flight. Now I am sitting exhausted in the airport, as I write, being told the flight was delayed actually by a mechanical issue. Not by a flight delay from the planes previous destination, as I expected all along. But at least my husband and I have a ticket to board and didnt get to the airport with no reservation because the woman failed to tell me she completely cancelled our flight. That would have been another aggravating battle to deal with. What are we supposed to stay in Salt Lake City for the rest of our lives?!? As far as I’m concerned every passenger should be refunded for the lies this airline has said to their customers. We will never fly this airline again.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Even on the short 49 minute hop from Newark to Boston (and at 5.30 am, I might add), the cabin crew and pilots were quite warm, friendly, and very helpful. My carry-on was unable to fit in the overhead bins, so the FA placed my bag in an empty seat so we didn’t have to gate-check it. Early departure and arrival, pilots provided arrival gate info in the air. Snack and drink service was efficient and quick. Cozy leather seats, albeit a bit old. IFE was medicore, but appreciated!

I flew in on Thursday with economy plus more room seats. On the way back from San Francisco’s to NY, the plane was maybe 30% full and mostly empty. We kindly waited for everyone to board to see if the row in front of us which had a few extra inches of leg room would be vacant (I am 6’3 so those extra inches would make a big difference). When the plane doors closed and we were ready to roll, I kindly asked the flight attendant to let me move one row up considering it was empty, she immediately went on the most uncomfortable rant about extremely strict policies (which isn’t true I fly with JetBlue and virgin airlines only and always had very nice flight crews tell me absolutely no problem as long as no one sits here when the doors are shut, feel free) long story short the flight attendant was so adamant about not letting me move even though the plane was more than half empty and it was so unpleasant considering I love this airline along with virgin airline. I will no longer fly JetBlue for this reason and this is all about principle. Extremely uncomfortable situation to pretend like they can’t move you whatsoever. I will only fly virgin from now on.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,Detroit to Fort Lauderdale,4.0," |  Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. I am very disappointed in my recent flying experience with Jet Blue. My boyfriend and I were traveling to Cancun for a getaway, on the way there we had a connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale with a layover time of 43 minutes. We were delayed as the plane needed to be deiced prior to takeoff, which set us back 25 minutes. Our flight was a smooth flight, landing in fort Lauderdale 22 minutes prior to us needing to get on our connecting. However, due to us arriving a bit later than scheduled time we had no gate to run into therefore waited on the runway for 20 minutes, causing us to miss our connecting. We were informed by the pilot that he got confirmation from the pilot that they would hold the doors. The crew allowed us to get off the plane first and race (and mean race) to our gate. Jetblue closed the doors 1 minute prior to us getting to our gate. We ran to the desk however the gentlemen informed us we were too late the doors have already been closed. I informed him the pilot was aware we were minutes late however he said that’s too bad once the doors are closed they are closed. The customer service received at the help desk was ridiculous. The attendant advised us there was nothing they could do other than put us on the next flight which was scheduled for the next day. I told them that was in 24 hours from now and they said we could sleep in the airport. We requested to speak to a manager as we were receiving little help or support. 1 hour later no manager arrived. I phoned JetBlue and advised them of our situation and in turn they offered us a free stay at a nearby hotel. Better than sleeping on a stiff airport chair. I am writing this review so customers/future customers flying with JetBlue can see the hassle my boyfriend and I went through. I am thankful we received a night however if a gate would have been opened we never would have had to spend 3 hours at the airport trying to make alternative arrangements and would have enjoyed the day/night paid for at the all inclusive resort. Not a good way to spend your anniversary! I would also like to add - if you are connecting to another flight using the same airline and you are Within minutes of reaching your gate, the pilots should communicate with each other.

Seems 20 minutes after dropping off the rental car we get the delay notice, 1 hour, getting updates but been here for six hours now. We could have stayed in the rental and enjoyed the days, instead we are sitting with about 600 customers. The delay is due to a breakdown with the plane. I asked at the other gates that were delayed and all stated there was a concern with the plane.  I guess I have no choice as I am stuck here.

Had a limo waiting for us upon pick up that was paid for and bought tickets to a show as well. Flight delayed four times now. I called after the first time and the guy said it was due to weather, so I was understanding, you can’t control the weather - delayed the second time and the guy at the counter said it was due to the plane not leaving Havana Cuba yet. Delayed a 3rd time; getting pretty frustrated at this point and call again. They can only say sorry. Doesn’t help me. Then delayed a 4th time. It’s now not supposed to leave until 12:45AM. Our entire night is cancelled and ruined. I looked at the board and it looked like every Jetblue flight was delayed.  I promise they used to be good; but they aren’t anymore.

Whole rows of screens were not working and flickering quickly. My row fortunately worked at first, but then failed about 2 hours into the flight. The attendants seemed to have trouble speaking clearly over the intercom. The plane was also uncomfortably hot.

Then an entire hour later they ran into an “over fueling” issue that set us back. The JetBlue staff stated that specific plane was ready for take off to San Juan PR and was not prepared to travel to Fort Lauderdale with that much fuel and had to wait for the fuel service to come and fix the problem. My sister and I had our children with us and had to board the carnival cruise by 3:30pm at the Miami port which is at least 45mins away from Fort Lauderdale with traffic. We did not leave Bradley until about 10:10am. So as you figured we did not make it in time to board our cruise for my sons 8th birthday.

I called Jetblue back to have them refund my flight and see if they could refund me the extra $269.00 it cost for my new flight. They refused and said they would only refund the cost of the flight and give a $100 flight voucher for my 'inconvenience'. Beware of Jetblue when there are problems, if you've read anything on this page you should see that they are ill prepared for issues or to compensate customers for what could be severe financial burdens.

The Jet Blue personnel is absolutely unprofessional, they didn’t even apologize, and just blamed us by saying that we supposed to come earlier. The whole situation is ridiculous!

nan,Economy Class,2.0,June 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,Sacramento to New York JFK,2.0," |  Extremely disappointed. I've actually been recommending Jetblue Airways even though it has the lowest rating. We had a weather delay which is understandable. We deplaned at the 3 hour mark. We sat at the gate an additional hour and half waiting for further instruction when we were told the flight was cancelled, to get our bags and call the 1-800 number for further assistance. The crew walked off saying they were off duty. The 800 number representatives refer you back to the airport staff which now we can't speak with as we were no longer in the security area. The retrieving of bags was a total mess, it took at least 2 hours for our bags to get pulled off due to so many cancellations. Now I have to wait 2 days to get a flight out not even comparable to the original booking. Isn't a whole plane full of cancelled people enough to add the additional flight that's already been paid for? The worst thing is Delta flew in the same weather, they never deplaned and actually got off the ground and to their destination. I was also told ""the system world automatically rebook my flight"". When I enquired about this process there was no clear understanding by the representative as to how this even happens. At this point.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,nan,1.0,1.0,no,Boston to PIT,1.0," | We were done in Boston and went to the airport. We had boarding passes for 10 pm flight. Most airlines let you fly standby same day as it gives them more opportunities to sell higher tickets later. Checkin manager could not care less. $150 to fly earlier. We went to the gate and none of their employees would help. 4 planes left with empty seats. Is that good customer service? Why advertise and send us ""specials"" every Tuesday if that is how you treat good customers? We can talk about the nonworking direct tv, or joke website which does not save info, kicks you off and has not improved in 15 years with the internet or flight delays when it is convenient for you, but you rudely treat good customers and train employees not to use common sense. Just booked our Sept flight to Boston on Delta.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,June 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Portland to New York JFK,3.0," |  Portland to New York JFK. Pros: Lots of free snacks such as: pop chips, sweet potato chips, cheeze its, and choc chip cookies. In flight wifi that includes free messaging. In flight TV channels. Cons: Very limited number of airports they fly in and out of within the US. Their planes have an outdated interior, like really outdated. TV screens on the back of seats that are super pixelated and are no bigger than 5'x5' squares. This is your only means of watching the inflight TV channels and movies. The movies have to be started at the beginning of your flight, they start on their own channel and can't be paused. They charge $80+ for the exit row. I personally had a not great experience on my flight home when our six hour flight was delayed due to ""catering"" only to then be told that catering couldn't make it to our plane so they just left without the food for the flight. I also ended up in a seat with a broken headphone jack that only emitted a high pitched squeal so I couldn't watch the tv. The TV tray at my seat was also broken, causing anything on it to slide into the aisle. I reported all these things to JetBlue, only to be told that my trouble was worth a $15 refund. I paid $650 roundtrip.",Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0
A321,Business Class,5.0,June 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,New York to Las Vegas,5.0, | Excellent flight with jetblue Mint business class. Our bags were taken to get checked in by a lovely jetblue mint team member. We got expedited security clearance too. We boarded on time and got seated. Our flight attendants came round and introduced themselves and asked if this was our first time flying mint. Our amenity kits and a little note were left on the seat. They came round with noise cancelling headphones for everyone. They asked if we would like a drink and myself and my husband chose the refresh mint cocktail. They came round and cleared cups before we took off. Bottles of water provided at every seat in advance. Seat was super comfortable I loved the fact the offer directTV entertainment this was great. The inflight wifi worked perfect and I could stream facebook live. The food again was lovely we ordered the plane eats menu and everything was tasty. The only slight gripe was that the croutons on the salad were soggy. But that's all I could say. Excellent selection of alcoholic drinks. Ice cream for pudding and I chose a lovely freshly brewed coffee. A decent choice of wines with our meal. I settled down as we flew at night and got around 3 hours sleep. It was lovely. The duvet pillow and seat were all comfortable. Cabin and toilets all clean. They left us a milkbar cookie to take home. I would definitely fly jetblue mint again.,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,nan,2.0,nan,no,Ft Lauderdale to Cancun,2.0," |  Me and my wife had a bad experience with Jetblue's staff on a flight to Cancun from Ft Lauderdale. Our 21 month old toddler was crying a lot with no clear reasons why. My wife and I were trying our best to calm her down. The air hostess comes over and says that we need to calm her down because we were disturbing other passengers! Of course we don't want our baby to be crying and do NOT want her to be distressed. We were trying our best to soothe her down but nothing was helping. This was totally unexpected. When the airline was contacted, they did apologize, but at the same time, they reiterated that the air hostess did not do anything wrong. So basically, Jetblue is a non infant/toddler friendly airline for sure. And they support their staff when they do anything wrong.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,1.0,3.0,5.0,yes,New York to Los Angeles,5.0," |  I am reviewing two flights, the first from LAX to JFK. I really like that the airline treats adults as adults and not like children, they have a more hands off attitude, non hovering. The system is quite efficient and flows well. There don't appear to be any meals on board which became a problem on our return from JFK to LAX. The plane was boarded 3 hours late, each update was another 15 minute delay making it impossible to get some food before boarding. We ate a small breakfast thinking we could easily get to our destination as scheduled and eat an early dinner once in LA. The delay made the on flight snacks barely adequate and we were starving once we arrived. There are no healthy snacks, the only offerings are potato chip type bags with carbohydrate and fat loaded ingredients. I guess that's ok if your 20 years old but for many it is undesirable,unhealthy and inadequate. When my wifes Southwest flight was delayed two hours she received a $100 voucher, so far we have seen nothing from Jet Blue and that's okay, we understand delays occur but they need to have contingency preparations in place. There are many things to like about Jet Blue, the seats are very comfortable, the legroom is good, the entertainment screens are excellent. This is an airline that wants to excel, and I think it does, perhaps the decision makers need to take a flight and experience what the traveler experiences and they would understand any deficiencies better. One last thing, the cabin temperature was very cold, I am 63 and needed a jacket, often times I think my age makes me less tolerant of cold but the 30 year old lady sitting next to me had the blanket on and couldn't cover up enough, she was also quite uncomfortable.",Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Charlotte to New York,1.0," |  This will be my first JetBlue experience and it will be my last. My flight was supposed to leave at 10am this morning- it’s after midnight and I’m still at the airport. After a twice delayed flight that eventually was canceled I was booked on a flight scheduled to leave at 7:48pm. About an hour before the flight it was delayed for 2 hours. Once we received that delay there have been 5 more, now we’re supposed to leave at 2am. The crew here can’t give us clear answers, one minute it’s going to be earlier than they think the next we get another alert of a delay. Multiple other airlines have taken off from CLT to JFK, I’ve even seen a plane return from JFK that took off from CLT while I’ve been waiting. Ultimately I’d like clear, honest answers rather than deliveries of false hope. Also some kind of compensation for the extreme inconvenience would be nice- but so far it’s just been a bottle of water - disappointed to say the least.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,2.0,1.0,5.0,no,Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles ,3.0," | Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. Gate agents in LAX are extremely rude. JetBlue must have many complaints because they refuse to let customers speak with a supervisor. All communication is done through the dearjetblue site. It’s a useless back and forth where nothing gets accomplished. Furthermore, their small credit vouchers are for future use on the airline. Once again, useless for customers who no longer wish to fly JetBlue. There are other options for paying customers. Next time, I’ll take my business to another airline, especially one that has more destinations and more tactful employees.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,Aruba to Boston,1.0, |  JetBlue has become a horrible airline to fly with. On this four and a half flight there were several issues. I upgraded to more space seats for $170 because the airline strategically blocks off many of the seats so that you cannot sit with your spouse. There was no entertainment on this flight. The wifi did not work either. Apparently their entire systems were down according to the announcement. They would give you a $15 voucher IF you booked through them but would have to jump through hoops because the booking was done through Expedia. As soon as we took off the staff made an announcement that there were no sandwiches or salads available on this flight for sale. Thanks for letting us know after boarding. The plane itself was old and dirty. The seat was hard as a wood plank due to the foam material degrading. Also the cabin was freezing cold and had to spend $5 per blanket to keep warm because they would not increase cabin temperature. Worse flight I've taken in a while and that's saying something since I rarely complain.,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Jetblue cancel our flight today from Orlando to San Juan July 9, 2018 party of 6 with a Minor. They book another flight from Orlando to Ponce which is an hour and half drive they told us when we arrived to go to baggage claim in Ponce and they will give us transportation to San Juan for free. Once we arrived to Ponce at 12:30am Jetblue says that they didnt received no emails from Orlando and it was our problem we also waited 9 hours for our flight in Orlando. The supervisor in Jetblue Ponce was very rude. She didn't wanted to help us knowing that we were with a minor.

Embraer 190,Economy Class,2.0,June 2018,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes,Westchester to Tampa ,4.0," |  While my trip was for the most part satisfactory, the return trip from Tampa to Westchester was problematic to say the least. I dealt with not only an extremely rude flight crew, but the crew onboard the aircraft did little to keep the passengers updated with the status of our delay. Due to a ""cracked taxi light,"" the flight was delayed and the flight crew notified us twice, the first notification came when we were initially told about the need for repairs and a ""tape up"", and the second came over an hour later when we were told that ""we would be getting on our way shortly."" The trip down to Tampa from New York was more than satisfactory, but that return trip was problematic from the very start. I shared the sentiment of a frequent flyer one row behind me, who was very vocal about her disappointment with the airline and their handling of the delay. Despite these things, there was a very nice selection for entertainment which included free in-flight TV service and WiFi (which came as a shock to me). Overall it was not an amazing experience and I would recommend this airline, but it would be a matter of comparison. If I had to recommend an airline to someone where JetBlue was one of many options, I would opt for the other options.",Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0

nan,Economy Class,2.0,June 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Newark to Boston,2.0," |  Never Again! I travel from NJ to Boston several times a year to visit family. Since I have 2 small children, ages 4 and 7, sometimes I fly because it is generally quick and easy. The Newark to Boston flight was slightly delayed and my tv did not work but was otherwise uneventful. The trip home from Boston to Newark was a nightmare. My family lives over an hour from the airport and on the drive I got a text from the airline stating the flight will be delayed an hour. We were having some bad weather so that was understandable. I just had to try to entertain my kids for a bit longer in the airport. We boarded the flight at the delayed time and sat on the aircraft for over half an hour just to be told by the pilot they did not get clearance from Newark and ""it may be another hour"" for take off. They let us deplane. After dragging my kids further around he airport to get snacks and games,I noticed that every single JetBlue flight in the terminal was extremely delayed. We returned to the gate to see a big cancelled on the flight board. No announcement made. We were then told to go to customer service to see about getting another flight. After sitting in an airport for hours, I now had to drag my kids to another spot to wait in a very long line. At the desk, the rep told me the flight was canceled because the delays caused the crew to ""time out"". Basically they up and left stranding a whole plane of people with nowhere to go. The rep offered me options on another flight which would land at a NY airport over 2 hours from my home or an 8 pm flight that she told me would most likely be delayed. Neither were reasonable options for my situation. I chose to take a flight at noon the next day since my kids were at their limits of patience. I asked for compensation since I would have to get a hotel for the night and was told no it was not their fault since they canceled for ""weather"". (Seems to me like the crew abandoning ship was why they canceled). Meanwhile other airlines were flying no problem. Now I had to drag my 2 exhausted kids through the airport to reclaim my bags and hope to secure accommodation for the night. I was told that most of the hotels at the airport were booked but the reservation agent at Logan found me a hotel 10 miles outside of the city. We had to wait for a shuttle during rush hour in the rain. A 15 minute ride turned into 40 minutes. What should have been a quick easy 45 minute flight turned into a 24 hour nightmare. It was needlessly stressful and exhausting.I felt like I was left stranded with 2 small kids. It had been a couple of years since I flew JetBlue and I used to love them. Not anymore. From the other reviews I read it seems like my experience is not uncommon. I will pay extra to use United next time, or Amtrak. I will not be using JetBlue anymore. This airline is really declining.",Family Leisure,2.0,1.0
