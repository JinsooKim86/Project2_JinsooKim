Boeing 737,First Class,5.0,October 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Beijing to Shenzhen,4.0," |  Beijing to Shenzhen on a Boeing 737. First class a total of eight seats, two rows, four groups, the first day of the first class of passengers a total of four people, so each person sitting on the side. Because the narrow body aircraft fly, the seat can not lie flat, but Shenzhen Airlines first class seats are very spacious. The flight attendant who was in charge of first class service was amiable. And the release of meals, but also to ask whether the need for chili sauce, mustard and other side dishes.  The seats do not have a screen, but first class passengers can get a Tablet PC, which has movies, TV shows and other entertainment, the headphone jack bad contact, affecting the listening effect. After the arrival of the plane, the crew will maintain the order on board, so that first class passengers first off the plane, I love Shenzhen Airlines, of course, if it can be wide body aircraft like. Service did not say that food can also hope that the food can do better and more refined. Drinks also hope to be more advanced.",Business,5.0,nan

It took me 10 minutes to find first class check-in while there was no signs of priority check-in in the terminal, which is quite strange for me while Shenzhen airport is hub airport of Shenzhen Airlines. Check-in and security were efficient. Lounges were comfortable and food tasteful. Flight attendants friendly and attentive. First class seats on this short haul flight was great.

The website is absolutely awful in English and in Chinese. After failing to purchase a ticket through their website, I managed to buy one on Ctrip. But then the online check-in did would not work. However the verification function on the Chinese language website reassured me that my ticket did exist. Airport check-in was ok as I was first in line. However then the flight was delayed by an hour, then after boarding an announcement of another half hour, then half an hour later yet another delay. I wondered if it was a ploy to avoid paying compensation and why they just did not let us deplane and wait in the lounge. Being vegetarian I would have needed to pre-order my special meal, but as web check in was not available I was not able to order. The only positive was one very polite and helpful stewardess, whom my translator guessed wanted to please the foreign guest, as the flight crew was otherwise quite impolite to their passengers.

Delay 1 hour, 2 hours, and last monday a delay of 3 hours. How is it possible? And there isn't other choice, this is the only flight available for to go and come back.

During the flight a woman from economy class went to the first class area and sit by me, chatting with a guy and a kid, who sat in the same row with me. Most of the time she was standing in the aisle even during turbulence. Even worse, she used mobile phone to take pics for the kid. This behavior is dangerous and it happened at least three times during the flight. But there was no cabin crew stopping her all the time.",Business,4.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,September 2015,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,SZX to SHA,2.0,"First time with this airline flying from Shenzhen to Shanghai, and it was not a positive one. Shenzhen Airlines one of those state owned airlines in China (part of Air China) that has no incentive to take care of its customers. Shenzhen airport was impressive and comfortable, but as soon as we arrived at the boarding gate, however, nightmare started. For an airport that spacious and modern, Shenzhen Airlines's plane that took us to Shanghai was parked far far away and it takes a long while for the shuttle bus to get there. We boarded the crowded bus and there was no air conditioning with temperature outside reaching 35+c. We had to wait on the bus for several minutes with everyone sweating like hell before the bus moved. After a seemingly very long ride, we arrived at our plane that was parked at a remote corner in front of a maintenance shop. We boarded the plan and our nightmare continued. There was no aircpn switched on onboard the plane. The pilot informed us that due to air traffic control, we had to wait on the plane for further instructions.  A flight attendant came over and asked if we wanted blankets. Looking at her sweat covered face, I am like what .. a blanket! Did you say blanket? She was just doing her job. But the entire crew did not seem to get it. ",Business,3.0,nan

Whilst I guess its quite a new plane, the interior was quite grubby with surface stains and scratches to panels and seat areas. The flight was delayed due to traffic but that's normal in China. Lounge at Shenzhen Airport in need of further change if they want to meet international standards, as its geared to Chinese only. Staff onboard were quite efficient, but language skills very poor and didn't understand anything that appears to not be on their script - a bit scary! Food is also geared of course to Chinese passengers, and wasn't good even by Chinese standards. There's not a lot of options for this route, but will go back to using Hainan Airlines whenever I can for domestic as they are miles ahead of all the other airlines here.",Business,3.0,nan

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,CAN-KWL-CAN (Guangzhou-Guilin) return by Shenzhen Airlines. 50mins flight offer breakfast with a small break fruit and tea. Aircraft in good condition but a little bit old cabin quite clean FA's service and attitude fare. Inflight announcement in Mandarin cantonese English and Japanese(a group of Japanese visitors). In my opinion Shenzhen airline's quality raise faster than other chinese carriers.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Shenzhen - Chongqing and Shenzhen - Wuhan with Shenzhen Airlines. The first leg to on an A320 the other two legs on 737-800s. Aircraft in a good condition. Hot meals served. On all longer routes Shenzhen Airlines also provide mints shortly before landing which helps to overcome the uncomfortable feeling in the ears. In my experience Shenzhen Airlines provides a better level of service than any other Chinese carriers.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,SZX/JDZ return. Did the same trip 7 months ago and was put off by average service and an old and dirty 737. Have just completed the same trip and what a turn around. Aircraft spotless with cleaners still scrubbing doors just prior to boarding. Aircrew immaculately dressed groomed and attentive. Meal was hot and tasty. This airline has certainly got its act together and considering they have a monopoly on the route provided a level of service above what I expected.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Shenzhen - XiAn and back. This is the second time I have flown Shenzhen Airlines. The economy class is comfortable. Seat width better than other Chinese carriers. Legspace great for a foreigner. Meals and drinks were adequate. Flight staff friendly and helpful. At least 2 flight attendant's spoke English. Inflight announcements in Chinese and English. Interesting that towards end of flight flight attendants encourage all passengers to do head neck arm and leg exercises. Very happy with service from check-in to disembarkation and will choose Shenzhen airlines again.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,PEK to SZX. Check in fast and efficient. Boarding on time but by bus instead of jetway as the aircraft was parked in apron far from terminal which is not good in freezing Beijing weather of about -10 C in the morning. Aircraft 737-900 and clean. Non of two choices of food was so good: boiled rice or noodle with boiled vegetables with no taste or spice - or even salt. Plenty of drinks served two times. Crew very kind and efficient. Arrival on time.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Guanzhou to Guilin. The aircraft was a very clean and new looking Boeing 737-800. The announcements were in Chinese and English. The flight departed and arrived early. Things are changing rapidly in China and standards seem to be rising generally. The snack was uninspired but most UK carriers give nothing on a 45 minute flight.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"I flew Shenzhen airliines twice in January and February 2006. The first flight was Nanjing - Shenzhen. The service was adequate though one of the FAs was going so fast with the drinks trolley that she knocked right into me spilling coffee all over my leg ; no apology even though she clearly saw what she had done she just giggled and rushed away. The second flight Shenzhen - Changzhou on an Airbus A320. The flight departed on time and everything was going fine until half way through the flight when the captain announced something in Chinese which caused quite a stir amongst the other passengers (I was the only foreigner). After speaking for maybe 90 seconds in Chinese he simply said ""Ladies and Gentlemen we back Shenzhen. Medical Emergency"" This seemed odd as we were now far closer to other airports such as Changsha Nanchang Hangzhou Hefei Wuhan etc. than we were to Shenzhen. When we eventually arrived back in Shenzhen there was no rushing to get a sick passenger off the place so it clearly was not a medical emergency. They started to hand out food boxes - some passengers were given two but when it came to the foreigner on the flight - nothing. Meiyou. Sorry. Then another announcement in Chinese and everyone starts to rush off the plane. I ask what the problem and in broken English the answer is ""We clean the plane"". So after an hour on the tarmac we are told to get back on - once again I ask what the problem was and the answer was they had to clean the plane. I try to get them to elaborate but the FAs English was dreadful. We finally arrived in Changzhou 5 hours late. Shenzhen Airlines are the worst domestic Chinese airline I've flown.",nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,A total surprise and a pleasant one with Shenzhen Airlines. Flew from Wuhan to Shenzhen in mid March. Half expected sloppy service and really scared about safety. Instead got a brand new 737-800 with leather seats in Y-class. Flight hostesses very polite and warm and helpful. Plenty of them too. Cabin service complete with drinks and meals. Professionally looking inflight magazine.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,This was the first time flew Shenzhen Airlines. Economy tends to be comfortable enough. On the SZX-HAK flight B737-600 - approximately 1 hour flight with snacks and mineral water only no other choice like coke. FA's services attitudes are fair. On the HAK-SZX return flight one of the FA was kind of bullied by two passengers but the FA was very polite and asked the passenger to be seated for landing. Overall Shenzhen airlines are good enough for economy travel on domestic routes.,nan,nan,nan

On arrival at Shenzhen Airport I was surprised to find it resemble more of a Chinese railway station than an international airport. Check in was quick. I used the automatic machines with the help of a staff who spoke almost no English. Was charged a fee for overweight luggage which was expected. Onboard the cabin seats were adequate. Was given a snack - a muffin peanuts and a tangerine along with water. Was glad to have something to eat but expected a hot meal. At Xiamen luggage arrived quickly and everything went smoothly. All in all Shenzhen Airlines was quite nice. Quite clean and quite efficient.,nan,4.0,nan

The one piece of good review I can give is that the flight landed at the intended destination. Messy cramped disorganized - and that is just a description of the boarding process. I know it's a cultural thing but the sense of personal space is nil - no way to relax on the flight. Got stuck in economy though I booked biz class.
