nan,Business Class,1.0,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Toronto to San Francisco,1.0," |  Toronto to San Francisco. Air Canada has a problem in their system where they can't get the spelling of my name right. Every time I make a booking the system deletes the last letter of my name ""Maryam"" becomes ""Marya"". Because of this, I can never check-in online at their system and with any booking I have to see an in person agent every time. As a frequent flyer for business, I am a NEXUS holder, never check baggage and always check-in online to avoid long waiting lines. However because of this problem I will forever have to get to airport early, and stand in line to have an agent correct my name on my boarding pass otherwise security will not let me through with the error on my boarding pass. Last week I flew to SFO from YYZ and Air Canada refused to let me bypass an-hour long line to have the change made and get on to my flight. They told me security would not have a problem letting me through but of course what happened? Security would not let me through and made me go back and stand in line for the Air Canada agent to change my name on the boarding pass. This is insane for an airline like Air Canada to not solve a problem that affects every person whose first name ends in the letter ""M"". They told me the system thinks that ""M"" stands for Mr. or Ms. so it gets mixed up. When I reached out to the Customer Relations team, after providing me with a 25% one time discount, told me they would not help me further, update me on whether this issue would ever be solved, or speak to me regarding this issue again.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Boston to Toronto,2.0," |  My flight was canceled due to a technical failure. It was the last flight out of Boston so there was no alternative for the day. We ended up in a long queue and were at the counter shortly before midnight, only to be told that the next available flight is 2 days from now. We politely declined and asked them to organise a hotel. They said there's nobody to do it and we should do it ourselves and expense the money back. Now finding a hotel in the middle of the night in Boston can be a real adventure. We managed to do it and were as conscious of cost as possible. In the end Air Canada only wanted to reimburse us a 100$ total for the hotel stay. We paid way more. Although they didn't care about what happened to us they didn't even want to cover basic costs. It's now over 4 weeks and we haven't seen a penny. The ticket cost were supposed to get charged back to my card end of June. Nothing has arrived yet. The same happened with a Delta flight and I got my money back within a week. In summary a total disappointment.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Montreal Airport staff was horrible. I was unable to use the self check in kiosk to to technical issues (missing info on my schedule). It took 1 hour to handle a small queue of 5 which kept growing. The staff of 5-6 counters worked extremely slow compared to counter staff such as Japan (my final destination) or swissport staff.

First ever trip of me I am on the study tour in UBC, so I am heading to Vancouver on my first ever flight. The Air Canada flight round-trip is very good, regard that the seat is lack of room somehow, the service, the cabin is in good condition.

Boeing 787 cabin is cramped, but that's typical across most carriers. App is hard to navigate, requiring me to reenter my name every time I open the app. Baggage was delayed 24 hours, and then delivered after midnight. The one bright spot is that cabin crew were polite and competent on all flights. AC used to be a better experience than the US carriers a few years ago. ",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,nan,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Quebec to Austin via Toronto,nan," |  Quebec to Austin via Toronto. I was to fly out of Quebec this morning with a connection in Toronto to Austin, TX. The flight was about 30 minutes delayed before the gate agent mentioned anything. I was actually receiving email alerts from Air Canada before hearing anything from the gate agent about the delays. My flight from Quebec was delayed 7 hours which left me no way of making my connection in Toronto. I went to the gate agent in order to re-book my connection. She very quickly told me I would have to worry about it when I got to Toronto and there was nothing they could do for me. I waited around 2 more hours and went back to the same gate agent. I again asked about re-booking my connection. She then gave me a pamphlet and told me to call their 800 number. Called the 800 number and waited on hold for 30 minutes. When someone finally answered it hung up the call on me. I called back and waited 45 minutes on hold. The guy that answered told me there were no other flights for the day that would get me back to Austin and he asked me if I could travel tomorrow (as if I had a choice in the matter). I had paid for premium seats on my initial flights (sounds as though I am out that money). He put me on hold as he booked me for the following day flights (I was on hold at least 20 minutes). During this time I booked a nearby hotel for the night because the pamphlet I was given said the airline would not be responsible for costs related to travel interruptions because it was beyond their control. I went back to the gate agent. Told her after 1.5 hours on the phone that I had been re-booked for tomorrow and asked her about getting my luggage back. The only good thing she did all day was call down and had my luggage pulled off the plane. Gave me a $10 meal voucher to the only place to eat in the airport which of course had a line wait of no less than 45 minutes due to all of the other stranded passengers. She then said she could get me to Toronto today (but still would have to spend the night in Toronto). If she could do that why couldn’t she have re-booked me to begin with instead of having me wait on the phone for 1.5 hours? Supervisor standing behind her seemed as though she could care less as well. So here I sit in a hotel room at my expense in Quebec. I will have to fight the battle with them tomorrow that I have already paid $60 to check my luggage from yesterday. I am sure they are going to want me to pay that again. I will also have to pay for another day of parking at Austin. The worst customer service of any airline I have traveled on.",Business,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,July 2018,nan,nan,nan,no,Edmonton to Shanghai via Vancouver,nan," |  Air Canada offers free pre-seat selection for their Asia flights, namely China flights. However, after I booked my round-trip flights Edmonton to Shanghai via Vancouver, they changed my seat selection without notice. After I booked flights, selected seats and made payment, they sent me a confirmation email. In this email they changed all my seats to last row, but they didn't give me any heads-up and so I didn't find out. Today when I was re-organizing my email folder, I happened to see it.  Air Canada has thrown us to the last row. I just talked with their customer service agent, and he said the mistake was caused by flight changes. It is a lie because first of all they only changed domestic leg but all my seat selections including international legs have been changed; Secondly, it is only a departure time change (earlier departure), not equipment change. I can imagine how people will be disappointed and shocked when they arrive at airport and find out their selected seats are long gone. And I'll be forced to pay extreme caution to Air Canada when next time I fly with them.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Food we bought on board was excellent. Overall flight, onboard entertainment as tv movies and series are just enough, but could offer more choices in French, seats of the B737 MAX not bad, I've seen worse on other B737-8 and 737-9 from other airlines.

Half the kiosks were broken and there was no one to assist so I got in line to get checking in by an agent. I was there more than 2 hours before my flight. The moment I got to the agent she said the flight was closed and she had to put me on a later flight but it was still 45 minutes before my flight was scheduled to take off so I asked for security. The woman at the counter was so rude and never apologized, she told me it was my fault. Once I spoke to security they also called the Air Canada manager who said he could put me on my original flight and over rode the counter agent. I was able to make the flight.

However my strong impression was that AC was like a budget airline. Inflight entertainment was limited and didn't work for my wife. We needed to ask to re-set it several times. Seats are not comfortable because armrests have built-in remote for inflight entertainment system and lights and you switch it off/on every time when you place your elbow on it accidentally. Serving food: items constantly were dropped down, flight attendants were picking them up from the floor and put on your table. Indeed it was better than United based on my many-year experience but still very close to it. My personal impression - Ryanair is treating their passengers a little bit better inflight - more genuine and attentive. Also, Montreal airport don't recognize Star Alliance membership card privileges for priority check-in which was disappointing (but it was not the airlines fault, but the airport ground staff). AC can be airline of choice indeed if there no any other suitable options.",Business,2.0,nan

The flight crew were very friendly and attentive especially one who was smiling from the moment we boarded to the moment we left the plane. The food served was the best food I have ever had on Air Canada in all the years flying with them. Probably because it was made in Paris and not Vancouver. - it was quite good.

Boeing 767,Economy Class,4.0,September 2016,2.0,1.0,nan,no,BNA to LGW via YYZ,3.0," |  Nashville to London Gatwick via Toronto. Air Canada is the worst we've flown. Sept 7, 2016, a 1.5 hour take off delay from Nashville due to our plane's having no air conditioning, and with the air blowers at only 10% of capacity. Problem was not fixed and the cabin temp was nearly unbearable for the 2-hour packed flight to Toronto. The delay cost us a missed connection to London Gatwick because the airline schedules only 1-1/2 hours to connect from the Nashville arrival to their once-a-day London Gatwick departure. To make matters worse, in the process of deplaning from the Nashville flight there were no airline personnel directing US citizens to the shortcut past Canadian customs, which forced many US citizens on our flight, including us, to spend an hour waiting to go through customs, then another hour reclaiming our baggage, checking it back in, and going back through security, none of which US citizens at Toronto are required to do. The airline had booked us on the next Gatwick flight, 24 hours later, but we were able to get a flight that night to London Heathrow, which was delayed by 2 hours due to technical problems. We finally left at midnight. Through this ordeal every single Air Canada representative was rude and discourteous.  The airline would do nothing for us except give us $10 food certificates which bought us 2 bottles of water. We had not eaten anything by this time for 7 hours and did not get anything to eat until 2 hours into the London Heathrow flight. Because our rental car had been paid for at Gatwick with return of the car to be made there we were forced, upon arrival at Heathrow, to take a commuter bus at our cost, from Heathrow to Gatwick.  The return flight from Gatwick to Toronto was delayed by over 4 hours due to the failure of a  ticket agent at Gatwick to give a fellow passenger more than one claim tag for the two bags she had checked in. This failure caused an extra bag to show up in the system. Staff  were in an out of the cabin for the 4 hours trying to determine the bag's owner. As a last resort, the airline ordered all the passengers out of the plane and down to the tarmac to personally identify their own bags! The delay caused everyone on the plane to miss their connections in Toronto. The next available flight to Nashville was 24 hours later. The airline put us in an hotel 20 minutes from the airport and included 3 meal vouchers which could only be used at the hotel. Trouble is, the hotel didn't even have a restaurant. It took 1.5 hours to get our bags out of the secure area for the overnight stay.",Business,1.0,nan

It was my first time flying Air Canada. The flight was not that great. The movies were boring. I ordered for Asian Vegetarian Meal as a special meal request, which mostly consists of Indian food, but the food was not good. Also, since it was an 8 hour flight, they should have provided 2 meals. Although they provided lunch, which was at the start of the flight, their second meal was a refreshment, which was only a packet of nuts.  Maybe a light meal towards the end of the flight was probably too much to ask.

On boarding I found the plane to be clean and well kept and the cabin crew was friendly. We hit some severe turbulence shortly after take-off so the IFE headphones were given to us only a good 40 minutes into the flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable and legroom was good for me standing only 172cm tall. IFE selection was wide and for the first time I had no trouble listening to the sound through Economy class headphones provided. What really stood out negatively was the food. I selected the pasta and it was the worst I have been served on a long haul flight. On the bright side, alcoholic beverages were complimentary. Breakfast consisted of a slice of banana bread and a cup of coffee. The bare minimum I dare say. Flight was on time and information from the cockpit plentiful.

I have emailed customer service multiple times with no reply. I went to the Air Canada customer service agents at the airport and they said there is nothing they can do. The last time the stewards tried to hand out one of those cards I laughed said why bother you can't claim them.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,October 2016,1.0,2.0,2.0,no,YYZ to YSB,2.0," | Toronto to Sudbury with Air Canada. For a while I was purposefully flying Air Canada over other carriers as I enjoyed their new inflight entertainment options, but I've reached the point where enough is enough. I could have excused the fact that on about a third of the flights I've taken the sound or screen is broken, as technology fails. I could have excused that they keep adding new fees such as a fee to choose your seat in advance (not just for legroom anymore, for any seat). But this time I feel that I've run into an inexcusably unethical practice that has significantly disrupted my vacation plans. I've been on a multiple-destination vacation, which will take me on 6 flights. Air Canada's pricing structure made it costly to mix and match airlines, so all six flights were with Air Canada. I had decided to cancel the third flight, and drive the distance instead, so that I could see more family members. I didn't care if they charged me for the flight, I just wanted to notify them of the change of plans. When I called Air Canada, they told me that if I did this, they would charge me nearly $400, a $200 cancellation fee as well as the increased cost of the fourth flight, as it would need to be ""re-booked"". Then they told me that if I didn't pay this amount and didn't show up for the third flight, they would cancel the fourth flight. So even though I was willing to pay the same for less service, they wanted to charge me substantially more. They didn't offer any justification, I'm assuming that it's just designed to take advantage of people who are in a tough spot and have to change their plans, regardless of whether it increases the airline's cost. Pure greed. Even if it leads to additional administration, I couldn't see this amount being reasonable. Then, to top it off, I had asked if I could pay more to switch my last two flights to a later time. Online the price was $761 if I was booking a new flight. However, I was told that to make this change they would charge me almost an extra $1000.

We had a reasonably comfortable flight but Air Canada needs to improve in a couple of areas. Firstly: all the controls for entertainment, lights etc are in the armrest which is very inconvenient as it is too easy to accidentally turn off or on something unintentionally. I understand this can only be improved when designing new aeroplanes. Secondly: the choice of movies, tv etc on the entertainment system is very limited. On a 16 hour flight people need more than a few old re-runs and a couple of newer movies perhaps not to taste. Thirdly: neither on this flight nor our previous premium economy flight from Sydney to Vancouver were we given enough time to eat our food. Meals appear to be served so close to landing there is a rush to collect rubbish before people have time to eat. Staff commenced collecting plates before I even had time to take the lid off my meal. Most of my meal was wasted and it looked to be quite appetising. BTW I'm not a slow eater.

My flight from IAD to YUL was cancelled, not one person from Air Canada could advise why - huge line was formed and approximately 2 hours later I was offered a flight the following day ""first thing in the morning"" (for Air Canada, 11 am is ""first thing in the morning""). After much effort I was able to convince them to put me on a flight to Montreal connecting through Toronto (yes, my direct flight had to be changed to a flight connecting through Toronto so I could leave on an actual ""first in the morning"" flight. So when I was finally seeing all this nightmare stop to expand itself, it was actually time for Air Canada's yet other fiasco: they couldn't reprint my ticket because it was bought by my company (business trip) and they didn't know how to do it. It was past 8 pm, I thought I would be home in Montreal at 7 pm, and I was still in Washington DC getting my ticket reprinted. After they were finally able to, I was given a 15 dollars voucher for dinner that I had to use in a hotel's restaurant where the cheapest meal was 30 (or 40 if you added taxes and tip). In addition to that, I was refused a cab service to and from that hotel, and was told to use the free shuttle which started running 4:40 am (and my boarding time was 5:30 am). I arrived Toronto at 8 am and there was a flight to Montreal with room for more people but I couldn't get in because my luggage was on a different schedule, so I had to wait until 10 am to fly to Montreal.

The return flight was Business class. All the flights were good. The service was pretzels with a drink in economy class and a light snack with a drink in Business class. The flight attendant was very nice on the inbound flight, taking good care of me and my family during the flight. The flight attendant was fine on the return leg but she was a bit exhausted. Inflight  entertainment was very good for a short flight. There was a choice of movies and tv shows on the screens on each seat.

First noted was the ease at T2 and the great service in the Maple Lounge. After take off we were served drinks and snacks that were topped up without waiting for the trolley to come around. Amazing service so far against BA who I normally fly with and Gold member. What is good is the layout of seats, you don't sit facing a random person plus you don't have to climb over anyone to go to the toilet if in a window seat. The tables are great and the cabin crew come and bring a table cloth before they bring the food, another plus better than BA. Appetiser was first class, salmon and salad. Main was a rack of lamb followed by cheese and a selection of ice cream followed by a port. The service is impeccable compared to BA and I think BA is overrated just because of the brand. The plus point is Air Canada is 50% cheaper than BA. So far 3 hours into the flight and cannot fault it. Seats turn into a very comfy spacious bed and again lots of space / storage to put things especially if you wear glasses. Cannot fault Air Canada and it's crew.

Whereas BA seem to have slipped into complacency and slimming down their service, Air Canada have upped their game and provided superior service and comfort. However, this month I had the displeasure of flying on their new 787 in economy class. Although the service was, as usual, very good, the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown in for a long time. The new 787 economy seat is incredibly narrow, offering little sideways movement and virtually no room for the arms. When I managed to rest my left arm on the seat, I was setting off the call bell because the entertainment controls are located exactly where you would rest your arm, very poor design indeed. I also noticed that the quality of inflight catering has dropped, too. I had only one option to choose from: a rather unpleasant overcooked pasta dish which was, basically, pasta with tinned tomato on it and some cheese.

Near the departure date, we got an e mail to say that her itinerary was changed to via Toronto. I phoned the airline and they told me the flight had been taken off and said book another day or accept what you have. It was a take it or leave it situation. Of course we had to take it. So she endured a long and difficult day as she is less able and the connection was rushed and it was tough. Imagine her annoyance when she finally got to Heathrow to find the direct flight we previously booked arriving at much the same time! They also managed to lose her baggage! Contact with Air Canada customer service was difficult. No response to the web mail submission. Telephone calls just produced advice to resubmit the complaint - which I did and still no response. In the end I had to badger them on social media to get any contact. It took a week to get anything from them. Their response was that some time after taking our flight off, it was put back again and people who had that flight cancelled were not given the opportunity to return to that flight. So those who were wise enough to book early lost out, while those who booked late got what we were denied. They said that as a goodwill gesture they would offer us 15% discount on our next flight. Useless as we don't intend flying again this year. Hardly good will as it was their poor customer service that caused all this. ",Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0

The cabin crew members were nice and worked very efficiently. I use Air Canada often and while the drinks and snacks are good, I have come to refusing the main meal because in economy class they always serve the same two things and they're simply uneatable.

She said that the plane would ""make up time in the air"". Ultimately, we actually left more than 2 hours later than scheduled because the new plane was also late. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Cairo. There are several exacerbating factors than just a delay. When we got on the plane, I told the flight attendant that we were going to be rushed to get to our connecting flight and asked if we could be let out first. Her response was ""We'll see"". When we landed, we were not given any accommodation whatsoever. We didn't land until approximately 10:15 p.m. The flight crew said that ""if"" we missed our connecting flight (scheduled to leave at 10:30), we should go upstairs to the ticket office to get re-booked. Apparently, they didn't know, despite servicing that airport, that Heathrow pretty much shuts down at 10pm and so the ticket offices were already deserted by the time we got there and the terminal gates shut down. This left us stranded at the airport, with no instructions or assistance, or any idea what we were supposed to do. We happened to ask a worker at the airport and he said we should check to see if our bags were there. Come to find out, our bags had been taken off the plane and set aside (not on the carousel). No one with Air Canada let us know our bags would be dropped off at Heathrow, rather than go straight to Cairo as originally planned. Obviously, whomever removed the bags knew we wouldn't be able to get on the next flight, even though no one else seemed to. If it hadn't been for the airport employee, we wouldn't have even known our bags were and they would have been inadvertently abandoned. We had to stay at the airport until the ticket office re-opened at 6:30 a.m. Once we got there, the Air Canada employee said a ticket agent would have been waiting outside the plane for us, to provide a hotel room. I'm not sure how we were supposed to know this when we were told conflicting information by the flight crew and the only people we saw waiting at the gate were there to help some disabled travelers in need of assistance. No one had a sign with our name or anything which would allow us to know that steps had been taken to provide us with a place to sleep. As a result of this delay, we lost a full day of a paid tour in Egypt and incurred expenses at the airport for food and beverages, since the next flight wasn't until 2pm that following day. In our complaint to Air Canada, they offered a discount for a future booking and didn't even address reimbursement for our out-of-pocket loss. I've made numerous international flights and this is the first time I've had any substantive issues with an airline. Air Canada's attitude, communication, and helpfulness are, by far, the absolute worst of any airline I've dealt with.

Q400,Economy Class,2.0,December 2016,2.0,3.0,nan,no,YUL to YTZ,2.0," |  Montreal to Toronto. The plane was delayed by around half an hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Halfway through the flight, about 40 minutes or so before we were scheduled to land at Billy Bishop Airport in downtown Toronto, the crew announced that the plane needed to be diverted to Pearson Airport, around 1hr away from downtown. Of course everyone was upset, but the reason given for the diversion was that (due to the delayed departure), the downtown airport was closed due to the night curfew. It was around 21.45hrs at the time, so I assumed the curfew was at 22.00hrs. Once we landed at Pearson, a manager came onboard and contradicted what was stated earlier. The plane was diverted because the crew were based at and needed to return to Pearson Airport. There were around 40 passengers aboard, and the time and inconvenience of these passengers were less important than the time of their crew. While I empathise with the plight of the hardworking crew, it says a lot about an airline that would put the needs of its customers second. And the airport curfew at Billy Bishop that the passengers were informed about and initially used as the justification for the diversion? It's 23.00hrs, meaning we had plenty of time to land.

Their chat service and baggage centre number's is unresponsive (no one answers the phone or chat sessions) with only five days to recover the item. While travelling from December 18, 2016 from Ottawa to Moncton the second flight, AC7502, was delayed on the Montreal tarmac for an hour and a half. As I had a two hour layover between the arrival of the flight in Moncton and the departure of my connecting bus this would only leave a half hour but with the baggage about twenty minutes at best. My issue isn't with the delayed flight but with the complete and total lack of customer support. While rushing to get off the plane to ensure I got to the bus stop outside the airport in time I had accidentally left my Kobo eBook reader in the pouch on the seat in front of me. I only realized it was missing once I was on the bus. I tried repeatedly calling the Air Canada toll free baggage centre number 1-888-689-2247 over the next few days and after an hour of waiting each time never got a representative. The recorded message prior to the hold music advised for missing items on a plane to ""chat"" with a chat representative. I tried that as well and found that not only was the chat window freezing and unresponsive (if you tried typing there was a significant delay before letters would show in the chat window) but I never could get ahold of a chat representative after another hour of waiting. I wasn't sure if the chat session was working and I tried repeatedly over the next few days without success. I had found, though, that the Air Canada policy was to hold lost and found items for five days. It's now the fifth day and after repeated attempts I still can't get a response by phone or chat. I also sent a form filled message to their general customer support feedback but only received a confirmation of receipt and not actual feedback on the lost item. My issue isn't with the delayed flight or poor customer service. My issue is that there's surprisingly no customer service for lost items. I advise anyone who doesn't want to be in the same position and would at least a chance at recovering a forgotten item left on a plane not to use Air Canada.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I would describe my experience as mediocre, a C in terms of classroom grades. The plane left Toronto about 45 minutes late, since the plane arrived with a delay from Montréal. There was no apology from Air Canada. The plane was completely full. There was, however, sufficient room in the overhead lockers, as ground staff had warned people to check large pieces (free of charge at the gate, at check-in, my suitcase was 35 CAD). Seating is very tight on the Embraer 175, when the person in front of me reclined his seat, there were about 10 inches from my head to the top of his seat. Thus, the three-hour flight was pretty uncomfortable. Likewise, when I used the bathroom at the back of the plane, I found that I could not fully stand up (I am 6'1""). For service, the cabin crew came through once with soft drinks; everything else had to be purchased. At the end of the flight, I asked one of the cabin attendants where our luggage would be arriving: ""On the carousel,"" she said - not very helpful, as there are about ten of those at terminal E. So, again, this was the average type of flight in the contemporary world of air travel. In my opinion, the Embraer 175 is too small a plane for the distance flown.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

I flew Air Canada Business Class flight AC36 from Brisbane to Edmonton via Vancouver to visit my in-laws as I do every year during Christmas. I am impressed with their new aircraft. The business class seats were comfortable, food was not spectacular however I was happy with it. There was only one washroom dedicated for business class, it was very small and not clean. There were two other washrooms that were shared with premium economy class. Overall, I was not very impressed with the washrooms arrangements. The cabin crew were helpful but not the best. The overall inflight experience was a positive one. Despite the food being so-so, and I was not impressed with the washrooms, I had a restful and comfortable flight. My experience went downhill when I couldn't find my luggage at the airport. Later that day, Air Canada confirmed that my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport. I was waiting on the phone for one solid hour until I reached an operator who told me the best they can do is $50 per day compensation before the luggage arrive. I tried to explain to her that with the freezing cold winter in Edmonton, I could not possibly buy anything warm enough with $50. However, she could not do anything else and Air Canada does not have a customer service phone line. My luggage arrived 2 days later at my in-laws house. By then, I was in Orlando for a 6 days trip in which I had to purchase 6 days worth of essential items in Orlando. Anyhow, I eventually got my luggage when I returned to Edmonton, however, I never received the compensation Air Canada promised. I tried to reach them with their phone line only to be told that I had to write them a ""letter"". I called Brisbane Airport and was given the manager's number. I called the manager and was told that this was a secure number and that the airport should have never given this number to me and hung up. I have sent Air Canada an email and a Facebook message.

On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort. The FA's were all very nice and worked hard throughout the flight.

We paid extra money for more legroom and, whilst understanding the reality of cramped spaces on any airline, expected what we paid for. We have done this on several occasions with Virgin and found the seating and surrounding area to be more than satisfactory. Instead the area in front was constantly used by passengers to access toilets on the other side of the plane and for a toddler (parents seated three rows behind) to run backwards and forwards. The space to the right of us over the wing was used by passengers to stretch and chat the entire overnight flight. The stewards/ stewardesses were nowhere in sight and surfaced only at meal time. The passenger seated beside my husband was a very large man who required an extension belt, no problem and not judging him, but it made for a very uncomfortable flight. Being a large man, he occupied some of my husband's seat as well as his own. When it was obvious (before take-off) the flight was going to be difficult due to this factor, the stewardess responded that she could understand it would be uncomfortable but the flight was full and there was nothing she could do. We contacted Air Canada upon our return to request a refund of the additional money outlaid and were told that they offer a high standard of service and apologised that we disagreed - basically 'bad-luck'!

We always flew Air Canada for the service and the people but now I fly further to avoid Air Canada. On Dec 31 2016, AC873, FRA-YYZ, either the FA who worked the rear business class section was getting ready for retirement or she was having a really bad day because her unfriendly, take it or leave it, monosyllabic attitude was quite pronounced. The new business class seat on the 777-300 is actually not so bad. The screen's a bit close but it's big and the seat depth is a bit short (I could never get the foot rest up to a comfortable height) but there's lots of space and charging stations and places for things. Very mediocre wine selection, I think one choice of either old or new world in red or white and as I said very mediocre. I hear they have espresso's and cappuccino's but they were not offered. I ordered the vegetarian meal which came out vegan and really it's mind boggling what the kitchen at AC thinks vegetarians eat. Years ago I had an amazing veg meal on a flight from Toronto to Calgary, roasted veg with baked tofu, really well done but this was some tasteless roasted eggplant on Polenta with a tablespoon of tomato sauce and that's pretty much what AC serve these days. All of this would have been overlooked if the FA had shown any kind of welcome or pleasant attitude. It was bare minimum, no more and definitely no service with a smile. AC 610, YYZ-YHZ started out well and I slept through most of it until the last 15 minutes of landing approach, when a little boy two rows behind us in business class, started to piercingly scream for his mother and was unconsolable screaming ""Momee"" until we landed. I thought maybe mommy was meeting the plane but it turned out that ""Momee!"" was the FA in-charge. To her credit, she remained the FA in-charge and didn't get up but probably not a good idea to fly with the family. I was a loyal AC flyer for decades but now Lufthansa and United I like better and I fly them 90% of the time. The timing on this route was deciding factor in flying with AC this time but that will not happen again. LH FA's are always welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable up front. Other airlines amenity kits are becoming collectables but not so the hideous herringbone, sparse offering on AC. LH, Eva and Thai's Rimova amenity kits are a reason to fly them and not available anywhere else. I think AC have forgotten that many of us love to fly and it's about a happy experience.

Q400,Economy Class,3.0,December 2016,nan,2.0,nan,no,YQB to YYZ,3.0," |  Air Canada - I thought they were a full service airline. Paid over AUD$500 for two of us to fly from Quebec a short hop to Toronto. This doesn't include checked baggage however (an extra $60) nor assigning a seat (that's an extra online fee as well). On arrival at the airport we realised the flight was full and when checking in on the kiosks we had been assigned separate seats on the aircraft despite being on the same booking. Fortunately a passenger next to me agreed to swap. The checkin agent was helpful only in explaining the reasons why we had been seated separately (a full aircraft, people on standby - not sure how any of this was relevant to not seat 2 people on the same booking next to each other). Now what Air Canada would likely say is that if we wanted seats we should have paid the online fee and seat assigned ourselves. It's a pity they have this type of model when they really are the only airline flying between many of these places in Canada. On a positive note, we did arrive and depart pretty close to schedule considering a big snowstorm had just been through the area. However I had to laugh when we arrived in a Toronto and the flight attendant made a PA asking all on board if we could let those with tight connections off the aircraft first, this was while we were waiting 10 minutes short of the bay for a marshaller to come and guide the aircraft onto the bay. I'd avoid Air Canada again except in a case such as this when they were the only nonstop option. On another note as well Air Canada have a policy that no headphones can be used on landing. But, portable electronic devices are permitted. So, you can use the phone but no headphones. When I enquired as to the reason behind this, Air Canada advised that this was for two reasons. Firstly, so they can ensure that you don't miss any PA announcements. And secondly, they can cause a hazard if you trip over the, during an evacuation.

On the way back from Vancouver, I had a head cold and needed regular drinks. I buzzed several times for tea / water etc but only once was my request answered. For the rest of the 16 hour journey, I buzzed but to no avail. Each time I needed a drink, or food, I had to get up from my seat, crawl over my fellow passengers, walk to the end of the aircraft to get my own refreshment. The worst part was, the entire crew was having a lovely time sitting down at the back, chatting away to each ignoring passenger requests. When I asked if they had noticed my bell call, they said they didn't hear it. However, when they looked, there were 3 others needing assistance listed on the screen. I wouldn't have heard the bell either if I was in the middle of a conversation. In addition to the lack of service, I feel that there could have been more food offered (it was minimal on such a long flight) and at no stage did the drinks trolley go around. Up to each passenger to request a drink. I guess it's a money saving ploy. The inflight entertainment was limited to a dozen movies that have been out for some time and didn't cater to a range of tastes. On 2 x 16 hour flights, this meant the choice was very limiting so I resorted to reading my book. Also, no wifi. Now that Air Canada has some competition from Sydney to Vancouver, it may be worth the crew lifting their game to remain competitive.

When I boarded my entertainment system and handset was dead. One flight attendant said to grab the seat behind me before we depart. Another attendant said I could not take that chair as it was broken and out of service. The first attendant rebooted the entertainment system and though I could not use the hand set, I was able to use the touch screen. I like to listed to classical music but there was no Mozart, no classical. A drink was served on my tray which collapsed. Now I am soaked with a double scotch. I have an extra shirt in my carry on and go to Business class bathroom where the sink was broken and wrapped in wide, colored adhesive tape. But its fine, when things go wrong, the flight attendant gives you a plastic Maple leaf pin right from his lapel. And documents the whole thing and submits it while we are in the air. I really did appreciate that. A month later I received an the email which was a voucher to use when you book a flight with us. The thing is that the voucher is worth 2 percent of my business class ticket's cost. ",Business,2.0,nan

Check in at both airports was a breeze and ground staff were friendly and efficient. Both flights departed approx. 30 minutes late and arrived approx. 30 minutes late. Seats were comfortable on both flights, and had no issues with the entertainment system. Didn't have to wait long for flight attendants to come around with drinks, and o both flights flight attendants were friendly. Baggage arrived promptly at both airports. Overall, had a good flight on both departure and return and would definitely recommend this airline for short-haul flights.",Business,5.0,nan

We were so disappointed to see that the experience for the travellers is the least of Air Canada's concerns. No TV, no food for a 6 hour flight seems unreasonable. The time allowed to transfer from one flight to another is far too short and we got no assistance whatsoever even though we were travelling with kids. Overall very poor.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,February 2017,1.0,2.0,3.0,no,Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna,3.0," |  Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna via Vancouver. Flight to Puerto Vallarta was good, staff awesome and service was prompt. Unfortunately on the way home I can't say the same. We checked in early and selected our seats to ensure a window and isle seat and to avoid the long lines at the airport waiting for check in. Once we arrived at the airport we waited 3rd in line for over an hour watching everyone who was checking in at the airport go through infront of us due to a computer issue. Then we were told that the flight was full and we had to sit in the middle despite checking in 24 hours before. Once in the plane the AC unit went down and we sat on the runway inside the boiling hot plan for an hour while crews scrambled to fix the issue. So we take off and I'm excited to get water after waiting in a hot plane for an hour only to wait 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight to even speak to a flight attendant. When I asked why things were so slow they scoffed at me and blamed the airline for cutting down from 7-6 flight attendants for this flight. Now I understand this can be stressful for them and create more work, but where I'm confused is how come on the way down with 6 flight attendants I received awesome service and water and coffee several times? I wish it could stop there but unfortunately it doesn't, we had to catch a connecting flight wich was overbooked, and we were asked if anyone would like to stay behind in Vancouver, only to find out it was so two Air Canada employees could fly home. Once our connecting flight to Kelowna landed at 12am our little plane of 30 had to sit on the runway for an hour while the other 2 international planes of over 150 passengers unloaded. Super disappointed in Air Canada and will definitely choose WestJet when flying next time. I'll Avoid Air Canada at all costs.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 787,Economy Class,5.0,December 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,London to Calgary,4.0, |  London Heathrow to Calgary. I had a very enjoyable 8 hr flight with Air Canada in economy! Service was excellent. Flight attendants went out of their way to make sure you had plenty of refreshments and plenty of water. In flight entertainment was 1st class showing all the latest films. Seats were comfortable. No delays. I was served a hot meal with drinks of my choice not long after take off and also a hot snack about an hour before landing. Two weeks later on 18th December I flew back to the UK with Air Canada and again excellent service.

I chose this airline as I am a Star Alliance Gold member but this was clearly a big mistake. This is the first time I have seen ten seats per row in economy on a B777 and I have flown many airlines. The seats were so narrow the it reminded me of a very low budget airline. Seven hours on a seat like this and you come out with leg and back pain. I had to keep my hands stack on my body as there was no space to rest them. Do not bother paying for the extra legroom seats as these are even more narrow due to the entertainment monitor stored in the armrest. Flight attendants completely uninterested and rude. No response to seat calls. Priority delivery of luggage for gold members not respected at Newark - our luggage came out among the last. Out of the four flights, three were late by an hour without any explanation of apology. Meals during flights small and of average quality. I will certainly not fly again Air Canada and I would not recommend this airline to others.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Due to weather conditions, my flight from Toronto to Halifax was cancelled. But the ground staff didn't do anything to solve that problem. Instead they send me to another airline, which was more helpful than Air Canada themselves. Air Canada wanted me to stay for unknown number of days at Toronto airport and did not bother paying for an accomodation. Their hotline in Germany can also only be reached from 09:00am to 5:30 pm.

I am trilingual Canadian frequent flyer 35K with Air Canada (I speak English 1st language, French 2nd language and Spanish 3rd language). I am always courteous, respectful of other cultures and speak the language of the person with whom I am doing business if I can. Air Canada is Canada's national airline (and I believe was even built with some public funding) and is expected to be bilingual English and French. When I travel to Montreal Quebec, quite often the attendants do not show this same courtesy of speaking English to me even when I clearly state this preference as a client. When I fly to other Canadian (outside of Quebec) or American cities they speak the language of your choice. I have flown many airlines over the past few years from many differant countries and more and more I am disappointed by Air Canada for the reasons described above, not to mention pricing and services offered. This lack of simple respect for my culture and language (English) is causing me to reconsider the choice of airline in the near future.",Business,1.0,1.0
Boeing 787-8,Premium Economy,5.0,January 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Calgary to London Heathrow,5.0," | Calgary to London Heathrow with Air Canada. This was a good flight that left on time and arrived on time. I took seat 12A in Premium Economy, which felt great compared to coach (which I have typically flown). You get a business class style entrée with a printed menu and choice of entree, and the seats are quite noticeably wider and with more recline. The attendants were friendly and made the rounds regularly without being intrusive. I am definitely a bit of a clean and neat freak, but the plane interior, including the bathroom, was organised and spotless. Upon boarding, we were given a departure drink (I chose OJ). After takeoff, dinner was served with wine. The entertainment system was, as usual with AC, stocked with selections of some recent films. All in all, the flight was smooth and enjoyable. AC gets a lot of complaints that I have never found to be substantiated. I've flown them lots; I've never had a late flight and never had a staff member treat me rudely. They have an international fleet of new or new-ish equipment including many 787s and a really good safety record.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I explained that every plane ticket I have had prints it the same way. She said no and finally went to another agent to ask. The other agent looked at the ticket and my passport and said ""yes it is fine"" as I watched. She then came back to me and said I would have to change the way my name is listed or I would not be issued another ticket.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,April 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto,2.0," | I was supposed to fly Air Canada from London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto. After arriving in Toronto, I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on a flight several hours later. This was then delayed, and I became worried that it would be cancelled. However, after repeated inquiries with the Air Canada gate agent, I was informed that it would be taking off that night, although hours late. Then at the last second this flight was cancelled, around 9 pm. No announcement was made of the cancellation until after it was supposed to have departed - the flight simply stopped being listed online or on the airport board. I entered a long customer service line, however, in the midst of waiting the agents went home from their shift. No clarity was provided about where we were supposed to go next. The customer service agents simply walked away. A long period of confusion in which it was simply impossible to find any Air Canada representatives. The amount of understaffing was appalling, and there appeared to be no urgency from anyone I spoke to about resolving the many issues that people were having. Finally, I wound up in a rebooking line, where I stood for over two hours before being helped. Despite repeated complaints from me and others to increase the level of staffing, this never happened: there were only two agents for dozens of customers. When I finally got to speak to someone, they made it clear that at the earliest I could fly to Columbus the following evening, because the earlier flights to Columbus were cancelled or fully-booked. The fact that I could not get out of Toronto until the following evening made my trip moot (it was only a two-day trip for a conference, one of which I would have completely missed). I therefore requested that I simply be booked a return ticket to London for the next morning and I gave up on my trip. After some haggling the agent reserved a place for me on a flight. However, although I was entitled by Air Canada policy to a hotel room for the night, none was provided for me. I spent the night on the floor of the Toronto airport. Despite pleading for some kind of compensation (I mentioned access to the airline lounge, so that I might change clothes / take a shower / have a minimum of comfort), I was given nothing but $20 of food vouchers. The next day my flight back to London was delayed almost two hours simply out of poor handling. In sum, Air Canada showed complete indifference to stranded travellers, made no effort to provide adequate staffing to deal with the problems that stranded travellers were facing; provided no lodging, were completely untransparent about the reasons for the delays and cancellations. To top it off, they are now being very difficult with regards to a refund. I was told that I had to go through Expedia, because that was where I made my booking. Now Expedia has sent me back to Air Canada. Air Canada claims that it may take 25 days to process my request. This should be the simplest matter in the world, there is no gray area: my trip was cancelled, I never made it to my destination, and I was left stranded at the airport without lodging in violation of their own policy. I just want my money back. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
A321,Economy Class,4.0,March 2017,nan,4.0,2.0,yes,Victoria to Ottawa via Toronto,4.0," |  Victoria-Toronto-Ottawa 15 March, returning 21 March. Reservation made through AC website and seat selection purchased at that time. In both directions, YYJ-YYZ legs served by A321s, YYZ-YOW legs by A320s. Seats and legroom comfortable although there was a 5 cm gap between the fuselage and window-seat armrests, reducing seat width unnecessarily. FAs made frequent runs to offer water. Three main glitches, all to be taken in stride as part of air travel nowadays: (i) Outbound from YYJ, the video safety presentation could not be played aloud through the cabin's PA system (though it was on the video screen), so FAs had to demonstrate the safety features themselves. (ii) The onward outbound YYZ-YOW leg was delayed nearly an hour, with all passengers remaining seated, while a possible technical fault in the cockpit controls was investigated. (iii) Accumulation of incoming flights at YOW meant that YOW baggage system was backed up and dispensing of baggage was delayed till an hour after aircraft had arrived. Oddly, on the five-hour return leg YYZ to YYJ, when I purchased a gin-and-tonic the miniature bottle was labelled ""Duty free"" and ""Export strength"" (47.3 percent alcohol). If Air Canada can use duty-free alcohol to serve on domestic flights, their price of CAD 6.50 per drink is pretty steep. This summer, Air Canada plan to downgrade all their non-stop YYJ-YYZ flights to their ""Rouge"" service level (less legroom, very limited IFE).",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

What really was outstanding was the FA up front with whom I have flown with before. Other than that standard Air Canada Business experience, unmemorable food, a comfortable seat and good quality alcohol. I did appreciate my bags actually being first off the carousel which happens too infrequently as I had exactly three minutes to catch a ETS bus into town, or wait an hour, or face a $65 cab ride. The choice of audio on the seat back monitor left a lot to be desired, never heard of many of the artists, don't think you can go wrong with classic rock or pop, but there were few selections of such available, so I listened to my own tunes.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 777,Business Class,4.0,March 2017,4.0,2.0,1.0,no,Toronto to Munich,1.0," |  Toronto to Munich with Air Canada. There is good news and bad news here. The food was better than any Air Canada Business Class meal I have had before. The staff were enthusiastic and attentive. The onboard entertainment selection was very weak, with a few new movies and even fewer classic movies. The music choice was appallingly short. I was not given noise cancelling headphones and was left with the awful headphones that AC gives out for free to economy class. The lie flat bed has very hard and I could not sleep.I expressly book business class so that I may get good sleep. The agent in Toronto did not mention to me that I needed to obtain my luggage in Munich and take it to my connecting flight. So, I had no luggage for the first two days of my trip. Business class is so costly that every individual detail is vital and can not be overlooked. So, despite the better meals, Air Canada Does not measure up when it comes to their Business Class product to the level of even the good European carriers.

Boarding was delayed due to an air traffic control ground delay program. Something to do with the space launch over Florida. We left the gate around 45 minutes late but were able to catch up time enroute. The service was nice and standard for North American flights. Drinks and buy onboard served efficiently, though one of the flight attendants was not very polite or attentive. The entertainment is far better then any other airline flying to the Caribbean.

One of the check in ladies helped us get our bags sorted and accepted. We paid to check our bags in for Vancouver on that flight checking in a small suitcase and a larger one. She printed us boarding passes and bag tags and explained that our seat allocations would be made at the gate. We arrived at the gate with lots of time to spare and waited. The staff there announced that they thought there was insufficient space on the plane to take all of the passengers carry on luggage and started to request that passengers voluntarily check their carry on luggage in. They also started to circulate around the passengers and tried to ‘talk’ anyone with largish carry on bags or multiple luggage items to check them in. They then announced that the flight seats had been oversold and that they wanted ‘volunteers’ to take a later flight. Then we were told that they would call out names for final seat allocations. I heard a name that started with the same letter as ours and approached the counter to personally enquire if it was in fact for our seat allocation. The Air Canada staff were all looking distressed and under pressure at this stage. I was told that it wasn’t my name but the lady took our ‘boarding passes’ and said that our tickets were only standby tickets. I noticed that the copy which she kept, with no seat allocation printed on it actually had ‘sb’ in very small letters where the seat number would normally be printed which meant nothing to me up until that very moment. She said she would check and call out my name in due course with seat allocations. After another 10 or 15 minutes and a number of other customers being issued boarding passes, she called my name and started speaking. I explained I was an international traveller and had to get back to Vancouver on that flight. I told her I had bought and paid for my tickets weeks earlier and as far as I was concerned, I was contractually entitled to travel on that flight. We did get onto the flight, probably because I had been so insistent. When we arrived at Vancouver, after the 5 hour flight plus a lengthy wait at the carousel, our smaller case finally came onto the conveyor. I checked with the lost baggage staff, again having to wait for some time in a queue. They were good and advised that my other bag had been routed on a flight to Toronto and would arrive later that night. They would then deliver it to my Vancouver address the next morning. It arrived at about 1430 hours the next day and it looked as though it had been dragged through muddy water. It was filthy. And the luggage tag on it was tagged ‘standby’ as well. I will get the case cleaned now that we are home. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

We were then delayed because of 'engine problems.' We then departed about 20 mins late. About an hour after we took off they served us our lunch which was quite good and I have to say I did enjoy it. For the rest of the flight I listened to music on my phone, and watched some interesting TV-shows. Then as the flight came to an end we were served a sausage wrap, which was spicy but also enjoyable.

My family's wonderful Hawaii trip had a very upsetting ending due to Air Canada's horrible service. We endured multiple flight delays and cancellations due to technical issues with their planes and had to pay for three hotel rooms out of pocket to accommodate our 8-month old baby and my elderly parents who would have been stranded overnight in two separate cities. It took us 2+ days to get back home (instead of the scheduled 23 hours). Our returning flight AC1830 was delayed due to technical issues. We found out about the delay when we arrived at the airport around 7:00 pm (no previous warning) and the departure was initially postponed from 10:00 pm to 3:45 am but got delayed again to 4:15 am early in the morning. AC told us that since they didn't cancel the flight they were not responsible to book us a hotel room despite the fact that we had an infant and two seniors travelling with us. I couldn't understand how AC expected families with small children and babies to deal with this - sleep on the airport floor? We decided to book a hotel room on our own since we have 20+ hours flight ahead of us and an infant baby travelling with us. A motel room with airport shuttle cost us $200+tax USD/room due to the last minute booking. AC did postpone the departure again from 3:45 to 4:15 am. Neither my husband nor I was able to sleep well as we were afraid to miss our flight. This was only the beginning of our horrible experience. We were supposed to have two connecting flights after arriving in Vancouver (VAN-TOR, TOR-DL). Due to this first delay, AC had to cancel our subsequent flights and rebook the rest of our trip. Instead of flying to Deer Lake on the same night we arrived in Toronto, we had to stay in Toronto overnight. However, AC couldn't give us the rest of our boarding passes, nor could it book a hotel in Toronto for us. The agent in Honolulu told us that we needed to get the hotel from AC's customer service in Toronto once we got there. AC's flight from Vancouver to Toronto got delayed again and the plane did not land in Toronto airport until 10:45 pm on May 2nd. By the time we got off the plane it was almost 11:30pm. There were 50+ people in line at the AC customer service kiosk, while only two to three agents were working. The line hardly moved and after midnight an agent came to the line telling us all the hotels around the airport were sold out and we had to look for hotels on our own. He said the desk would be closing in 30 minutes and the agents would leave despite there were still so many of us unserved. He told us to call AC to rebook our flights. He also told us to find hotel on our own; and AC will reimburse up to $100 CAD per room. Seriously, I want to ask AC where to find a hotel room cost $100 or less nowadays?? As we learned that we wouldn't be helped by anyone at the desk, my husband started to call AC about our booking and I started looking for hotel rooms for us since we were all exhausted and I did not want my super-exhausted baby to sleep on the floor in the airport. As it was after midnight already, I couldn't book a room on Expedia or other online booking website as they couldn't take May 2nd as the check-in date. Therefore I started calling every hotel around the airport. Finally a hotel had two rooms available and they cost us $169+taxes although the regular online booking price is no more than $128, thanks to AC for causing the last min booking.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Our two hour layover in Toronto was barely enough time to get through security and customs and get out to the end of the terminal for our connecting flight home.  We were lucky to only lose one day of our vacation to this incompetent airline.

The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new movies to keep passengers entertained during the flights! I especially appreciate that movies can be watched in various languages! The catering was just OK, the food quality is average. We were served a hot meal (with two choices) with a complimentary beverage. They serve water during the whole flight after meal services which is appreciated.

Its personnel at the connection desk offered us no apologies, no options for accomodation and no compensation, but instead lectured us with apparent agitation, even aggression, for being ungrateful daring to question their ""hospitality"". We spent the entire night on the floor of the airport where its administration ""generously"" provided prison-style blankets. Complaints to AC customer relations department resulted in an offer of 25% discount for the next flight off so-called ""base fair"", which (when applied), is still roughly 10-15% percent more expensive than what you could easily find on any consolidator website. Ruined plans, worries of friends and families, unattended business meetings, lost time, simply discomfort, both physical (from sleepless night) and moral (when you are just expected to gratefully overspend on overbooked flights and be happy and quiet about it) - all these things, apparently, are not considered, much less covered by the AC policy.",Business,2.0,2.0

We found out the flight was cancelled at 2pm that day due to construction at the Toronto Airport. It was ridiculous for them to find out that late that construction would be occurring at that terminal. But that's all fine, what I am upset about is the fact I had to take a flight to Montreal at 8:50pm and have a lay over there until 7:40 am. I was expecting hotel to be covered but unfortunately it was not technically their fault. They also neglected to tell us that technically the Air Canada ticket counter was closed until 4a.m. So we had to ""sleep"" in the outer lobby where any one could have access to steal our stuff.

There was no staff at the airport to help, and impossible to get any answers. On the new flight, which was over 5 hours long, there were no free meals or even snack.

Air Canada is easily able to provide one of the worst experiences to travellers of any airline. Their inability to manage delays and cancellations astounds me since it's such a regular thing for them. Yesterday most of their domestic flights from Toronto were cancelled due to a known outage of one runway, and most of their international flights were delayed. Despite knowing this it was chaos. I was incorrectly passed from desk to desk when I arrived late to a cancelled flight. Each person sent me to someone else or lied to me. Eventually I ended up outside of security with no luggage, no transport to my destination no luggage and no one who could give me any help or information. Every agent I dealt with lied to me to get me to go away and there was no joined up process for dealing with numeesous stranded passengers. The only helpful person was the woman at the delayed baggage call centre who had empathy, knowledge and genuinely helped me try to resolve my situation. Never again Air Canada!

The aircraft is amazing if not for one thing: the entertainment system has a fundamental flaw. On screen controlls are nice, but also controls have been aded on the armrest.

We showed the check in desk lady that clearly it was an airline standardized measurement and that they fit. She gave us a hard time and eventually allowed us to take them on and not have to check them. When we got on the plane, there was more than enough space for the carry on pieces. People were bringing larger bags on than we had. It was outrageous!  Our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we did not even get an email update.

The Cleveland flight was delayed due to technical difficulties. This meant that I was unable to make my transfer in Toronto and would need to find alternatives. There were no Air Canada staff to be found, only harassed United Airlines who code carry with them. No one could give advice, answers or assurances. After 3 hours we were allowed onto the plane. It was a blisteringly hot day and we were sat in a full, tiny plane in the heat with no air con and no ventilation for 20 mins. People in the cabin were beginning to panic - the crew gave vague assurances that things would eventually get cooler. By this point, I too was beginning to panic, feeling distressed and unable to catch my breath. When the plane took off, it cooled down slightly. What followed was an hour of complete hell - the pilots announcements were inaudible. This was the worst flight I have experienced in 40 years of flying. The cabin was dirty, cramped, the young woman serving us was indifferent and I could not wait to get off. I was then transfer via Dublin on an Air Canada Rouge flight, (think Easyjet without the cherry staff) - arriving 8 hours later than planned and without any luggage (it still hasn't arrived) At no time during this process did I feel of any significance to Air Canada - no friendly advice, no offers of help. Upon arrival in Manchester I discovered that 3 other passengers on my flight had had the same experience, they too were looking for luggage that never arrived.

Boeing 777 / A330,Economy Class,4.0,June 2017,4.0,2.0,4.0,yes,Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva,3.0," |  I normally fly BA to Europe, but since their service has apparently gone sharply downhill as of this year (their catering has virtually disappeared and their reviews here on Skytrax are truly appalling), I thought I'd try Air Canada again. Flew from Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva. The check-in/bag drop at Pearson was terrible. I arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and there was a long line that barely moved. It took an hour before I got to a desk. Typical case of lots of desks available but less than half were being used. Not acceptable for a full long-haul flight. The aircraft to London was a B777. I knew that AC had reconfigured these planes to squeeze 10 instead of the previous 9 seats per row. And I'd heard that the seats were hard and uncomfortable. And they are! Fortunately the seat next to me was free, but even so, it was pretty tight and I could not get comfortable all night. AC uses these aircraft on 16-hour flights to Asia and Australia, which must be unbearable. However, the IFE system is modern with an excellent selection of movies/entertainment, and good screen quality. The catering is standard and decent enough, certainly better than AC Rouge, BA or Air Transat these days. Lots of water runs throughout the flight, which were appreciated. My return flight was from Geneva on an older A330. Overall this was a good thing: the seats were wider and more comfortable, with proper cushioning and excellent leg-room. The IFE system was dated, though, and the selection not as good, but still adequate. The catering was again decent enough. All in all I would fly Air Canada again to Europe for direct flights. It seems to be one of few airlines to still offer a good, traditional service for a fair price.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

A330-300,Economy Class,3.0,June 2017,3.0,1.0,4.0,yes,Toronto to Rome,4.0," |  Toronto to Rome. The Air Canada staff at the Toronto Airport were very friendly, professional and very competent. It was very easy to check in and get loaded on the aircraft. Unfortunately things started going downhill after that. The aircraft was freezing cold. They had the a/c on high for some unknown reason. Even after many people complained, one of the cabin crew claimed they turned up the temperature by a couple of degrees. It was still as cold. Everyone was glad to get off the plane in the morning and warm up.  Air Canada staff in Rome are rude, impatient, unfriendly and incompetent at best. They act like you are bothering them at the check in counter and after our flight home was cancelled, you cannot make up just how incompetently they mishandled the situation. I'm not talking about just 1 person. It was pretty much all of them. Their communication was awful as to getting our bags back. The passengers were basically left to fend for themselves to find their bags since we were all sent to the wrong turnstile. Then Air Canada sent someone with the voice of a mouse to give instructions on who goes to what hotel. This almost turned into a riot since almost no one could hear or understand. The employee seemed to have no idea what she was doing and gave terrible instructions as to which hotels and where to find the shuttle buses. There was no organization whatsoever from the Air Canada staff. It really was the incompetent leading the incapable. It took the airport police who were wonderful to get us to the hotel. Air Canada could care less. The next morning, we were right back to the rude, impatient treatment at the check in counter with a different person and disorganizion at the gate since we had to be bused to the plane. Everyone was thrilled to get away from the Air Canada Rome staff once they were on the plane. We must give credit to the cabin crew however for the return flight. Although this aircraft was almost as cold, the staff couldn't do enough for everyone. They were kind and professional. The wonderful Air Canada staff in Toronto guided us to Customs and we got all our bags. I would have scored Air Canada higher if not for their awful staff in Rome and the planes being kept so damn cold.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The staff from check-in, flight attendants and captain were all professional yet cordial, ensuring all customers were well treated and comfortable. We had a connecting flight between Montreal to Toronto, with a fairly tight window. The Director of the attendants, made a personal call to ensure the flight would wait for us before departing. Knowing we had to go through Customs prior to changing flights made us quite nervous we'd miss the connecting flight, but the Air Canada staff was quite supportive and helpful, making us feel much taken care of! Of course, they were right, we finished going through Canadian customs and reached the boarding area with 30 minutes to spare.To date this is our favorite airline, and we've been telling our friends and other Tauck Tour travelers how much we enjoy flying with Air Canada.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,May 2017,1.0,4.0,3.0,no,San Francisco to London via Toronto,3.0," |  San Francisco to London via Toronto. Flights coming back: smooth, and well done. Flight going to London - it's been over two weeks since I first addressed everything that went wrong, including missing flights, being bumped to different flights, them losing our baggage, and their support team literally says an agent has up to 30 days for a response.  The flight that left on May 10th was late. About 45 minutes late out of SFO (San Francisco). This ended up making us late for the connection flight in Toronto. When we got to the gate we were informed that we had been removed from the connection flight because we hadn’t checked in. Of course we hadn’t checked in, because the original flight Air Canada had us on was late. So we tried to get back on the original flight. Luckily they got us on. However, they had already moved our bags to the following flight leaving out of Toronto. So they had to move our bags back. They said they would get a runner to do it. Fair enough. When we landed in LHR (London), they didn’t have our bags. We went to the baggage claim desk for Air Canada. They said they had no scans on our bags and had no idea where they were. They asked us to file a claim and track it through your World Tracer program. This trip was becoming a nightmare. Because the flight was delayed in Toronto the flight to LHR landed late. This made us miss our original flight to Munich that we had made on Lufthansa. We went to the Lufthansa desk who said it would be $271.00 for each of us to get a new flight. Still no update on the baggage tracer. Kept calling their baggage claim desk, and they said the bags hadn’t arrived on the recent flight coming in from Toronto. We ended up needing to book new flight with a completely different airline much later in the day. This time directly to Salzburg (our eventual location) coming out of LGW (Gatwick). Total price for the two flights: $293.40. As we were about to leave LHR to head to Gatwick, we got a call from baggage claim. They had our bags. Their World Tracer, which they kept pointing us to for more information which showed absolutely no updates, never showed the bags delivered. In fact, it STILL doesn't show the bags reached us and it's been over two weeks if you can believe it. So…where do we stand? They causes us to miss their own connection flight in Toronto. They caused us to miss our Lufthansa flight to Munich (and we had provided plenty of time from arrival in London to departure for the next flight). They screwed up delivery of our bags (they still haven't officially confirmed us receiving our bags, that's how TERRIBLE their bag tracer is). And yup. I contacted their support team. Nothing. Absolutely NOTHING has been done since we've gotten back from London. They just keep saying the same thing over and over again: a support agent is looking into your case and will respond within 30 days. I am never flying with them again. While some of their agents and staff do a great job, part of their team is absolutely incompetent, has zero sympathy for nightmares like this, and their support team is practically unreachable unless you plan to wait 45 minutes on the phone for one of them to answer, or you want to go through online channels, where they have up to 30 days to get back to you.

Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for. After complaining to the flight director who was charming but useless and mouthing platitudes that she would write it up in her report, I braced myself for the arrival of the pasta dish that no one else wanted and that I was going to be saddled with, unless I wanted to be hungry for the next seven hours. It arrives, the foil is removed and it is dry at the edges. I to eat the bun and lettuce with six small slices of red pepper. The dessert is artificially creamy with peach bits that has some pleasant taste but which hardly provides fulfilling sustainment. An hour before landing we are served a savoury pastry in a cardboard box. Mine is a Chicken Fajita.  I look at the writing on the box and it says it is made in the UK with ingredients as silicone dioxide to prevent anti-caking and colour - it also says this Fajita is made with chicken from Brazil.  I found out that if you try to use the business class toilets up front, you will be castigated and sent to the ones at the back of the aircraft.

This was in contrast to service on the ground. The Maple Leaf Lounge was a temporary facility and was overcrowded with poor food and drinks available. I left and used the nearby Plaza Premium lounge. Boarding was a bit chaotic with confusing queues forming 30 minutes before boarding time. The AVOD had a couple of issues, once freezing and going blank and having to be reset. The food was a bit disappointing, with an overcooked tenderloin and a limited wine choice. However, the FAs were superb, making passengers feel genuinely welcome without being intrusive.

The 787's advances in pressurization (the equivalent of about 6,000 feet vs 8,000 on the 777) and humidity meant that I arrived in YVR less tired and dried out than I did in Beijing on the outbound trip. As before, the cabin service was superb and the food was surprisingly better on the PVG-YVR leg than on the YVR-PEK portion, which had touted a ""signature chef."" The electronic window dimming worked well and AVOD was flawless. Boarding was orderly (more so than in YVR) and the Air China lounge was comfortable and quiet, though, as usual in China, with really bad wine. Baggage delivery in YVR took close to 30 minutes after clearing immigration, perhaps because the immigration process was so efficient.

Very friendly attendants: I was sitting beside a couple that was ignoring every instruction. The man was on his phone almost until take off, and neither of them stowed their carry-on during take-off or landing. Despite this, more than one attendant helped them cheerfully. Due to a misunderstanding of when we were landing, I tried to order some food close to landing time. The attendant in my section was polite, explained that they weren't supposed to take any more orders, but then gave me a free sandwich (worth around $6.50 on this domestic flight) to give me the benefit of the doubt. I always have and will continue to fly with AC for their consistent service, polite crew/attendants, and clean/modern fleet. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

The experience was very decent and it had slightly surpassed my expectations. The cabin crew were very friendly and hospitable. Since it was a flight to Mumbai, it was really nice that they had cabin crew who could speak in Hindi. However, like my previous experience with Air Canada, the cabin crew do not respond to call signs at all. Regarding meal service, they were quite delicious and well-presented. The food was recognizable. It was very nice of the airline to serve Indian food and beverages like Indian Masala Tea (Chai) and other Indian main course dishes, snacks and deserts. I was served three meals throughout the flight, which included a dinner, snack, and breakfast service. Although there was a limited selection of movies and other forms of in-flight entertainment, I surprisingly did not feel bored during the course of the flight. Flight was certainly eventful. The seat was comfortable with for the long journey with excellent legroom, though the seat recline was not as good as other premium economy classes I have travelled in. Moreover, during the whole flight it was really cold and for a while, after the dinner service, when people are generally sleeping, the main light was still on, which was very disturbing. However, the cabin interior was very clean and the ambience looked great, especially for an inaugural flight. The ground staff at Toronto Pearson Airport were also very nice and helpful.

I have no issues with the plane or service on that flight. My issue came in trying to go from Vancouver to Denver. At the last minute Air Canada cancelled our flight. Okay fine. Things happen. (There was no issue with weather in this case.) I'm not upset that the flight was cancelled. I'm upset at how it was handled by airline representatives. First of all, there is no customer service counter for the airline in this part of Vancouver airport, so the entire flight is waiting in a giant line for a mere two representatives to help us rebook. Second, they start handing out a phone number because they said it was faster for us to rebook if we called this number. This is true, and I did call. However, why are they making already frazzled customers do this? Shouldn't they just employ enough agents to handle this sort of thing? As a side note, when I called the number the woman on the phone was very nice and helpful and took the time to answer all my questions.  Third, did my rebooking over the phone, and the agent was very helpful. However, she can't issue me a boarding pass or check me in over the phone. I have to see an agent. She assured me that my baggage would follow me, perhaps not on that same flight, but eventually. I'm on my way home, so I'm okay with this. Fourth, I try to see said agent. If I can get a new boarding pass with enough time, perhaps I can get go get my baggage and get it retagged myself. I have no such luck. I can find 3 Air Canada reps in the entire airport (or at least the part I have access to without going through US customs again.) All 3 are trying to help with rebooking. I wait in line while my husband wanders the airport looking for a person or a kiosk or anything. He finds nothing.  This is where my issue is. The woman trying to rebook everyone literally will not even let me finish a sentence. She says I have to go get my baggage and go through customs again with it retagged. When I tell her that the agent told me over the phone that I would not have to do this, she rolls her eyes and prints me one boarding pass. I need two boarding passes. You see, our new flight was from Vancouver to Seattle and then from Seattle to Denver. The final Seattle to Denver leg was on another airline. She refuses to print me that boarding pass and sends me away with a wave of her hand and will not answer any more questions.  I go to the gate where we are supposed to take off from Vancouver to Seattle. This agent also will not print me another boarding pass. Here's how that exchange went Me: I was wondering if you could print me a boarding - Agent: No. The flight has been downgraded. I don't know if you have a seat. Me: Okay well - Agent: Sit down and I'll page you. (Not sure how she was going to page me without asking my name but what do I know right?) She pages customers being bumped to the next flight. They are unhappy naturally. She is just as snippy with them, not letting anyone finish a sentence. We do make the flight and eventually get home over 6 hours late. We have no bags. Of course there is no Air Canada representative in the Denver airport to speak with. Our final leg was on Alaska Air. I make a lost baggage report with them.  I've been on hold with Air Canada the entire time I've been writing this review. Long story long, but don't fly with Air Canada.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

The seats on Air Canada have massage and can be adjusted for firmness and softness and the AV screens are large and easy to use.

Once in the air, I ordered a Pizza from the onboard menu, and it tasted great. In-Flight-entertainment screen worked great,very responsive and had a good selection of movies, TV shows, Documentaries, and more. The seats were very comfortable and the cabin was in excellent condition; very clean and neatly organized. The crew was friendly.

Boarding the plane in London, ticket system went down again and delayed everyone boarding. What has happened to Air Canada? Business class seat a vast improvement on their previous Boeing 777 version, but still not brilliant.

When I was looking for round trips from Beijing to Denver and vice versa, this was one of the cheapest flights I came across, even cheaper than the US airlines, and it did not disappoint! With comfortable seats, a nice selection of the latest movies and TV shows, and decent airline food, I would pick this over airlines like United Airlines any day. Also, the plane did an amazing and efficient job at letting the passengers out the plane. The only complaints I had were rather minor, one being that whenever the crew announced something, they would do it in 3 different languages, meaning you had to wait 3 times as long for your movie to play again, and also Canada's inefficient system of transferring layovers for people going to the US.

I was told to go to the Air Canada service desk where, understandably, at 5:30 in the morning, they were understaffed. When I was sent to another desk and finally helped, I had been rebooked for a flight to Detroit two days later. Thankfully the worker continued to check and found a 5 PM flight on the same day. I was given $20 in vouchers (which I now know over a 12 hour time span can be spent very quickly). When it was time to leave, there was an announcement made that our flight attendant could not be found and therefore we did not know our new time of departure. It was discovered later that she had gone through the wrong side in customs and the flight crew had to go through customs again; the wait was about an hour before we were seated on the plane. We then had to fish out a bag from the hold, wait to taxi for 15 minutes, and the icing on the cake was a wheel broken off of my new suitcase.

AC also provided very obliging service when we needed to change our connecting flight to Calgary. Although a word of caution - AC agent in Copenhagen informed us that we could not check our luggage through only to Toronto and the first question we were asked by AC personnel was whether we had only checked the bags through to YYZ.

Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices.

There was only one FA with us in the front cabin and she did the best she could being short handed with a full cabin. She was friendly and otherwise I enjoyed my trip. The meal was excellent and she offered a special liqueur service which was appreciated by many in the front cabin. My other suggestion is that on the IFE you get more documentaries old comedy TV shows and classic films. These must be reasonably inexpensive.

It's not that the flight was uncomfortable the entire experience was just average. Flight attendants seemed uninterested and the plane was probably the oldest in the fleet.

This route is also being transferred to Rouge next year so maybe it'll improve. CPH-YYZ absolutely no problem newer aircraft friendly flight crew.

At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling.

I don't think it is normal that I have to clean the cabin (remove the cookie crumbs food) off my seat which is filthy stained clean the walls covered with spills and put my blanket on the seat to avoid having to change my clothing when I am heading off to a meeting. Those are things I had to do on my flight from Rome (and the same from Geneva London Paris) The last flight from Rome. The audio system was not working my tablet was broken and the overhead light of our entire row inoperative. We had paid for Business tickets and were standby so I paid an extra for preferred seat so I could have room for my injured knee the leg room was fine but I can tell you that the experience wherever you sit Economy or Business it is always the same: prepare a few napkins and sanitizer so I can have a decent place to sit before the flight. Staff had a condescending attitude!,nan,2.0,nan

The ""hot snack"" consisted of a dry wrap in a box which was horrible. There was a large box under the seat in front of me (any many other seats).

Flight was packed on the outbound and boarding was chaotic due to passengers returning with copious purchases and multiple suitcases and carry-ons. Flight attendants are all new hires and so lack most of the basic skills expected of them. I purchased an extra leg room seat in one of the first four rows. Be aware that KIN check in agents will fill these seats with mothers and babies if you think you're getting a bit of respite. For purchase food selection was missing the healthy items inbound and outbound. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes when customer traveling with parent and 7 relatives including 3 newborns had not made proper arrangements for oxygen and crew struggled to deploy the onboard oxygen using FA manuals to sort out the issues. Lost connection meant 3 hour wait and midnight arrival in YOW. Rouge is not Westjet.

Plus points: flight left on time and arrived early even with a short hold before landing. Also Air Canada has a 3x3x3 configuration on its 777-300s rather than the 3x4x3 used by many other airlines. Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless. 'Continental breakfast' comprised a small muffin and a small container of fruit - insufficient for a flight of 9 hours duration. The AVOD was ok with a wide choice available. I may well go to Canada again but will avoid Air Canada.,nan,3.0,nan

I flew off peak hours so I benefited from a quick check-in with a personable agent. The YYZ-NRT boarding was the usual rush of pax. It would be nice if AC moved the priority lane to one side and it was better labelled so people don't accuse priority boarders of pushing in the line. Not a full flight so FAs had an opportunity to take their time and provide decent service. Food and beverages better than usual and overall I have noticed AC has shown some improvement in its food quality in the past year. Unfortunately the wine selection is still hit and miss. The seat showed its age and was well used. The IFE selection was boring and I resent the forced commercials. It was a good flight and I was able to catch a few hours of sleep. The problem was with the return flight. It was cancelled due to equipment issues. It happens but it seems to be an increasing scenario at AC. The AC response to the issue was disorganized and slow. Personnel tried their best. The end result was hours wasted at the airport until AC sent Pax off to a hotel. Communication was poor. The concierge in NRT was professional although it took some time to get an answer. The lady in YVR who assisted was also professional and kind. Unfortunately the replacement flight the next day was also beset by equipment issues as the air conditioning system wasn't working well and the cabin was stuffy and hot for the flight to YVR. However FAs on this flight were the best I have had on AC. I seem to be encountering an increasing number of equipment issues and delays with AC. I have only recently started using the airline again on my long hauls and I am not particularly impressed by this aspect of its operations.,nan,3.0,nan

I am 5'10"" tall and 170 lbs and the height that aircraft seats were originally made for. It was impossible to reach down and get things from the floor without getting up and bending over. The price of this flight was not cheaper than others and Air Canada did a bait and switch changing the configuration after I purchased the ticket. The cabin crew did their best . The galley for the 400 seats in economy was very small. The food was almost non-existent. Air Canada has the worst food for an international flight I have had. The second meal was a heated wrap essentially a ""hot pocket"". Inflight entertainment was new system on this plane and was quite good but the second flight had a slow outdated system. Overall service good and AVOD good everything else terrible. Flight 787 was an Airbus A320. Bad AVOD only two bathrooms for economy. Turbulent flight so when not turbulent long lines for lavs. Service Satisfactory everything else not. Hopefully Air Canada will get new 737 MAX equipment with 3 lavs in the rear for these medium haul flights. The Pearson Airport transition with US customs is terrible.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Air Canada Rouge - Great cabin crew terrible seating space. I flew from Toronto Canada to Varadero Cuba and back. In both directions the cabin crew were excellent and that is where all good about Rouge stops because no matter what these great people do they can not solve issue with lack of space between the seats. Airplane type was A319 and they had 31 raw of seats which basically means no leg room at all. Anyone close or above to 6 feet or 180cm should avoid Rouge flights. Seating pitch on this plane is 29 and this is for flights to Caribbean. After 3.5 hours of flight you will not be able to get out from your seat because of pain in your back and legs. It is so tight between the seats that in my view this is security issue since in case of the emergency people will have extreme difficulties to quickly leave the seat. When it comes to entertainment system there is something called wifi and that has to be paid 10 $ but it did not work so I can say is it worth or not other than this there is no other option. When it comes to food and drinks non alcoholic beverages including coffee and tea are free how ever quantity is limited to one or if you are lucky two drinks at the best.

I usually do the kiosk thing but given we had a lot of luggage our child has a broken arm in a cast and we were tired I just wanted to deal with a live person. She refused to check us in at the counter and instead assisted us at the kiosk. She then told us we couldn't have seats together as the plane was full. Not an ideal scenario travelling with an 8 year old child! She said there was nothing she could do. She scolded me for not having checked in online 24 hours prior.

They tried a couple of times to re-start it and finally 2 hours before arrival it got done. Things like that happen but no apologies or compensation was offered for a 6000 USD flight. Food was average to low and the crew was rushing through the service with no smile. Bottle of white wine was clearly open for a while the glass was taken away and after my comment about the bad taste no more wine was offered nice way of solving that problem. Transfer in YYZ was easy and good and shortly after boarding the CRJ for Nashville the plane was grounded for technical issues. Had to run to the other end of the airport to get a spare plane 2 hours later and had to wait in a small waiting room with no water or communication on what was going on.

I will never fly AC rouge again. My flight home from Athens was a regular flight and I almost felt guilty with the attention I received. The staff are more mature and know how to communicate with customers. They go out of their way to be available at all times. Their presence is comforting. I will continue flying AC but only on regular flights even if it takes a little longer to get to my destination.

Was interested to see how this new airline looks up close and was surprised at how awful the FA uniforms look in person. The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference! The FA's may be older but they look experienced professional and confident and seem to be enjoying their jobs. I guess it's true you get what you pay for and Rouge is paying peanuts to these kids.

I usually fly with WestJet so I'm used to friendly flight attendants. Boarding this flight was quite a shock. The flight attendant at the front of the plane had a scowl on her face and didn't reply when I greeted her. Later during the in-flight service the same flight attendant asked me if I wanted pretzels. I said ""no no pretzels thank you"" and she didn't offer me a drink at all. I had to her co-worker for a drink and she looked annoyed that I asked. Cleanliness of the cabin was so-so. The floors were clear and there was no garbage in my seat pocket but the window I was sitting next to was coated in what I assume to be facial grease. Delicious. I'm currently preparing for my flights tomorrow and they have both been cancelled and delayed and now I have a layover in Vancouver for several hours. Even though Air Canada is offering other flights to my destination at an earlier time with several available seats they refused to change my flights. I booked my flights a day early to avoid missing mandatory engagements at my final destination due to many of my friends flying with Air Canada and sharing their horror stories about the service and cancellations/delays.

Apparently for flights within the EU there is no differentiation between business class versus economy because when boarding time came this was an absolute 'zoo'. No pre-boarding announcement for business class ticket holders and no priority boarding.

I heard ""boarding completed"" reported twice at separate times so obviously there was confusion. They giggled their way through the safety announcements as if they were a private joke. I was left with a very distinct feeling that in case of emergency this crew would be no help at all in evacuation or other procedures. I have never felt that way on a commercial flight before. The Rouge design seems to be on the ""hipster"" model with banter such as ""you will get busted!"" referring to smoke detectors in the washrooms. Fair enough I guess flights do not have to be sombre to be safe I know from experience. But this needs to be better delivered in the Rouge case. There needs to be an adjustment of crew conduct related a better show of competence. The presence of a more mature (but cheerful!) crew manger would be a big help. I'm sure these are nice deserving young people who work hard and they are trying to make a cramped flight feel lighter.

The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can.

I am a tall person and the tiny regional jet to Vancouver was bad enough with cramped seating and small overhead storage but the long haul across the Pacific was particularly uncomfortable. Clearly AC can order their planes with the seating configs they prefer so with 40-50 seat rows they can easily squeeze in another row in by trimming off a 1/2"" from each row making leg room just that little bit less. Heading out from Vancouver the food was decent but the movie selection was pretty poor. No major current releases and a lot of older stuff. As a result of travelling extensively in the Asia region I must have been on 6 or 7 airlines and when it came time to head home to Canada I had plenty to compare Air Canada to. When it comes to national carriers like Egyptair (Jakarta to Bangkok) or Thai Air (Bangkok to Shanghai) Air Canada doesn't even come close. On the return flight to Canada the plane was an older B767 with the same cramped seating as before. When I checked out the movies they were the same ones that were listed over a month earlier.

All delays were controllable apparently being caused by shortage of staff in airport operations. Being stuck in Montreal airport for 24 hours I got a Holiday Inn voucher but the meal vouchers did not actually cover meals unlike with other airlines' passengers staying at the hotel. Had to stand three hours in a line of five people to get the hotel voucher at the Air Canada counter at the Pierre Trudeau. For a lunch voucher I got a small cup of Pepsi from a tap and water no food. The way the airline struggled with computer maintenance (delay of 4+ hrs from Montreal to Frankfurt) was frightening in terms of flight security. No compensations no apologies but major loss of time and money. Had to buy new tickets for the last leg home.,nan,1.0,nan

Service Director was a gem very gracious. But the rest of the front cabin crew didn't seem to want to be there. Eye contact & smiles were absent and the environment lacked any genuine sense of welcome. We took off after midnight and I opted for the express meal which was adequate but not great.

Why were the pods designed to face the aisle? Plenty of overhead space but minimal storage space around your actual seat. There was a fair amount of trash (newspapers plastic wrappers boarding cards) from the previous flight around my seat and in the overhead bin. The bathrooms were in poor condition.

Air Canada uses American Airlines' Admiral's Club in Santiago which is very pleasant but quite full at night. The gate was crowded and announcements were difficult to hear but boarding was orderly and efficient. The cabin crew was outstanding on this packed overnight flight. And this makes all the difference. Welcoming friendly sincere. We pushed back within 15 minutes of departure time. I opted for the full dinner. While the food itself was average the service was very attentive (this crew hustled!) and the wine selections were surprisingly good. The IFE system had a wide range of choices and was fairly intuitive to use. The bathrooms appeared worn but were clean. The lie flat seat (3D) is very comfortable. Breakfast was a disappointing rubbery omelette but I appreciated being able to sleep until shortly before landing.

The seats are so narrow that it is impossible to move even fingers. It is so annoying that the trip becomes nightmare. Air Canada has introduced these seats into three B777.

As I was in transit this was even more taxing. Air Canada should have provided passengers with meal vouchers/food and hotel accommodation. Before boarding (after 4 hours of waiting) a few parents with young children asked for some water and sandwiches for their children. Their requests were flatly denied. I approached the purser to ask for water and something to eat when we had finally boarded after hours of waiting but I was impolitely brushed off and made to feel greedy even though I had been travelling for 12 hours at that point and was starving. After we were finally informed that the crew were no longer legal and that we had to disembark and spend the night in the airport we were informed that there were no available hotel rooms.

Rouge is a big step down for their regular flight service: reduced legroom uncomfortable chairs inexperienced flight attendants. The lady next to me was not able to be served in French so I had to act as the translator for the attendants this was unacceptable! The Entertainment system changed to an App or browser-based system. I'm not opposed to this but it would be much better if they provided a system on which I can mount my tablet rather than staring down at the table-top the whole flight. Moreover if you have an Ipad you will need to download the app ahead of the flight (or have the Google Chrome browser installed) otherwise you won't be able to view movies onboard. TV viewing will still work through the regular browser (not sure why TV and Movie streaming would be all that different but anyhow).

PE is great! Seats are huge like domestic Executive Class on A320's A319's and A321's on AC but only if the upgrade is offered relatively cheap. My one complaint is that there should be a curtain divider between PE and economy and the cabin doesn't feel separated or intimate and noise and crowds spill over into PE. AC's new EnRoute system is a high upgrade over the old high-rez monitors much easier interface and improved maps. Seats are large leather arm-chairs same as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic small footrest and small cocktail table in armrest. The economy 3-4-3 is just totally unacceptable to a North American consumer who are typically much larger than in other parts of the world. At baggage claim the complaints were loud people all around me talking of the horrid cramped conditions seats that don't breath and suffering passengers. AC get rid of this product it's horrid!!

They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider. For those of us in the air a lot this change of equipment downgrade is a real choice maker.,nan,2.0,nan

This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks.

My flight then took a 30 minute tour around the taxiways which granted AC has no control over but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started our take off. On the return trip we first ran in to possibly the rudest person working a service job I've ever encountered at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologized for her co-worker. Again at the gate the staff was lackadaisical fumbling around and not boarding the flight until 10 minutes before departure (even though the boarding pass said boarding would start 55 minutes prior to departure and the plane was at the gate for a good 20 minutes at least before boarding started). Luckily it only lead to 5-10 minutes delay on the YUL-LGA trip. On all 3 flights there were no announcements about how or where to pick up baggage when we landed. Overall I feel like we were lucky that our AC experience was only somewhat bad.

nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,"This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the ""pods"" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities. Use them.",nan,1.0,nan

Usual AC crush on boarding with lots of people with too much carry-on no enforcement of carry on policy and insufficient space in aircraft cabin design for carry-on seems to be a universal feature of AC that you have to fight for bin space.

However my partners continued poor service through Air Canada for his work trips since February has made me rethink my opinion on them. He has had multiple flights with AC from Toronto to Newark Intl for work and it seems over the last 4 months the service has continued to degrade. AC has continued to overbook flights. On top of overbooking every flight seems to range between late and very late. This level of tardiness could be explained away in February as bad weather but now with not even a cloud in the sky the excuse has gone to continual maintenance issues. As I type this my partner is still sitting in his now 4 hour delay with no explanation why the crew can't seem to get the plane off the ground. I understand things happen sometimes but the way problems are handled is clearly an issue this airline needs to work on. Not all of our service has been bad but all of the recent service has been rather poor. The additional seat area with more legroom is a very nice option for customers and the little TV screens offering movies and music are also very welcome and help with longer flights.

As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination.

Although I had originally seen a suitable flight schedule with Air Canada my travel agent organised for me to fly with Lufthansa as she said they were a more reputable airline. Turned out it was code share with Air Canada meaning no access to meal choice no seat selection and subsequently general anxiety about the booking. I got to the airport 3 hours before each time. At Heathrow I was patronised at the counter with 'everyone knows that showing up early does nothing anymore'. I was given a seat in the last row of the plane that only reclined slightly. No problem I am an experienced traveller and although I was on the way to give one of the most important presentations of my life I was able to relax and keep calm. At Toronto airport checking in for the Heathrow flight I had to queue a very long time and then was told there was no assigned seat for me. I went to Lufthansa to see if there was anything they could do for me. I asked why I could not check in online. They told me because the code was a Lufthansa code not recognised by Air Canada. They then told me that because I had bought a significantly cheaper fare (I hadn't) that I should expect to be treated like this. I did however notice that my class was Y which is usually on my boarding pass when I travel economy. Finally 30 minutes before the flight they called my name and had assigned my seat in the last row of the aircraft where I could not recline. This was the overnight flight from Toronto to Heathrow and I had to go back to work the next day. I was offered a choice of two meat based meals and had to refuse them as I am vegetarian. No seat choice no meal choice. My advice is to give code share a miss. Lufthansa and Air Canada may well be partners but when you travel Air Canada as a Lufthansa customer you are bottom rung nobody who somehow deserves to be patronised by all.,nan,2.0,nan

Air Canada has relocated many of its US gates from main terminals with good services and lounge options to 2nd tier facilities serving discount or charter carriers. The mainline now operates very few flights in North America subcontracting most flights to Jazz Sky Regional and now ""Rouge"". The product has become so inconsistent that unless one flies AC very regularly it would be almost impossible to now what to expect when you book a flight. Hint - avoid Rouge like the plague! To offer Rouge as a low cost / low service alternative is fine - to discontinue mainline service and replace it with Rouge is not fine!

The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled.

The airplane sat on the YOW tarmac for over an hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in Toronto. Only good thing I can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed us to get out of our seats while we waited. On my way off the plane in TOR no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure I could make my connecting flight to San Diego which was showing ""on time"" on the flight board. After passing customs baggage check etc. the flight was no longer showing on the flight board. The AC flight attendants I found roaming around had no clue where to direct me.

As there were 4 people in line my flight had left by the time I received ""service"". So booking another flight to get to San Diego I opted for a layover in Los Angeles that night instead of waiting another 24 hours in Toronto. I was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in Toronto nor Los Angeles even though Air Canada caused me to miss my flight.

TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment.

Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it.

The Dash8 series has never been able to accommodate a full-sized carry-on bag in the passenger cabin either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front. As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination. Passengers were forced to take out from their carry-ons all the items essential to keep with them during their entire trip (laptops prescription medications anything breakable or valuable).

Formerly Tango Plus fares were full status points at a reasonable price and upgradable. This has now changed the 'low cost' Tango fare usually gives you a ticket at a higher price with only 25% of the status points of the former fare and is not upgradable. Customers seeking an upgradable fare must instead book Flex which is a substantially higher price (35-45% higher). Additionally Air Canada will now bill you an extra $750 per leg to book the upgrade. My experience on June 8th was this. Pay extra for a Flex fare in order to upgrade. Upgrade not available so I've paid extra $350 for the Flex fare to sit in a lower priced economy seat available at a cheaper price. An out and out rip-off.

When you're travelling with a 5 month old this situation can create a lot of stress. Once we boarded the situation became worse. The seats were dirty and clearly very worn. It was evident that the planes climate control was broken. We sat onboard the aircraft at the gate for what seemed to be a very long time with aircraft engineers trying to fix the problem. The pilot claimed the problem was fixed we began our taxi away from the gate and then the plane just sat there. We went back to the gate and tried to get it fixed. After a lengthy wait (again) we taxied and took off. Of course once airborne the cooling system still did not work and the pilot informed us that we were going to be diverted to Vancouver to potentially switch planes. Told a new plane was being readied and we would be boarding 7pm Vancouver time. When we went to our new check in gate the situation went from worse to downright awful. Ground staff had no idea on seat assignments and couldn't figure out where to seat everyone. We thankfully got our bassinet seats but other passengers were told to board and to find a seat ""anywhere they could"". We finally got in the air 9 hours after our ordeal.

Seats were similar to AC domestic standard business class about 38' or more pitch two on the sides. The dinner meal was a condensed business class meal in my opinion having travelled in that class previously. The wine drinks service was excellent staff were very attentive. Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones.

All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious.

Wife and I flew out of Paris from CDG. Boarded aircraft along with other 398 passengers and waited for over an hour for the plane to depart. No apologies nor explanations other than a brief P.A. about waiting for one late baggage. Plane arrived at Montreal one hour late and all passengers were not allowed to disembark due to some medical problem with one single person with another further delay of 20 minutes or so. We rushed to baggage claim to retrieve the check-ins then to an Air Canada connections kiosk. The clerk was extremely slow and seemed unsure how to process the transfer and became irritated when told that we were in a hurry to catch the 4 pm connector in 45 mins. She eventually told us that she would be placing us on a 8 pm connector instead. She became even more irate when asked for an explanation and merely told us to move on and just place the luggage on the conveyor. Another agent then came over and demanded us not to place the luggage on the conveyor as the flight was not until 8 pm and we were required to lug them around until further notice. While waiting for the connector - we spoke with a supervisor at an Air Can ticket counter and she explained that all passengers must be checked in 1 hour to departure hence we were placed on an 8 pm connector. At no time did any Air Canada staff members offer any apologies or help to alleviate the problem.,nan,1.0,nan

This 2-3-2 configuration was crowded on a long haul flight and there are only bathrooms in the back of the plane. Our seats at the front - you get it. I do have a few issues with this flight- the bathrooms had not been cleaned and smelt terrible! I think a flight attendant did a good clean up mid flight as it seemed to improve as the flight went on. Surely not appreciated by her. My other issue with Air Canada on both flights is that the cancelled their pre dinner drink run. Cost cutting? Maybe. And the food was pretty lousy too. My children's meals in particular were terrible. Finally our IFE had a glitch and the first 40 rows had their programming interrupted about 20 times. I know first world problems - but when you pay for it. On a brighter note 'some' flight attendants were friendly (others not at all). We will go back to our regular Air Transat route across.

Seats were filthy when we got on the plane with garbage shoved under the seat and in the pockets. Not acceptable for business class. Service was poor and staff constantly running around frantically. No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger. If you are seated next to someone consider yourself stuck because it is very difficult to climb over when the seat is reclined.,nan,3.0,nan

Given the strong and well deserved criticism levelled at Air Canada's bizarre Rouge offering I want to compliment those in charge and working in their Express service. Our flights to Charlottetown and back were on time professionally operated with a calm atmosphere completely absent the tension that exists on so many stressful jammed-in flights. The CRJ 705 to PEI was very comfortable you could cross an ocean in those seats no problem. The smaller CRJ 200 on the way back is more snug with a couple of inches less leg room but still adequate for the flight length. The CRJ 200 lacks the entertainment system and catering of the 705 that is the only thing removing some stars from my overall rating. Now that I will not book an Air Canada flight that could be Rouged at a later date it is good to know that there are some services under the Air Canada brand that one can take with a confident expectation of good service and a pleasant flight.

On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed.

We checked in online at the first opportunity and had an uneventful trip to Miami the Air Canada Plane being a little rugged was an ""Air Rouge"" flight but it was ok. The return flight was a disaster. The Plane from Miami arrived late from Toronto which resulted in missing the Vienna flight. We asked the onboard personnel if they could give us any information on the status of our connecting flight but the same problem again: they told us they had no info on the Austrian Airlines flight and that it was ""out of their hands"" - then they got annoyed when we asked for priority disembarking. Well we ran for it but it had not waited for our party of 8. We were split up re-routed to Paris AC880 and then after 5 hours of waiting to Vienna by Air France flight AF1738. We had to get the Air France boarding passes ourselves offered no assistance like food vouchers or lounge access but told us we could fill out a complaint form online.

Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us.

A few days later I received a call from them to change my itinerary to 26 hours when I asked if they could let me use the airport 10 minutes from my home he said since we put you through the trouble OK. Sleeping in my wheelchair inside of the Mexico City and Guadalajara airport we arrived in Cancun utterly exhausted and me with a diabetic low blood sugar. On the 6 hour flight home with an overnight in Calgary my wife left me ahead to grab our luggage. When they came to get me I told them my supplies were all in the overhead compartment. The rude stewardess wouldn't even look and told me that my wife had everything. I get off of the plane and when I saw my wife she didn't have my jacket medical supplies or test kit. After spending the night trying to retrieve my medical supplies in the city we went home exhausted again. They had the nerve the next day to tell me to come and get my supplies.

I just returned from a trip to Thailand and flew the Vancouver to Hong Kong leg (return) business class in their newly configured 777-300 series aircraft. The new business class seating arrangement on this aircraft is an unmitigated disaster. Where do I begin! It is primarily a 2-2-2 layout with 3 rows being 1-2-1. This single seat is only available to AC super elite members. So AC has decided that any other full fare business class travelers on this aircraft are not entitled to a single seat. Ridiculous. The tight seats are far too firm and narrow footwells make it impossible to properly stretch out and have a relaxing sleep. There is no storage area and materials used are cheap and do not even belong in a Premium Economy section. Window passengers do not have a clear access to the aisle. You have to climb over the other passenger. This is unacceptable in a business class in today's airline industry! I browsed through the Duty Free Magazine located in the seat pocket in front of each seat and asked the Flight Attendant if I could order something. She advised me that the configuration of this aircraft did not permit any duty free sales on board. No duty free on board when there is a duty free magazine located in every seat pocket! I will never fly on this aircraft again and my frequent flights to Asia will be on other Star Alliance carriers which are improving their business class product not reducing it to cattle car status such as AC.,nan,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,5.0,no,nan,2.0,"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding.",nan,2.0,nan

I understand that due to safety issues there was no choice but to cancel the flight but what I'm extremely upset about was the unhelpful staff and lack of support for the 300 passengers walking out of that plane at midnight in a snowing city hungry and without anywhere to go. After exiting the plane we were summarily dismissed by agents who could do nothing to help us rebook our plane find hotels or even to just to remove our ""checked-in"" status so that we could call the helpline to rebook our flight. Because the desk agents failed to remove my ""checked-in"" status (when I asked they told me it would be done in about an hour which did not happen) I had to call the help line 3 different times before someone there was able to reach the ticket office to fix things up and issue me a new ticket for next evening.

Our return flight included a connection at Montreal - the plane from New York was delayed and from the offset the staff on the plane were incredibly rude disengaged and unhelpful when we asked for advice and reassurance. The whole process was terribly managed - we arrived at the boarding gate in time to see our plane pull away from the gate - some better communications and we definitely could have boarded that flight with a five minute delay for the other passengers at most. We were then sent around the airport with cursory explanations and a lack of basic guidance - for example no one explained there was a shuttle bus to the hotel or even pointed us in the right direction. There was a lack of staff in the airport due to it being a bit later in the evening and we felt completely unguided in the process. I was stunned that a customer-focused service could have such a poor grasp of good communications and moreover just didn't seem to care about it's customers as well. We arrived in London 12 hours after our scheduled arrival time. Overall the process was poor in itself - bad food stingy amounts.

There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it.

It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job.

I was to arrive at my destination at 0930 in the morning and didn't get there until 5 in the evening. I had a 2 hour wait in one airport and a 3 hour wait in another. This was not acceptable to me as I was travelling with my husband who is a dialysis patient and had meds with him that had to be kept cold also my 75 year old mother who has problems walking. Not once did we get an apology or even a food voucher to eat. Thankfully we were only travelling from Deer Lake to Toronto - usually a 2.5 hour flight but took us 11 hours.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,Having had two bad experiences with Air Canada I will never fly with them again. First issue: Booked to depart Vancouver at 0800 on 1 Aug 14 on a flight to Toronto we arrived at the airport early. Checked our bags and got our boarding passes however on the boarding pass it did not have a seat allocation but indicated that this would be done at the gate no problem. As we had cleared security and it was now only 0620 we casually got a coffee and wandered up to the gate. On arrival at the gate my wife went to the desk to get our seat allocation only to be berated by the desk person who told her they had been paging us we didn't hear anything. He then informed her that our flight was boarding. We said that our flight wasn't until 0800 he then told us that our original flight was delayed until 1000 and we had been placed on the one now departing. Obviously had we not arrived early we would have been waiting around until 1000. All well and good but why weren't we informed of the change when we check in? Arriving early in Toronto messed with our booked transport which caused a few anxious moments and we had to get a taxi however thanks to Viator we got a refund on our transport booking. Second issue: The next flight was from Toronto to Seattle (E90) 3 Aug 14. On this fight the cabin crew showed a complete disregard for the comfort of the passengers. We were seated in the second last row of seats and were very conscious of people using the toilet no problem. However the flight had a number of turbulence issues and at one stage the line up for the toilet was half way up the cabin. On a number of occasions people asked if they could use the toilet at the front of the aircraft and this was denied. It did not help matters with the seatbelt sign going on and off. At one stage a young girl who had been waiting a long time got to the front of the line only to be told to go back and put her shoes on. I have never been told to put my shoes on. Anyway all that said I will never fly Air Canada again. The first impression is always the best and lasting impression.,nan,3.0,nan

The result was that I could not go to the bathroom with my son without leaving my baby. I could not change my baby without leaving my son alone - my wife was 30 odd rows away. The stewardesses would not help us get food from bags (which were all with my wife because we were meant to be sat together).

I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said ""I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good.

Water was served periodically during sleep time. Although I never watch any movies on flights I did go through their collection. I must say the number of titles in stock was massive. You'd be more than satisfied if you enjoy IFE on long hauls.

The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked. Fortunately BA did sort out the mess without any assistance from Air Canada who had gone incommunicado and would not answer calls.

As a disclaimer for these flights I was not ""overly"" concerned about pricing but rather timing and comfort. That said I definitely wasn't willing to pay insane prices. In my opinion and for how I was traveling Air Canada has been by far the best airline I have traveled with (I have not flown airlines such as Emirates as they don't offer the routes I need but of course I have heard good things). There is no question that a direct AC flight to your destination might be more expensive than flying with another airline with one or 2 connections. If you are not too worried about spending more time traveling and in result save a few bucks - then go for it. That said where AC really shines is comfort and from my experiences service. The no. 1 reason I fly AC is comfort. In economy there is a good amount of leg room. If you disagree try flying United in row 30 and then report back. Secondly there is free in-flight entertainment in every seat. The flight from Heathrow to Toronto will fly by with a movie and some TV shows. Thirdly the first class cabin on the YYZ-LHR route was incredible. I am a light sleeper and also 6'2"" and even with the decent economy seats in AC economy I still have trouble sleeping. As most of the YYZ to LHR flights are red-eyes and I need to be rested for meetings when I arrive - I often spent the extra money (or later on upgrade credits) to fly in business. I don't care if Emirates gives you a hot towel to exfoliate your face halfway through the flight what AC provided was a great lay-flat bed in a semi-private pod and I got a good 6 hours of sleep. It was invaluable. Where the true service came through was on the return. When getting a ride back to LHR there was crazy traffic on the M1. Airlines recommend arriving to LHR three hours before your flight. I arrived 45 mins before the flight. The AC staff were so helpful in getting me checked in and somehow got me on a golf cart and I was driven through the bowels of the airport escorted through security back on another golf cart that drove through random hallways passed luggage belts arriving right at the gate just before they closed the doors.

No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,1.0,Yesterday I flew from London to Toronto on a Boeing 767 which is basically a lovely plane. My complaints about this flight which apply to every Air Canada flight I've taken in the past few years are principally about: a) terribly uncomfortable seats and b) the lousiest food anywhere in the air. a) Seat comfort. Who on earth designs a seat that is so short that it puts unbearable pressure on the middle of the back of one's thighs? And this wasn't a Rouge flight either but a mainline experience. Why do they torture us with seats that are so close together that our knees are grinding against the seat in front? I'm a very average sized person - 5'10 and 170 pounds - so there is no excuse why the seat should not be comfortable. And let's not even mention the fact that the available tilt is about 4 inches from front to back with zero lumbar support. b) Long ago back in the 70's when I was a university student I used to wonder why the cafeteria food was so terrible when Air Canada could server a very decent meal at 35000 feet in a pressurized aluminium tube. In those days I routinely asked if they had any leftover meals on transatlantic flights because the food was actually quite enjoyable. Not any more. It's just awful. Virtually inedible except when one is starving. And yesterday's flight was the very worst. Recently I had the opportunity to fly to from and around Central America on the Colombian airline Avianca. Although the aircraft themselves weren't new the in-flight experience and especially the food was exceptional. The difference between the food service on Air Canada and Avianca is night and day. Avianca has delicious food and interesting menus served with a smile. Air Canada has heated cardboard served reasonably efficiently but without any enthusiasm by flight attendants in dowdy uniforms.

Air Canada has to be congratulated for cramming more seats into this aircraft than ever before. I paid a premium for the extra legroom seats behind business class. The aisle seat is placed right in the centre of the entry to the aisle of business class. This results in constant crashing of the food and beverage carts into the seat even though the new carts are narrower than those used on other aircraft. If the video screen which is in the armrest is used the situation is even worse. everybody trying to negotiate their way through the aircraft hits the screen.

Air Canada took no action during the 4 hour delay to rebook anyone who was going to miss their connecting flights. In the meantime AC's ""customer service"" number was continually busy. Stayed on hold for another 2 hours and finally got through to a booking agent. Got my wife rebooked for a later flight out of Toronto to MSP and wondered why this wasn't being handled internally by Air Canada. I notified my wife and she was able to check in and get to the gate in plenty of time for the later flight. I had a 3 hour drive to Minneapolis to pick her up. Just as I was getting on the interstate she text me saying that AC said there would be a slight delay but that it would be short. Halfway to Minneapolis I got another text saying that AC had cancelled the flight without explanation and were providing no assistance to stranded passengers. The gate agents were rude and simply told people they couldn't help them and that they would have to leave the gate area. What they failed to tell the stranded passengers was that they couldn't leave the secured area without assistance from AC or security. It was just by pure luck that my wife stopped an agent from another airline who explained that the passengers would need to be ""let out"" through a locked door so they could return to the ticketing area and start the entire process of booking a flight over again. Flights get delayed and cancelled that's just the way air travel has become. However Air Canada's total lack of regard for their passengers well being after a flight is cancelled was echoed by everyone flying Air Canada. The rudeness of the gate agents after the flight was cancelled and the empty promises of booking agents to assist stranded passengers was unparalleled. When the passengers were finally able to get to the ticketing area for Air Canada there were five queues with five functional computer terminals there were hundreds of people waiting in the five lines - but not a single Air Canada employee to be seen despite Air Canada's promises of assistance.",nan,1.0,nan

Halifax to Montreal on a E175 and crew did bare minimum to pass their time onboard and again were just as unpleasant as the previous lot. My luggage got left in Halifax even though I had a 3 hour layover was reunited with my bags 2 days later with no apology offered when I returned to the airport to pick up lost luggage.

The so called new suite on Air Canada's Boeing 777 on select routes only must be one of the worst business class seats ever designed. I was seated in 2D. When you first arrive at your seat you think that you have plenty of space. However once seated you soon feel very claustrophobic. The large arm rest on the left is made up by the very small armrest on the right which puts you very close to your neighbour. Just sitting normally ones left arm/hand naturally rests on the seat controls so without warning your seat starts moving. The tray table has a 3 phase deployment which could only be done by cabin crew. All passengers battled. Your seat can only be upright or flat with no in between settings. When flat the massage function on my seat would not turn off. It would only turn off when upright. When flat your feet go under the seat in front leaving no room to move your legs around. It's like laying in a coffin. There is no ground area for any luggage and no space for your duvet or pillow (which you are not allowed at your feet for take off / landing). All in all a very badly designed seat. I wasn't a great fan of the previous pod system but it is far better than this current design. I would rather have flown BA even with the backward facing seats.

My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class.

Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,3.0,Planned to travel with Air Canada (Toronto to Ixtapa) on January 31st for a one week vacation in Mexico (given the short duration time was of the essence). Arrived at Pearson in good time and was advised the flight would be delayed 15 minutes (acceptable but just!). On arrival at departure gate loading of plane was initiated then minutes later an announcement that the loaded passengers would have to be deplaned as there as a maintenance issue (not a weather or staffing concern!). First observation: why does Air Canada insist on placing faulty equipment in the loading gate? Don't think it is too much to ask to have a functional plane ready and available to load at prescribed time! Worse the 'delay' (over the next six hours) lead to a flight cancellation at about 7pm. Many families with small children are then expected to deal with the development one that was obviously known hours earlier but not shared. Air Canada's behaviour in this regard is consistent - it would be only a common courtesy to advise on such matters - honestly and in a timely fashion - so passengers can make other arrangements. But no the airline drags the waiting times out until no other options are available. As a result a plane-load of angry passengers are at the 'customer service' desk to make alternate (hotel and air travel) arrangements only to learn that the staff there have not been advised of the situation. As a result more time is lost (almost an hour) as harried staff scramble to address the issue making other arrangements etc. without being prepared in advance for the onslaught with answers ready and alternate course of action determined! Again incredibly poor planning from this passengers perspective. Finally we were advised that we were scheduled on a flight the next morning and this one actually took off as scheduled and on time. Remarkably as for this passenger it was the first Air Canada flight (out of the most recent five flights flown with the airline) that was neither 'cancelled' or 'delayed' on departure (I reference flights between March 2014 and January 2015 in this regard: Denver SFO Nashville Miami and Ixtapa (1)). As a result my 'trust' in Air Canada is at an all-time low as they simply cannot be relied upon to reliably meet their contractual obligations.

We were rudely informed that that was not possible and were directed to go to customer service. Air Canada told us that they could not get us to Tokyo that day and that we would need to spend the night in Toronto. They paid for the room and some of our meals but the customer service was horrible. No attempts were made to book us with another airline as we have had happen in a similar situation in the past. Two years United screwed up and caused us to miss a flight to Hawaii but they bent over backwards and got us there only one hour later than our original time.

Then she proceeded to sit where I could clearly see her reading a magazine and eating - very professional. When we were about an hour from destination the attendant got up and finally started breakfast prep then placed the cart in the middle of the cabin and started serving fruit plates 15 min later she served the hot breakfast not long after the descent started. Trays collected finally and still descending the coffee cups and juice glasses are still not picked up.

Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.,nan,3.0,nan

Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase.

Overhead bins too tiny for carry-on resulting in bags being shoved under seats wherever possible by an overwhelmed and stressed attendant. Disgraceful considering the usurious fare charged by AC. Inbound on United was most surprisingly day compared to night. Roomy and comfortable 320 Airbus attentive attendants serving an open bar drink before takeoff and during flight to Newark excellent lunch provided with soup and chicken salad or a cheeseburger and potato salad as choices. Flight from EWR to YYZ also well managed even though only a one hour trip and comfortable on an Embraer with proper sized bins for hand luggage and spacious business class seating.

We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault.

The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie!

Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.,nan,2.0,nan

Now my comments on my experience with Air Canada on this trip: Air Canada uses the Boeing 767-300ER between YOW and LHR. Despite this plane showing its age it's always a very sturdy and reliable plane no wonder that many airlines are still using them regularly on long haul routes. On my outbound flight the captain gave accurate cockpit announcements and staff members on both flights were very attentive and professional. Food snacks and refreshments were plentifully provided throughout the flights. My only issue is with the seats which were uncomfortable and there was very little legroom. Otherwise the meals were decent by airplane food standards and Air Canada offers a great inflight entertainment service keeping you busy on a 7-hour flight. I travel to Canada at least a couple of times a year and previously I used KLM travelling to Ottawa with a stopover at YUL. The route I took with Air Canada this time works out better for me personally and overall I am quite well satisfied with this airline. Will use them again in the future.,nan,4.0,nan

The front seat row 12 on the Dreamliner 787-8 is missing the leg support and relax as all other Asia/Pacific airlines such CX NH JL QF BR which has superior seat comfort and welcoming Champagne as well not only water and juice as AC offers.

With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already.

The reading lights for all the middle section of seats did not work. This was an international flight - US to Canada but I think Air Canada views it as one country.

The cabin was new and spotless, seats were really comfortable and inflight entertainment was excellent. Service was really good, but the second meal was only a very bad slice of cake. LHR-YYZ was on an older 777-300ER with 3x3x3 abreast economy on May 26th. I could not perceive any difference in width between the inbound and the outbound flights. Most of the cabin crew on board this flight were the best AC bunch I have had in a while, there was one that was very nasty to a passenger whose English could not be understood easily. Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty. I had encountered the CSM working in this flight before, and I have to say he does know how to co-ordinate a team.

ORD-YYZ was on time FA's were friendly and fairly attentive a dinner (chicken skewers on warm salad) was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. Seats were comfortable for the short flight however not as good as the first class seats on US airlines. Check-in in ORD as well as in YYZ worked well manned premium counters and just a short wait. AC uses UA lounge in ORD which was poor as expected. Fairly crowded no actual food some limited snacks most alcoholic drinks were for purchase but some were complimentary such as house wine and one type of domestic beer. However the lounge has a manned bar which for practical purposes means as this is the US tips are expected anyway. Boarding was uneventful which is good. Arrival in Pearson a mess arriving passengers are held back midway in the terminal by airport employees while crossing embarking passengers make their way to their plane. This lasted for several minutes with frustrated arriving passengers with tight connections having to wait for the embarkation process to finish. Also airport employees were rather rude in this situation. Customs hall before border control packed and 45 minutes wait to get through border control. Arrival process in Person obviously not AC's fault but still very unpleasant; not a good first impression for Canada. Check-in and security at Person was a breeze. YYZ-CPH was boarded on time but then delayed for almost an hour at the gate and on the tarmac because one generator did not work. For this reason the plane was also unpleasantly hot while on the ground. Once in the air everything was fine. The Dreamliner is obviously a modern and comfortable plane. AC’s version has a 1-2-1 pod style configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD with a decent movie selection. Crew of friendly senior FA's were excellent professional courteous and attentive. Air Canada is obviously going for a European style of service rather than following the style of US based airlines. Also FA's were regularly present in the cabin to check if something is needed and generous with wine refills. Dinner was a seafood appetizer salad and roasted cod plus various dessert choices. I thought dinner service was very good for airline food. Also featuring some Canadian flavors as well as a Canadian Chardonnay. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Skipped breakfast in favor of sleeping an additional hour so cannot comment on its quality. AC's Maple Leaf Lounge again excellent comfortable spacious and with various quite good food options and a nice selection of drinks. A very pleasant experience and several quality steps above the lounges operated e.g. by UA or AA. Arrival in CPH was delayed 45 minutes but fine otherwise. Border Control in CPH fast and efficient and quite surprisingly for CPH no long wait for the luggage to arrive. All in all two very pleasant flights. Have not flown AC previously because of the airlines mixed reputation but wanted to make use of the stopover possibility in Toronto and to fly the Dreamliner.

After flying with British Airways for years now I decided to try Air Canada, but I won't again. The service and food were bad and a lot of screens and/or earphone plugs aren't working. As an single traveller, 6""4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her. I ended up with some cheese and crackers, grapes and a cup of peanuts, one headphone working and a terrible feeling for letting me change my seat for other people.

Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served.

When we had gone through security, we went to the customer service desk and explained what had happened. The lady there told us we did not have seats at this stage and that the guy in baggage drop had no authority to guarantee that we would get on the plane. She told us to wait at the gate to see if we were allocated a seat. After a very tense hour, and after most of the passengers had boarded, we were eventually called to the gate and given boarding passes, seated several rows apart. Compared to other airlines around the world, and particularly our domestic flights on Qantas and Virgin Australia, the standard of service is well below par.

My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a ""remote"" control located on the arm rests.

I learned the flight was full, and as I was in economy in a seat with no window (31K) I asked if there were any other economy seats that had a window. I was only offered the middle of the middle section, which I declined. I then asked if my Aeroplan miles would be of any use, but was told there were people with higher status on the flight. It doesn't hurt to ask, and it certainly helps to ask nicely, and to be decently dressed. I had a brief chat with ground staff, who were not in AC uniforms. Moments later, one of the ground staff approached me with a huge smile on her face, and a boarding card in her hand. I was taken up front to executive first, seat 10D. I've flown this cabin before, and was really pleased about the upgrade. It didn't matter to me at all that I didn't have a window at my seat. Such a huge difference from economy. Crew really can't do enough for you in the premium cabin. There were bubbles for boarding, along with pretzels, due to an allergic pax near me. I went up to the galley after takeoff to enjoy a glass of decent (but not really good) champagne, and some hot nuts. I then returned to my seat for meal service. There was middling champagne, but excellent reds and whites served with lunch. I had a seafood appetizer which was good, but which was not presented very attractively. Then I had a main of mushroom and herb-crusted lamb with red currant jus. I had this on a flight a few years ago out of CPH, and it was as good as I remembered, cooked rare. The CSA worked my side of the cabin, and he was attentive and friendly. The meal was filling, and so I skipped the cheese, and had ice cream and a cognac, and settled in for a sleep on my way back to Toronto. There was a snack service before landing, but the sandwiches, though wrapped, were really stale. The interesting thing is that the IFE's map feature does work in Business Class, but doesn't in economy: why is that? A pleasure to ride up front, but a drastic difference from down the back with economy pax. Again, I'll suggest that AC can do a lot to make their economy experience better: after all, tickets are about 1400$C for this trip in high season. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

When we arrived at Heathrow, special Needs staff lifted G into his wheelchair; he switched the power on but his chair was dead. We spent the four hours between our flight to Manchester with engineers, ground staff and special needs staff but no-one could fix the chair. The headrest appeared broken too. We were transferred to a different terminal in a manual chair. We spent a further two hours at Manchester where staff tried in vain to find the problem and complete paperwork confirming damage. Staff read the wheelchair manual but this was too technical for a layperson to understand.We borrowed a manual chair to take G home, his own broken chair being delivered home late the following evening. Air Canada have accepted full liability and will pay the nhs for repairs (it's an nhs wheelchair). The repair contractor found the baggage handler had disconnected every possible connection in the wheelchair rather than disconnecting one easily accessible plug for the flight duration as was in the written instructions he refused to read. The wheelchair had to be completely stripped down for the reconnections to be made. Air Canada say they will also compensate us as G had to sit in his emergency basic canvas seated manual wheelchair for two days. He cannot move around in it and as the back does not tilt it makes it difficult for him to eat and drink. With regard to the flight, the seats were comfy with plenty of legroom - and I have long legs! Staff were polite. Breakfast was a choice of pancake or omelette.

Boarding started late, but was done in an organized way. Once on board we were greeted by some very friendly Montreal-based crew members. The two francophone flight attendants were very friendly in a not-fake way as opposed to the overcompensated service that can be found on some airlines, the anglophone flight attendant looked a bit surly and was not friendly, but she did her job fine and was polite. It is a bit of a shame that food is the typical American ""buy-on-board"" selection. The options available were similar to any café food (sandwiches and wraps) served on a napkin along with other unfortunate junky choices. All non-alcoholic drinks were free of charge. (TIP: It is worth it to pay $7 when booking online, this will allow you to choose a main dish and a snack from the menu at no extra cost. Bear in mind that these items will be more expensive on board and that you will need to be carrying a credit card). The airplane was in great conditions in spite of its age. In flight entertainment was the standard personal video, but choices were not very enticing. Arrival was done in a very organized manner, and crew made sure that passengers with tight connections left the plane first, which is very considerate.

Why do any of these people continue to do this job if they don't like the public? I guess this is a good route for cabin staff and rewards them for their years of service. It's not cheap to fly with Air Canada, we paid a lot for the seats - they're not a budget airline but offer worse service than one. The seats are poorly designed, the buttons for the remote are built onto the passenger armrest : it's almost impossible not to lean on the panel whilst seated, so the lights, volume, and service button are frequently accidentally pressed, it's very annoying. Not that this bothered the flight crew, who never attended a service call on either leg of the journey for anyone.

The food is generally good, and the drink service on my last flight was regular, generous and friendly. The downsides - the last 2 times I have flown with them they messed up my meal orders. The time before last they did not have a gluten free option as I had requested. The last time they gave me a gluten free meal with chicken in it. I am a fusspot gluten free/veggie (which had been noted on the agent website's booking form), luckily my wife had the vegetarian meal which happened to be gluten free. Their official response - they can only cater for one dietary requirement. Sad to see this in the 21st century, so if you don't fit into a particular box, bring your own food along to avoid disappointment. Fair do's to Air Canada though, they do keep offering money off when they mess up, but I would prefer a meal I can eat with no fuss or bother.

If we had showed at the gate for the flight that night with no boarding passes, we would have likely been out of luck because initially, Air Canada could not find our tickets!

People seem to be let on with cabin bags as big as my main case (it's not only Air Canada who let them get away with it). As a result, the lockers were full, meaning having to squish bags under the seat in front. The result is a real squeeze. We spoke to the crew, and they said AC have removed a galley and set of toilets so they can squeeze in more seats. This makes meal-heating arduous for them and conditions cramped. We were actually dreading the return trip, but it was far less packed, and there was a good 6"" extra leg-room. It really makes a difference. I know airlines have to maximise profit, but if they get known as the airline with cramped seats, people will steer clear. On the way out, my entertainment system didn't work, except to show a map. No films, TV, music. On the way back, it all worked. Food going out was OK at best, with the last part being a wrap which dribbled all over my top. Probably my own fault for not knowing how to eat.

It is appealing to travel domestically on a twin-aisle plane. But the IFE has more limited offerings than were previously available, so bring plenty to read. Travel on the short YYZ-ROC is almost always a nightmare. I was determined not to be fooled again, and had already lined up a rental car to drive instead - knowing that the average delay has been running well over an hour and I'd easily get there sooner by car. Up until less than an hour before boarding the flight was shown on time (despite the arriving equipment being shown as not getting in until well after the posted departure time).

Not now - there is more room and the seat is comfy and not too firm. The lie flat seat is now much easier to control with the touch pad screen, and in the sleeping position there is lots more leg room too. Each person is in a private pod, and the whole product has been so well designed and thought out. The TV screen is large and razor sharp, and the BOSE noise cancelling headphones are wonderful. You will also have fun with the new light sensitive windows which do not require a shade. They have a new food menu in business class.

Living in Hawaii requires a long flight to any designation outside the island chain. I have flown Hawaiian mostly to California destinations and have never been sorry about that choice. I always slept comfortably on red eye flights. However, I was in pain and shifting constantly en route to Los Angeles on the first leg of journey because seating was too close. I am only 5'6 and about 125 lbs so it should not be a problem. I couldn't sleep at all. Then, in Los Angeles, as we were boarding a empty plane that was not even close to being sold out, we were stopped by a flight attendant who lifted both our regulation size carry ons. She smugly said, ""if this wasn't a full flight we couldn't let this bag on."" Um, why bother singling us out? Why bother even mentioning it? It was wholly irrelevant. She was just rude. When we got to Toronto, we were in more pain and really uncomfortable because we were on the same aircraft type as the flight across the pacific (two rows of 3 seats, narrow body). The Air Canada folks were really unfriendly and downright couldn't be bothered throughout our traveling. It wasn't isolated. After a 6 hour layover at Toronto, we discovered we weren't seated next to one another on our 10 hour flight to Munich. We tried to get them changed and they were (sort of) but then they messed that up and the double booked our seats. So when we got on the plane we didn't have any seats. The kicker is that I went to ask a question of a flight attendant she pretty much ripped my head off and was extremely confrontational. All I wanted was her to tell the other flight attendant an important piece of info while they were sorting out the seat issue. Our flight to Munich on the brand new airbus was amazing. If you have a chance to fly the dream plane do, but the crew were still unfriendly. When we flew home we flew with Lufthansa and it was great. Back on Air Canada from Vancouver, BC to Hawaii - awful. The flight attendants were dressed in cheap looking uniforms. They left the lights on almost the entire time so we couldn't sleep (night flight) and they kept the air on the entire time. Everyone around us froze. There was no TV, music, or any entertainment at all. They told us we needed to download an app after we were on plane where there is no internet.

Curiously there was another Air Canada flight scheduled at the same time for departure but was told the plane was fully booked. I did notice at the time of checking in the plane was clearly not fully booked (AC 180). The only way to get home was through Montreal which added an additional 3 hours to the flight. How they can cancel a routine route flight full of people and and sub in a plane that obviously had smaller capacity and not able to take all of the booked passengers, re-routing them instead, is beyond belief. The agent did not seem to feel that this was in any way unreasonable even though I had a booked seat on the cancelled flight. So a 5 hour flight turned into an 8 hour flight which would not have been too bad other than it took another 2 hrs to get to the gate in Toronto and get my bag (1hr 15 mins of waiting for the bag).

However, considering what I paid for that seat - what is Air Canada even thinking? It seems like they haven’t flown these planes before or have anyone on staff that has even one flight of experience on their resume. It began at check-in in Columbus where no less than 5 agents stood looking at their computers and doing their best to check in two passengers in the span of 35 minutes. I was embarrassed for them and luckily we had arrived early so we weren’t stressed with time constraints. I am on a flight from Toronto to New Delhi, sitting in 3G with the seat all the way back, attempting to balance myself while typing this, sitting up, on a half-way reclined seat. God bless the flight attendants – I just asked one for help to put my seat back to a semi-seated position and she started pressing the buttons on my seat controls and said, “It’s not working? Well, do you want duty free?” The “chair moving system” is apparently turned off for the moment as they “reboot the entertainment system.”  There is no way to put my seat up and one of the flight attendants acknowledged this fact. I tuned in to the inflight programming before takeoff and that was the last time that it actually worked. I was able to begin the “Diary of a Teenage Girl” but that is no longer a choice on the movie selection. This is a 14 hour flight and we are now only able to access 5 movie choices from the New Releases. This was after the crew attempted to reset the service for two hours. The reset apparently takes at least 40 minutes to accomplish but still never works. The service in business class is poor - I waited 2 hours for a beverage refill during dinner and finally I just got up and walked back to the drink station and refilled it myself. My husband and I – since we’re on our honeymoon – asked for champagne. For the first round crew members presented us with a glass but it wasn’t even chilled. I realize in the grand scheme of life and love and loss this matters about as much as a cricket being run over by a car but  the tickets for this part of the plane are expensive and the service/inflight entertainment/food are all awful?

If the CEO of Air Canada speaks of a superior on board product in his letter to the passengers in the Air Canada in-flight magazine then I suggest a major improvement in the food as to make an already great experience even better.

We had arrived at the airport with ample time before our flight, we had already checked in online and prepaid for our suitcase to be checked. All we had to do was print off our boarding passes and check our bag. We waited in line for an atrocious amount of time (there weren’t even many people in line) as Air Canada employees socialized with each other instead of getting people through in a timely fashion. When we finally got up to the counter, they told us we had missed the deadline for baggage check by 2 minutes. The employee were so rude and kept emphasizing that we were late and needed to arrive earlier, use the kiosks instead, etc., as he clearly saw us waiting in line for more than 20 minutes. We checked in our suitcase at a baggage storage unit in the airport overnight instead for $8, and rushed through the airport in order to make it to our flight on time. We got to the gate as they were just finishing boarding our flight. We were about to board when the flight attendants tell us they have no more room for carry-on baggage, and they need to start checking our carry-ons. That alone would have been frustrating enough, but that, added to the fact that we were just denied the ability to check our bag and had rushed around the airport in order to store it, was downright infuriating. Additionally, we did not get beverage service on the flight for 3 hours. My sister went in the next day to pick up our luggage and ship it to us, at a cost of $275. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Boeing 777-200,Economy Class,4.0,December 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Toronto to Sydney,3.0,"My wife and I flew Air Canada from Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver and then back on the same route two weeks later. Prior to the flight, I was a bit concerned about the quality of service we would get compared to Qantas and Air New Zealand, which we have flown before. The crew (flight deck and flight attendants) on both legs was actually quite good - responsive and polite. We had a slight delay due to a minor technical malfunction leaving Sydney, and the captain kept us well informed. I appreciated the frequent ""water runs"" by flight attendants throughout the flight - important to keep hydrated during those 14 hours. However, there are definitely things that Air Canada could enhance for this sector: Toronto passengers flying to Sydney have an awkward flight transformation whereby they are on a domestic flight up to Vancouver with North American service standards for food. They are entitled to free food because they are flying as international passengers, however, we had to inform or alert the flight attendants of our status (although we found out they already had this information!), which was awkward to do, particularly if your seatmate was a domestic passenger flying only to Vancouver. Would it be too much to ask if international passengers could be treated the same as those with special meal requests, who are served discretely prior to the regular meal service - On the way back, we had to clear customs in Vancouver, collect our baggage and then put it on the luggage belt for the continuing flight to Toronto. There is a long walk from customs to where the bags are put on the belt. The most disconcerting thing about this was that we barely had time to use the washroom before having to immediately line up to board the flight to Toronto - this was unlike the much more contained but efficient process on the way to Sydney, where we deplaned and then reboarded in the same general area. The quality of the food on the Vancouver-Sydney sector was average at best - bland but adequate. Breakfast included a hardened omelette which was barely edible. Food on the Sydney to Vancouver sector (same meals - chicken with vegetables or beef with rice) were tastier - we attributed that to Australian (vs. Canadian) catering. AVOD was again very lacklustre - older movies and nothing very appealing, music selections were average - used to be XM radio, now Stingray, small old screens - mine had a crack on the way back So no major complaints but there is much room for improvement in the product.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Having used British Airways Premium Economy on the London to Toronto route, I was keen to compare the two. Check in was not at Heathrow as I was hubbing from Germany - the new terminal is great other than the trek to the gate. Priority boarding was quick and easy. On board, the Premium Economy cabin is great - just three rows creating a quiet and intimate environment. A menu was offered along with decent hot towels and juice or water. (in plastic cups) The food was at best average with either cheese pasta of red chicken curry on offer. Neither were my idea of an upgraded meal service. No bar service before a late lunch was offered and so a pre dinner drink was served (when asked) along with the meal. Two T&Cs were offered along with a drink after dinner. The AVOD / entertainment was excellent - probably the highlight! A large screen akin to a tablet with easy navigation. The seat was comfy too though being in the front row meant (bizarrely) that there was no foot stall. The crew were ok - nothing special, but did make an effort to engage. We took off late and landed early so no complaints there. Like BA, the Premium Economy experience morphed into economy for the snack. Another hot towel with the (Economy) hot savory slice merely served on a china plate with two chocolates. There were nice touches using decent glass for drinks, tablecloths on the table etc etc But then odd things such as serving the boarding drink in plastic, poor food choice or a low quality snack on china. All in all, the extra money is worth it to me for the priority boarding, more space and a decent level of service. I think BA has the edge only because the product is more mature. With a bit of tuning Air Canada could really turn it into a quality Premium Economy experience rather than the slightly ill thought out, inconsistent and hit and miss nature of the service.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

I have flown Air Canada multiple times and normally never had bad service, but this experience consisted of a 26-hour hold up in Vancouver International Airport. While the initial delay was due to factors beyond Air Canada's control, our family was then overbooked on multiple flights, transferred to a United Airlines flight, only to be rejected from boarding that flight due to Air Canada not transferring our bag (United Airlines stated that without our bag, they would not let us board the flight due to liability concerns). We then had multiple conversations with various Air Canada employees, one of whom in particular was aggressive and confrontational, telling me at one point that I should consider myself lucky that she was spending her time dealing with me. She also lied to us on multiple occasions. Air Canada eventually offered us a hotel and a flight via Seattle the next morning, and then did a complete about face after we accepted, refusing to honour the offer they made less than an hour before. The reason our bag was not transferred to United Airlines (as we discovered when we went to collect it after the last flight for the day had left from Vancouver Airport without us on board), was that it had already flown to Los Angeles earlier that day. Ironically, we did eventually end up flying from Vancouver to Seattle, and then taking Alaskan Airlines from Seattle to Los Angeles the next day (as Air Canada had offered us shortly after the United Airlines fiasco). I tried to follow this issue up with Air Canada's customer relations department, but unfortunately they failed on multiple occasions to even recognize my concerns adequately (for example, the reply about my concern with not being allowed to board the United Airlines due to lost baggage was to state that the ""aim [of Star Alliance] was to build an airline alliance which would improve the travel experience of customers.""

Before takeoff she ordered passengers to close their overhead compartment (isn't this her responsibility?). At one point, there was a lady with a crying baby. This flight attendant told her to put her two large bags up in the compartment in a rude and apathetic manner. The lady was too short to do so, and she was alone, so she had to get a tall passenger next to her to do it for her. On another occasion, she came over and reached over to turn off my reading light without any warning, which I was using to do my knitting. As she reached over, she spilt water on my boyfriend's leg, she apologised and said ""give it 2 minutes and it'll dry."" The two male flight attendants were also rude - when handing out inflight meals, they would stare in silence when passengers were trying to decide what meal to pick and when collecting trays they would just hold out their hands, expecting passengers to hand over your tray as well as other passengers if they were sleeping. On the ground, before take off I politely asked an Air Canada staff member if my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other since our seats were one in front of the other. He seemed overly confident that it was possible and told me he would call my name out. I waited until the last minute, after people started boarding, for him to call my name to find out that he found an aisle seat 9 rows away with no change to the other middle seat we initially had. I understand an aisle seat is great when traveling alone, but this was the opposite of what we wanted - we were now 9 rows away. I told him that that's not what we want, and immediately he snapped, took back the flight ticket, and said, ""if you're not going to appreciate this change I'm giving you back your old seats.""

The only observation I had is that the flight was only approx 65% full yet all the seats in the back 10 rows remained empty.

The Air Canada clerk told us to retain the receipt for the purchase of the ferry tickets and then claim the cost from Air Canada. I have tried to do this and Air Canada tell me that we were not authorised to take the ferry so therefore they will not refund the cost. I assume that as Air Canada sent us to the ferry terminal which is obviously by the water, we were supposed to swim to Victoria. All in all, the customer service, or lack thereof, from Air Canada leaves much to be desired. I guess they just think that I will give up and go away. After all I am only trying to claim a lousy 34 CAD. I did try to claim for the four hour delay in reaching my final destination, but we can forget that too. Well, guess what Air Canada?

The seat was not remarkable, except that it has a wider seat pitch and a bit more recline and a footrest. The plane was a Boeing 777, which had 458 seats, and it took a very long time to board the aircraft because there were so many passengers. The crew were doing their job, not particularly friendly or offering service that deserves any mention. On flight was offered drinks twice.

However, having said that the pricing and quality of the items cannot be faulted. I prepaid for a meal and snack voucher for $7 Canadian. For that I choose a Swiss cheese / crackers package which had a very generous offering of cheese with it, and a delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye with pickles. It would have cost more than that just about anywhere else. Buying it in advance is quite a saving over the listed prices and the flight crew knew I had done so and offered up choices in advance before things ran out.

If it was a bad thing, I couldn't sit beside my wife who I was also on this trip, so I sat behind her on the right side of the plane. To sit kinda beside is taking an isle seat but it's no window seat, plus because the pods are positioned in the pod style, being comfortable in your chair would be hard to chit chat to your traveling partner, so it's down to preference.

I am 6ft 2 and did not find it cramped and sleeping was no problem. I did read reviews in advanced that sitting in the last back seat of each section of Business, provides a bit more storage space, and it was true.

For over 10 years I have been flying steadily with Air Canada/Aeroplan mostly internationally but domestic as well. I know what AC used to be and what it is today and it is sad that to increase their bottom line they have selected to emulate other reward programs (to the point where their loyalty program is negligible) and service programs (where we are paying more per seat yet getting less in flight services including luggage options).

We are frequent fliers and I've never had this issue with an airline before. I was repeatedly hit with the trolleys as the cabin crew made their way up and down the aisles and also by other customers. The issue appears to have been caused by the introduction of an additional seat, so on the 787 the configuration of seating is 3-3-3 in economy. I spoke to the cabin crew about it, as I was unhappy at not being able to get any rest, and on a few occasions when I was holding our baby, his head was also knocked.

Following this, we have turned up to Toronto airport this morning to find out that our flight from Toronto to Barbados has been delayed by 6 hours. An offering of a $20 food voucher is simply not enough in this situation, monetary compensation would have been appreciated far more. They have a large customer service desk with 5 staff members answering questions, however all they have been asked to do is to tell customers to phone a number or send them an email. They seem unable to take any immediate action. It is now 4.5 hours until our flight leaves, I am not hopeful for our journey home.

If you are a Business class passenger you will not be disappointed in this Boeing 787 seat Pod. This is my first Air Canada flight on this new route and I chose to use the last of my upgrade credits and $500 to get a Business seat, I was very glad I did this. I was pleasantly surprised when I got on the flight and it was a new aircraft, usually AC focus's on the Asia Market but maybe they decided that Canada's largest expat community of Dubai might switch back to them vise using the high class and direct flight competitors. Who knows, I was very happy in a luxury pod with very comfortable massage seats and a fantastic Entertainment system. The large screens were amazing but I knocked back a point on the score for the endless commercials you have to go thru with every movie or TV program selected - I normally fast forward, read a book or go to the toilet during this time. Meanwhile in Economy the seats looked nice in Premium Economy but Economy looked a little cramped (Boeing likes to add another seat per row over Airbus so seat width is automatically smaller no matter what configuration is flown). One of the strangest things is that for a flight this long (12+ hrs) that a complimentary toiletry flight pack is not given to economy like the old days - very sad that North American Airlines set the bar lower than Europe and Asia Airline companies. Air Canada advertised the wifi but I did not use it at all, too busy sleeping or watching my big screen TV.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular.

When I first started taking this route (from St. John's to Halifax) they were flying an E90. Which was a lovely plane, lots of luggage space, overhead compartments and space. Since then they have put on a CRA which admittedly was a step down, not to mention a little older - but we made due because it still offered in cabin entertainment and was able to get to and from Halifax in a reasonable period of time. Today, I have been told that in the 2 weeks since my last flight they have downgraded to a Q400 turboprop plane. This plane unlike the last two has nothing, small cabin, small space, no in cabin entertainment and to add more discomfort it will take an additional half hour to make it to its destination. flights to and from Halifax are consistently full, so clearly this is not a space issue.

The 788 seats were quite narrow and hard and overall, passable in terms of comfort. The plane's interior looked ""tired"". Food was served fast but was not properly heated as our water and salad were frozen and not consumable. IFE was decent but did not like the fact that the remote was very small and could not be extended, thank goodness it was also touch screen though. Only plus for AC for NRT-YVR was the ground staff and cabin crew who were all helpful and friendly.

Economy was full with 3-4-3 configuration and Premium Economy was almost empty - people from economy moving to PE (Economy Plus) seating there, the curtain open between economy and Premium economy. Now they have more Business Class seats with the bathroom in the back in economy for Economy and Economy Plus passengers. Never again Air Canada or Air China who have downgraded to a cheap product and charging the same of others whom are offering a much better product.

I am an Air Canada frequent flyer and had the front row of economy class on the aisle - travelling with family instead of business for a change. Apart from having to deal with the very cramped middle seat person I was regularly bumped by the FAs and their trolley throughout the flight due to the very narrow aisles. I would rather fly on an older Boeing 777 or A330 then have to suffer this again. To cap it all off the FA gave me a cracked cup which leaked all over my lap.

On the flight back from Vancouver to London it started so well but the breakfast was a major disapointment. I mean is it too much to serve a normal breakfast on a 10 hour flight? The breakfast was a small cup of yoghurt and a dry cake, packed in plastic, so not fresh in any way. And that was it. Guess most passengers walked straight to a café in Heathrow after arrival.

Although, we made it to the flight they would not allow us on because our bags did not make it.  We waited 2 hours from 11pm to 1am to get our hotel voucher, and had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. We were not allowed to get our bags. Our hotel was for one night with an 11am checkout, so from 11am to 11pm we had to wait at the airport. We get to our final destination, and one of our bags actually did make it on the original flight so had been waiting for us there, but the other somehow didn't make it on either. We then waited 48 hours to get our second bag delivered to us. So, we were without much of luggage for 72 hours (great way to start a trip in dirty clothes). It was strange how we flew to Dublin on a plane that didn't have any of our baggage on it when the day before we were told the that we weren't allowed to board because our bags wouldn't be travelling with us. Flight back from Dublin via Newark. We had a 3 hour layover which turned into 4.5 hours due to a delay. Then the captain advised that due to a navigation system failure on the plan it will be delayed another 2 hours. Two hours later the captain comes back and says the flight is cancelled. Customer service agents tell us it was cancelled due to weather so no vouchers (weird how the captain had just told us otherwise). We know we missed our connecting flight so asked for hotel (it was 6pm). They make us wait until 11pm to fly Toronto, then, I wait there until 2am to get hotel voucher. We had been traveling since 1am EST. Get back to final destination, and our bags were still in Newark. Again, very odd how they let us on the plane without our bags.

We paid full price in January, we picked seats, checked in, etc. No idea why he was bumped. We go to gate to try to get him on the flight. My father is stressed, my boys needed to assist him, handle luggage, get the 3 of them home, keep him calm, etc. The reps at the gate were unhelpful, callous, rude.  We were vacating seats for the medical emergency, there were clearly seats available, it was a no brainer. Apparantly Air Canada staff can do nothing but look at the computer screen. It took me 2.5 hours at the airport to find someone high enough up the food chain from Air Canada to get my son on the flight and he was put on at the last minute. I should've been with my mother at the hospital but had to deal with this problem that shouldn't have been a problem at all. Also had trouble getting bags off the flight (they pulled the wrong bags twice). They rescheduled us to fly the next afternoon, then bumped my mother to a later flight and notified via email.

However, something must have rung the bell in Italy, because the next day a very friendly Italian staff called me from Rome and informed me that I would get free accommodation. The flights from Rome to Toronto and back were very pleasant, with good premium economy seats, good service and good food. Entertainment also had been satisfactory on a big screen (the movie selection could be improved). The only terrible experience, outside Air Canada's control, had been the USA security screening and immigration in Toronto. We had to stand 2 hours in line and, despite being ushered forward twice by friendly airport staff, boarded our plane to Charlotte as last passengers 2 minutes after official departure. Many other passengers lost their connections due to the newly introduced stricter security controls for the US. The return flights to Rome were again very pleasant without any incidents. Toronto airport is very efficient and pleasant. ",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

This is a business class with full reclining seats. They are a little narrow and rather hard. However, not bad at all. They offer flexible meals and this time this offer worked (sometimes the staff decides that it is not available and as the alternative offered is the same meal but in compact form on a tray with less dishes, we wonder why this would not be available). I enjoyed a lighter meal, when I felt like it. The staff was nicer than usual, and they make a point (this is a new thing) to come by and ask you your opinion about the flight.

No amenities provided except for the obligatory hand soap. One snack was offered up inbetween meals and even though the ""menu"" tells you that snacks are available throughout the flight, flight staff made it quite obvious that they won't get you anything. During the shorter flight from Toronto to Vancouver, the snack / meal cart was only stacked with chocolate and chips. Bad luck if you wanted something hot. Clearly these people do not have experience with the truly great airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Was recommended Air Canada by my travel agent.

Our request for 2 vegetarian meals was overlooked on this 13-hour flight. The seats were fine for us because we had a 3-person section and could lift the armrests and lean against each other. The flight would have been pretty uncomfortable next to a stranger for 13 hours because the seats are quite narrow. Also, the flight was about the driest I've ever been on - I left with a very dry mouth. When we spoke with the AC personnel about trying to get back to DC, we were told that there were no flights available to anywhere in the DC area that night, direct or through connections. After AC checked with United about a possible routing that would get us to DC at 2:48 p.m. the next day, it became apparent that the routing was not available either. At this point, we discussed other options and I was told that a 9pm flight to Philadelphia was available. We took it. It was delayed 80 minutes. During this time, I booked a car rental from PHL to drop off in the DC area. By the time we left PHL, it was 1am, and I drove to our house 2 hours away, finally arriving at 3am.

The seat in the plane was narrow. I used economy class and there were ten seats per row (3-4-3). This resulted in a really cramped environment. Reclining the seat was also useless. The tray tables were small and could only fit the tray and nothing else. Also, there was not much space for storage in the seat back pocket. Legroom was quite cramped, even though I am only 178 cm tall. Baggage handling at Toronto-Pearson was quite slow, despite the fact the gate (Terminal 1) was a short walk to immigration and baggage claim. I waited two hours for my bags to arrive, and I even saw the flight crew waiting even after I went to customs. Now, the only saving grace was the baggage allowance.

To be able to purchase access to the lounge, the ticket had to be a Flex or Latitude class ticket which it was.

Both flights were full and operated to a high standard. Good legroom and space for carry-on baggage. FAs passed through the cabin often to offer water or juice. A lot of AVOD offerings, but always preceded by commercials. The worst intrusions of commercials were at the very start of both flights, after the safety briefing, presented not only on all cabin screens but also over the public-address system and on the classical music channels, where from time to time the commercials suddenly blared at more than double the normal volume - forcing you to pull out the ear-buds immediately. Air Canada's food offerings for sale on-board are poor (mostly junk food); but Canadians know that when taking domestic flights they need to eat beforehand. A few days after the flight, an Air Canada agent telephoned to say that an e-reader had been found near my seat on the YYZ-YYJ flight and asked if it might be mine (it wasn't).

That flight boarded ok and we landed the next morning at Heathrow, and the 'adventure' began. My suitcase did not arrive. I very nearly missed my train at the mainline station I had to travel to because I had to report the missing bag to the agent, who took my details, provided me with an information sheet and file tracking number, and told me my bag was on the next flight. Couldn't seem to tell me why. After a few follow up calls without meaningful responses from the people at the number I was given to call, as well as from the courier, I also learned that the baggage department and the courier do not communicate to each other. That needs to change! Courier delivered my suitcase directly to me 3 days after my arrival. I got a bit of a runaround obtaining information on how best to proceed with submitting my receipts for reimbursement because the form wanted me to send to an address in the UK, but I reside in Canada. I was given instructions eventually and followed that with a letter plus documentation sent off to the baggage department in Dorval, Quebec. It is unacceptable to me that the airline (or whoever it was) should arbitrarily decide who's bag arrives with them and who's does not, especially when you are flying on their largest aircraft, and particularly failing to communicate this information to the passenger. I am not impressed, I am waiting for my reimbursement, and the days of me doing business with Air Canada are now seriously numbered. I understand they do this quite regularly but it is not acceptable. You leave your luggage in their hands and this is what they do? There is no explanation, no reason or excuse, and no apology could satisfy me on this one.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Took off an hour late as inbound flight late landing, nothing they could do about that, but surely they could have given out water? Food on both outbound was of such a low quality, cheap ingredients and generally poor quality meal when compared to many other large carriers. Children meals no better, deep fried 'smiley faces' and solid tomato pasta. This was a night flight, yet the full brightness cabin lights were still on at 11pm local Toronto time simply so they could finish duty free sales. This just smells of greed for profit over passenger wellbeing. Nobody could sleep and young children and babies were distressed due to this. My wife spoke to crew about this earlier, just to be told 'after duty free they will go off'. Only upon me insisting on speaking to the purser and explaining why this was such a problem did the cabin lights then get reduced to a normal night flight level The inflight entertainment had very few new releases, mainly bulked out by old films and TV shows.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

The pilot kept the passengers informed as much as he could on what was going on (we had to wait for about an hour for the takeoff clearance which was not Air Canada's fault, the boarding was completed on time), he apologized for the temperature in the cabin while we were waiting for takeoff, suggested ways to keep it cool, he made informative announcements throughout the flight, and the best landing I've experienced in years. The food was ok, we were served gelato as a snack which was great. No problems with luggage. No problems with pre-booking of seats.

We faced countless problems from the moment we started our journey to Brazil. We were scheduled to take off from Cleveland to Toronto on June 23 at 5:50pm. To then take Toronto to Sao Paulo on flight AC 0090 at 10:40pm. When I scheduled the flights, we gave ourselves plenty of time in between to go through customs and ensure that we made our flight to Brazil, as I had work meetings and an interstate flight to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday morning. The first problem we faced was our flight from Cleveland to Toronto was late arriving. There were problems with the flight or weather issues - no one really knew what was going on. We did not take off until 10pm - which didn't put us in Toronto until 11:15pm. This made us and at least 50 other people miss their international connections. Air Canada was able to put us in a hotel for that night and we were to come back the following evening for a 8pm flight to Sao Paulo, putting us in Sao Paulo now on Saturday morning at 9am. I was able to move my meeting in Rio and also called the airline to reschedule my interstate flight from Sao Paulo to Rio. We got to the airport Friday evening for our flight that is meant to take off at 8pm. We are supposed to be boarding at 7pm and there is still no plane. We were then told that the plane won't take off until 11pm and after more time told it won't take off until 9am the next morning. This now creates problems for my business meeting in Rio. After working with Air Canada customer service (who were not polite) they were able to change our flights to Rio instead of Sao Paulo so we could make our work meeting. By this time it was already 3am and if we had gone to the hotel we would have to turn around and leave 2 hours later to come back - so my husband and I slept at the airport. This was exetremely uncomfortable and we had an awful night of sleep. We finally got on the plane on Saturday morning at 9am (supposed to take off at 9:15 so we were late again) and we sat on the plane for 40 minutes with no movement. They finally announced over the speaker that there is a passenger on the plane who shouldn't be - and security was there to remove him. After an hour and a half of being stuck on the tarmac we were finally left for Brazil. We were supposed to leave on Thursday evening and weren't taking off until Saturday morning.",Business,1.0,1.0

Once airborne, the FA's came around and read out the menu to each passenger as they did not have any printed versions. I could not help but feel sorry for the FA who had to repeat the same script 23 times. The food was mediocre at best with quality well below a business class offering. The drinks selection however was decent. The IFE had a reasonable selection of new releases but the music selection remains obscure and totally irrelevant. I would like to know who actually appriciates AC's music selection. The service director did an admirable job interacting with passengers which gave the journey a personal touch. The seat was the usual pod style and less than comfortable in the flat position. The toilets looked grimy and in need of a thorough scrub.

The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in ""Premium Economy"", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight. We arrived into SYD in the morning, feeling fairly fresh and rested from our flight. Overall, all 4 flights with Air Canada were very good.

Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,1.0,July 2017,2.0,4.0,3.0,no,Tokyo to Toronto,2.0," |  I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them ""brushing"" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need ""Go to town"" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline.

A319,Business Class,1.0,July 2017,2.0,1.0,3.0,no,La Gaurdia to Toronto,3.0," | I recently flew Air Canada business class from NYC LGA to Toronto YYZ. Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a ""snack"" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in ""so quickly"" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would ""catch up"" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared. If she hadn't walked into that room, I would've sat there waiting for my name to pop up on some screen and wasted more time!

The flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver was on a newer A330. Each seat had its own personal entertainment system, and meal service included dinner and light snacks. The flight to Taipei did not depart until the next morning so I spent the night at a hotel close to Vancouver Airport (Pacific Gateway which also has a free shuttle between the airport and hotel). The flight from Vancouver to Taipei was on a Boeing 787, seat configuration was 3-3-3. Sat in economy. Unfortunately the room between my seat and the row ahead was very limited. I'm 5 foot 10 inches (about 170 cm) and even without the seat in front of me not reclining, my knees was making contact with the seat back pocket and it contents. Needless to say this made for a very uncomfortable 12 hour flight. The cabin could've used a deep cleaning as I was siting by the window and noticed all the dust bunnies clumped up on the side vents above me. The cabin staff were professional and could not be faulted. On the return flight I paid extra to sit in the bulkhead section (Approximately $60 Canadian). This made all the difference in terms of seat comfort. The cabin staff were also professional. All cabin announcements were made in 3 languages: English, French, and Chinese-Mandarin. At Vancouver Airport, all US bound passengers go through US customs and immigration checks inside Vancouver Airport--so when the flight arrives stateside, I was able to pick up my luggage in domestic arrivals which was a plus. The final leg from Vancouver to Los Angeles was operated by United.

Upon check-in, the lady at the counter informed me the flight was departing on time as scheduled. Thirty minutes later, the first first delay alerts started to come in. Initially, it was a three hour delay, that became 5hr 15min, eventually it settled at a delay of 4hr and 45 minutes. There was no explanation at all given as to the delay, just told to sit and wait. Time went by, and at around 11pm, the airline's lounge started to broadcast that they were closing. With this flight and several other flights of Air Canada delayed by several hours (one delayed by 6 hours), you would think the airline had the courtesy of keeping the lounge open longer in these exceptional circumstances to accommodate the premium passengers and frequent fliers. Finally, it was time to board, and the boarding area was already full of passengers impatient to board the long-delayed flight. Suddenly, the ground staff came on the intercom and announced that the flight would be ""delayed"" until late afternoon of the next day, a ""delay"" of 21hrs. People were obviously very upset and there was chaos. The ground staff tried their best to calm nerves and frustrations, but the worst was the lack of news, lack of updates and lack of announcements what passengers were entitled to during the flight waiting period. As for the cancellation, they announced that they are not in a position to book hotels for people (not even to offer discount vouchers), so hundreds of people had to go off on their own at 1am!

My partner and I were returning from a trip from Asia, a 15 hour flight. We were to get a connecting flight in EWR with Air Canada and return to YYZ at 6pm. We made it to EWR with plenty of time to spare and as we were in line to check our baggage, we get a notification that the flight had been cancelled with no further information. There was an AC employee in the area and we asked her about the cancelled flight, she mentioned in passing that the flight got cancelled all the time but we needed to stand in the assistance line to figure out what to do next. We got in line and there was only one rep dealing with an entire cancelled flight. One would think that if a flight gets cancelled, the company would bring on more staff. So, after waiting in line for nearly 2 hours, mind you there were only 4 or 5 people ahead of us, we finally got to the rep, who was incredibly dismissive and borderline rude to us. We were told that because of weather, the flight was cancelled, no other information other than that. I can accept weather can cancel a flight but based on our experiences and the information I found, I suspect we were being lied to. I asked if there was any other information and all I got was a blunt 'No'. All they could do would be to put us on standby for a flight at 9.35pm and we would have no idea if we could get on that or not. If that failed, the next flight we could be on was 8.35am the next day. When I asked if there were any other airlines that AC could put us on, a blunt 'No'. When I asked if AC would put us up in a hotel, another blunt 'No'. When asked if there was any compensation, he blurted out 'nope' in almost a happy way. Absolutely horrible customer service. My partner has priority pass, so we thought we could wait in the AC lounge. We showed up at the lounge, tried to get in, the rep there informed us in a way that he almost seemed to take pleasure from, that the lounge was only open to priority pass members until 3pm. The next flight, ended up getting delayed, we asked the rep at the counter a couple times if there was any status on the standby list, the last time we asked, which was close to 11pm, they told us they would tell us in two minutes, 30 seconds later they called out at list of names, didn't explain what it was and left us completely in the dark. It turns out that everybody that was on standby, except for us got a seat on the plan. When I went up to ask what was going on, they told me that the plane was full, maybe, just maybe if we waited a little while longer, we might be able to get on. It turns out there was another couple waiting on standby that had already been bumped 4 times before us that day. We waited until probably around 11.30pm. The rep found that two people hadn't checked in so we did have seats! He rushed us on board and we got into the first two seats that were available, they happened to be in business class. They seemed a bit confused at first and then realised that the tickets were for seats in economy, the first rep told us not to worry about it but then this horribly unfriendly flight attendant came up to us and told us that we we would have to move. We said okay, grabbed our belongings quickly and started to look for our seats, at this time the flight attendant yells out at us 'just take your seat, we'll sort it out in the air' - well that's great, she is the one that forced us to move, meanwhile embarrassing us in front of everybody in the plane.

I flew in at 1:00 am, slept in the airport, then tried to check my luggage so I could eat and move through TSA. Went through three different people telling where to go after looking at my ticket. The ticket line was crazy but they were pulling people who had flights closer than the people around them. I was asked about six times when my flight was and waited in line for about an hour and thirty minutes. I am okay with people being pulled to pass me if they were going to miss my flight. I make it to the counter and the lady I spoke to looked at me and made a loud ""annoyed"" sound and asked, ""why are you here."" Explained everything and was cut off with her moving her arms rushing me away. When I asked why several people would have sent me through the line if it was too early to check my bags, she informed me she did not know, she was not them. I am okay with not being able to check my bags, I am okay with waiting in line, I am not okay with the ticket lady.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

On my way to the Bahamas, I was quite pleased with the service on board. My family and I were flying Business class. Our luggage came very fast! Our flight back to Montreal from the Bahamas with a connection in Toronto was a disaster. First of all, the flight was late with no explanations, then when we got to Toronto, we almost missed the flight to Montréal. When we finally got to Montréal (at almost 3 am), we waited for about 30-45 minutes with no luggage! Half the people on the plane didn't have their belonging! There was a sea of unclaimed luggage! We submitted papers and got home at 4h30 am, we got 3 of 4 bags the next day, it took a week for them to find my luggage with no compensation.

Once I got to Vancouver I went to Air Canada Customer Service and was told by their less than caring agent that they will not provide me with a hotel and that I could find a pillow and blanket at baggage claim. Got down to baggage and asked for a pillow and blanket and they were once again rude and said they don't provide that. ",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,August 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Montreal to Vancover,1.0," | I generally write reviews when I feel like there is a reason to commend or perhaps criticize an airline. Today I regretfully flew with Air Canada again from Vancouver to Montreal. We arrived 90 min prior to our domestic flight. The lines were especially long, and most kiosks for check in were busy. I went ahead to check us in and unsuccessfully an error receipt came out. I was forced to go into the check in line which had a wait time of 35 min. We got to the front of the line and found out that the flight was over booked and they wanted to put us on the next flight out. I was livid - how could they overbook the flight that we paid for? The Air Canada representative also had the audacity to mention that we were running late. After I firmly mentioned that I cannot get on the next flight, they magically found two seats right by one another. A miracle really. On my way from Montreal to Vancouver, I also did not have a pleasant experience. I had one carry on luggage. The front desk staff at the gate came specifically to me and asked to check it in for no charge because they had a full flight, and not enough space for the carry on luggage. I had some personal belongings that I wanted to carry on board, and in addition, I wanted to forego waiting for the checked in baggage to arrive in Vancouver. She relentlessly asked that I check it in, giving me no option even though many others had carry on bags of the same size that were not being checked in. I felt bullied into checking it in. The whole experience prior to take off each time was below average and I will not fly Air Canada again.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Excellent crew - really funny, engaging and gave me a double with a smile. Excellent landing, good PAs from the flight deck and an on time arrival at the gate in Montreal. Return was different in the sense that the crew were just about friendly and no announcements from the flight deck throughout. Confused service as the Purser initially tried charging for drinks - know your service and product! Full flight again and an on time departure but unusually bad landing into Toronto City. Toronto City to Montreal with AC Regional remains my favourite service within Canada.

Flight from Bogota was delayed by 3 hours which meant I missed my connecting flight from Toronto to London. Landed in Toronto at 12am and was given a new flight 24 hours later. This wasn't good enough as i had to get another flight in England, so I went to customer service and was told I would most likely get on the 9am flight as a standby passenger. Turned up at the airport at 5am after 2 hours sleep and checked in, when I got to the gate for boarding the flight was apparently full. Went back to customer service and they told me the next available flight was the one they had given me in the first place. I went online to the Air Canada website and searched earlier flights and there was one 5 hours earlier that they were still selling tickets for. I queried this with customer services advisor and he said it was overbooked by 16 seats, yet they were still selling tickets for $5000 online? He told me that I could book a ticket online if I wanted to pay that much but he couldn't put me on that flight. It's ok though because they gave me a $15 meal voucher to apologise for my 15 hour wait in the airport. What an absolute joke.

We were then given 15$ food vouchers and standby tickets for the next flight (an hour later). That flight was full and the next flight was at 22.30. A delay of around 7 hours since our original was to leave at 4.15. We asked Air Canada representatives for compensation and they gave us a measly 10$ food voucher which isn't even enough for a sandwich at this airport. When 22.30 finally arrived we were stuffed in economy class on a full flight and upon arrival were informed that our baggage was not to arrive until 8.30 the next day! So we left the airport 7 hours late with no baggage. And for having missed the birth of our cousin we get 25$ in food vouchers.

After doing the long line to pay the extra 3 kilos, they told my husband he could have put the 3kg in my luggage, solution that was not given to us in that moment. We went back and my husband told the guy he could be nicer and also could have told us about the 3 kilos change of luggage, I was going to speak and he said ok if you continue complaining I cancel your flight and call the police.

While coming back to Canada I had my parents with me and because of their old age and my father's nerve problem in his feet, I asked for a wheelchair facility for both. They failed to provide wheelchairs both in Delhi and in Toronto. I filed a complain and after that they gave me a CAD 400 discount on my next booking. So, I booked flights for three of us to go to Toronto (return ticket). Don't take me wrong. Air Canada on international routes is pretty good. The crew are helpful and food is good. Good entertainment options! Legroom is small but its economy! However, their domestic route flights are the worst I have seen. No food or drinks offered on long haul flights (Saskatoon-Toronto takes 3.5 hours). Legroom small. Sometimes no entertainment system (Saskatoon-Vancouver/Calgary routes).

Submit it and they tell me it is not covered because the flight was cancelled due to weather. I understand it is not covered because it says it on their site but why would they not tell me this before I went to the hotel? Now I am out the $180 for the hotel and $200 on the flight that could have cancelled and got a rental car that would have costed me $60 instead because that customer service rep and the airport didn't tell me why it was cancelled.,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

The last row of our 2 seats did not recline very much at all. Not all seats in this cabin are created equal. Air Canada did not tell us this about this configuration. Our overnight flight was one of the worst we encountered. The 2 seats in front reclined right to our chests. The people in front were reclined and legs were fully stretched and they slept the whole flight We struggled with the reclined seats at our chest and struggled to get comfortable, I had difficulty getting in and out. I am a fairly fit person who had to throw my legs over the arm rest to stand up due to the seat in front reclined into my chest. Our legs were cramped. I traded seats with my daughter a few times. She was in the economy bulkhead seat right behind us. It had more space overall than our $400 seat. We were definitely ripped off by Air Canada. They should refund us the money.

This saves so much time when one may have only a minimal amount of time to make a connecting flight, especially given regular delays! It is so much better, and truly customer-centred.

There are not always reasons given, but the result is always the same. Not only has this negatively impacted my business, it has also affected the impression that others have of me. Lateness has become an acceptable trend with this airline. Flights later in the afternoon and evening have no chance of being on time due to delays earlier in the day.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Charlotte to Gander via Toronto,1.0," |  Charlotte to Gander via Toronto. I am one of 6 in our group that have the same complaints. In Charlotte, Air Canada charged us an antler/horn fee of $150 instead of a $50 firearms fee when we checked our guns for a Moose hunting trip to Newfoundland. They tried to tell us since we had rifles that we had to pay an antler/horn fee because they were hunting equipment and they no longer fall in the firearm category. We even got a TSA agent to try help us talk sense into the girls at the bag check but they wouldn't listen. Then we were told our luggage would go direct to Gander but we had to check guns in Toronto thru customs. Every person that we talked to employed by Air Canada gave us a different story concerning our guns and our luggage. In Toronto instead of bringing the guns out to us for an ID check we found them in the baggage claim area that anyone could have picked them up. Then in Toronto customs we saw all our luggage stacked in the corner that we were told would go straight to Gander. Also Toronto customs only had 2 people working the 15 check stations and 40 people were lined up for connecting flights and we barely made ours. We checked our luggage and guns again but when we got to Gander all 9 bags including our guns were lost. We missed a full day of a $4300 hunt waiting on luggage and guns. They didn't make it to the airport until the next evening. Then on the return trip home to Charlotte we were charged the correct firearm fee but we watched a girl throw our gun case on the carousel in Charlotte. Hard enough it hit and bounced almost off and another passenger caught it and placed it back on the carousel. These are very expensive guns and scopes. Also she did not bring the guns to us and check our ID to release them to us as she was supposed to. Anyone could have taken them again. We tried to file a complaint at the airport and talked to her supervisor and he said he would reprimand her as that was uncalled for but that we would have to file an online complaint. Also a brand new luggage bag came back with the handle ripped off. And the flight from Toronto to Charlotte had a problem with the fan that pressurizes the cabin so it was so hot on the plane you couldn't breath. It did get better as we flew but the pilot had to fly at a low altitude according to the flight attendants because of the cabin pressure issue. With the treatment we received from start to finish I wonder how an airlines could exist like this. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network. The flight was fine with the usual beverage service and an on time arrival in Toronto. In the race for maximising profit and cheesing off customers - Air Canada wins first prize. We were 5 mins late for bags - sure. But the officiousness of the check in supervisor and the stinging us financially shows just how little Air Canada cares about good and honest customer service / experience.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

I feel the need to leave a comment here in regards to the disorganization that Air Canada has in regards to baggage. I was delayed and missed our connecting flight home due to customs. I had asked every attendant or working persons that we had dealings with about whether I needed to get my luggage and everyone stressed due not worry about it. And like many would be, I was. I work hard for a living to have nice things, some of those of which I had brought on our trip.  There is no system in place and the bag never made it back home. I have been calling into what seems to be a secondary bag check line with zero information as to where it is. I am being told it is still in tracking mode.

I am so disappointed in the treatment I received during boarding at the beginning of my vacation today. It really put a sour start to my vacation. There was no room for my carry on luggage because people had bags and coats overhead. I was forced to check my carry on and I had to transfer my things such as medical items and other expensive things into a garbage bag that I had to ask for instead of being offered. During this, the flight attendants threatened to put us on later flight! Never even said sorry! I strongly believe they could have improved the situation by simply checking the overhead storage for small bags and coats and asking others to put it under their seats. They also could have been a little patient. I am currently dragging heavy garbage bags around the airport. They definitely could work on their manners and attitude.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I have flown this route many times via London but this time Air Canada only gave the option to transit in Frankfurt. Originally I had a good two-hour and a half transit time in Frankfurt but because the Lufthansa plane got delayed in Amsterdam the transit time got less and so I had to kinda rush to get to the gate. Going back to my flight experience, it didn't differ much from my previous ones. Everything was just okay except the food which is always below standards. The Boeing 767-300ER is an excellent plane, however it does feel a bit like it has done its time and I wonder when Air Canada will replace it with the 787 on the Ottawa-Europe routes.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

As I reached the airport, the Air Canada queue was so long, almost 200m or longer. Only 3-4 counters were open and service was so poor. Counter staff were so slow and busy chatting. I cannot understand simple logic why can't Air Canada open more counters. Due to this delay, I almost missed my flight since the US immigration further delayed the entire process. As I reached Philadelphia, my luggage did not arrive on time and Air Canada did not have the courtesy to inform me what is happening. What is so difficult in tracing the luggage?

nan,Economy Class,4.0,November 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver,4.0," |  Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver. What an atrocious check-in experience traveling to the US. Stay away unless you're on a visa waiver, visa, permanent resident or US citizen. The check-in supervisors have zero idea how to deal with anything else and are a combination of poorly trained, arrogant, aggressive and power tripping. Two supervisors were involved and they were both the same. They don't know that other forms of US travel authority exist (a US Advance Parole combo card in this case). They had no idea how to type the Advance Parole combo card into their computer, so just wildly guessed, with one attempt before giving up. The computer then said I wasn't cleared to fly, because they'd typed in garbage data, which they insisted was what was going to happen ""because we don't have the authority to override the system"". Instead of just saying ""I'm not sure how to process this card, let me call someone who can help me"" their *first* opening approach is to say ""we have to offload you because you don't have a visa or permanent resident card and that's what our systems require"". No attempt to solve the problem and understand. Utter aggressive refusal to let me explain what an Advance Parole card is and that I am indeed allowed to fly to the US, you just have to call someone who knows what this card is. Literally I was trying to show them my phone and get them to read a paragraph from a US government website explaining what an Advance Parole combo card was and that it grants travel authority. They refused to read it - ""I don't care what that says because we have to do what the computer says and it says to offload you"". No matter that the computer only said that because they didn't know how to type this card in! Finally they call US immigration, after about 20 minutes of telling me they are going to offload me and aggression. They keep calling the combo card an ""Employment Authorization Document"". It has that in big print along the top, and the Advance Parole part in little print along the bottom. I keep trying to explain that it's a 2-in-1 combo card and to read the sentence on the bottom when talking to US immigration. ""We know what to say"". US Immigration answers, they refuse to read the bottom of the card, calling it an Employment Authorization Document and looking at me smugly. After many minutes on the phone the person on the other end finally asks them what is on the bottom of the card and they read it out with a grimace. About 30 minutes in after countless threats of offloading and one threat of calling airport police ""because we don't like you"" I am cleared to fly. They don't say a word to me, refuse to look at me. Just pass my passport to a check-in counter worker and say ""he's cleared to fly"". The in-flight experience was great, a near new Boeing 787. It was all destroyed by those power tripping poorly trained check-in supervisors who shouldn't be anywhere near a customer facing role.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I left Vancouver Oct. 3rd. My bag never showed up in Baltimore. I immediately placed a baggage claim report with an Air Canada representative at the airport (which took over an hour as their were no representatives at the kiosk and no one picked up when I called repeatedly; I had to call the 1-800 customer service hotline to get them to contact a representative at the airport). I was told they'd send my bag through to my hotel where I was staying for work for a week. My bag never turned up; I called and emailed multiple times daily to no avail. I had to purchase all new work clothing, shoes, toiletries etc. It is now more than a month later and I have home in Vancouver. Since then I've travelled on several flights for work and have several more this year. I still do not have an answer from air Canada. It has been like pulling teeth trying to get ahold of anyone that could help. My baggage number is still under ""locating"" and I have filed claims for ""delayed"" baggage as you cannot file ""lost"" status until they tell you it cannot be found. I filled my ""delayed"" claims the day I arrived home to Vancouver Oct 10th. I have made numerous calls, Facebook posts, instagram posts, twitter posts, and emails to customer service, baggage claims, and whoever else I could find to contact. And I still have ZERO answers on where my bag is, if it will be found, if I will be reimbursed. Or if I will even be reimbursed for the $50 I paid to check the luggage (the money I paid to have someone lose my bag). I have been clear that I understand mistakes happen and it is not the loss of property that has me truly disgruntled (although this is a nightmare when on a business trip).

There was about a 3-hour delay in our first flight segment from Ottawa to Toronto, and unfortunately, they could not manage to put some passengers on the two other flights departing in the period of delay. Therefore since our connection time at Toronto airport was 2 hours, we missed our flight from Toronto to Amsterdam and we were offered an alternate route to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. The staff at the airport were rude  in providing a concrete solution and were very reluctant to respond us. The customer service is all about their priority rather than customers' problems. During the first part of the flight, the service and food were terrible.  We only had one option and that was a vegetarian meal, when I politely asked for another option, the crew rudely emphasized that that is all we have.

My complaint is the manner in which Air Canada has increased the price of their fares by offering reduced seat fares through travel web sites (e.g. Expedia) only to underhandedly force the purchaser to pay for selecting a seat either before or during check-in and paying for every piece of luggage. This practice is deceiving and dishonest. I have come to appreciate airlines who are forthright in their pricing practices through travel web sites and have flown many that are completely above board. It is unfortunate that we are serviced by so few airlines in Canada that this type of price gouging is allowed to continue.

The AC desk at the Portland airport has selective hours and no one there until 2 hours before the first flight out. So we had to wait 1.5 hours for staff to change the flight. The girl arrived and we were first in line (with a huge line up behind us). Staff said we booked it with a third party so we have to go through them to change anything.

When Alaska has only delayed 10% at most during my 6 years going the same route. I really want Air Canada management to take a hard look at why they cannot be on time more often on the same route that Alaska does.

Online check-in easy and quick with very easy printing of boarding passes and luggage tags at the airport kiosks. Ground staff professional. The zone boarding process can be confusing as, even though specific zones are called, passengers from other zones tend to get into line prior to being called. Ground staff don't seem to manage this boarding process well and this is not the first trip where I've encountered this issue. Planes were clean and well kept. Onboard staff were professional and efficient. Meals were tasty, which was a vast improvement over my last international trip with AC. Vancouver - London Heathrow included 1 hot meal and a very small breakfast - a slice of gingerbread and a small yogurt. This is not sufficient for a flight almost 10 hours long. London Heathrow - Vancouver included a hot meal, mid flight snack and then a hot fajita about 1.5 hours prior to landing. Frequent drink runs both flights. Overall, onboard service was efficient and well done, but not outstanding. Seats are reasonable but not overly comfortable. Onboard entertainment system worked very well both flights and there was a good variety of TV, movies and music. The only negative comment would be that AC charges for advance seat selection on Tango fares, fares are high enough without adding this extra fee.

Up to this point I have refrained from commenting about United based on the negative press however after experiencing the checking I have to agree with everything that is being reported. The United personnel at Philadelphia Airport were extremely rude. I am a crew member for a cruise line and normally I ask to have my bags tagged ""priority"", that way they arrive at the final destination, other airlines usually have no problem doing this however the United person at the counter said to me ""No"". At one point during the conversation I had to ask if she was having a good day and then that sort of made her realize how nasty she was being. As far as the flight I do have to say that we were up in the air for about an hour and there’s really not much to comment other than the fact that I paid for the preferred seating and there is not much difference between that and regular seat. The space is extremely cramped as you will see in the photo I have attached. The flight attendants however were very nice, the plane was clean and the flight went on without any incident. I would definitely recommend this airline but please be aware that the check-in could be done by United and that could ruin your first impression.",Business,3.0,nan

The aircraft was beautiful and clean however I paid for extra legroom and I found myself next to an emergency door which I had no problem staying on however the seats did not have a movable armrest. I had a row of two for myself but I was not able to move the armrest because it was stationary. The seat also felt kind of narrow. I was served a hot meal, two snacks, plenty of drinks (alcohol beverages included) and a light breakfast. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment selection was mediocre with only a handful of movies and TV shows. I am a big fan of the Boeing 777 because it is spacious, relatively quiet and depending on the airline the amenities can be quite good. Overall I would definitely fly Air Canada again because they were friendly, I felt safe, and they got me to my destination on time. They still have room for improvement when it comes to the entertainment offerings, the comfort of the seat, and please do not have United personnel do your checking at the airport it ruins the first impression.",Business,3.0,nan

The lady at the Air Canada desk was extremely rude saying that they weren't re-booking tickets there even though we'd be directed to go there - she provided essentially no customer service. Another thing - some passengers are automatically re-booked onto flights and others aren't which is super inconsistent and something I expect a budget airline to do - I wonder is Air Canada a budget airline or Canada's national carrier? Because it is a total embarrassment of a carrier. Moreover, even though I was re-booked onto a flight the next day at 8pm, I was not given any accommodation vouchers or food vouchers or anything. I received nothing in compensation. I understand the flight was cancelled due to safety reasons, but Air Canada has appalling customer service and I will never fly them again.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Only at Pearson I knew that my flight is ""domestic"" and it ""stops"" at Montreal though it is ""indeed direct"" flight to Geneva. I asked if we stay on the plane during the stop and we don't - we get off the plane and later board it again. If Air Canada started to turn planes into trains maybe it should charge a train fare. And not letting people know in advance what is that they are paying for in my opinion is a fraud.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

We already had a ride set up and were meeting friends, Hotel was booked. They didn’t pick up the phone to notify us. I called and they said due to weather but they had a flight leaving from Newark.

Then I arrive in Toronto to find out my flight was cancelled and moved 5 hours later. Without notice and when I asked why the lady behind the desk responded with “weather”. I found it funny how a plane can fly from Toronto to London no problem, but to fly 15 min farther it can’t. It’s a lie. They lie to customers to fill cabins they cancel flights all the time.

I have always travelled Air Transat Club before and thought that this might be the same or better, as it was more expensive. The service was terrible. The flight attendants seem to be in First Class and Economy and the Premium Economy gets no one. We were offered water or juice when we boarded and there was no bar service after take-off. No flight attendants were seen after take-off and close to 2 hours later, the meal came. We were given a glass of wine and refills were not offered. An hour after the meal, we were finally offered a cocktail. This should have been done before the meal service. There was one other pass of the cocktail cart when they passed out a snack before landing. I paid $3,400 return for just a larger seat. No other perks were offered and the crew were not at all pleasant. I even complained to them afterwards and just got a note thanking me for my input.

While at the passport control I still have 35 minuets and the walk to the gate is on 5 minutes. The passport control did not let me through due to my luggage was loaded off and she told me not to worry, I still have time. She said just go to the helpdesk for Air Canada which was 1 minute away. When I arrived there. I discovered that Air Canada decided to change my flight to next morning and they can’t put luggage on the plane and will not let me leave to Houston without my luggage. I have tried to explain a lot and couldn’t get them to put on that flight or any other flight that could help me to achieve my goal. And funny enough, they have told me that I was paged on my arrival gate to see if I’m going on this flight or not. This is so funny, how the heck I would know that I will be called on my arrival gate, on top of that they should’ve be expecting me running to my departure gate. They have booked me the worst hotel and have told me that I have to go to this hotel without my luggage. Normally for human being, the luggage will be needed at the hotel so that shower can be taken and changing. So they basically they don’t let me go to Houston without my luggage on the flight and would let me go to hotel without it. What make it so funny is that I’m writing this review while waiting on Saturday morning for my flight which have not arrived yet, it’s been 30 minuets already.

Looking to move from Canada to Australia I was happy to see a direct flight to Brisbane from Air Canada. Value for a roundtrip fare was exceptional, we booked the base economy 'Tango' fare (Y) and we picked up the round trip flight on a seat sale which cost us just under $1,000 each. This included 2 checked bags each, which really helped us as we ended up checking one of our carryon bags as we didn't need it in the cabin with us. Once at the airport, boarding was quick and efficient by the staff on the ground. We boarded and were in the air about 12:20am, 5 minutes ahead of our scheduled takeoff. We were sat in row 31, seats J & K which were exit row seats, a pillow and blanket were provided at each seat. Once the seatbelt sign was turned off meal service and drinks started right away. Options for dinner were Chicken or Beef with vegetables and potatoes. I chose chicken which was average for airplane food (Picture attached). I then browsed the entertainment selection with a post dinner drink. The entertainment had 100's of different films and sitcom option, however none had appealed to me at the time and I was fairly tired so I ended up not watching anything. The best part of the flight was the seat comfort. After dinner I put some earplugs in and went to sleep. I ended up falling asleep for a good 6 hours at which time I woke up and tried the entertainment system again to no avail, at which point I fell back asleep for a few more hours. I did have an exit row which meant I did have extra legroom, however lots of people congregate there to use the washroom that is in the centre row. Even though I had the extra legroom I was not looking forward to the 15 our flight in the middle seat, however in the end I was pleasantly surprised. About 2 hours before landing the crew came around to serve breakfast. The choices were scrambled eggs with salsa or pancakes, I choose the eggs which were not great at all, I would have choose the sweeter option. (There was another service halfway thought the flight for a light snack, however I was asleep for that service). After breakfast the crew quickly cleaned up, I changed and freshened up in the washroom which was fairly standard and had ample space to change. This one was situated in the centre of the cabin however I was told the one up front in premium economy actually had a window in the washroom. A few minutes earlier than expected we had a smooth landing in Brisbane around 9:30 am, where I felt surprisingly fresh after the 15 flight and ready to take on the day.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The flight was scheduled from 8pm - 11pm. 7:30 PM - Upon arrival at the departure gate we were informed the plane was delayed for an unspecified period of time. 8:40 PM - We boarded 40 mins late. My family all had only carry on bags, which we quickly realized would not fit in the overhead compartments - along with a many other passengers. Our bags were taken from us to be placed under the plane, and would have to retrieved via the carousel in San Diego. It seemed odd that all the flight staff watched us board with bags they knew would not fit in the plane? The overhead compartments were broken and duct taped in several places on the plane. One gentlemen even remarked that he thought the front window of the plane was duct taped. 9:20 - Takeoff The plane seemed very old and in dire cosmetic disrepair. The flight staff were friendly. They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog. Everyone was obviously disappointed and also confused because it didn't appear foggy. Once in LA we sat in a deserted area of the airport hoping to be accepted for deplaning. Several announcements were made to try and appease our frustrations but the pilot himself seemed utterly defeated. He mentioned that he ""we shouldn't worry, because they were already assured we wouldn't have to return to Vancouver."" We were just sitting there on the tarmac waiting for something to happen. At one point there was supposed to be a bus coming to get us and staff to help accommodate our various scenarios. 1:30 AM - We were able to utilize a deplaning corridor (our plane was too small to fit against the tunnel opening, so we walked down the stairs of the plane and up into the terminal via a second set. Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options. We were also told the reason the plane didn't land in San Diego was because the in flight crew had worked 12 hours and wanted out of the air and didn't want to circle to wait to land. We checked the flight status at San Diego airport and it appeared all other flights were landing. 2:00 AM - Air Canada staffers advised those of us wishing to leave to submit car rental vouchers to Air Canada, those in need of boarding stayed back. I will try this but some other folks with previous experiences of this nature didn't seem hopeful that we would be reimbursed. I will remain hopeful. We rented a car for $100 from Avis. 4:00 AM - We arrived at Hotel in San Diego. My parents were to arrive in San Diego today to meet us on the same Air Canada flight 8 pm - 11pm. After our experience yesterday, I was very worried for them. Rightfully so, the flight was cancelled right at 8:00 PM ""no pilot"". I will never fly this airline again.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Our family decided to try out the premium economy service given that it was such a long flight plus the rather lacklustre reviews I have read about Air Canada's economy class comfort and service. As it transpired, it probably wasn't worth the additional expense. The seating was a plus (extra legroom plus a little extra width of seats) and this made the difference b/w no sleep and a little sleep. The first meal - a beef casserole - was very good, and served with metal cutlery etc. The next meal, in contrast, was very ordinary and served with plastic cutlery and I'm very forgiving about airline food generally. The biggest disappointment was the cheap and nasty headsets which meant that it was too unpleasant to watch any movies - the sound quality was that poor. These were flimsy single jack throwaway units used in a conjunction with a double jack fitting in the seat arm (and a loose fit at that). I didn't speak about this with other passengers but noticed that surprisingly few people had their screens turned on during the flight. Note too that I tried several different headsets on several different seats, and they all either failed to work at all or had the same poor sound quality. I've since raised this with Air Canada but their response suggested that this was a one-off equipment failure - it wasn't, those headphones could never provide acceptable sound quality. Appears to be more a case of penny-pinching by management. If they can't afford better then the very least they could do would be to recommend that passengers bring their own headsets.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Today it’s some kind of maintenance issue (we’ll likely be delayed 3-4hrs before takeoff is the estimate over the loudspeaker).  It’s routine for Air Canada to be delayed on this particular flight. It seems Air Canada is exceptional at apologizing for things though - I’ve heard more of the phrase “I’m sorry” on this flight than anywhere else (and I’m Canadian, so very used to hearing it regardless of context). I’m not a complainer, and a frequent flier, so understand all the things that can go wrong and have sat through most of them. I’m not sitting here fuming or anything. I have a phone / laptop and can work. It’s just something about the inconsistency of this particular flight that I’m hoping to prepare people for. ",Business,3.0,nan

The flight was fine, our problems started the second we touched down in Canada. During the flight, we were asked if our final destination was the US or Canada and given the appropriate customs form. However, on getting there, we discover that we still have to go through Canadian customs and so needed the Canadian form too. We then had to get to a waiting area for our bags to come off the Air Canada flight and go through to US customs. On the airplane and by several signs in the terminal not to pick up our bag for customs; it would go directly through. My bag took 2 hours to get to where it needed to go and my companion’s bag was lost. So, naturally, at this point we can’t get to our next flight because US customs requires your checked bag to be accounted for first. So, we missed our next flight. It’s a busy time of year so no other flights were available for two days. We go to the counter to get a hotel since it’s their fault we couldn’t continue on our trip. We’re told by one employee to go talk to another, who gives us the phone number of their help line. I spend half an hour on hold waiting to talk to them only to be told they can’t do hotel vouchers over the phone and I have to talk to someone in the terminal. We finally get our hotel, but they’ll only book it for one night because their policy is we have to try again tomorrow to get rebooked on an earlier flight. So, today, now the day after our original flight, I spend another half hour on hold trying to save them money by getting an earlier flight and not having to spend another night in a hotel only to be told that because another airline operates our final flight, they can’t do anything. So my travel companion goes to the Air Canada counter to get us approved for another night at the hotel. When she finally talks to someone, they tell her she needs to speak to the person at the ticketing counter to be told again that there are no earlier flights to Florida before they’ll approve a second hotel night. So now she’s waiting in line to talk to a ticketing agent and they only have two clerks at the desk and a line of over forty people when there are a lot of passengers displaced during this time of year all trying to get home.

First of all, our flight from Vancouver on Dec 23, 2017 was cancelled and we were never notified by Air Canada. We came to the airport and found that we need to take another flight, which was delayed and we couldn’t make connection from Toronto to Quebec on time. We had to spend 1,5 hours to find another ticket and it was just the beginning of nightmare. Our flight was Premium Economy, and the ticket was changed to economy without any refund or explanation whatsoever. I had a fracture in my spine and metal rod was installed, that was the reason for Premium class and a window seat, so that I wouldn’t suffer from pain. Instead we were seated by the toilet in economy and I had severe pain through the flight and a day after. When we finally got to Toronto our flight to Quebec got delayed and we had to wait another 2,5 hours. We got there eventually, but on the way back it was the same story. Our flight got delayed, we did not make it to our connection flight and on Dec 30, 2017 we got stuck in Montreal. Air Canada provided accommodation after an argument, but we had to take an extra flight to make it home on December 31, 2017. Thank you Air Canada for screwing up New Years for us. The seats that we booked originally were cancelled and they couldn’t find a place to accomodate a person with severe back pain. You can only imagine through what I went through in this 2 days journey. The worst experience in my life for the amount of money we paid.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The dinner was okay, however, they were out of chicken when they came to my row so I didn't have any choice. The 'breakfast' they serve was just a slice of banana bread which wasn't good. The flight attendants were really sincere and did their job well. We departed Montreal with an hour delay and I had a connection flight with just an hour of layover, so one of the flight attendants informed me that they are aware of the situation and that they would relocate me to a front row business class seat before landing.

We were then given a card with a phone number to call to book another flight and to also book a hotel at a discount. However, upon calling the phone agent, we were told that because the cancellation was not their fault, they could not provide accommodation, even at a discount. We were also told that there would not be another direct flight out until 2 days later, although upon checking the internet, we saw that there were many other direct flights for the next day, with other airlines. The phone agent then told us that that they could not book us a flight with another airline, and that we would have to go back to the airport and speak to the desk agent. All the agents gave us different information and seemed clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful! Because of this airline's stupidity, we all lost out on a day's pay and had to drive down from Toronto to Newark so that we wouldn't miss out on another day's pay. Upon arriving back home, we found out that a friend also went through a similar experience previously with this airline. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

How can one airline loose so many bags, be so late for so many departures and arrivals, offer the most disgusting on board food and employ the nastiest most incompetent staff and still be in business is a mystery to me. Air Canada's hatred of its customers is evident at every level of the company and can be seen in every single employee you come in contact with.

On my return trip the flight was again delayed 2+ hours, leading me to miss the connection flight I'd already booked. So I was put on the next flight leaving YVR at 5 pm to Seattle.

Luckily the agent booked me on a flight going to Munich via Geneva, this flight was already 3 hours delayed. They delayed that flight another 1.5 hours when arriving at the boarding gate. We again left more than 2 hours late, which then made me miss my connection in Geneva.

The crew were really sympathetic and spoke French, German and English. The legroom was standard for economy class and the selection of movies on the IFE was more than enough for a 6 hour and 49 minutes flight. But there were a few downsides, not necessarily the fault of the airline that need to be noted. We arrived 35 minutes late at Cointrin and we left the aircraft in rainshowers, but the true downside was a disruptive passenger. Before landing, the crew asked everyone to retract their seat, including in English, but the passenger didn't do it. The crew passed a last time for a verification and asked him to retract it, but when the crew were out of view he retracted it on me again just before landing.

The flight attendant said there was a vacant window seat directly in front of me 18F but since it was an emergency exit she would come back and brief me on the instructions. I moved to the seat in question, got settled in again, ear phones in, blanket etc and 20 minutes into the show I was watching the same flight attendant said I couldn’t sit in that seat because it was a preferred seat and told me I must move to another seat! I said that I did not want to move again & reminded her that she told me to take that seat. She said she made a mistake and with an unpleasant attitude rudely insisted that I move. Needless to say if the equipment was in working order I never would have moved in the first place. In order to avoid the situation escalating I did move again to the back of the plane. When the food for purchase cart finally reached me in the backn of the plane almost everything was sold out so I was also unable to purchase the fruit/cheese platter that I wanted.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

We reached Toronto and flight to Columbus was cancelled due to snowstorm. That is when it took them over 4 hours to get us to a hotel. In that time the agents acted as if they had never handled a similar situation. There was no one in charge, or not, who could tell us anything for over 2 1/2 of those hours. I was assigned next day to the very next CMH flight. I asked about my luggage and was assured it would be on that flight. It was not. I filed a claim at CMH, and later was told it was lost, so I filed another 3 days later. The flight to Toronto was on the 12th of January, and it is now February 11th. I have called the lost baggage line multiple times over this period, and no one has taken any action that led to finding my luggage. It was obvious that there was no plan on their part to try to find it, as no one at any time has been able to tell me where it is. One agent tried to track and said he thought it was put on a flight to Pittsburgh on the 13th of January, stayed there 5 days, and was sent by protocol then to Montreal. I asked them how to contact Montreal baggage center and he said that even agents can not call them in Montreal, they can only email them. He stated that he would, nothing happened. I begged another agent a few days later to do something to locate the luggage. He seemed genuine in his concern, and said he would do a thorough investigation and get back to me in 2 hours. He did not contact me again. I had many souvenirs from Hong Kong and gifts from friends as I got engaged on the visit. I feel their system is set up to only deal with the ordinary travel situations. They have given no priority at Air Canada at all to helping passengers in a situation in which they send their luggage to the wrong place. The agents on scene in Toronto, and the leased agents they had in Columbus were at times disrespectful to us. The agents who knew what they were doing or were kind operate in an airline that shows no respect in these situations, and has not once reached out to me to help in correcting the situation. The only contact has been initiated by me. I believe their policy is ""let them complain, eventually they will go away!"" In this instance they are wrong. I will seek out every way I can to give them reviews like this one until someone listens to me. ",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Flight boarded by zone number and completed promptly. On board the aircraft was filthy with crumbs, almonds and wrappers strewn across the floor. My seat had an empty water bottle left behind confirming the poor or non-existent grooming of the aircraft before flight. The seat was comfortable but the tray table was very flimsy and hard to balance anything on it. We were served a hot breakfast and offered several rounds of drinks on this 2.5 hour flight.

I had to cover my own lodging. The following day, I sought to get on standby for an earlier flight which I received a ticket for. While boarding, I was told my bag was too large and they made me check it. The moderately rude attendant told me that I could change the baggage claim if I got on an earlier flight out of Toronto. When I got to Toronto, I asked to get on standby for the 16.55 flight to Syracuse. After waiting at the unoccupied customer service counter for over 30 minutes, the attendant there said I couldn’t because I had a checked bag. That flight was already delayed to 18.30 for mechanical issues. My original flight of 20.10 then also got “mechanical issues” and was delayed to 21.45. The carelessness of Air Canada employees is upsetting and the airline’s ability to problem solve is severely lacking. The entertainment amenities on the planes is worse than most other airlines. They nickle and dime customers be charging for small packets of pretzels. Finally, if someone gets a cancelled flight while trying to fly into the US, he/she cannot request a different route or city hub to fly though unless he/she is willing to pay for another connecting flight.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,February 2018,1.0,3.0,3.0,no,Vancouver to Toronto,3.0," | We were delayed coming out of Vancouver on Feb 23 due to a snowstorm. We sat in the plane on the tarmac for 3 hrs waiting to de-ice, so a total of 8 hrs on this plane on this flight. I do not have any issues with the delay, this is weather related and out of anyone's control. However we had one drink the whole time we were on this flight and they ran out of food. So basically 8 hrs on a plane with one drink and no food. The service starts at the beginning of the plane and works it's way to the back which takes a long time for those sitting at back of plane. As well I had to ask for my drink 3 times after I paid for it, and each time they asked me what I had ordered. Once we connected to the ramp in Toronto it was another 50 minutes to de-board the plane and another 35 minutes to get luggage, as 4 flights were all on one baggage carriage to come through. Overall I found the service terrible, the snack I was able to get also was terrible and did not find a friendly experience overall with any of the staff. My coworker who also was on the plane rang for service several times no one ever came. I have travelled with Air Canada several times and for one reason or another there always seems to be an issue. I decided to write a review this time as I am definitely going to consider other airlines first before I have no choice but to fly with Air Canada. I think this airline needs to remember that ""ecomony"" calls is what supports the majority of the clients that fly with them and need to ensure those passengers are looked after as well as others.",Business,3.0,2.0

Boeing 777-200LR,Premium Economy,4.0,February 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,no,Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver,2.0," |  Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver in Premium Economy. In deciding which airline to take, we put weight on using AC on a direct flight with my partner having 50k Elite. The flaw in this was assuming 50k elite meant something and that a direct flight with one stop was fool proof. After booking the flight, we found we could only select seats available for both legs. So with no twins in a 2-4-2 formation available for both legs, we were forced to select an aisle and middle seat. (though different twins were available on either leg). Call centre and ground staff were unable to allocate different twins available for each leg as it's one flight / boarding card. We bid online for a cash upgrade and initially had money taken from our credit card only to have it returned to our account within hours. A request at the gate in Toronto for a seat change on either leg was answered with ""ask in Vancouver"". An on time departure but a poor meal service. Neither my partner or I got our choice of meal. A very average stew of veal was provided followed by drinks. On spotting an IPA ale on the cart appearing from club, I was told the IPA was a premium beer and not available in PPremium Economy. The service just feels ill thought out with a meal before a drink! At Vancouver, we were told we couldn't swap seats as we should have asked in Toronto! My partner was initially upgraded for free to biz as Premium Economy and Economy were over-sold which was then withdrawn when a connecting flight ran late and all classes suddenly available. Another average ""slop meal"" followed by drinks followed served by a very capable and very senior crew. After this alleged enhanced meal, service morphed into Economy with standard mid flight sandwich and an inedible breakfast. A late arrival was followed by late bags. The day before our return we were informed of a four hour delay. On arriving at the airport we checked in fine, and my partner invited to the Air NZ lounge as a star alliance gold member. (no invite for me as it's it's another airline's lounge) Despite the 4 hour delay the base manager wouldn't budge and bizarrely - no vouchers for food were issued despite an 4 hour+ delay. On boarding, we found out the original crew ran out of hours in Vancouver and it operated 12 hours late to Sydney with a spare crew who needed minimum rest. In terms of upgrades (again), we bid the max for an online upgrade and still didn't' get it. An ok meal served with drinks again served after. On arrival in Vancouver 5 hours late, we found the second leg had left on time with another aircraft and we had been bumped to other flights. (no announcements before arrival into Vancouver) At the gate, we were given PE seats and split up BUT on the original aircraft (with a new flight number in view of our original twin seats) Others from Sydney were in the same position a lot of angry customers feeling let down. Another average meal and drinks rounded off my most average Premium Economy experience ever. On the plus side, all crews were great with plenty of drinks runs. The fundamental design and architecture of this route is flawed. The inflexibility is annoying though when it suits AC, they will split the flight in two to maintain punctuality. Checking back, it is clearly most unreliable AC flight in their entire operation Upgrades were also harder on credits as it's treated as one flight. I would never do an ultra long flight with AC again where so much of the experience is fragile, mis-conceived, late and inflexible.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

I purchased a ticket for my wife and I from Toronto to Calgary for a friend's wedding in June 2017. One of our family members passed away and as a result we needed to cancel our flight. We weren't able to obtain a full refund (due to their policy) which is understandable. I was, given a credit of a fraction of what I paid which I was told on the phone twice by different customer reps that will not expire. A series of family circumstances occurred which prevented my ability to fly. After 1 year, I decided to book a flight only to discover that my credit has expired. I emailed and appealed my case to their retention department and all they gave me was a 15% discount on my next flight. They even had the audacity to say it's out of their ""goodwill"" that they're offering me 15%.  Very irritated with this policy.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

There were no more seats for 12:20 flight, but could check in for 16:35. However, the staff did not tell us it's a standby boarding pass. When boarding at 16:05, the boarding gate staff said the flight was full, put us on 18:20. If you did not have seat why would you check us in. We could just walk out and spend time outside airport, instead of sitting for nothing for hours inside this small airport. We are still waiting now. Also, we could not buy anything from Quebec airport duty free, because of connecting flight, must buy in Toronto airport. Just wonder how a passenger could have enough time during short transit!

However, prior to travel I contacted customer services by email for basic information about whether the airline covers the cost of the Cuban visa card and airport taxes (they do). They were very reluctant to help me. Customer Services actually told me they only deal with customers after flights have taken place! Eventually my travel agent gave me a telephone number to contact the carrier, and I got the information I needed. On the Toronto to Havana flight both ways with Air Canada rouge, no meal was provided, which came as a surprise on a scheduled flight. In Toronto, Air Canada ground staff were very dismissive and unhelpful when we sought information on baggage. Havana check in told us we needed to retrieve bags at Toronto, even though the baggage tag showed check in through to destination. Air Canada staff seemed unable to give clear guidance. Two members of staff told us to reclaim the baggage, but could not tell us what to do when we had reclaimed it. I had great difficulty getting another member of staff to focus on my question: she just wanted to turn away from me. Compared to travel with other national carriers recently, Air Canada was poor.

They change planes at the last minute which can cause all sorts of confusion at the gate,  they told everyone that their carry on bags will not fit the new plane and they must be checked in. They could just sky check the bags and all would be okay, but they stopped that service also (second flight in two weeks they have done this to me on). They told us because it is a Q400 that they have to check in all the roller bags - this causes all sorts of delays upon arrival into Vancouver and is problematic if you have a connection due to a late inbound AC flight that delayed you to start with! The thing is, the sky check bags end up in the same place as the checked bags. Its just far more convenient for the business traveler to get your bag plane side and run to you connection.

Air Canada has a regularly scheduled 7am flight from Pittsburgh to Toronto that connects with many flights headed to the Caribbean. In our case, on Feb. 4 we intended to connect with a flight to Barbados, from where we would take a short flight to Union Island in the Grenadines and then a short ferry to Palm Island. Problem is: Air Canada cancels this flight - and not infrequently. On this day, Air Canada cited the reason as lack of crew. Really? You can't schedule adequate crew? And Air Canada didn't tell us it canceled the flight until we were on our way to the airport at 5 a.m. What are we to do then? In our case, we had only one other option, which was to buy a last-minute ticket on JetBlue via Fort Lauderdale for $772. Unfortunately, the flight got us in too late to make the connection to Union Island, which means we had to pay for a hotel in Barbados and repurchase the $285 non-refundable airfare to Union Island -- not to mention forfeit the first night at our final destination. Air Canada doesn't compensate you for the cancellation, other than to refund the original one-way ticket. They gave us coupons worth $300 Canadian. That barely makes up the difference between the original ticket and the Jet Blue ticket. Their comment was ""schedules cannot be guaranteed and they do not form part of the contract of travel.""

This entire experience was very frustrating, a terrible way to start a holiday and was made worse by the lack of compensation for our time and frustration by Air Canada, no food vouchers, or drinks were offered and nothing more than an explanation every 45 minutes was given.

Air Canada is incompetent in effectively handling delays in particular for business travelers. There are a lot of negative reviews of Air Canada for everything from overall friendliness to food. I care about those things – but as a business traveler I care most about getting to my destination on time, and that delays are handled effectively and knowledgeably when there are disruptions so that I can still get to my destination as needed. I was flying from Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto. My flight was delayed to Toronto, causing me to miss my flight to Shanghai. There were two other flights that could have gotten me to Shanghai in time for my meeting. Due to the incompetence of the Air Canada staff I missed both. In particular, there is no Business Class line at the re-ticketing counter. I waited for an hour and a half – missing both other flight options. I was behind domestic travelers with multiple rerouting options and coach fares. Even when I called over a “supervisor” and explained the situation I was told there was nothing she could do, she couldn’t get me to the front of the line, and I would just have to wait my turn. I was going for a board meeting, with my executive team flying in from all over the world for this meeting. All other travel and arrangements – for all of the other people – needed to be rearranged due to my travel issues. I am a frequent Air Canada traveler. I go to Asia at a minimum twice a year in Business Class. I fly every other week on an expensive (typically $500) ticket to my other office domestically. When I called ""Customer Service"" they were rude, told me there was no management escalation (no way I could talk to a supervisor), and showed absolutely no flexibility. My experience with customer service just added insult to injury. I am taking the time to write this review on as many review sites as I can. I don’t typically write reviews. In this case, however, I really want to warn other business travelers – in particular overseas business travelers – that they are not at all equipped to handle the inevitable travel disruptions and prioritize business class tickets.

Majority of travelers' flights were canceled upon arrival, and the people at Toronto Pearson (Terminal 1) were helpless. There was no one directing people to where they needed to go for assistance. The lines started to get long at Gate 15 at departures but there was absolutely no one to direct people where to line up or answer questions. We waited at the phone line for 1.5 hour just to wait another hour to speak with a representative.

Once we got to the Air Canada counter, the lady didn’t even care to look anything up on her computer & just told us to call this number that didn’t even work because it had “reach capacity.” Basically, the only help most of the 300+ travelers got were from other travelers. Also, this worker came onto the intercom to announce to us that they are doing their best to help us. Following that announcement came some short responses from frustrated travelers.

Because of this, the line clogged the entire walkway of the terminal with people. A lot of bags had to be gate checked due to the full flight, thus, delaying the boarding even further.

I booked the ticket for my mother to travel Wellington, New Zealand from Vancouver, Canada. I booked in mid-February to travel in April beginning. My mother is old and has limited English. So i want her to travel hassle free for her vacation. The reason I choose air Canada 1) Price wise i can save about 150$ compared to the next cheap flight 2) I don't want to transit at Auckland because she needs to take a bus between international arrival and local departure at Auckland. 3) Air Canada's transit at Sydney only 3 hours and she can clear the bags at Wellington. My mother is Canadian and she doesn't require an ETA or transit visa to Australia if she has less than 8 hours transit. Exactly two days before the travel, we have received an email from Air Canada with a subject of itinerary change. No information inside the email except the itinerary. As per the new itinerary, transit at Sydney become 10 hours from just 3.5 hours. Same day evening we called the Air Canada to seek the reason. The person came to the phone didn't tell the reason. He just says the transit changed. Then we request for accommodation but he refused. Finally, we request the food voucher as a compensation for their possible mistake. He said they can provide that at the airport. ultimately its a useless conversation for us.( Nothing provided at the airport at the end.) Then only we realized my mother required an ETA or transit visa to Australia. Transit visa is free but it could take up to 5 days to get it. So we apply for ETA and luckily we received almost immediately. As per there website, this could take up to 12 hours sometime. We were not happy about Air Canada's behavior. So on the same day, we file a complaint with Air Canada and asked them to reply immediately since the next day my mother was flying. It is now almost 5 days and my mother in New Zealand for 3 days.

The website for refund and rebooking did not work for me and you can only transact with them on the phone for this matter not the counter. But I was on the waiting line for probably an hour and no one picked up the phone. In addition to this incident, I was flying from Toronto to Halifax and many of the customers were caught up in the security line due to “unforeseen” (from customers point of view) crowd at the check in and security check. We missed the gate by probably 2 minutes? Can still see the plane on tarmac but it’s deemed as customer fault and we were told to rebook. The rebooking process was similarly difficult. Not sure why their online systems have not been revamped. Customer service at the counter were also usually rude except for the staff at the priority line.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

That caused a strong misdundertanding among passengers and the ground crew for about half an hour. 2) The flight was rescheduled to 8am. It was a late flight (11.15 pm) and they were very slow to solve the situation. Therefore, a group of people could not go to the hotel and got stuck in the airport. The group of about 20 people had to stay outside the security area from 2am until 4am with CAN30 for dinner and brekfast meals. 3) No alternative to these passengers was presented. 4) Air Canada shamily sent an email with a promocode to be used in the next 60 days, otherwise it will expire. This promo could not be used for upgrade on a next flight.

Due to this flight change my connecting time in Frankfurt became extremely tight and so I needed to run to catch my Air Canada flight to Ottawa. When I arrived at the gate nearly everyone had already boarded so it was just myself and a few other latecomers who got there last minute. As far as the flight goes, it didn't differ much from my previous experiences with Air Canada. The food in economy class was horrible, save for the pretzel snacks and the chicken wrap they give out towards the end of the flight.

The way we were treated last night July 2nd 2018 flying at 23:20 flight to Reykavik flight number AC 816 was my worst experience with an airline. My boyfriends passport is slightly water damaged, but scans where we go. It has never not scanned until last night, but it wouldn't scan at the terminal. But what I'm having a hard time understanding is why were we stopped outside of the US? So we flew from NY to Toronto no problem, passport scanned and was accepted by Air Cananda staff. And then we are about to board in Toronto to go to Reykjavik and its no longer acceptable , why were we allowed to enter into Canada? So we proceeded to try to talk to the women who told us she couldn't do any thing because it wouldn't scan. And proceeded to tell us to go to customer service to see what can be done.  So we have to leave the terminal and go through border control, so my boyfriend hands over his passport to the  man working the counter, and now my boyfriends passport will scan. The young gentleman at the booth suggested she wasn't holding it on the machine long enough for it to read. So she refused us for a $2000 flight we booked. At this point its 24:00, we had been at Toronto airport for 6 hours because of delays. We need to go to customer service, rebook the flight, get a hotel and get our luggage. We go to customer service and had the best customer service thank god! The staff there was amazing and super helpful. So we go to get our luggage and its almost 0200, so they have no one there get our luggage and now we have to go to the airport today and hope it didn't go to Reykjavik because we obviously did not rebook the flight with Air Canada.

I didn't realize that each one of these was an itinerary change. The last one moved our flight time up from 7:10 to 6:30am. Having 2 small children, we got to the ticket counter at 5:35 am which was plenty of time for our first flight time, but they would not let us on the flight because we missed the 1 hour check in by 5 minutes. The lady at the counter was unhelpful and rude. I called the rebooking number and they said there was another flight that same day (the lady at the counter said there wasn't). The rep on the phone said we need to book with the lady at the counter because it would cost much more if she did it on the phone. I went back to the lady at the counter and she was still completely unhelpful even when talking to the rep on the phone. The rep on the phone spoke with her supervisor who gave it to us at the same price because the rep at the counter refused to help. $450 later and hauling 2 very young children around at 4:30 am for no reason because our flight was changed without real notification (the email never stated there was an itinerary change that I noticed), I am extremely unsatisfied. Flight home- My husband was detained by US Dept of Homeland Security. While this was not the fault of Air Canada, it took them almost 2 hours to get them his bags to be checked. He almost missed this flight as well and I was in the airport in Calgary for over 2 hours with 2 small children by myself because of this delay. This was my husband's first time to fly. It was not mine, but I can say that it was by far my most stressful. Between the cost in money and stress, I don't think I will ever fly Air Canada again.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every  time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure  11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there. Now I had to call customer service and spend over one hour for them to guarantee us on the premium seats on our return flight, but I am still expecting a full refund for the premium seats I was denied despite having paid for them.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I had not flown before in the new Premium Economy of Air Canada, although I had done so on several occasions with AC Rouge leisure subsidiary including on this route, before it was ‘transferred’ back to main-line AC. Check-in at DUB was problem free and expeditious as PE passengers can use the Premium lines. When this service was operated by AC Rouge PE passengers were directed to use DUB Fast Track security. This perk not offered on main-line AC. Boarding was as expected, PE being the second group to board after Business class. The flight appeared full, all seats were occupied in the PE section. The seats were a little more comfortable than those on Premium Rouge with perhaps a little more leg room. As this service departed DUB early afternoon, lunch was serviced not long after departure. There were 2 choices for the main course and the meal was serviced on china ware. No so the drinks with plastic glasses, (apart form a wine glass on the meal tray!) and coffee/tea from paper cups. This is a downgrade from Rouge PE where real glasses and china mugs for coffee/tea are used. The second meal or snack was exactly the same as offered in Premium Rouge. A significant difference was the lack of a dedicated FA to PE. FAs in PE are shared with Economy, with Economy being a much larger cabin, at times there was no FA to be seen in PE. With Rouge PE there is dedicated FA at all times. Another difference is that the FAs on main-line are more mature, and for the most part more experienced. The flight arrived on time and dis-embarkation was as expected, PE exited followed Business class passengers. Based this experience, I found the AC PE service inferior to that of the nearest comparison, international Premium Rouge.",Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0

Initially they had me on a morning flight from Melbourne but I felt the time between flights was too tight, together with fog/winter issues so I called and arranged a flight the day before, it cost me an extra $300. The shock came at the airport when I found they downgraded me to economy, not a big issue except the $300 extra is more than a normal one way flight. Anyway determined to put this behind me, I used the kiosks at Brisbane airport to check in and self label my bags. The lounge (NZ) was really nice. Boarding was in zones with children going first, then zone 1-5 in order. The plane was a Boeing 787 with pods. Offered fruit juice or water and nuts to start, then handed menus. The FAs were nice but apart from meals, they were mostly absent, the meals were small but tasty. Then snacks (chips, water, chocolate and fruit) were left to help ourselves to. On the menu was a list of hot snacks on request. Meals were trolley service, like upmarket economy. Entertainment was ok, not extensive but adequate. The seat was a little hard but ok. Breakfast was nice although the FA gave me a lecture on sugar when I asked for milk and sugar in my coffee. After arrival in Vancouver and the necessary immigration procedure followed, it was off to domestic and the lounge. Stayed there just a few minutes, it was crowded, inadequate, little to offer, so I just walked around until the Toronto flight. Old plane, again boarded via zones. The food on board was dire. The nice FA offered me alternatives, I just opted for a cookie. The entertainment in board was better than the Dreamliner.

On arrival in Vancouver I approached the desk for an earlier Syd-Melb flight than 1.30pm. They said there were none. On my iPad I showed them how many Qantas flights there actually were yet they refused to budge. This was all their mistake and it was compounding. The plane to Sydney was old.

Once on a trip to Halifax, once on a trip to Las Vegas and this is the third time they have done it on my trip to Italy. Halifax and Las Vegas were both five day trips, I spent the first three days of these trips without baggage. I understood that because I made connections that it is possible there was not enough time to properly get the bag onto the next flight. However, if this is something that often happens maybe it is best they stop charging for connections they do not have the capability of properly executing. This most recent flight to Milan, I checked in 4 hours early for a direct flight. There is absolutely no reason my baggage should have been left in Toronto. This is my third day in Italy without my baggage, how has it still not made it on another flight? I am writing a review on here because the customer service website for Air Canada is insufficient, there is no direct email for customer service, instead they lead you to numerous automated responses. Working in customer service myself, I understand that mistakes happen. However, considering I have given this company thousands of dollars over the last few years I am fed up. I see no reason why in 2018 they can charge $1,200 for a round trip, direct flight to Milan and be so behind that baggage cannot arrive with that flight. I am ready to ditch Air Canada completely and give another company my money.

We got off the plane, and the next flight was delayed (we were suppose to board the same plane, but just pick up some passengers in Kelowna.) They come on the intercom and say the plane is broken so we need to call a number to re-book our flight to Calgary or get a partial refund. (Yes, it was our responsibility now.) We needed to get to a wedding reception, so time was of the essence. All 4 of us were on the phone trying to re-book the next flight, and we were put on hold. And hold. And hold. Then they came back saying they got us tickets, then put us on hold again. Finally came back and said ""sorry the next flight is now full"", but they have a flight leaving in a few hours with a layover in Edmonton and to arrive in Calgary around 9pm. We needed to get there so we jumped on that flight before it was full, we got new boarding passes, and went to sit at White Spot for some drinks. We waited about 2.5 hours and then that flight was now delayed. About an hour later they told us that the flight was now cancelled. So we just wasted hours in the airport waiting for nothing. We tried calling customer service but there were no more flights that evening and the next one was at 7:30 in the morning. FWe had called to ask for a refund so that we could jump on a flight with WestJet, but they said that was ""unlikely"" to happen. So now we were trying to get hotel vouchers, nobody would give us any sort of solid information. Every person we talked to told us to go talk to another person, or to call a different number. One guy had told us that all their hotel vouchers were ""exhausted"". So not only did they royally screw us for the entire day and night, but we weren't even going to get any sort of accommodation. The only good person we dealt with was an amazing lady who finally pulled some strings to get us a hotel, and she was helpful and knowledgeable.

Air Canada did not have to help us at all. They could have made us wait for the 9:00 pm flight, sitting in the Paris Airport for 12 hours then the flight and drive home. They all went above and beyond. The three of us were tired and confused but the staff came through! Thank you so much! Maybe if I had flown Air Canada to Paris to begin with, my luggage would not have been lost by Brussels Airlines! Whole trip - no luggage! This was my first time flying with Air Canada and would recommend them in the future.",Family Leisure,4.0,5.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Calgary to Toronto via Regina ,2.0," |  My flight was more than 20 minutes delayed from YYC to YQR. We then had to divert to YXE due to what the crew described as a fast-moving storm that was going through YQR. As a result, I missed my connecting flight to YYZ. Staff at YQR rebooked me for 6.00 am the next day, but offered nothing else as compensation. No hotel accommodation, meals, upgrade, nothing. They said that the delay was due to weather, not the delay of their flight crew in YYC. I will not use Air Canada again. Terrible customer service, and they don't care about their customers.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Edmonton to Toronto,1.0," |  During the drink service, I asked the attendant ""What is that Georgia Bay thing?"" as I had spotted a can I did not recognize in the pop drawer. She said ""Oh it is delicious"", opens the can, hands it to me, and moves on to the next row. A few minutes later she returns with the credit card machine. I was not informed that the drink was alcoholic, nor that it cost money, nor did I even request to have the drink."" After a rather threatening discussion on the flight attendant's behalf, I agreed to pay for the drink and contacted customer service instead. Customer service  informed me that I would have known the prices of all of their service offerings had I read their 18 page menu, and that I should know better than to order alcoholic drinks that I don't want to pay for.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,June 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Comox to Grande Praire via Calgary,3.0, | Once again all goes well until I get to the Calgary to Grande Prairie leg of my journey. Delayed over and over. If you don’t have the planes flying don’t sell the tickets! Every time I’m delayed hours. Haven’t had one reliable Air Canada Jazz flight to Grande Prairie in the last 8 times flown. Flight attendants blame it on The “Jazz” entity. Don’t know what that means but 3-4 hours every time is pathetic.,Business,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,no,Vancouver to Melbourne,4.0," |  All my flights were delayed and no meal from Vancouver to Montreal through Winnipeg. Also, they lost my luggage in Winnipeg (the aircraft was the same from Vancouver to Montreal) and it was hard to get in touch with them on the phone. The day I was flying back to Melbourne, my flight to Vancouver was delayed by 2 hours losing my connecting flight to Melbourne. They relocated me in an earlier flight and now this one has suffered some delays. This time the flight is 5h and they are still not offering any food on board. ",Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0
Boeing 777-300ER,Economy Class,5.0,May 2018,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Paris to Montreal,4.0," |  Paris to Montreal returning from Toronto in May. Had quite low expectations of Air Canada but was pleasantly surprised with their service. Friendly and warm cabin crew, several rounds of drinks on 7 hour sectors, and announcements in both English and French. Top-notch service from this crew as they were able to get for you what you needed. The seat was relatively comfortable and the inflight entertainment system had plenty of good choices. No fuss boarding at both CDG and YYZ, and their mobile boarding pass was a huge time saver at busy airports such as CDG. If there was one thing I didn't like it would be their in-flight catering - strange choice of mains such as shredded carrots on pasta was not very delicious, and they ran out of second options on both flights. However, pre-landing snacks were delicious and the wine selection was excellent. Look forward to flying them again in future and hopefully by then they will change their menu.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 787,Business Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,5.0,3.0,yes,Vancouver to Brisbane,5.0," |  Round trip Brisbane-Vancouver-Brisbane. Third trip in 3yrs. Used to have to fly to Sydney to get to Vancouver on a 777, the 787 a much better experience. Meals excellent, lots of choices, hot snacks on demand, and pre-packaged snacks and fruit available overnight. Entertainment options a bit weak: new releases aren't really new, 'world cinema' options mostly Asian or Bollywood, limited Canadiana, Franco options. Ended up watching TV series in bored desperation. 14+hrs is a long time! The seat cover mattress is long overdue (most Asian/Middle Eastern airlines have had them for eons). Quilt and pillow just right, amenities kit ok, basic. Staff friendly, courteous, available and not in your face all the time. Too bad they collect the noise cancelling headsets an hour before landing and you're stuck with useless earbuds. ",Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0
nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,1.0,5.0,no,New York to Tel Aviv via Montreal,5.0," | Flew Air Canada from New York to Tel Aviv via Montreal. The airline service on board was very good, however, when it comes to speaking with the airline by phone or email there is no service at all. I waited nearly an hour to talk to a representative, its a real disgrace. For example if you need to order special food there is no way but wait 1 hour or more. For that reason alone I will give the airline a 1 star.",Business,1.0,5.0

Boeing 787-9,Business Class,4.0,July 2018,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes,Vancouver to Melbourne,5.0," |  Vancouver to Melbourne. Delayed boarding due late inbound aircraft and documents checking for passengers. Excellent, well-designed, comfortable seat pods. Thoughtful menu and service throughout, very good entertainment choices and accessibility, TV screen well positioned and easy to use. Amenities were good, although on this 16 hour overnight flight some pyjamas would have been good - as other airlines often do. Cabin crew were mostly very good. Overall, a very comfortable and enjoyable flight.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 789,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,no,Vancouver to London Heathrow,1.0," | Vancouver to London Heathrow. Air Canada created much publicity about the greater comfort on their new Dreamliner, the Boeing 789. The reality is very different. Seat is extremely hard and uncomfortable. Pillow and blanket are thin and flimsy. Service and food on board were mediocre. Staff were mostly unsmiling. Dinner was a dish of dry, cubed chicken with a lurid, spicy sauce. Almost inedible. Arrived exhausted at LHR. Very disappointing. Air Canada’s Dreamliner is no dream to fly on.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

A good, comfortable flight in a new B737 MAX aircraft, sitting in international premium economy (in this plane it's the same as AC's domestic business class). Service crew was friendly as usual and the flight itself was on time. The seats are substantially more comfortable than in economy and the food is much better as well.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

After 20 minutes of flight, the plane turns back and land back in Montreal. The flight is canceled. I spoke to 3 Air Canada employees and they all gave a different reason why the flight was canceled. I had to wait hours in line to schedule another flight. I wrote a complaint to the company and they refused to refund me for the money I lost for food and hostel. They gave me a discount on another flight and they even made it sound like it was a privilege. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
