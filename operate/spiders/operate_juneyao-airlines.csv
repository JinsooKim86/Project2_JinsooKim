A320,Economy Class,1.0,August 2017,2.0,2.0,nan,no,Shanghai Pudong to Hong Kong,2.0," |  Shanghai Pudong to Hong Kong. Miserable flight experience and try to avoid it ! The flight was delayed for 2 hours due to airline reasons, but no explanation, broadcast or any apology ! Another hour taxing before departure. Thereby, no express service at Hong Kong Airport upon arrival in midnight, and I have to take a taxi. The most horrible is its cabin service. Flight attendants were very indifferent, impatient and grumpy when requested. No welcome and farewell at the cabin door, the crew kept chatting instead. The language skill of cabin crew is ridiculous, and pronounced Hong Kong in Chinese phonetics.  The catering is the same as domestic flights, and far from quality and delicacy. Feel shameful about such a poorly-organized and unprofessional airline !",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,June 2017,2.0,3.0,nan,yes,Shanghai Pudong to Xi'an,4.0," |  Shanghai Pudong to Xi'an flight with Juneyao Airlines. Delayed by two hours due to inclement weather, but the communication and information was very poor indeed - there was a blanket refusal to give any information (such as an estimated delay time or even where the plane has left the previous destination). Check-in online does not work unless you have a Chinese mobile phone number, which is a big minus when travelling and forces you to get to the airport early. Juneyao counters do have apparently convenient bag-drop locations. On the positive side, the seats are very comfortable and have head rests (even for a short-haul flight). A hot meal was served on this short 2.5 h flight and the service is better than many Chinese airlines.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
A321,Economy Class,2.0,April 2017,1.0,2.0,nan,no,Hong Kong to Shanghai,3.0," |  Flew Hong Kong to Shanghai with Juneyao Airlines. Due to bad weather visibility and air traffic delays we were boarded before we had an air traffic control slot. We remained on the aircraft for over four hours then we were deplaned and were marched through security again taking another hour and a half and reboarded. We eventually took off at 0600, seven hours late. I am amazed that the crew who said that they started at 1600h were within their legal hours. Absolutely no extra food or refreshments whatsoever during the 10 hour ordeal. Worse still no apology, in fact the pilot said nothing. We complained to the ground handling agent asking for refreshments but we were told that one of the worlds busiest 24 hours a day airport could not provide catering. I have been to over a hundred countries on thousands of airlines and never have I been delayed eight hours without an as much as an apology.",Business,2.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,5.0,February 2017,4.0,2.0,nan,yes,Krabi to Shanghai,4.0," |  Juneyao Airlines was a complete surprise. After a painful experience dealing with the crowds of people coming back to China after New Year's Holiday, I was afraid the flight was going to be the same. The experience flying from Krabi to Shanghai was the opposite: the plane was modern, comfortable and clean. Since I didn't know anything about the airline prior to my flight, I thought it was going to be one of those horrible charter airlines, but it's not. The crew were really nice, correct and helpful. The snack was good and the seat was comfortable. The airlines website English version is not really helpful and when you need to do something it takes you to the Chinese version. The cell phone app (at least for iPhone) is only available in Chinese. Not really helpful, but not surprising since I was the only non Chinese in the plane.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,December 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Tokyo to Shanghai,1.0,"When booking with Juneyao Airlines you cannot book very small children online, you need to call. When you call you find out that the child pays 10%, everything still reasonable. Then you find out your ticket was a discount ticket, you didn't see the full price when you paid, your child pays 10% of full price ticket (which is hugely inflated), and will work out more than your adult ticket. But you already paid for your ticket and with all the cancellation rules you have to pay, so they have tricked you into paying a high price for your baby. What an immoral airline, only a snake could implement an idea like that exploiting families with babies. Of course everybody has to make a profit but you do it by being open about prices and charges. So be careful if you book with them.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Water and snack provided, no entertainment but it's acceptable for this 1.5hr journy. Airfare is very cheap (only RMB1000 including tax). Overall very enjoyable experience with Juneyao Airlines.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

A short 20 minute stop in Wuhan enabled us to make up some lost time from the delayed departure. No inflight entertainment provided so bring your own. Cabin crew spoke limited English but were happy enough to help.,Family Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Flew Juneyao Airlines for a domestic flight PVG-WUH. The flight left within 30 minutes of scheduled and all announcements were given in both Mandarin and English. There wasn't any in-flight entertainment aboard but it did not matter on this short flight. There was a food and beverage service that began about 20 minutes after take off consisting of a bottle of water and a saucy pork sandwich that was quite good. Arrived in WUH within 20 minutes of scheduled time. Overall a good experience.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,First time flying domestic in China WUH to PVG. Used Juneyao as first leg to fly back home to States - bad decision! Juneyao leg delayed by 2 hrs causing us to miss every subsequent connecting flight. We were delayed three days at PVG as our international flight was booked three days out. Juneyao refused to help us out in any way with accommodations or replacement flights. Will stick to trains for domestic travel in China.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,I booked a connecting flight with Juneayo from Hong Kong to Qingdao via Shanghai. At the check-in at Hong Kong Airport I was rudely informed by a Juneyao employee it was not possible to check-in for both flights and send the luggage directly to Qingdao. As expected I lost my connecting flight to Qingdao (the flight was delayed I had to pick up luggage in Shanghai and doing the check-in again). The truth is the Juneyao employee in Shanghai was much more polite and they changed my flight with a different company (China Eastern which I recommend never had problems with them) and no additional charges but I got to Qingdao with more than 6 hours of delay (that is later than midnight). It was a long day travelling for such a short trip. Of course I'm never going to travel with Juneyao again. Rude employees in Hong Kong and there is no previous warning about such company politics anywhere.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,PuDong to Xiamen. Wasn't expecting much based on the inexpensive ticket price from an airline I'd never heard of but was impressed with new plane and upbeat cabin crew. Dinner was a typical tin-foiled beef/chicken with noodles. Drink service was plentiful for such a short flight. Much like Southwest and jetBlue in the US. I love that they fly to both Shanghai airports and have cheap flights even in the afternoon. Overall I'd rate them as an above- average 3 star airline.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"Shanghai-Harbin-Shanghai. On the Harbin-Shanghai segment midair the undercover air marshall rudely demanded that I turned off my PDA phone which was already set in ""no connection'. Juneyao should better train their air marshal on manners and be sufficiently knowledgeable about PDA type phones. I am an international frequent traveller and found Juneyao's air marshal manners offensive. Travellers intending to fly Juneyao should make note about using their PDA type phones. Apart from that the air hostess service was good airplane interior was clean.",nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,TSN-SHA. I have no idea why it's called Juneyao Airlines in English because this is nothing like its Chinese name. Check-in smooth new A320 was spotless inside. Every seat taken. The crew were friendly and helpful free newspapers - I was the only person on the flight with a foreign surname and they'd made a point of ordering in an English-language newspaper for me which was a nice touch. The food was interesting - a tangerine and a dry bread roll (no butter or anything) - but it was inoffensive. Passenger discipline an issue as it is on most domestic Chinese airlines : one stupid woman stood up to get her luggage out the bins when we were still about 100 metres in the air. The crew shouted at her to sit down but she ignored them : she fell over when we hit the ground which was funny.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,First Class,2.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,5.0,Booked Shanghai to Xiamen flight on 28th December 2013 at 2.15pm. Checked in and settled in the business class lounge. As soon as we heard the flight started to board at around 1.45pm we started to move out of the Business Class lounge and made our way to the gate. It was a long walk so we got there at 2.00pm. Behold the plane was already starting to reverse! Asked the gate agent they said our luggage had already been taken out so we missed the flight! We had to book on to a different airline as we were going to a wedding that night. So stay close to the gate when catching flight in China even if you travel on business class. Will avoid them from now on.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,Checked in at Shanghai Pudong airport 20 minutes before boarding (boarding time: 4.20pm departure: 4.50pm). Told it was delayed but staff had no information on when the flight would arrive. Decided to go through security. At about 7.30 after about 3 hours of waiting they handed out food but still didn't offer any explanation for the delay and they still didn't know when the plane would arrive. After about 3.5 hours of waiting many customers started shouting at workers. After 4.5 hours the workers fled. Still no explanation or ETA for the plane. After 6 hours we were told that our plane had landed. We finally took off around 11.50pm. 7 hours late.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,Shanghai Pudong-Macao round-trip. 3+ Hours delay on the departure because the airplane left its previous point of origin that late. 4 hours delay on the way back. Compensation meal tickets on the return flight were only redeemable for a bottle of water and a package of instant noodles. No compensation on the departing flight. This was a weekend trip to Macao and the delays meant we lost our Friday night and didn't get home until past 4am on Monday before going back to work. None of us will fly Juneyao again.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,"Shanghai Hongqiao to Sanya and back (party of two). Check-in in Shanghai smooth and professional no issues assigning 2 aisle seats in the same row to us. must quite efficient we showed up at the gate in Shanghai 5 minutes after the indicated ""boarding time"" only to find ourselves greeted by a PA announcement that we should report to our gate immediately for the boarding of the flight. We were the last passengers to board after which the flight proceeded to sit at the gate for the next 30 minutes. In-flight on the positive side: brand new A320 aircraft. Seats reasonably pitched every seat had a plush pillow and flight attendants distributed free blankets before takeoff. Food during the flight was standard pork/chicken with noodles - but quite edible. In-flight negatives: my request for English newspapers was met with a rather curt no. The seat- belt sign was on throughout the entire flight for no rhyme or reason when I queried the flight attendant he either did not understand my question or couldn't explain why the sign was always on. During cruise one of the flight attendants also rather rudely asked me to turn off my smartphone which was already in flight mode. Sanya to Hongqiao: flight delayed 40 minutes with absolutely no information provided to passengers by ground staff. Ground staff spoke very little English. After boarding we sat at the gate for an additional hour waiting for ATC clearance. I unfortunately cannot comment much on the in-flight experience on the return leg as I slept for the vast majority of the flight. Overall Juneyao seems to be about on-par with China Eastern and Air China for domestic flights.",nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Shanghai Pudong to Xiamen (return). We choose Juneyao purely on price being the cheapest. Check-in at Shanghai was swift albeit delayed a little. Juneyao uses new(ish) Airbus planes and the aircraft had good decor and very friendly cabin crew. Food was slightly better than most domestic Chinese airlines. All in all a very good experience with helpful and attentive cabin crew. On the return our departure was delayed due to congestion in Shanghai thus we boarded over an hour later than planned. The cabin crew again impressed very attentive. Food was a snack box on this leg as it was late evening - but this was a fairly decent standard.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Shanghai to Changsha. The Check in staff was helpful. I was very late for check in and I called them before hand trying my luck and hoping against hope that they would keep the counter open for me. They asked for my passport number and asked me to come to a particular counter asap (all in Chinese they spoke no English). When I reached the counter my boarding card was ready and was asked to rush for boarding. Onboard given a drink. Reading material was bilingual. Flight was on time. Cabin crew OK limited to no English. Safety demonstration was manual. No entertainment except for reading.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Shanghai Pudong - Xiamen. Flight delayed firstly 'due to weather' [it was a very clear day for Shanghai] and then later 'due to late arrival of aircraft'. Overall delay 3 hours with no rescheduling until all of a sudden let's board the plane. Thought it was very poor that the airline didn't even offer to us a drink. Staff seemed in hurry once we got into the air literately had to catch my snack box as it was thrown to me. Staff handed out a raffle ticket and a suggestions card [both bilingual] to most other passengers though I didn't get one maybe because I'm a foreigner. Seat didn't recline at all though better width than the other time I've flown with them. Probably won't fly again unless it is a very cheap flight.,nan,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Great food and service inflight but both my flight Qingdao to Shanghai and Shanghai to Harbin were delayed an hour or more. The first was assigned to late arrival of the aircraft and the wait was in the terminal. Note that check-in desks are not destination specific for Juneyao at Shanghai Pudong. This means that one cannot arrive after the expected rush (but before check-in closes) and expect a very short or no line since there will likely be a line of people checking in for other destinations at every counter.,nan,4.0,nan
