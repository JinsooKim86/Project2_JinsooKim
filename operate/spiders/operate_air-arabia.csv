Later I saw people boarding the same flight with both of these items. I asked the lady at the customer service desk attending to us in how is she allowing others and on what basis were we picked, she was rude and unhelpful.

But the worst was the handling: Only after 2 hours of insisting and talking to the responsible person the passengers got a voucher to buy some food or drinks - with the value of 5 Euro! Finally arrived in Frankfurt 6 hours delayed at 2am in the night. No connecting trains. No compensation from the airline offered, and it can't be enforced because the airline is not under EU law.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,CMB to BA via SHJ,1.0," |  I was flying from Colombo to Bahrain via Sharjah with my 8 weeks pregnant wife. Firstly, the flight from Colombo to Sharjah was delayed for about 4 hours which led in missing the connecting flight to Bahrain. Any normal airline would at least provide passenger with correct information. At Sharjah airport (which is another part of terrible story), none of the staff had clear information. The pathetic level of customer care was seen particularly by ""Help Desk"". I was even given an answer by staff on the desk upon asking when is the next flight ""any when!!"". There was nobody present at the desk to reserve us a Hotel even. After going around like headless chickens, I found out that the flight would be in the same evening at 5:50pm. I was told that no need to get new boarding pass you will fly on the same boarding pass. At around 5pm, after sitting on chairs at Sharjah airport in miserable and uncomfortable environment, I was given another news. That the flight is actually full and we will be given 2nd priority if the passengers from connecting flight miss this connection. I even noticed that there were passengers who bought this flight on same day, were told by the staff to just ""wait and we will call you"" meaning they were not let to stand in the queue for boarding. This clearly shows the mentality of the airlines where they have made their money and let the poor people be as stand by. After me literally begging the boarding assistant and explaining him my wife situation, he let us go on the plane and luckily, our luggage was also gone through to be on the plane. I appreciate the help of the guys, but this should not have happened in the first place. It was not my fault that the flight was delayed from Colombo. Even the pilot admitted that it was out of their hands. At least offer us a free meal for goodness sake! The general views of public about airline and Sharjah Airport were quite obviously true. Also, the aircraft is not up to the scratch with other competing airlines in region like Gulf, Oman, Saudia etc. There is clearly a hopeless attitude prevailing throughout this airline management. My first and last ever experience of Air Arabia! I hope I get a refund because I am happy to prove each and every incident that happened in this episode.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The flight was supposed to leave Tehran at 2:30pm but left at 11:00pm. a different conflicting reasons were given (in Arabic only) including technical problems...etc. Only until we got on the plane did the pilot told us that the fog in Sharjah was the problem. Instead of landing in Sharjah, we landed in Al-Fujairah, 80km away in the UAE. We were not allowed to leave the plane for couple of hours until they released us to the transit lounge which was holding the passengers of another 7 planes.  We were not allowed to leave the airport under different excuses. However, UAE nationals were permitted! We had to remain in the transit (literally a barn) for more than 8 hours. Throughout the entire ordeal, there was not a single Air Arabia agent that we could talk to. Bottom line, instead of arriving at 5:30pm, we arrived around 1pm the following day. The airline is very cheap and they will cut cost at the cost of anything happening to the customers. To add insult to injury, after all this ordeal, they would charge you to eat or drink on the plane. Please make sure you don't every give them your business. Pay extra to have a peace of mind and not ruin either you family reunion or your business trip. Interestingly, I learned later that the experience I had was not unique and what happened to us happened earlier and possibly part of a pattern to cut cost (avoiding hotel accommodations or landing at Dubai airport which cost higher landing fees.)

The gentleman at gate says, we will only allow 3kgs for duty free. No guidelines for this given before. We would have made purchases accordingly.  According to air Arabia 10kg + 3kg (duty free), thatâ€™s all what they will allow. I had to leave my luggage behind as they wonâ€™t agree or willing to listen what Iâ€™m trying to explain.

I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Air Arabia from Stuttgart to Marsa Alam and back. Service is pretty much non existEnt and only a major case of hunger made the onboard meal edible. On the return flight takeoff was delayed about 3 hours no information as to why was given to us. As this was known well beforehand we could have remained in our hotels instead of being jammed into the airport at 1 in the morning then finally boarding the aircraft at 04:30 and sitting on the Tarmac for an hour before takeoff. During this time the crew had better things to do than hand out any water or other liquid refreshment it seems. I shall not be flying with this airline again if I can help it and shall recommend to all I know that they should avoid it.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Bangalore-Sharjah. Despite leaving at ungodly hours 3.30am in my case this is probably one of my favourite low cost carriers and in my opinion better than some full service airlines that fly from the middle east to India. Plane was clean and service was excellent plane half empty so had whole row to sleep. Since leaving so early in the morning lights are switched off early overall happy with the service Air Arabia provides.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,CMN-BRU. For a LCC Air Arabia has been a welcome surprise. They offer you 20 kg baggage allowance new airplanes decent seats and a fresh crew. For a price/quality comparison they are better than Air Maroc. But their website is often malfunctioning certain routes are deleted without notice time tables suddenly change and they often leave at ungodly hours. I'm satisfied with this airline and will keep flying them if they keep their standards to the current level.,nan,4.0,nan

They never tell us if it will be canceled or just been delayed. The staff cannot even give any details from Air Arabia from Sharjah in UAE as to whether they will be sending the plane to Pakistan or not. We tried to contact the Air Arabia Sharjah landline and customer service but to no avail.The line is not being attended and only automated reply is what you get everytime you ring them. Air Arabia cannot take care of their passengers. The delays caused us a lot of trouble at work and stress to our family and friends.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

The seats offered great legroom which is 32 inches. The cabin crews were very friendly and helpful. However the food quality was average. You have to book your meal with the ticket or you have to purchase it on board. Overall I think Air Arabia offers the best value for money.,Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Service onboard is as good as any other and with kindness to the crew who is serving you, smiles and respect goes both ways. Had to pay for food and drinks but it is not a big deal. Prices are fair in comparison with some of the bigger low cost airlines. I hop on Air Arabia Maroc very frequent and my experiences with them have always been good.",Business,5.0,nan

The flight was supposed to leave at 1pm and they informed us because of some technical issues the flight should be delayed until 5pm. and no from the company came back to inform the passengers about the status. On the boards we have seen its delayed to 6pm. Again no one appears we called the airport security team to bring us Air Arabia staff but no one shows up. Then they announced the flight will be delayed until 8pm for the 3rd time. Gate changed 3 or 4 times. Company was not clear and keeps ambiguity from the beginning.
