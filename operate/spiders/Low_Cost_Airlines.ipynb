       "'  very disappointed with air asia as a frequent flyer after last experience. online checkin had errors and glitches which did not allow me to checkin early charged 40000 yen at airport. showed pictures of website glitches and errors airline does not care or understand. then i was accidentally tripled charged on my return flight baggage. had 5 transactions for baggage totaling over 800 usd my two tickets cost only around 700. was refunded for some of the excess charges however such a hassle and online help and calling is very time consuming and stressful and not user friendly. i figured if i provided pictures and explained my problems the airline would understand the online checkin and website had experienced problems and was not working properly. poor customer service using live chat and submitting cases on issues just replied back with automated answers. like talking to a computer. nobody should have to get charged over 800 usd and worry about 5 charges for 2 small checkin bags especially unauthorized charges. very disappointed and will never fly again because of airlines poor recognition of the problem poor customer service and failure to refund a small cost that should never of happened. nobody should have to go through that stress while on vacation air asia d7316 from kuala lumpur to beijing march 1213. we have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. kuala lumpur airport is awful. when you ask if there are meals provided they say yes but dont tell you that you are required to pay extra. if you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. we were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. when we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said no we are a low cost airline. they nickel and dime you all the way. when you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. then hit you with a 30 charge however they let all kinds of oversized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. loading the plane is a joke. it is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac it is a total free for all on the tarmac. have flown with aa a few times this time rt from cnx to pen. on the way from cnx to pen i had to pay for the first checked baggage twice just because i had a transit in kuala lumpur. you will never know where they are going to put you in the airplane unless you pay to choose seat. while at singapore changi airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. the airasia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. there was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the dfs stores. my flight to bali took off an hour late. worst experience i had with a budget airline. kuala lumpur to manila. pre flight customer service was a nightmare. my flight was delayed before my trip i was sent an sms to be advised of this. i was offered an earlier flight that wasnt going to work because i was travelling from adelaide at that time. there were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. when i arrived in kl to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. there was a lot of hassle and waiting but i was provided with my boarding pass. flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. as soon as seat belt sign was off i went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as i am concerned in the air i got what i wanted. the selection of food is quite bland i would prefer to just take my food on board. for the price it was not bad. when it comes to staff service i have based it on the pre customer service as thats where i experienced most of the customer service. the worst airline in the world in terms of customer service. i booked a series of flights 8 months in advance. air asia moved one of the flights causing a connection to be not possible. air asia then refused to allow me to move the flights to fix the connection conflict they caused and refused to give me a refund. i wonder what happens if i take the flights and get stranded when one flight lands after the connection has already taken off flew phuket to chiang mai and got dinged nearly 60 cad 55 us for a 20 kg bag. when i picked myself up off the floor i asked the desk person if i could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. told to go to the website check in online and preregister my bag online. the savings would be significant. so today i did just that. only problem  when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out  even after multiple attempts. simply couldnt register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. when we got to the airport i explained the situation. we had checked in online so it was clear i wasnt pulling anyones leg about trying to get things done on the website. but the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. i explained again it wasnt my fault  id tried to do what her colleague had recommended  but their website wasnt working. i then told my story to the person who took my money. same look. so watch out bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy. kl to kota kinabalu. i was hoping for a more malaysian style welcome however i was not even shown to my seats. the cabin crew were fixing their hair and make up and chatting. i was not offended but in my 18 years of flying i have never seen such sight. air asia indonesia. qz8322 21 mar 2014 dmkcgk a320. website checkin is convenient checkin agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an aisle seat. boarding in dmk is manual and the staff check recheck and re recheck if you have boarded or not. crew welcoming and point to your seat. announcements so fast no one can understand them. safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights i had prebooked meal pak nassers nasi lemak as im allergic to fish however the meal included anchovies. again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. overall i will fly them again but will bring my own food and water. i flew from darwin to bali on 21 april and from bali to darwin on 25 april. that was our first time trying air asia and we will not try again. on both days air asia was delayed for about 2 hour. there would have been no time to have the crew check the plane before it departed again. 7th may from jakarta to denpasar bali. flight qz7532. every single time i flew aa the flight was delayed. they usually use a random excuse like delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft. this time 15 min before boarding i asked if the flight was on time. i was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure i enquired again as i couldnt see the airplane at the gate. only then i was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. as a pilot myself i know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on pa i thought that was extremely bad. they cant care less about their passengers. had the worst travelling experience travelling to and from sydney to phuket via kl. hated every minute of it. appalling service from the minute of check in both ends. do not waste your time nor paper checking in beforehand. do not buy food on board maybe chips would be ok. will never recommend nor use again. yesterday i flew from thailand to malaysia. air asia charges extra for every possible option. i booked a hot seat which should have priority boarding. no priority was ever offered and i was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. i also prebooked food. i saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. i had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. the portion was inadequate to say the least. the bathroom was out of soap and when i again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendants attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. no apology was offered although she did suggest i use the bathroom in the back. trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airlines fault that there was no soap. after about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. no one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. the floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. the worst flight i have ever been on. chiang mai to krabi. this is by no means a budget carrier due to their increasing prices. they were the only carrier to offer a direct flight less than two hours avoiding bkk but at a cost of almost 300 one way for two people. thai bangkok and nokair all stopped at bangkok. nothing given for free on board no entertainment. you got to pay for luggage and i couldnt fathom out how not to pay for their insurance better and cheaper fares offered with main airline carriers. although the flight was straightforward. air asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware as stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and prepaying your bags. so on a domestic flight from phuket to bangkok instead of 330 baht per bag about 1011 us per bag we had to pay a whopping 900 per bag about 30 us per bag and it was their fault that we couldnt follow their procedure to checkin and prepay online. if you are sick like i was on the flight dont expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. the flight was chaotic there were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children inflight entertainment none. spend the extra and fly a real airline. dmkphndmk via fd 606 and 607 respectively. flight was on time with a couple minutes late. both flight was close to full as it was holiday week in cambodia. once again nothing much to complain or pride. except i noticed the quality of ground crew and flight attendant going downward. unfriendly and very unapproachable. i know this is a lowfare airline however given the price paid for at least a smile or welcome aboard is shown to the customers. i was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible arriving at the counter at 1.15pm i asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight i was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. there was no one at the airasia departure lounge counter so i went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. i was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm  no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight i asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. as you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available i was mighty ticked. i know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and i understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. i had heard such good things regarding airasia but after this and the cancelation of our clark to kalibo flight on the 14th of november 2013 i will be very hesitant and wary of using airasia again. low cost flight low cost quality. flew from kuala lumpur to sydney. then from melbourne to singapore in april 2014. the second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. seats narrow and uncomfortable. no entertainment. food and drink expensive with little choice. delayed for almost 20 hours without food water and accommodation in kansai airport. it was a midnight flight. no announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. worst airline that io have ever taken. unprofessional and doesnt care about passengers. only having profit in mind. didnt even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. they have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from airasia ground crew. unpleasant experience  flying with toddler with air asia. i flew with my wife and 4yearold son from jakarta to singapore on 12 sep 2014. surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. i asked the checkin counter officer to change the seats. however he said that the flight was full and suggested i purchase seats in advance on my next flights. some thoughts on this incident 1 is this air asia business model separating a toddler from hisher parents could push the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. this is shown as an ads on airasia magazine. 2 is safety air asias concern separating a toddler from hisher parents raises a safety risk. suppose an emergency event occurs. who will help the toddler do you think a stranger sitting next to himher would help himher finally i exchanged seats with other passengers. this definitely causes unpleasant for them. after this incident i do not recommend a family with young children to fly with air asia unless they want to purchase seats. prayalombok to kuala lumpur klia2 as a hiflyer. i booked the premium flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced optout options one has to explicitly decline. web checkin however started to be positively jarring mobile boarding pass didnt work with a european cell number the airport kiosk cant reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the systems shortcomings. priority boarding is a myth at lop as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. that way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. i ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. fas didnt really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. the flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service. boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. this was ok we received vouchers. we boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. so we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. so about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. after an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. so we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. we queued again to the shop. after an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. in both cases an air asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. so then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. air asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. air asia is fine when everything goes well. but when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off. i flew from kuala lumpur to sydney. the flight was cancelled after we had boarded. we had to queue for hours for various things. air asia did the bare minimum to help. airasia philippines is the worst airline i have ever flown with we were flying from cebu to manila and back. the boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. at check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. on the way back they managed to put our 2 children 5 and 8 years old in row 6 and the parents in row 26. for a fee they could change seats  this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. the person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could. we flew from denpasar to perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. we checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows my husband and i were flying with our two kids. obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought oh well its not the end of the world. we boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. we were absolutely gobsmacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own when we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. i told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. just when i thought things couldnt get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids i was told that they only accept cash and not card. i didnt have any cash on me i had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the atm was out of order so they told me i was unable to order any food. i said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. my poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldnt even give me a bottle of water as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security. i was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me 10 so i could buy something for the kids to eat. i will never fly with this airline again. i needed to get to bangkok chiang mai and krabi. to do this within my allotted time span i had no alternative but to fly between these cities. the price differential is quite marked so i elected to try air asia which would allow me to compare it with bangkok airways who i had flown with before. the aircraft was configured as a single cabin. the first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. the other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches like myself were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seatback in front. minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of air asia. my next flight chiang mai to krabi due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. this meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my prebooked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. no apologies – no explanations from air asia. the only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. more of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. all in all my experiences were certainly negative ones. as i write this my wife is trying to get home from bali. they promoted their new direct flight from melbourne to bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. as a result she had to travel through kl and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. they promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through kl again. then the morning of coming home the flight to kl was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. in total it will now take her 16 hours to get from bali to melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. never again. kulhktkul. i accept that if you dont pay to choose a seat it will be selected randomly. but to split people up on the same booking my wife was in the row behind me is ridiculous. outward flight 15 minutes late it appeared that someones bag was being offloaded so maybe someone failed to board the flight before arriving into the chaos of phuket airport arrivals i reviewed this airport separately. flew with them this week between bangalore chandigarh and back to bangalore. i feel the airline has potential if handled properly. the ground staff leave a lot to be desired. our flight from bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. the return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. no announcements. also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. if it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. no smoking announcement not made. some positives though. good pricing strategy. fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve. november 26th chiang mai to hong kong. early morning flight departure time 06.00 and while the standard check in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. a small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. they do not make this easy. the passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the air asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. we knew we had excess weight we had prepurchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. the agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. we were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht approximately 175.00 usd simply based on his arbitrary determination. we preordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. it was the worst attempt at a meal i have ever witnessed. on this trip we used 10 different airlines. did air asia get us to hong kong on time yes. was the plane clean yes. did we receive value for the money spent not even close. of all the airline companies we flew was airasia at least average not even close would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers i hope we never are faced with that decision. i needed to get to bangkok chiang mai and krabi. to do this within my allotted time span i had no alternative but to fly between these cities. the price differential is quite marked so i elected to try air asia which would allow me to compare it with bangkok airways who i had flown with before. the aircraft was configured as a single cabin. the first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. the other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches like myself were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seatback in front. minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of air asia. my next flight chiang mai to krabi due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. this meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my prebooked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. no apologies – no explanations from air asia. the only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. more of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. all in all my experiences were certainly negative ones. fly drive mukdahan  kop  dmk. poor service at check in. bag overweight so had to pay extra. no problem. went to service desk to pay. lady started to serve my wife and then dealt with someone at the next window already being served and ignored us. flight cramped compared to nok air. drive was fine and on time from mukdahan. plane to dmk a little late. air asia india traveled from delhi to bangalore on may 23rd. one of the worst experiences i have had. we boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. as a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. when some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. the crew was inexperienced. they had no idea about how to handle the situation. i think air asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network. my flight was from sydney to kuala lumpur on 30 march 2015 at 11.55am. at about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. we didnt board until after 3pm. many of us would miss connecting flights i was told that i would be informed about my new connection in kuala lumpur. we arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. after an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. we waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. after midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were nonexistent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. we hadnt had food or water served for about five hours by this time. one staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. a group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldnt get them rooms. airasia staff then left us. i for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage i had no malaysian currency to buy food because i was only in transit. no one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one airasia staff member apologised. apparently this level of service is acceptable. i would never book with them again as its a false economy you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong airasia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own. i flew them on aug 5 in the evening. the flight was supposed to be at 8pm but it was delayed to 9.45pm without any explanation. finally we boarded around 10pm and we left 30 minutes later. the only compensation was a tiny piece of banana and chocolate cake and a small bottle of water. the flight was quiet but the seat is very small. other problem everybody was sleeping on the flight but they kept the lights on full during the 1.5 hour flight.  my wife and i had to fly them 3 times on a recent trip to indonesia and wouldnt go near them again. on the first flight even though we booked together and checked in together we found we were sitting in opposite ends of the plane. on the next flight we paid more online so we could sit next to each other only to be told after waiting an hour and a half to check in that we werent sitting next to each other and to pay another 50. i explained we had already paid for this and showed proof it fell on deaf ears and we still had to pay the extra fee. our bag was 1.5 kg over weight so they stung us for that. on all 3 flights we could not hear a word they said over the intercom onboard the flights.  check in at surabaya airport was good and smooth boarding schedule time 11.55 actually we boarded at 13.00.  flight attendant was friendly sales onboard was good. the food very good tasty i ate chicken sauce philippines style and chicken hainan but the hainan tasty was not good for me. orange juice from pulpy orange coca cola product. baggage delivery needed long time. terrible customer service. airasia cancelled my flight at 16 hours notice and offered a replacement on a different day. this obviously meant i had to rebook on a different airline at short notice to get a ticket on the correct day which cost me a lot of money. getting a refund is impossible because there is no one to speak to who will offer to help on this issue even though it seems to be quite common. i keep getting told to send a tweet or go to an online chat forum which simply never works. i bought a premium flex ticket kuldpskul due to depart kul at 1820. the afternoon i was leaving london to get to kul i received a message advising the flight had been rescheduled to a 1405 departure time 4hrs 15mins earlier. my flight from london was due to land at 1520 so there was no way i would make it. because of the time change i had to call airasia in indonesia and explained the situation. there was a later flight showing available online departing at 2020 and asked to be moved on to that. was put on hold for a long time to be advised they would have to charge me to do that and that i should try at kul airport to change for free. upon arrival in kl the later flight was full and was advised i was rebooked at 1030 the next morning. also flew dpskullgk  had to wait 45 mins for bags to arrive in kl and check in again. air asias online system wouldnt let me do kuldpskullgkkul as 1 booking  so had to make separate bookings and the handling agent in dps couldnt thru check my luggage to lgk. dpskul three passengers upgraded themselves to premium seats and the crew didnt move them back to their original seats. lgkkul crew didnt even leave the galley  no service at all  they blamed the turbulence even when the captain announced it was a smooth flight. good value for money but awful customer service.  i booked premium flex with airasia from cgk to kul which were the best seats available on this flight and considerably more than economy. the price includes a meal which i did not particularly want neither did the two people travelling with me. however a meal came with the flight  i was not impressed with the plastic spoon and fork to eat it with or having to pay extra for a cup of tea. premium flex promises priority check in and boarding at jakarta there was priority check in but not boarding and boarding was the usual mad rush. on return flight there was no priority check in or priority boarding. as far as i am concerned i was missold these tickets. i tried airasia just to see what they were like as i normally use other airlines and i fly very often many thousands of miles but will never use them again. the airasia flight we were supposed to board came in 2 hours late because of bad weather. apart from this delay we were made to wait another 2 hours because there was no crew i can understand the weather delay although that could have been mitigated by ensuring a longer gap in between the landing time and take off time of a particular flight but the nonavailability of crew is inexcusable further they decided to commence boarding of the next flight before us.  flew airasia from siem reap to melbourne via kuala lumpur. every flight to get to and from our final destinations were delayed causing us to miss our connecting flight and having to be put on one 10 hours later with no offer of hospitality we had to ask for a hotel to get some sleep and the assistant then took 2 hours to actually walk us to this hotel. when it was time to fly our flight yet again was delayed and our gates were changed without notification forcing us to run from from one end of the airport to another the flight attendants were unfriendly and to finish it off our bags were lost.  flights from perthkl then kl to bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. the rest were very disappointing. even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets. we were subject to attitude from staff when we complained about the chewing gum over our table dried vomit over the back of the seats in front of us and the accompanying smell. we were eventually moved. a toilet door broke because it wouldnt shut people sitting adjacent had to put up with the chemical smell. our preordered meals werent served to us. fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. since air asia introduced web checkin the problem has started. my flight was to chennai i did web checkin and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. however the baggage drop off area was total chaos people were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. i waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for chennai only and i managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and i boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. this has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate checkin counters there were no issue. bkkpenang return. asked and paid for assistance as have problems walking and needed a wheelchair. had a chair on the outward trip as far as the bus then left to struggle on and off the bus on my own and to climb up to the aircraft. at penang airport had chair but had to walk up 2 flights of steps. the return was not too bad till got to bangkok  no chair waiting the air hostess tried to ring for a chair but nobody answered the phone. had to walk whole way through the airport with great difficulty and then collect my luggage. by the time i got to arrivals to meet my daughter i could hardly walk and was in a great deal of pain. will never travel air asia again alone. perth to kul. my elderly mother paid extra to travel premium economy  what a waste on both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers  everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them we had originally booked flights leaving perth midafternoon and today i was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight. no sign of any compensation nothing but a note in the email to say that we hope it wont inconvenience you in any way my family and i flew bkkkul kulsyd. awful experience staff were rude no attention from flight attendants whatsoever. seating space limited on both flights. have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers. this is a bad bus service. on my travel bkkccu the checkin lines were ridiculous with attendants weighing every piece of baggage. not sure if the web checkin works as i still had to stand in a long line for over 75 minutes to hand in baggage. the flight itself was fine seats seemed like they were for kids. attendants seem inexperienced and lack manners. our flight kulsgn was forced to return due to a tropical storm in sgn. that was unavoidable so we accepted that we had no choice. however on return to the lcct the absence of senior staff and the overall treatment of all passengers was appalling. passengers were left to fend for themselves and there was a disgraceful lack of communication my wife and i had to make our own way through immigration to try to find a hotel room. staff seemed confused and leaderless. bkkkul kulhkt bkkhkt. had booked for my girlfriend and myself to fly from bkkhkt but had to change plans and flew bkkkul and kulhkt later on. fast checkin at suvarnabhumi at selfcheckin terminals but extremely slow baggage dropoff flights were acceptable considering the reasonably low prices. no attention from flight attendants whatsoever. seating space limited on both flights. have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers. sydkul then kulsyd. paid for full premium seats plus meals. before leaving sydney i called air asia to purchase my inflight entertainment and was advised that due to my seat being a premium seat it came as a package. as expected was not the case when i got on the plane disappointing 8 hrs for the flight back i was advised that there were no entertainment units left to prepurchase and every plane was only allocated 10 i can see value in economy but not in premiumbusiness class. we flew from sydney to bangkok and then from phuket to sydney. staff were so rude and were unable to answer any questions. there was no inflight entertainment. if you wanted entertainment you had to pay extra for ebooks. however there were none available on our flight. even people who had prebooked them couldnt get them because they were out. there were 3 of us travelling and we did not get seated together even though we checked in together. a family on our flight were also separated. our flights were delayed also. i will never fly them again. pay the extra money and go with another company. flight from subbkkhktbkk and kulsub. the service was very bad and the crew very rude. i flew to bangkok and then phuket and always got a seat that couldnt recline because the button was broken seat pitch was also very bad. the low cost carrier terminal in kuala lumpur was very bad ground crew very rude to passengers. dont use this airline youll be very disappointed with its service crew and much more. we flew from sgnbkk return in june 2012. i flew air asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. how things have changed it seems air asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. i can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you 11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motionsickness being denied a window seat is a blatant ripoff. your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you dont like it then you pay 11 to change it. in bangkok i tried to call air asias office 3 times but each call dropped out while i was waiting to speak to someone. the old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. my carryon wheeled backpack weighs 3kg so that means i can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before i exceed the weight limit. if you book online checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you uncheck them. boarding in bkk was a case of first rush first aboard. the flight itself was fine but the entire air asia experience leaves a lot to be desired. subbkk then bkkhktbkk and last kulsub. the crew was impolite and unfriendly. when onboard from sub to bkk and kul to sub i always found that my seat couldnt recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. when i was in the lcc terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. this airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. airasia really disappointed me. flew from kulbki on 27 may 2012. service is awful. no direction whatsoever from the ground staff. queue system was a disaster as theres no indication of which line to go to. the monitor didnt help at all and i have a couple going to kch queuing in front of me and a group going to kuantan behind me. what a mess. the staff at the checkin was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. end up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle. my flight end up with 2 passengers to johor and it took them 40 minutes to find that out. singapore  miri miri  kul. cabin staff were more interested in themselves and each other than actually doing anything vaguely like serving passengers. a smile from half way across the cabin isnt service it is nice but that is all. the only good thing about airasia is the price. there was not even cabin staff ensuring passengers stored their bags for take off and landing properly. flight from kulhan was on time. the check in was smooth through until boarding. aircrafts parked far away from our boarding gate. we walked more than 300 metres. seat comfort and leg room are extremely poor. staff were nice. however on our return trip from hanoi a male crew was standing like a poster man. neither instructed to ease the boarding flow nor helping a nanny who was holding her grandson to stow her hand luggage. low cost airline shouldnt mean low cost in assisting passengers who need help. 3 hours delay on the flight jakartasingapore. no information about what is going on delaying every half an hour. horrible customer attention service is awful. booked a return flight from bangkok to krabi with my wife. she was 27 weeks pregnant and we confirmed with air asia before flying that nothing special was required. we flew to krabi and all was perfect. on the way back we were seated onboard for 5 minutes when a crew member asked us to leave the plane as we did not have any authorization to fly. we were left at 8.30pm in the empty airport with no solution for us to go back home. luckily we could take a thai airways flight home. following the below review of our trip from tokyosapporo the return flight sapporotokyo was cancelled leaving us with the option of travelling the following day or getting a refund. to give a refund is to shirk responsibility. anyway i suppose lowcost travel is fine provided nothing goes wrong. if it does youre completely stuck at a foreign airport. overall the cheap experience from beginning to end is probably not worth it unless youre desperate to save 50 on the ticket price at the purchase stage. we will certainly not be using lowcost air travel again if it can possibly be helped. our flight was diverted on the way to phuket and we were dumped in bangkok at midnight with no information let alone a hotel. over 200 passengers were forced to fight for 8 available hotel rooms that they had to pay for themselves. after over a 12 hour wait the flight then boarded again but was then further delayed as they had messed up the luggage getting to the plane. it ended up with bags on the tarmac and passengers pointing out the windows to their bags. the staff were downright rude and refused to even provide a drink. bandung to pekanbaru on 9th december. at the time i bought the tickets scheduled for 3.40 pm but 3 days prior to departure the schedule suddenly changed to 5.35 am. a very disappointing change. i am unhappy that air asias transfer to don muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from bangkoks main airport at suvanabumhi. the delays are the same  from the check in counters to the flight departures. last week i waited 1 hour in the check in line  unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. changing from bangkoks main airport was supposed to improve all these things. also transferring from don muang to survanabumhi where all the other airlines leave from takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht incl. 3 tolls. it is just not worth using air asia in thailand at all their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint. this airline makes changes to suit itself and save money but never makes changes for its customers. flight ak1441 from hanoi to kuala lumpur. booking and flight document indicated departure of 21.00 vietnam time and arrival 23.15pm malaysia time with no delay in departure time. arrived kuala lumpur at 01.15 the next day without any transit only to find out later that an added 2hrs flight is due to inconsistency in flight details generated by airlines system against actual flight duration. ample of residual consequences including airport pickup charter and hotel booking arising with the timing mistake made by the airlines system. flew from sydkul return. was quite happy with them on the first leg apart from the poor airport at lcct on the return leg they changed the rules for cabin baggage denying both of us a second carrier bag allowed onboard. very disappointing and rude ground staff. very poor organisation. on the same flight staff failed to secure toilet doors before takeoff so they swung open abruptly. id avoid flying them again. in the last month my husband and i went on 4 air asia flights. it was a mixed experience. the inflight entertainment is very limited. whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. we paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. but on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy. an experience which has really left a very poor taste in my mouth was having a check in lady be very rude and abrupt with my husband. i used air asia to fly back to australia from vietnam where i now live. on the kl to gold coast leg i went to buy a meal using vietnam dong and was refused service as they dont accept this currency. they also would not accept a credit card hence i was looking at an 8 hour flight with no food or water. it took a lot of complaining for the staff to give me a single 250 ml bottle of water to last me the entire flight i had to get to talk to the head steward as the others simply walked away from me and refused to offer anything whatsoever. the cabin crew completely ignored me after that and could not have cared less about my situation. i will never use this carrier again. melbourne  chiang mai return. plane was a little late leaving chiang mai and due to congestion our plane landed at the international airport  presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. arrived at air asia terminal over 3 hours late. the air asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. about 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport  the desk for wheelchair service. over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. no food offered and no information given. eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel  no towels in room no drinking water. to bed at 2am no food. minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault. flights were on time and thats about the only good thing ive experienced with this airline. throughout my southeast asia journey i flew air asia 4 times and each time had a terrible time booking and then with customer service. their website is a hassle to navigate and there is so many extra fees they randomly cancel flights and rebook you without checking then when you have to rebook that flight the website doesnt work and there are no phone numbers to be found. they say they can only help you through live chat but it never works. at one point we resorted to going to the airport and talking to them where they admitted they had read out emails and just did not reply. ive never seen an airline less flyer friendly. good thing theyre cheap. never flying air asia again. kulcmb cmbkul. flight time to cmb was changed to 6 hours later and return flight to kul was cancelled. no refund given. had to fly mas to kul. march 9 2013. dmkkul ak1941. march 12 2013 kuldmk fd2916. you cannot expect much from a low cost airline but air asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 usd supplement for their red seats where you have more knee space although the difference is nominal but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. but what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair 3 usd per use amounting to 12 usd for a round trip to make money from handicapped people is a novelty. subkulhktcnxkulsub. subkul flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on eidl fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. once we arrived in kl we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the lcct. flights to and within thailand were pleasant and punctual. evening flight from phuket to chiang mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. in chiang mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. we were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in kl on the way back to surabaya because the flights were booked under different booking codes. note that there is no way to book ak and qz flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about not paying a transfer fee and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. we took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. i am not going to fly air asia again unless i have no other choice. perkuldmk. booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminderconfirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours  no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departurearrival times. arrival at dmk bangkok would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. no option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. chaotic checkin at dmk under staffed 1 hour just waiting to checkin not good enough especially when its a premium ticket they claim dedicated checkin for premium but no such counter exists. at the end of it all total cost was more than 100 more each than original quote on find flights result page. i have traveled this airline twice. while their inflight service is average i found other aspects to be quite awful. i travel extensively across us europe and asia so have a good basis of comparison. if there is a problem  dont expect any competent problem solving. ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. first time i traveled my flight from phuket to bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. on a recent flight from siem reap to denpasar via kuala lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through kl  you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. they have no transit facilities at their hub in kl. the website clearly states they have through transit facilities  to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. so that is the other problem  their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. their terminal in kl is awful  it makes a greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. there is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. if you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. there is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you cant check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure  so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. i have taken my last flight on airasia  it is truly the worst airline i have flown. the inflight service however is ok given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever  you will pay for everything including water. it isnt low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like thai airways. their services from ground to inflight staff were inefficient. kolhkt 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. bangkok phuket being a short haul flight i skipped the seat selection my biggest mistake. i told the lady at the check in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. all 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. upon boarding i wasnt going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. a stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. i saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. the seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. air asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.they claimed that they did try to contact me. at the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. there were so we rushed to checkin luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. we had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. we struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time i had preselected seats with the original flight. we also had prebooked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldnt serve us any meal. air asia in bangkok lands at don muang airport and not the suvarnabhumi. the difference in two is that the don muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline. delayed more than 3 hours on flight to bali from kuala lumpur on 9 jan 2014. although the ground staff knew about the delay in advance they failed to inform the passengers early  not only were we not informed at check in counter but only 1 hour prior scheduled take off time when we were at the gate. the airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. no embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. air asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. terrible experience. airasia failed to get me cgkjkt on christmas eve. all they offered was flight to sydney and melbourne  and make your own way there. couldnt offer me a direct flight for 48 hours from kul although mas had spare seats. airasia indonesia. subcgk. overall the trip was good. the cabin crews were polite. but the staff service wasnt very good when i entered the boarding gate the staff hasnt placed the airport tax thing behind the boarding pass although we had paid to her. because of that we should wait for minutes before boarding the aircraft. i flew to singapore from sydney with air asia last week. i regret flying with aa. preordered meals were of very poor quality. there was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase  only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. the flight was freezing cold and i had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. no credit cards are accepted on board. if you pay in dollars balance is paid in myr another rip off there were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in kl to get a aerial view of kl. many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. the children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in hot seats. i thought the way they said was quite rude. the flight attendants speak little english. they are careless. i think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as qantas economy. airasia flight from singapore to kuala lumpur on 26 january it was a short full flight and boarding was quick. legroom fine and comfortable at seat 23a crew looks tired and wanted to finish their duty quickly. i did not hear the pilot make any announcement regarding the flight path etc. if it was not the perfect flight schedule selection for this route i would not fly with them tentatively. da nang to kuala lumpur with airasia. got to check in after listening to at least five other passengers have a variety of arguments to start our discussion. the system allocates seats automatically. we are a couple that booked together and the system had us at opposite ends of the plane and the only way to change this is to pay  and surprisingly the only seats available were the most expensive ones. so another 24usd to be paid. this is obviously done to generate another income stream. flew with airasia from johor baharu to bangkok don muang airport. smooth check in because i had already checked in at bangkok dmk airport and printed the boarding pass there because my route on 8 jan was dmksin  jhbdmk. the price of this route was very cheap. prebooked meal was vegetarian ginger fried rice and vegetable biryani. for me vegetable biryani was not ideal but it was tasty. arrived early in dmk airport.  we got delayed 6 hours from cebu to manila. while waiting passengers were left in the dark for several hours since there was no ground staff in sight the flight even disappeared from the main schedule board for a very long time. after almost five hours of waiting a fellow passenger called the airline directly and finally someone showed up at the gate. the so called airasia representative was pretty much worthless in terms of knowing when we would leave. the only way i found out was by visiting the global flight status website which had all correct and updated information i am aware this is a low cost airline however i rather pay more and indeed get some service. will never use them again. flew from hong kong to phuket on airasia. my first and last flight with them. a very unplesant experience overall long and slow baggage dropoff process flight delayed most unconfortable old and tight seats. food and beverage only with cash as they accept no credit cards. they dont even give you a glass of water for free. they are cheap yes but if you look at what you get they are actually extremely expensive. kuala lumpur to tawau. air asia is a low cost airlines but their ticket is not always low cost tickets expensive especially the festival period. but i will still choose air asia as my primary airline because it is cheaper compare to another airlines. the experience to fly with air asia is not so good when the flight is more than 2 hours because of their bad design of seats. we booked a round trip domestic flight with airasia philippines from manila to cebu in february. our first flight was delayed by 45 minutes at first then delayed again with no known departure time. luckily we only had to wait about 30 more minutes before we began boarding. however the second delay was not reported to flight status sites.  the return flight isnt going much better. it was delayed for an hour and a half already. fingers crossed it doesnt get delayed a second time.  airasia from denpasar to singapore the flight i took was qz502 even though the flight was late it was no fault of the airline. the pilot did a great job of getting us there on time even though we were late in departing by an hour we reached only 20 minutes late so a great effort. the cabin crew were gossiping at the end of the aircraft but what you pay is what you get so no complaints on that. all in all great value for money.    flew three sectors in total with airasia. booked online and checked in online well in advance. we were not seated together but expected to pay a fee to be seated together for two of the sectors. i booked 30 kgs of baggage as there is no free allowance for all three sectors but they only allowed me 20 kgs and wanted extra excess baggage fee. their scales at kbv registered 5kgs more than the scales at dmg. seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how i was feeling. safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. money before safety. third sector was late departing but no apology. there are cheaper alternatives if you look around. i am a regular flyer and this was possibly one of the worst experiences.    had a flight from yangon to siem reap via bangkok with airasia. found out at check in that a bag fee 36 per leg of the trip  72 in total for a small bag that ive been able to carry on all other international flights. our seats had virtually no leg space it was quite uncomfortable and i am only 57. they only had the option to buy meals and i could not get water or any other drink without paying an additional fee we asked for water and they smiled and shook their head but they gladly made several trips down the aisle trying to sell teddy bears perfume etc.  kuala lumpur to gold coast with airasia as a single parent with two young children 5 & 3. received the boarding passes which revealed i was sitting across the isle from my children. tried to have all three of us sitting together. unfortunately this did not happen and airasia staff said this was fine. my recommendation is to pay the extra dollars and allocate your own seating with this airline. i flew with airasia from phonm penh to phuket via bangkok and nothing positive to say about this airline. seating with minimal leg room and they charge for water. the inside of the aircraft is plastered with advertising for one brand of jeans or another. there is no lumbar support in the seats and for tall people the headrest is in the middle of your back. the extra charges apply to everything and baggage is expensive. by the time you add in all of the extras might as well fly with a full far carrier. i will never fly again.   bangkok to krabi. dont bother flying with airasia. sent me a text saying they have changed my flight time. they didnt bother sending an email with any more details to resolve it. when i spoke to their customer services they refused to help  they have a policy that if they have changed the flight time to within 3 hours of the original time they wont offer a refund. not great when you picked a specific flight time to suit you  i.e. after a tour has finishedleaving enough time to check into the hotel. means i have to pay for another flight with another airline i might as well have thrown my money in the bin.    flew sydney to yangon via kuala lumpur. ok airasia is a budget airline no trouble. unless you have no money on you and no water you are in trouble. everything here has a price ticket which was absolutely ridiculous on a 13 hour flight since when do we have to pay for a human right water. the leg space was so little that my partner got cramps in his legs he is nearly 2 meters and even i 1.65m was struggling being comfortable. beside the lack of space the staff were unfriendly rude and didnt seem to be interested in their job at all. there was no onboardentertainement and the checkin at sydney airport took nearly 2 hours. yes that is correct we stood 2 hours in line to check in. another reason why we would not choose airasia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning while most people were trying to sleep. this broke us up as we were so tired but couldnt sleep because of the lights. all in all we wouldnt fly airasia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves as the groundstaff were very slow. we had similair problems a month later when we flew from yangon to bangkok the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. we were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadnt even left the plane secondly because of the lack of legspace it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.\\r\\r\\n    chengdu to denpasar via kuala lumpur. most ridiculous flight ive ever experienced. flying with two adults an infant on lap and a two year old child. at airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination but couldnt print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. at transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart  including our two year old. told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. on board told no that was the policy and we couldnt change seats. obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight finally agreed could ask other passengers if theyd mind swapping. couldnt wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding  hed have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. in case you havent met a two year old getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and i imagine youd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us. will not be flying air asia again am amazed that their policy of two year olds sitting on their own is even legal.    bali to perth with airasia indonesia. it was my first time flying on airasia. unfortunately i did not have a great experience. this is because throughout the entire flight two little kids kept grabbing the top of my seat like little monkeys. when they werent dangling from my seat or my boyfriends seat they were kicking our seats for 4hours. the odd thing was that these kids did not seem to have a seat of their own and were either sitting on their parents lap or torturing my boyfriend and i. i dont know that i can fault the airline for this as we never voiced to the flight attendent what was going on. on a side note i thought the airline provided plenty of decent looking food and beverage options.    flew airasia from denpasar to perth. had booked red carpet to eliminate queues through security immigration and passport control and it did work very well including access to a very good lounge. the whole thing was ruined by imposition of a fingertip search of cabin baggage  30 minutes in the queue. airasia  we approve the need for security measures but you must provide those who have paid for red carpet to receive the benefits they paid for.   airasia offer four flights a day to singapore from bali indonesia. unfortunately it is difficult to rely on any flight time as they have started consolidating flights to fill planes. my booking for the earliest flight was to allow time to take my daughter to singapore for her 21st birthday. first flight in last flight out would give us 12 hours in singapore. 2 days before the flight to singapore airasia resheduled it ok fair enough it was only by 2 hours. but then 6 hours before the flight they rescheduled it again by 3 hours. then to add insult to injury the rescheduled flight was also delayed by 50 minutes. we finally got to singapore but our entire whole day shopping trip turned into only 3 hours. why offer such an extensive array of flights you have no intention to fulfil airasia have lost all credibility   surat thani to kuala lumpur. airasia has to be one of the all around worst airlines i have ever flown. i dont write reviews this is the first. i travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. it takes a little effort to get me annoyed. their website doesnt work very well. it constantly kicks you off. the website wont take any of my visa cards. because of this i am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. some flights include a checked bag others dont. so if their website doesnt work and you cant pay in advance you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. inflight service is rude and narrow minded. for example i booked meal service for a flight in february 2017 from bangkok to hanoi. i ordered a coffee in advance however after traveling all night i decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. i asked for a water and was told no you must have coffee because it is what you ordered. i said okay ill pay for the water. staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. i was not rude i was not demanding but was treated very poorly. i ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. this was not an isolated incident. similar things have happened to me before and i seen it happen to many others. maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where i come from but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. being kind courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. unfortunately there is no recourse for me. they dont care. they are so big it will be hard to avoid them in the future but ill will do my best to use other airlines.    singapore to kuala lumpur. worst budget airline flights i have taken the ground staff and cabin crew were rude.  not consistent with safety checks. some people where allowed to continue to use their phones some were watched whilst they turned them off.     kuala lumpur to singapore. how come air asia could have won an award for best low cost airline took 4 air asia flights across the weekend none were on time. now my last flight to come back to singapore is announced on last minute with more than 1h 30mins delay supposing a technical issue. staff disappeared and screen even not updated. this is a poor experience and the lower one i have experienced in asia. does it worth to waste time and money when again in theory you caught a good ticket fare.    ho chi minh city to sydney via kuala lumpur with airasia. i have to say this was the worst travel experience i have had. we bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. on the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to sydney via kuala lumpur then connecting flight to ho chi minh city and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. when arriving at sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the kuala lumpur flight and also the ho chi minh city flight at the same time. on the way back different story. they said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. so in kl we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. many times i have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and i dont drink caffeine. i usually just ask them if i can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and i add my own decaf coffee.  i got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk powdered for free and that if i asked on another flight for this that i might be told to pay for a drink. there is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a lowcost airline. when you  pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in malaysian currency or credit card. then if you dont have credit card you cant purchase anything. fortunately i had some us dollars in cash and they made a quick conversion and i paid in that for my items.     hanoi to bangkok. they offer cheap flights but tack on a bunch of other costs. i tried to get the website to allow me to select baggage but it did not work. when i tried to call the phone number they provide for the vietnam office it did not go through. as a result i was charged 40usd to check a 15kg bag. the staff was rude and unaccommodating.  this may just be a problem with air asia in hanoi. aside from the booking process. they do not provide free water let alone snacks on flights as a lowcost airline.     kuala lumpur to malé return. my very first flight ak 72 was considerably okay but the return was terrible. both female flight attendants were rude discourteous when they served the food. one of them nudged me hard to fasten my seatbelt in the middle of the flight due to turbulence. no please or excuse me just a rough nudge. the male attendants were nice and were trying to do a good job.    kuala lumpur to krabi. we booked our flights online and our reservation was changed by airasia without notice. they changed the time of the flights changed the bagages allowances etc. that caused a big problem at male airport in maldives where the staff was especially not collaborating and unfriendly. we have big the victimes of their unfair online system as still had to pay the price for this. booking on airasia is like playing russian roulette. i started my trip at krabi airport where my 22 kg bag was accepted as a 20 kg check in bag. then the same bag wasnt accepted in kuala lumpur and i have to waste 10 minutes and make the queue even worst to take out things from my bag. on the way back from the trip same problem at the cebu airport. you can take 25 kg  carry on bags without paying a check in bag while people like me who try to respect the check in system are just treated rudely for 2 kg in excess.    this is my return flight from labuan to kuala lumpur. airasia pride themselves as a low cost airline and indeed the fares are very low. however yet another delayed flight. no wifi in the aircraft. airasia is very strict with carry on cabin baggagge. they will count and weigh every piece of bag. nothing special about this airline.    i was travelling from bali to hong kong where i had to transfer at kl. i only had a cabin size suitcase and a drawstring backpack with me. i have been travelling with airasia many times in the past due to the its competitive price even though the seats are uncomfortable but i dont mind it for short hauls. i have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. so size wise i know my suitcase is definitely fine. for my drawstring backpack anyone who has one knows you cant really put much in it. i only had my personal documents in the bag plus a jacket to use while on the flight. after i finished checking in a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. the total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg the total permitted weight is 7kg for airasia. this is exactly what i came with perhaps less. i threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. they weighed my luggage on my outward flights i cant remember the total weight for that but they let me through but gave me a little advice to make sure i was within limit the next time. however on my return flight this guy did not let me through he took my boarding pass away even when i told him i was running late i only had less than 10min left before boarding time he said i had to check in my suitcase. so i had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again after all this messing around my suitcase was finally ready for checking it and i was charged idr 800k for that my flight was only idr 1380400 i could have pay a little bit more and flew with cathay which comes with 20kg checkin luggage a much comfier journey with entertainment plus direct flight. what really annoyed me was that after i went to the other side at the boarding gate i saw so many people with oversized luggage. i spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint but they ignored me. as soon as i landed i sent an email to airasia to make this complaint there were a lot of emails back and forth but they were not willing to do anything about it. im fine if they want to follow their rules strictly but please make sure its consistent.    our booking from kuala lumpur to kota kinabalu was for 17h30 got email that delay until 19.30. checked in 16.30 and went to departure area. by 19h00 notification of another 1hr delay. 20h45 no official communication but flight staff member informed us that entire flight crew for our flight had been rerouted to another flight. all airasia staff disappeared and at 21h00 an announcement over public address system informed us that flight was delayed until 02h40. at customer service cubical in departues there was one airasia person with a queue of at least 50 customers waiting to be served. we then went home no point staying in kk for 30 hrs as our return flight was at 15h00 on sunday    one of our passengers wanted to upgrade to the emergency upgrade seats. for two days before the actual travel date we could neither reach the airasia listed telephone no nor could we relogin. after boarding the flight we saw a vacant seat and offered to pay but we were not allowed. same thing happened on the way back from bali. neither the online checkin works nor the telephone no. customer service is nonexistent. there is no airasia counter in kl airport for the service of en route passengers. even water is not served which is being too stingy. the a320s flying to india are too cramped. on the way back from bali to kl we were unfortunate to get the last row seats. besides the constant sound of the toilet flush the cabin crew who did not have much work were chatting away at the top of their voices like excited school children. flights were late by minimum 1 hour on all four legs. overall one of the lousiest flights that we have travelled. no professionalism at all.    hong kong to male via kuala lumpur. horrible experience with airasia.  we suffered a delay of 2 hours so we lost the conexion flight and after long time and queues we were rescheduled 24 hours later. we were provided a horrible hotel voucher and received very poor attention.   airasia is by far the worst airline experience ive ever had. i had four airasia flights in the last week for my trip to malaysia kuala lumpur and penang and back to changsha three of which were delayed. the ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. on the first 2 flights the staff were unfriendly. on the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. there is no unity among the airline. every airport has a different request. airasia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. checked bags food and drinks are all an extra cost. passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. people were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. the chairs are quite uncomfortable when it was time for landing i didnt even realize my seat was reclined. many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable. i would rather pay for a more expensive flight than take airasia again.    flew chiang mai to kuala lumpur. airasia are cheap but thats all they have going for them. the experience i have with them is as follows deceptive  they add lots of charges and its hard to navigate their online system to avoid the extra fees. website crashes  as said above their site is tricky to navigate. i think its deliberate to trick you into buying extras you dont want and to gain revenue from inadvertent double bookings of flights. customer service  there is none of this at airasia. none. ziltch. i asked for help and they arrogantly didnt listen instead just threw policy or rules at me. there is no compassion no fairness nothing. just everything their way. they wont even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. unfair and unjust. small seating  the seats are too small for taller people. i hate that. i will never book an air asia ticket again. instead ill go scoot or jetstar  these companies have a heart and actually care about service.   among the worse airline in all respects. terrible website nonexistent customer service indifferent staff horrible oily food and constant delays on most domestic and regional flights. and it has been getting worse with each passing year. hardly remember a domestic flight in malaysia which departed or reached on time.    air asia 11.35 flight from bangalore to delhi is delayed for the second consecutive time we have used them. all the time they give same reason incoming aircraft delayed. fed up with this airline would be better changing the flight time to stop wasting passengers time.    singapore to bali. first and last time traveling with this airline. we paid double the fare to board ourselves to a later flight in the day due to arriving late at airport. the checkin staff assured us to board us onto the next flight. the price difference is nothing short of predatory pricing. airasia insists on an allin tix plus luggage overweight charges airport taxes and everything else. fine we did as per their recommendation and waited 2 hours to the next flight. but the airline delays an extra 2 hours this is only a 2 hours flight and our first day of the vacation is almost over. do yourself a favor and book tigerscoot next time.     penang to bangkok via medan with air asia indonesia. this was my second worst flight experience ever. it is absurd that they do not offer fly thru service for international flight connections. it is absurd how small the pitch is between seats. it is absurd they will fill up an a320 with no one in the exit rows because that costs extra and kick a passenger who relocated there during the flight how many advertisements are in the plane and that after collecting our baggage and passing through customs simply to catch a connecting flight the checkin agent insisted i pay cash for an outrageous overweight bag fee because he didnt feel like entering my credit card information into the computer. this is 2017 i can pay anyone for lunch with venmo but paying a major airline for a fee is difficult are you kidding me it is absurd they woke me up to hand me a meal which i did not order only to realize that the meal was for someone else so they took the meal away.  wifi on plane advertised but doesnt work. seat entertainment not on any planes. t   shantou to bangkok. with my knowledge having boarded airasia i simply lowered my expectation of inflight service to zero. beautiful flight attendants were there greeting me. the plane took off as scheduled. the meal plan i prebooked is served at a comfortable pace. they were using 2 flight attendants one is to do everything and another is just to stand there and hand out the food. i have no idea whether it is the best way of serving on board but i see many flight attendants who are serving passengers more actively. they refused my chinese money once i ordered a can of coke. i have given them 14rmb the flight attendant returned me with 2rmb and said it is too old. as a passenger i cant the control or reject the legal money given to me from a supermarket can i can they refuse legal bank notes   bali to phnom penh via kuala lumpur with airasia. in kuala lumpur there was a delay of more than 2 hours. staff and company gave zero information about the delay. moved to another gate waiting for another flight to arrive and than just before boarding gave us a bottle of water for over 2 hours of waiting. even a meal does not compensate this delay. airasia is a budget airline with next to no service. booked my ticket online and they charged me 10 for using my debit card 48. ridiculous. this amount does not show before you agree to pay. do not fly. i prefer a regular airline.    we had a trip from kochi to ho chi minh with 1 stop to kuala lumpur. both of our flights were delayed. the first one for over 1 hour and the second for over 3 hours. the seats inside the aircraft are small. we ordered something to eat inflight and most things on the catalogue were missing and the food was very little for one person and the cabin staff didnt have enough change to give you back. i will not travel with this airline again for sure.    phnom penh to kuala lumpur. i have no words to express my severe disappointment in this airline and will never fly with them again. they have no concept of customer service experience or satisfaction.    we were travelling from krabi to jakarta via bangkok and when we arrived to jakarta our luggage didnt arrive. we reported it lost at the cbto office they told us our bag was left behind in bangkok and that they were going to send it back to jakarta the next day at 3pm. we were flying back to the us next day so we couldnt claim it. it has been already 3 days since they got our luggage at cgk airport and they havent done anything to get it back to us. weve been calling them many times and they either dont answer their calls or when they answer they hang up on us or they require us to provide a report id number from the airline we flew back home so they can handover the bag to them. but its not that other airlines fault and because they dont have my luggage they cant give us a report id number. its not our fault it should be the airlines responsibility to send the luggage to us. it has been a nightmare trying to get them send our luggage. very inefficient staff in jakarta. they dont respond to our emails and dont say anything about what theyll do with the luggage.    ranchi to kolkata. they only serve food to passengers that have done the required preibooking of meals and thats it. in a short flight like this indigo cabin crew will sell food and water apart from pre booked passengers.  this is my last time.     kuala lumput to denpasar. our flight was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and atc tech issues. airasia informed us about the first delay on 1130pm the day before our 745am flight while this could have happened faster i was still able to adapt to it. after boarding we waited an other 60 min with very sparse information about why roughly in the middle of wait we were informed that there are problems with atc and at some point later we pushed back without further announcements. the seats were fine but had little comfort.  no ife or wifi available. airasia is fine for the price if everything works if you have a problem you have a big one. our return flight was rescheduled and offered to refund or rebook. i tried to rebook. to me the saving on airfare is not worth the very real possibility that you will spend a lot of energy and time being stressed by airasia messing up.   flew johor to kuala lumpur. flight delayed 3 hours 25 mins. no advance notice given the day before. very bad experience with airasia poor service not recommended. no compensation offered on flight delayed.     singapore to bali. have taken many flights with airasia which have been largely positive. my last experience i arrived late 20 minutes before departure and was prepared to be refused to board the plane. i was surprised to have to pay 3x my original fare to buy a later flight.  i could have made my original flight had i been allowed to proceed without issue initially as i had no baggage to check in etc. extremely disappointed.    vientiane to kuala lumpur via bangkok. worst flight experience i ever had. the only reason i went to the check in counter at my first leg of the flight was to see whether i was correctly checkedin since i booked through a 3rd operator. showed my boarding pass on my phone that was all fine and then they gave me a paper boarding pass. while boarding i showed my boarding pass on my phone as i had put my paper boarding pass away they acted like i was from another world having a boarding pass on my phone. they took me out of line saying paper boarding pass all taking my pasport out of my hands. then at my stopover i couldnt transfer like i normally would on connecting flights because my boarding pass had to be verified.  really inconvenient to say the least almost missed my connecting flight because of it.    flew from delhi to srinagar. airasia has always been my least preferred airline. again i regret travelling by this airline. the customer service and support is zero. i needed to take a medicine and asked for water by pressing the assistance button above our seat. the air hostess came and asked me what i needed i said water. then very conveniently she forgot that. i mean do they teach them the meaning of that button very unfortunate that such a big name has such poor quality service. thank you for giving me another reason as to why i am definitely not going to travel airasia again.    chiang mai to bali via kuala lumpur. we needed to pay close to 4000 baht just to check in our bag weighing 23 kg. when we got on the flight the seats were so close together. they expect you to pay for any sort of beverage or snack during the flight this includes water. on the way back we decided to try to skip the hidden baggage fees and pay for it online only we couldnt. every time we tried to do so we were met with the warning that their site was experiencing a glitch and that we had to do this at the airport.     on board you dont get a meal unless you buy it before hand or on board but they will refuse to serve you a glass of water. on the first occasion i have been lucky enough to get a glass of hot water on the second attempt i have been asked to buy a bottle but unless you have myr with you or a credit card you wont be able to get any water. pa s never stop on one flight i have counted 25 that drive you crazy trying to get you to buy any sort of things. you can just notice how they save and make money looking at the aircraft one of them on the inside was covered with advertisements even on the table and the hand luggage compartment. emergency doors they have two rows of seats on the immediate left and right of them the so called vip seats where for an extra 20 dollars you have extra leg space. if you are unlucky to seat on row 11 in front of them your seat will not recline and if you are tall 1.90m like my husband and someone reclines the seat in front of you you have no space for your legs.    dont recommend. originally flight from jakarta to singapore was canceled and we were rebooked 5 hours later. multiple calls to support went unanswered. no response after two days to email ticket created through their support website. no response on twitter. service desk at cgk was vacant. let the ads on the carryon overhead bins be a signal this is a bus with wings so expect all the qualities of a bus company not an airline.   bali to mumbai. my flight supposed to depart at 03.10pm on 31 march. they allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didnt inform them about the delay. once the immigration process was completed then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. now passengers dont have any option other than waiting. there wasnt any airasia executive present at the gate. we also didnt get any vegetarian food at bali airport. the airline provided food as it was delayed but they ordered nonvegetarian food only. they should have some common sense that nonvegetarian people can eat vegetarian food but vegetarian people cannot eat nonvegetarian food. most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. they promised us that they would provide vegetarian food on the flight. but when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. i really will not recommend this airasia to anyone. while going to bali from mumbai one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with airasia is different. generally 1 inr  210 idrapp. but with air asia 1 inr  100 idr. that was so pathetic. i wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. the customer support misguided me. they told me there wasnt any twin seats available in flight so i ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. and actually twin seats were there. this airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. i will not travel via air asia again even if they provide me free tickets. i will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. we should not expect more from it. it is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it. it take off from source and lands at destination. thats all. i hope this review will be valuable for all future travelers.   not even a greeting getting on the plane first time reviewer. the plethora of reviews surrounding this airline do not lie. to save time let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. positives no delays. flight arrivals were timely. unloading was fast. wifi was available for free. problems no staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. did not have malaysian currency coming from vietnam and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that i could have a bottle of water cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. decor is most budget i have seen carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stainstears in the leather seating is obvious. staff not all lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. the rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight uncomfortable seating no inflight entertainment no complimentary foodbeverages complimentary wifi was limited no power supply etc. this is a classic point a to point b service which was delivered. however there is budget flying and then there is air asia budget flying. do not recommend.    my flight timing was changed from 2pm to 8.45am for 1st of april for surabaya to kuala lumpur.  i was given the option for a full refund if the timing is not right. however i contacted them for the full refund and they never got back to me. i have been frantically trying to contact them via calls emails live chat twitter facebook since march 1. none of these methods work. there was no reply whatsoever from their customer service. ive tried calling every one of their physical office but none of the numbers work. there is no way to contact them at all.   seat and aircraft dirty and magazine is never complete. their budget ticket is quite expensive.    hong kong to phuket. i booked the premium flex ticket to get good leg room. i was advised that this type of ticket allowed me to change my flight date at an extra charge.  i needed to change my flight date more than a month before flight date. i tried for days to access my booking on airasia homepage and when the page finally allowed me to login i had correct login credentials the page just didnt work for days it said i had no booking. finally i had to call their customer service to have the flight changed instead. at customer support i explained that i needed to change my flight and was told that i had to sit on a standard seat. i asked if it could be solved. they didnt even try to have it sold but just said no. i end up with normal seat instead. i then asked for a refund since i was no longer getting what i paid for. instead i was asked to pay 1500hkd extra for the change of the flight. i had known about this rule before but i still asked for compensation due to not getting what i paid for. also i later found out that if i had booked a new ticket instead of using my return ticket the cost of the new ticket would have been 1700hkd. that is 200hkd more than the fee i had to pay for changing my return ticket but still several hundred hkd less than what i paid in upgrade for the premium flex ticket i had originally purchased.     \\r\\r\\nwe were suppose to leave on july 10th and got notice on july 6th that they had cancelled our flight and moved it back a day. the airline did not reimburse us the money we lost from our airbnb. the flight was not comfortable and the food was not good.     \\r\\r\\nmy 16yr old granddaughter and i flew back from new york as part of an iglu qm2 cruise package. booked 10 months previously.as stated on the norwegian website we expected the plane to be a boeing 78  but on receiving our flight tickets a month before departure this had changed to wamos air. the plane must have been the first 747 ever to take to the skies. our low fare plus tickets included checked in and hand luggage seat reservation and nice and tasty meal. our allocated seats were 9a and 9b before an emergency exit. there was no leg room in front of 9a meaning i could only sit with one leg crossed over the other. the seats were less comfortable than a park bench and didnt recline. seat 9c was occupied by a lady in her 60s and i am in my 70s. none of us 3 were able bodied enough to deal with an emergency evacuation. there were a few well built males  6ft ish but not fat in the cabin who had to squeeze themselves into their seats. there were no aircraft magazines fooddrinks menus no drinks or flight accessories blankets trolleys or any form of entertainment whatsoever. the nice and tasty meal was served about 2 hours before landing in a paper bag and contained a bottle of apple juice and a long refrigerated cheese and ham roll and small muffin which were cold dry and inedible. many passengers boarded with oversize hand baggage which couldnt have been weight checked taking up whole overhead compartments and making it almost impossible to close the doors. more than a dozen other bags including ours had to be crammed into the crews storage cupboard. apart from serving the paper bags this appeared to be the only 2 occasions when any crew were in attendance. the flight fulfilled not one of the expectations of a norwegian flight and if this was their first flight for any of the passengers they will surely never set foot on a plane again.   the worst experience of traveling ever they canceled my flight on the same day of departure i had to buy a very expensive last minute ticket with another airline because the very unresponsive customer service told me the next norwegian flight available would have been leaving in 15 days they didnt compensate for my monetary loss. on the return flight the ruined my luggage and they wouldnt compensate. on an 11 hrs flight from paris to los angeles they dont even offer water to people that dont buy their very expensive and unappetizing lunch avoid this airlin .    madrid to malta. the flight was first delayed by 4 hours then cancelled because they had no crew. we arrived to the hotel at 2 a.m. we were woken up early to have breakfast and go back to the airport only to inform us that perhaps the flight will be at midnight. no staff were available to talk to but only agents who knew little english. all announcements were made in spanish only and we had difficult time finding someone who could understand spanish and translate to english for us. i am still in madrid hoping to arrive home after 48 hours if lucky. flew norwegian from london gatwick to boston. my first time on a no frills airline. the air was slightly better on a 787 but the crowded plane in economy with no meal i didnt preorder the relatively high priced meal service made the flight seem almost endless. the ticket price was good but i think if i need to save that much money i would prefer to just stay home. there is no lumbar support in the seats and the planes were  full. i never got comfortable in the 7 plus hours.   oslo to amsterdam with norwegian. a delay of more than 3 hours and very bad communication. a food voucher of 110 krone but all the stores are closed except one therefore you have enough for a childs pizza. after 3 hours they finally announce a technical problem but no indication of when it will end. this is the worst customer service i ever seen.    rome to london gatwick with norwegian. perhaps the worst flying experience we have had in the last 20 years of flying with different airlines. flight was delayed at origin for more than an hour. then the staff could not have been less helpful by giving us seats at the rear of the flight even though they saw us with an infant aged 1.5 years. the cabin crew were talking and laughing so loudly inside the cabin at midnight not even realizing they were frequently waking up the sleeping baby with their nuisance. the flight lands and we were told to collect the stroller from the luggage area unlike british airways who hand it over to you right at the aircraft door making me carry the baby all the way up to luggage area nearly 2km walking and carrying the baby in my arms. in their terms sit back relax and enjoy our hospitality. avoid.\\r\\r\\n    gatwick to copenhagen return. 2.5 hours late out to copenhagen and then an hour late on the return leg. no apologies or explanation for the delay. staff didnt try and make up for the delay or offer apologies. they even tried to make me check in my luggage even though it was going under my seat.   i have flown several times recently from malaga to manchester with norwegian and everytime it has been late. usually about an hour late but even then often you are not notified until inside the airport and stuck inside. i decided to check on flightstats how many times they were late and its almost daily. on the 25th nov i had a flight back to manchester with them at 16.05pm and knew they would be late by 45minutes to 1 hour. i decided not to enter the airport on arrival at 2pm but instead just checked the monitor. to my shock they were delayed until 7pm. on asking the norwegian office they said there was a lack of crew and they needed a rest. i told him that perhaps this airline wont be around much longer as their lack of customer service and constant lateness is staggering. it makes me want to open my own business because the level of incompetence on this airline is staggering and ive flown a lot of airlines.    bangkok to stockholm. good and comfortable aircraft. food and beverage is expensive and nothing is included except water. for hot food its best to book in advance not the best food and in my opinion not worth the price.  we thought by being norwegian we were in for a great flight flying from bangkok to amsterdam but as result we started having to pay for everything which was not very clear when buying the ticket and to our biggest suprise we were not included a free meal in a 12 hour plane ride. we even had to beg for a glass of water and anything that we did end up paying came to be different. i will never take that airline and highly recommend no one does. big disappointment. i booked this as i liked the idea of paying for what i use flying from gatwick to orlando with norwegian. on the way out i ordered food which was very basic. tea was served in an ice cream type of container. on the way back i went to order a cup of tea 2.5 hrs from landing but the snack bar app was not available. i ask for tea and waited an hour but nothing came. i went to the attendant who refused to serve me tea 1.5 hours before landing. i even offered to pay. absolutely appalling never again. plane itself very good.   london gatwick to larnaca with norwegian. very poor service at boarding. about 20 passengers left behind in the lounge due to shortage of crew members. over 1 hour delay still waiting. then they started checking in hand luggage into hold from those left in the lounge. so my hand luggage is on the plane now but i cant board. i have seen some poor service before but norwegian is the worst yet.    oslo to lonyearbyen. a good airline until things go wrong. and when they go wrong you may pay a lot of money or waste a lot of time. norwegian use a lot of contractors for ground service where passenger issues are dealt with by contractors whether it is baggage or customer service at the airport or reservations. and the contractors provide whatever level of service that they want which is sometimes no service at all. if you are on a delayed flight which happens you will pay.    berlin to los angeles via gatwick. the people at the checkin desk forced us to check a small carry on bag. this despite the airline stating that it allows one carry on bag and one personal items like a briefcase or handbag. we had purposefully packed everything we couldnt lose in the bag we were planning to carry on the plane. the overofficious staff tried to say it was a security reason. when we went through security the officer was as equally puzzled by what the airline staff had said. and sure enough most people on our flight had one carry on bag same size or bigger than ours and a briefcase backpack handbag that fits under the seat in front of you. i guess they were able to check in online and bypass the nasty ground staff. for some reason norwegian wouldnt let us check in online maybe because we have a connection to a us flight. the thing that was also troubling is that norwegian uses the same ground services company for luggage as the one that lost our suitcase several days prior. i have never had such a problem on other european airlines nor on us airlines. lastly we are connecting onto a flight to the us and booked the premium cabin norwegians discount business. however they still nickel and dimed us on the connecting flight charging for water. lastly why do they have their checkin at terminal d but then make you walk to the opposite side of terminal a for their gates at sxf and then make you take a bus to the plane when changing planes at lgw they tell you you have to be at the gate 120 before the flight time. this is also ridiculous. it doesnt take that long to board an airplane.    this was the worst flight experience i have ever had. on arriving at the airport the flight itself was delayed 2 hours then 4 hours then 6 hours and ultimately was over 9 hours delayed by the time it left the gate. the flight was originally scheduled to leave at 2230 jan 8th with everyone for the flight was already at the airport by the time the delays began meaning that we spent approx. 10 hours in the airport overnight with the flight eventually taking off after 6 am jan 9th. it was nice of the airline to offer everyone a 15 meal voucher to be used in the airport for our 9 hour delay but what they chose not to share as they were handing these out was that there was not a single restaurant or snack bar open in jfk terminal 1 at that time making these vouchers useless. there was no communication from the ground staff of the airline at all and around 1230 am the single norwegian agent left the gate desk and did not reappear until boarding was scheduled to begin effectively escaping any accountability or communication to the 300 stranded passengers. in fact around 2am the flight listing itself was removed from both the airport departure screens and the norwegian flight status tracker on their website leaving the 300 passengers searching for any agent to provide information as to whether the flight had been cancelled. from the norwegian website i could see that our incoming flight from oslo was scheduled to depart oslo at 6pm local time noon in new york and was itself delayed by 8 hours. it became abundantly clear that norwegian failed to alert passengers on our flight of this delay and chose to inform us of the delay in 12 hour increments once we were all already at the airport in order to avoid any associated financial liability to provide passengers for hotel accommodations meals rebooking etc due to the delay. given i had family i could stay with in the nyc area upon learning of the first 2 hour delay i called the airlines customer service line to be moved to the flight the next day instead and avoid any prolonged stay in the airport. i was told by the agent that although the delay allowed me to rebook on another norwegian flight free of charge the airline was not permitting passengers from our delayed flight to rebook onto another flight until 2 days later. when i inquired if this was because the flights over the next two days were full or because we werent allowed to be moved to the next days flight the agent confusingly was unable to confirm one way or the other. additionally once we were finally on the flight the plane itself was a disaster and had not been cleaned. in our new 787 plane the seats were filthy there were napkins stuffed in the ceiling above many of the seats in our area and the ceiling panelling was cracked.    norwegian is alright if all goes well and if the flight is on time. we occasionally have problems with delays or cancelled flights and then the travel becomes a nightmare. on the last particular occasion the flight from barcelona to stockholm was over 10 hours late. we received the information via sms. however when we try to contact the airline or to ask questions about a refund it is very difficult. the telephone queues are very very long and it is impossible to know if we are getting a refund for our additional expenses. norwegian made us wait on board for hours after anouncing they loaded all of the wrong luggage onto the aircraft and had to search for the luggage of 288 people. during this time they did not offer any refreshments save a small cup of water after some time. near the end of our flight they came around offering coffee but sped down the aisles without offering much a glance or interest into who wanted some. when they did stop with the coffee we had to provide our own cups. my neighbor was forced to offer his plastic water cup for the hot drink. once arrived in ny we sat on the tarmac for an hour no appeasement came from the staff for the anxious customers on board. after finally getting off they took another 45–60 minutes to start getting luggage off. not only did i miss my 30 bus ride to boston but i had to take 2.40 am amtrak train to get me back to boston in time for a wedding. it cost 100. after formally sending in my request for reimbursement they twice rejected it on the grounds that the delays were extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.    i fly two or three times a year from new york to europe for the past 5 years and i have never had such a bad experience. my flight from cdg to jfk on 010117 was scheduled at 7.35 pm got canceled after waiting 4 hours in the aircraft because of improper technical maintenance. we were all disembarked at midnight with buses the aircraft did not get to a gate which took another hour. no one to give proper information and not able to contact the company. we were all relocated to a very cheap inn ibis budget in the smoking bedrooms which were a disaster. no dinner was served. the next day our replacement flight was supposed to take off at 1.30pm then 2.30 then 5.30 then 6.00 and finally took off around 9.00 pm. we had to board by bus again no gate connected. when landed in jfk another wait of 1 hour before getting off the plane because the logistic was not in place and they could not open the gate. again we took buses. we had almost no communication and only 1 breakfast and 1 sandwich over the total of 62 hours in transit. this is not acceptable. will never book norwegian again.    london gatwick to stockholm. all three flights so far wih norwegian has run smoothly. but this flight d82852 on february 8 was sinking the rating of norwegian as we entered the cabin. the crew was disorganised and there was not enough space overhead for the cabin luggage. either norwegian hasnt designed the aircraft to fit all cabin luggage in the cabin or they are not making sure that people stick to the rules of carrying hand luggage. so we came in to our prebooked front seat rows and find that the overhead storage isnt designed for normal sized cabin luggage and already there is one smaller bag and a ladies handbag stuffed in there. the cabin staff tells me to follow her colleague further back to store my luggage there. another staff says there is no room for our luggage down there. when i finally get back to my seat the staff confirms they need to check our hand luggage in. i need to take out my laptop and our valuables. after takeoff i realise that the luggage stored overhead of us belongs to the cabin crew. i have to admit that yesterdays flight from fuerteventura to london with a half full cabin did have one of the smoothest communicating crews i have seen in work lately.     i was due to fly to new york jfk from gatwick aboard a norwegian airbus but received a text a few days before departure telling me that the flight would be operated by hifly and that the inflight entertainment would be limited. nothing about food comfort or anything. as soon as i got on board the discomfort started. thin uncomfortable seats. tiny tv with only 6 terrible films. not that it mattered as my headphone socket was broken. id paid extra for the food upgrade 50 each way. the food was as basic as you get. ive seen better school dinners than this food. we were provided 1 drink only. i asked for another and even offered to pay but was refused and told rather rudely only water. on an 8 hour flight. when it came to attempting to sleep my seat didnt even recline. along with that there was a wobble to it as though it wasnt screwed down correctly. the staff were hardly ever around and never seemed to answer the service light. there was also a constant bong noise like when the pilot communicates to the staff. this was constant the entire flight every few minutes making any rest impossible. to make all this worse i was flying back the next day. looking forward to a slightly better flight. the morning of my departure i received the same text which said my flight later that evening would also be managed by the same company to my horror it wasnt just that. it was exactly the same crew meaning norwegian knew well in advance that my flight would be this one but deemed it ok to not tell me until the morning of my flight stopping me having a chance to change it. since then ive had back and forth with them over email. theyve offered me 1000 casahpointsairmiles voucher. which equates to about 96. no refund on the food upgrade i purchased. just a means i can only use if i fly with them again. theyve been horrendous for customer service. an apology for misselling me a ticket and a small voucher is ridiculous. there are a lot of others who have clearly had good service on their flights when they work. just beware that when they dont youre probably going to have a really really bad time.    gatwick to new york jfk. a week before departure received an email stating that the flight will be conducted by hifly not norwegian. i had hotels booked and a car waiting for me so the opportunity to rebook or cancel was not an option.  there were 6 films to choose from total but it didnt matter anyway because apparently they had forgotten to load the headphones. the seats were no better than economy and although the seat recline was in the region of 60 degrees there was insufficient room to relax i had booked premium class because my wife suffers from a slipped disk in her spine. broken magazine pouches and tears in the seating fabric lent nothing to the overal comfort. no small comfort items toothpaste brush eye mask etc. the two meals was served in a cardboard box with limited choice yuck. i appreciate that airlines need on occasions to uterlise alternative aircraft leasing but come on. when at gatwick airport and you observe several norwegian aircraft to european destinations questions you ask as to why a long haul flight to the usa was serviced with an aircraft so old an clearly not suitable for those who have paid a great deal of money for a semblance of comfort which was sorely missing in this trip. im not looking forward to the trip home.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    gatwick to new york jfk. the worst airline experience i have had. the flight was delayed 5 hours and we were not given anything to make up for it. on boarding the flight i pulled back the seat pouch to put my book in and the plane had clearly not been cleaned. i asked the air hostess to clear the mess she rolled her eyes and replied i guess i could do that. i was sat next to quite a heavily pregnant woman there were cabin staff stood in the entrance who could see this pregnant woman struggling to get her bag into the overhead bin yet not one of them offered to help her. they then later denied her request for a glass of water because the snack bar was not open. they would not let her go to the toilet when there was turbulence. appalling customer care. i wouldnt say its good value for money once youve had to pay for extras such as luggage and food.    copenhagen to stockholm. im a frequent norwegian flyer and have for a long time liked it a lot. it seems like norwegian outsource many of their flights to smartlynx airlines and it is terrible. today the plane is delayed 1.5 hours. that is unacceptable. smartlynx airlines fly a320s instead of norwegian new boeings and that means the boarding can only happen from the front so it takes twice as ling and gets the arrival even more delayed there is less luggage room in the cabin so they have to check in last minute extra luggages which delays the process and there is no wifi on the plane.     this airline is terrible. in taking a simple flight from london gatwick to stockholm arlanada they managed to delay both my flight out and returning. the customer service lines are also closed on a sunday which is interesting because they certainly fly on sundays so if there is an issue you are on your own. the big issue is the delay over 3 hours placed the flight in at 3 am which means there are little to no trains in and i had work in the morning. this airline service is disgusting and i will never fly again. they cant operate well and they dont even have the customer service to remedy their mistakes.    i usually dont leave reviews as im not a fussy person when traveling however my experience with norwegian was not good. firstly on travelling from london to new york our aircraft was changed to wamos air which had no inflight entertainment. we questioned this when we checked in and the lady said we do have tvs but they are limited she also said there was phone chargers available on the flight but there wasnt. we asked for four of us to be seated together she said this was sorted however when we got on the flight two of the seats were together but the other two seats were taken up by two other women and they had the same number seats as us. me and my friend were then seated at opposite sides of the plane. it was an 8 hour flight and we checked in early to ensure we could be seated together. not satisfied with this the return flight was worse. in new york i hurt my ankle and could not walk again on checking in please note i was in a wheelchair also holding my crutches i asked to be seated in the exit seats or a seat with room to rest my leg. the staff member said this would be possible however i was seated on the outside lane in seat 20 d with no leg room i stressed how much i needed the room to keep my leg up incase of swelling however he didnt listen to me. during the flight i asked the air hostess if someone could swap with me but they said no that the flight was full and they couldnt help me. there should have been some alternative for these situations.    first time i have flown with norwegian. booked flights from london gatwick to new york jfk only a couple of months in advance and they were a lot cheaper than alternatives had generally solid reviews and were using new being 787 aircraft. received text week before to inform flights being operated by wamos. i believe this was due to maintenance issues with original aircraft and read of similar issues over the previous 45 weeks. we ended up on 20 year old aircraft with no inflight entertainment. all customers were served food as a sort of compensation however since we originally paid for food there was no benefit to us. service was generally poor most announcements were in spanish and flight attendants didnt really seem to care about any passenger requests or needs. it may be a temporary issue with aircraftservice however were i to travel long haul again i would pay the extra for guaranteed decent flight.\\r\\r\\n    flew from new york jfk to london gatwick. the most appalling customer service from norwegian. they have been using wamos air instead of their own dreamliner planes and consequently they are smaller planes. we booked premium but on the smaller plane there are only 24 premium seats compared to the 35 on a dreamliner. despite reconfirming our reserved premium seat numbers 5 mins before entering the airport when we arrived at check in we were told that our seats had been allocated to someone else and had been down graded to economy. on speaking to the duty manager at jfk check in he explained that norwegian had been doing this for the past month had known well in advance of the problem but choose just to cause maximum distress by downgrading at check in. absolutely disgraceful and can only advise  do not fly norwegian long haul.    gatwick to catania with norwegian. delayed over 3 hours at gatwick due to late crew. no explanations terrible organisation then made sure they sped up and arrived at just under the 3 hour limit by literally minutes to avoid claims. helpfully we were delayed on the way back also.    \\r\\r\\ni had a 9 hour overnight flight with norwegian and was very disappointed with their service. the plane was incredibly cold and we were not provided with blankets or pillows and when i asked for anything that could keep me warm as i was shivering they said the only option was to buy a blanket for 7. as my flight was part of a 3part journey i travelled from managua to fort lauderdale with another airline then fort lauderdale to copenhagen and copenhagen to gatwick with norwegian air i was not given the option to choose food online nor was i told that we needed to select which meal we wanted. everyone around my friend and i were served food and when we asked the air hostess why we were not given any she told us it was because we had opted out of having food so they could not serve us anything  not even a drink even though all food and drink was free and included in the flight ticket. the next morning the same thing happened and i had an argument with the same air hostess who would not even give us a cup of coffee even though there was plenty to spare. we had been travelling for 35 hours and had no food or drinks but she insisted she couldnt give us a cup of coffee otherwise everyone on the flight could have one. yes everyone on the flight should get a cup of coffee if they want one. the airline even has a video explaining how they believe that if their customers dont want something they dont have to pay for it.  examples included checkedin luggage and coffee on the flight. yes norwegian air if i dont have luggage to checkin and dont want an extra coffee then like every airline in the world i shouldnt have to pay for it but starving your passengers because your online food booking system didnt work especially when the food is free anyway does not count as a customer not wanting something and not having to pay for it. i will definitely never be using their service again.    helsinki to malaga. we were given wrong information about my baby pushchair. they didnt allow me to take it to the gate but i read on internet that it is allowed. we went to the airport the day before travelling to ask this question and they said that yes we can take the pushchair to the gate. the airport agents at helsinki airport addressed me rudely and impolite at baggage drop off.    gatwick to palma de mallorca. extremely disappointed about my flight with norwegian. most previous flights with norwegian had been pleasant but the service i was offered was unacceptable. when i entered the plane no crew would place my suitcase in the overhand locker. they wouldnt let me pay my snack in euros unless i was to spend 9 euros just for a bag of chips and a muffin. the thing that was good was the wifi for i am writing my review in the plane. \\r\\r\\n    wife and i flew norwegian on their premium flex cabin from lax to stockholm return. this will be the last time as we had a very poor experience in both inbound and outbound flights. the crew never showed up after two poor meals. flight was late arriving. and the cherry on the cake being packed so tight on their bus and drove around some more around the lax tarmac. the way up was even worse due to a 4 hour delay. i paid more in flex 2100 per ticket that i would have paid with other airlines. i regret my decision.    los angeles to gatwick. a flight booked months in advance and then subsequently upgraded to premium.  never mind that it was an additional 100 to upgrade over the phone due to the service not working properly online. checking previous flights for the past few days  all ok on time. great. get to the lounge early  oneworld  excellent facilities and a perfect way to start our journey. then the texts started coming. from a 2010 expected takeoff saturday the short story is a delay until 0200 monday.  the key issue was having no ground staff to assist passengers leading to a fair amount of emotion uncertainty and pain in arranging own hotels flights etc. again no doubt great when it goes well but with no network and no support be aware that the costs come with a caveat that you are on your own should there be any issues. our little bit of luxury missed and likely not to be repeated again.     gatwick to new york. apparently when norwegian get it right they are excellent. sadly we havent had chance to see this in action yet. we were subbed onto a euroatlantic 777 which was over 20 years old and extremely cramped. the crew were fairly staid  not really caring given theyre on a contract. food was average inflight non existent. no entertainment at all text said limited. it was either suck it up or pay three times more to change the flight a matter of a day or so beforehand.    gatwick to new york return both flights operated by euroatlantic airways aircraft. dont bother upgrading your ticket. we paid the upgrade price to be guaranteed our selected seats get a meal & snack have a free carryon bag and checked luggage. the first issue arose when our flight was delayed by almost 24 hours and no one representing norwegian would help.  when it was time to board our flight we discovered that the upgrades we paid for were in actuality free for everyone because the flight had been delayed. the upgrades were being given away free on the return flight which was on time. on both flights they moved our paid for seats back 30 rows in into the middle of the plane we paid for window  aisle side seats. the entertainment did not work and there was no wifi. the seats were incredibly cramped which was not fun for an 8hour flight. the flight attendants did not care about providing us with service beyond the meal and snack. my row was skipped at drink service and when i asked for water i  never got it. dont bother wasting your money or trying to contact a nonexistent customer service.    edinburgh to providence. our return flight was cancelled only hours before with no explanation. when we called the helpline number given to us we waited 45 minutes before speaking to anyone. they asked one question and then passed us on to another line where we were put on hold again  and only norwegian was spoken. after another 30 minutes on hold we gave up and booked other flights back to uk at a huge cost. there was no other way to contact the airline or receive assistance or get more information. i will never fly this budget airline again. our flight from edinburgh to providence was not enjoyable. we expected it to be a budget airline for a long haul flight but to not be offered water and to not have fully functioning wifi made it unbearable.    my flight from los angeles to london was repeatedly delayed for a total of 30 hours. evidently there was an electrical problem and the part needed to be flown in before they could make the repair. norwegian handlers were rude and offered no help in getting a hotel. when asked a question one of the handlers held up her hand and rudely said hold your questions. they gave 7 food vouchers about 10 minutes before all of the concessions closed at lax. i telephoned norwegians customer service and was hung up on several times as were other travelers on the same flight. during the flight they served the food that was stocked for the original flight. the steak was grey and completely inedible. the cabin crew basically turned off the cabin lights and hid in the galley for the flight. i missed my connecting flight my hotel my tour and had to rebook my connecting flight at a double the rate. it will take 6 months for norwegian air to reimburse me for these charges. my return flight was also delayed 2 hours while they repaired the pilots handset microphone. my return flight was a completely different experience with lots of offers of water or juice during the flight and although tiny portions somewhat decent food. after 2 flights being delayed by repair issues i believe norwegian does not keep their planes in good repair. yes the leg room is abundant and the price lower than other airlines but after this i will never fly on norwegian again.    flew norwegian from edinburgh to newburgh. the staff were lovely but come on an 8 hour flight and no movies for some reason some people got a meal and others didnt buy dont fret you can buy an overly priced sandwich or drink granted it was a cheap flight but i had gotten a better price on air france with all the amenities of an international flight but purchased way earlier dont get me started on their so called international airport and theo bus service to nyc 45 minutes later were still waiting to leave    on an evening flight from athens to stockholm norwegian had to swap out the aircraft and the replacement was smaller than the original and a group of us were denied boarding. no issue here. problems began after that. we were on a direct flight and eventually got booked on a flight the next day with an 8 hour layover although there was originally a direct flight available and even later flight options with 4 hour layovers. we were given a meal voucher only good at mcdonalds. we were kept at the airport for 2 hours and booked on a 6.30 am flight meaning we got a maximum of 5 hours sleep assuming no time for shower. called customer service as directed by gate agent who first denied any problem with flight then told me it wasnt possible to book onto a better flight. i asked her why they wouldnt and she just kept repeating it wasnt possible and hung up on me. no compensation given at airport but instead directed to an online form. online form didnt work and had to call customer service. customer service had me fill out a general email feedback. waiting with low expectations of ever getting compensation.    \\r\\r\\nflew los angeles to gatwick. booked through kiwi.com got decent food on the way out but nothing on the way back. apparently i should have ticked a box but i didnt see one. plane was clean and reasonably comfortable. cabin crew werent great though they had a surly manner and one was swearing within earshot of young kids.    i purchased a one way ticket on norwegian for a direct flight from gatwick to denver. the original ticket was 303 paid for as soon as i booked it in june. three days before the flight norwegian emailed me an offer to upgrade to premium economy for 450 which i accepted. i received a confirmation that i was being charged a cancellation fee and i was now being charged 779 on top of the original 303. while this will get resolved i suspect now that i am back in the us i was not overly impressed with this airline. in premium i asked for coffee and was told no it would be served after the meal. i had to bus my own trash back to the kitchen  they did not come by with a trash bag to collect. i had to go to the kitchen several times to request water. in premium there were two decent meals but no cranberry or tomato juice.    i guess my mistake was not knowing that norwegian is a low cost airline. my flight was certainly not considerably cheaper than others. the plane itself was fabulous. huge very roomy clean individual tvs for everyone with movies and usb ports for charging devices. the app  wouldnt allow my friend or me to check in online saying that check in needed to be done at a kiosk. ok. i was on an 11 hour flight from london gatwick to oakland california with no  water. i didnt bother to preorder a meal because ive never needed to with other airlines. i figured id get my complimentary drinks and snacks and that there would be plentiful options for meals onboard. while everyone around me was being served hot meals with tea and coffee and snacks i sat there confused. when i asked if i could have some coffee the stewardess asked if i had prepurchased a meal. i had planned on purchasing food onboard the flight but options were limited. thehot snack was a grilled cheese with one thin slice of ham for 7. it tasted fine. the flight attendants rarely came by twice i hit the call button and no one showed but other parched passengers like myself were walking to the flight attendants station to ask for water which they were then provided a cup of room temp tap water. at least i had  movies to keep me occupied. good luck if you get cold need a pillow or forgot your headphones because they will charge you. for the last short leg of my journey home i flew southwest airlines and  for my less than one hour flight from oakland to phoenix i had caring flight attendants and drinks and snacks.     new york jfk to gatwick. the line for check in was 4 lanes deep. at the counter i was met with a luggage overweight problem by 4 lbs.  i transferred weight from one bag to the other but staff were not satisfied and i was still 1lb overweight. i have come to expect 50lbs not 44 20kg as is their policy. flying them once was enough for me.    flew norwegian from copenhagen to new york jfk. this airline seems fantastic. they are low cost but fly the newest jets. nevertheless they are wildly inconsistent with their boarding practices. i have flown several times with the airline. the last two times they let me take my certified luggage onboard. this time however they insisted that it was too big. despite my protestations and citation of numerous examples where i had flown with the bag before they told me i could not take it on the flight. they made me pay 64 euros at the gate. this is absurd because they didnt even measure my bag. just told me that i could take it or leave it. unfortunately an otherwise great airline is flawed in their selective boarding practices.    palma to gatwick. i had not used norwegian for a few years and thought it was time to give them a try. i found the website logical and well set out and the terms and conditions were clear and concise. i arrived early to checkin and was delighted with the process and found the staff polite and efficient. my flight was after midnight and boarding was orderly and civil. i found that things were a mixed bag. the cabin crew were italian and spoke in their own language ignoring passengers. the safety demonstration was not conducted with much sincerity. i had paid for my seat near the front and was dismayed when i saw passengers grab seats not assigned to them and the cabin crew did nothing to address this situation. the snacks on board were expensive and some options were not available. there was no route map and at no stage during the flight did the captain make any announcement. very comfortable boeing 737 with mood lighting. when i went to collect my luggage i noted that my bag had been interfered with as it was unzipped. i looked inside and saw that it had been disturbed. i made enquires with the norwegian desk and was told to report it online. there was no sense of taking this issue seriously at all. overall a lacklustre experience on this occasion.   i would be very careful booking with norwegian. all the money you supposedly save will be made up for in time trouble and additional money. the most basic of amenities are not available could not check in online or transfer bags so had to rush from a connecting flight after picking up my bags to recheck them and even with paying extra baggage fees online in advance was charged 90 for 6kg overweight even though they have some discretion and only then told they dont work with tsa precheck another 100 down the tubes and no they wouldnt transfer my bags for the last leg so ill have to claim and recheck in london too. i had also tried to call weeks in advance to ask some of these questions and was told the agents at the airport would help me. for the extra 200 and all the time wasted i should have just used a real airline and i recommend others do the same.    gatwick to orlando. flight delayed by 4 hours with no communication from ground staff. delay occurred following our progression through the gate but before boarding so we were kept in the gate area with not enough seating and no food or drink for four hours. staff on flight were rude and saw no need to provide any level of customer service. after flight it was clear that there had been a mix up with luggage but there was no one from the airline available to help due to the delay it was now 2am and we were stranded without our luggage and no assistance. i called norwegian helpline and informed them that my telephone credit was about to run out and requested they call me back but they refused to do so. phone credit ran out and i was left with no way of contacting norwegian and no suitcase. i emailed the airline with a complaint over a month ago and never received any kind of response. im sure they are fine if everything runs smoothly but as soon as there is an issue they are completely i equipped to deal with it.    gatwick to los angeles. nickel and dime you to death. on my flight they forced me to check my bag because it was slightly over the weight limit of 10kg and charged me 55 their price if you dont buy baggage in advance. food i found revolting. 45. by the time theyre done nickel & dimeing you your at the cost of the other airlines just with horrible aggressive anti passenger service. they lure you with low fares but then pursue you to squeeze every dime. an oppressive experience    airline with atrocious service on par and in some ways worse than the likes of spirit and frontier. i flew a couple of norwegian routes in the last few days 1 prague to copenhagen and 2 londongatwick to seattle. the first annoyance was the inability to check in online which for the first route required lining up at the airport for 30 minutes as someone who never checks bags the only place ive had to do this is cuba. while the plane itself was a beautiful new boeing 787dreamliner with the latest in tech the cabin was woefully understaffed. while i understand the ideology of charging for everything on this airline the lack of any basic amenities offered by was unbelievable. only once in an 11 hour nightmare after begging a flight attendant was i given water on the plane. apparently they require that you purchase a 5 bottle of water not only is this environmentally irresponsible but grossly negligent to those customers who may not want to pay for extras. i was very dehydrated with a massive headache when i arrived a scenario echoed by multiple passengers i spoke with following the second overseas route. halfway through the flight i tried to purchase a sandwich but they were sold out 5 hours before landing. when i inquired they told me i need to reserve specific meals ahead of time. how many people know what they want to eat on a plane days in advance or want the headache of remembering what added services they have purchased on each ofpotentially several flights i had 10 flights on this trip    gatwick to tromso via oslo. this was the 3rd time i have flown with norwegian and the 3rd time the flight was late. they made no announcements in the airport or during the flight telling you of delays. i missed my connecting flight which was due to the fact that they hadnt made support plans for people trying to get their connections. we had to collect our own luggage recheck in and were told to run to the gate. having missed the flight me and a few others were told that our bags had been offloaded and there were no more flights that evening. it turns out the bags hadnt been offloaded and were on their way to my final destination. when i finally got to where i was going the next day my bags werent there. i had to wait another 12 hours for them to arrive. this was in august 2017 and i am still yet to hear back from my complaint despite multiple attempts to contact them. in their words their complaints team are very busy. they only thing that they have going for them is they are cheap but you get what you pay for.     gatwick to barcelona. i could not log into the web site to add advanced passenger information. boarding the plane at gatwick was shoddily organized i asked the lady at the gate check in if this was the correct place and was answered in an answered very curtly. we were then cattle penned into an area where we uncomfortably stood for about 15 mins. why let us through so early when nothing was ready we could have been sitting down. the aircraft took off approx 45mins late and not one word of apology. when we touched down in barcelona there was no update on weather or change of time. i was told by my booking agent they requested an aisle seat as i had a bad back problem this was not actioned.    alicante to gatwick. flight cancelled and no available other flights for that day. offered flight to gatwick for the following day via helsinki we asked for a direct flight and the next available was in six days time and there was only one seat on that. the desk staff gave us vouchers for a taxi one way to a hotel and a voucher for the hotel no luck there. no room or didnt accept the ticket. sent to next hotel who had no twin beds available and offered bunk beds in a budget hotel we are both 70 yrs old. we declined and went back to the airport. the norwegian  desk was closed and we were stranded in alicante. the girl at the end of the phone could still only offer helsinki. we arranged a taxi to a hotel ourselves and booked with ryanair for flights home the next day. we have submitted a claim for our expenses plus compensation. hope to hear soon.    flew norwegian from denver to london gatwick. the worst flying experience of my life. i waited for ten hours for them to constantly tell us 30 minutes 30 minutes we will depart. rudest airline attendants i have ever met. what a nightmare. delay after delay lie after lie. they told some passengers the night before through email that it would be delayed but others got nothing. they are so disorganized i have never seen such a lack of capability in an airline. what a joke. when i went to check in with their ticket counter i walked past several times because they did not have a sign. they boarded us after 8 hours of delay then kept us in seats for another hour and a half refusing us to move around or allowing us to use the bathroom. they told us we would depart than changed their story and gave us some rubbish about checks this is so frustrating. completely unproffesionnal and utter lack for human decency or common truth.     ft lauderdale to paris cdg. our flight was delayed due to maintenance to a departure from 1030 pm to 1250 am no big deal. then they boarded the stewards and announced they would begin boarding in a few minutes. 5 minutes later were delayed at least 2 hours to locate a part 5 minutes after that the flight has been cancelled. so now its 1am and everyone rushes back to the other terminal because god knows why they arent in the same one the gentleman says they are rebooking the flight for the morning and if we didnt have a place to stay to go home and wait for text updates also okay. i call the airline to get an update around 130am am to confirm this is true they say its being rebooked for 10 to 12 hours from now and im cool with going home for zzzs. wake up next day to not a single alert. call back. we cannot get you on a flight until next wednesday 6 days from my original flight. call back again.  we have no information to update you with. call back again. we can get you on a flight on saturday but not in the original class booked. im sorry what no one has a clue whats going on from the top to the bottom.     new york to gatwick. we flew return from london to new york on our flight out we had to sit on the ground at the airport for over an hour in jfk  which is not helpful when you have arranged a pick up service. however it gets very poor on our return flight. at check in the staff were very rude and unhelpful. we checked in 4 hours early as recommend as we got through the security checks i noticed that the flight time on my ticket had changed once in the departure lounge we found we were delayed by 2 hours which the staff clearly knew about as they printed our tickets. however they neglected to inform us of this. 30 mins later we get a text saying we are delayed go see a member of norwegian staff and they will sort out a meal voucher for you. we thought ok that is nice of them. in the coming hours we saw 3 members of staff and each of them said its nothing to do with me. i dont know what you are talking about so basically they didnt want to know. we arrived late back to the uk missing our trains costing us 118 to replace. ive spoken to norwegian on the phone and they informed me it will be 68 weeks to look at my issue as complaints is busy and backed up. they may seem cheap but it will cost you elsewhere so be warned.     flew barcelona to newark. norwegian offers low fares great. they offer a staff of unfriendly people and they have very odd business practice of not offering any food or drinks unless you pay extra prior to flying or in cabin. they will not offer you even water to drink on an overseas flight. better bring your credit card the staff certainly couldnt care less if you were there. they simply look through you and would rather be elsewhere. ive never seen more unmotivated and unfriendly staff with any other airline ive flown and i fly every week for business. i rate norwegian an overall big fat 1 out of 10 and its well deserved.    norwegian is below low end. the check in staff at la were rude and dismissive. finally after checking our bags we spent about 2 hours trying to board the flight and left about an hour late with no explanation from cabin crew or captain. there was no safety demonstration from cabin crew just a video in the cabin.  once we took off they served us a warm meal which we had preordered and half of the passengers didnt get anything. you are allowed one cold and one hot drink at the time of your meal and after that you have to pay for water. after that they turned the aircon down the flight was freezing. i would say this is so they can charge you for a blanket but they didnt have any stock. the cabin crew were asked numerous times about the temperature and just replied ill see what we can do and nothing happens. everyone was sat on a 9.5 hour flight cold in coats and scarves. it was pleasant walking off the plane into the autumnal air of 15 degrees and still nothing from the pilot. cheap slightly  worth it no. stockholm arn to new york jfk. the dreamliner had been replaced by a340. seats ok but inflight video system out of order. meal service was a joke. after almost 3 hours we were served a light meal and one glass of wine. no possibility to buy anything else until meal trays had been cleared and bar trolleys where rolled out. by then we were 2 hours from landing in new york if i have to fly with this airline again i will stock up with own water and food. a very poor substitute a340 to the dreamliner for the stockholmnew york flight with a secondrate portuguese speaking crew. warned through a text message that no inflight entertainment was to be expected on board reading light was non functional probably connected to the entertainment system which was not turned on. cabin temperature was at a very low setting so cabin crew could sell blankets for 5 dollars a piece. food service was slow and dinnerbreakfast were of minisized quantity. service in between meals was nonexistent. i have used norwegian in europe before and i had no complaints but this long haul flight was a clear picture of costcutting and a total disregard for passengers basic comfort. business class premium class nycoslonyc in julyaugust of 2013. staff generally friendly and professional and planes are clean. at jfk no separate check in for premium and i had to drag my bag over to a bagdrop area after check in. at the gate they had priority boarding for children and premium albeit a bit disorganized. older a340 which they have wetleased from hifly out of portugal original interior of old emirates. there was a small first class section and a large business class section. after take off i was allowed to move up to an empty first class seat which was layflat but not all that comfortable. business class seats are comfortable very padded and with a good recline and foot rest but there is no layflat or even close. inflight entertainment system is disengaged so do not expect anything. the food thrown at you is deplorable. actually worse than what you get in economy on long haul return today from oslo not so good. of course no premium check in and here not even priority boarding. the leg rest of my seat wasnt working and it turns out norwegian had known about it for a long time. food again the same. after they throw that food package in front of you and clearly states that you only get one alcoholic drink you dont see them again before a basic coffee service. i had to walk to the very back of the a340 in order to buy some snacks and drinks after dinner. dont expect business class on norwegian when you buy premium. paid for premium seats jfkstockholm and told 2 days before flight that plane grounded and replacement had only economy. replacement plane was equivalent to a retired school bus. checkin conducted by 3 folks one of whom knew what she was doing. of course they couldnt even figure out how to configure the lines for checkin so should not have been surprised. boarding comical  start with back rows then forget rows called and just have a free for all at end. 3 hours late due to the need to retrofit some part of the replacement plane. entirely a free for all boarding when flying bergen to oslo. return flight to jfk had premiumbusiness with entertainment system not working and food not fit for a dog. and the seat was partially broken foot rest part. all in all a disaster. returned last night from stockholm to lgw. plane late but not na fault. long lines at passport control. waiting area  no seats. boarding chaotic free for all with no priority boarding for children or disabled people my wife. made comment to stewards who said it was down to the airport. seated in seats 2c and 2d. no overhead space left. requested a g&t  no ice available. alternative warm beer so no sale. impression that na cared little for customers or repeat business. would urge you not to fly with them. return trip from helsinki to copenhagen. outbound flight was to be at 07h00. neither my friend on the same booking or i received any notification that the time had changed. after the arduous task that is getting through security check at helsinki airport at 06h50 we hear over the pa that we were running late and have 1 min to board. on boarding the guy next to us showed us an sms hed received earlier that morning to say it was now early  where was my message to change the time to choose to not notify me and then give me poor attitude and sass as i approach the plane on the gangway when im not in the wrong is disgusting. return flight was fine. return was only 10 mins late there was no attitude and we were kept updated. however bearing in mind that all they can do is promote the fact that theyre the first european airline to offer free wifi onboard you should know that it is incredibly slow to connect to the initial page outside their own domain. additionally if the captain or purser make an announcement it resets the wifi and you have to endure that wait all over again so the free wifi that they use as the balance to all negativity is not all that great. there is no offer of anything regarding fooddrink despite the flight time and it being international but i figure thats a nordic thing maybe other points like seating are neutral. theyre not cramped but not the most comfortable. ife was pathetic. in all fly with norwegian if you only care about price or if it absolutely essential that you have onboard wifi and can handle the speedsresets. avoid them if you would like nice and friendly staff or if you like to know when theres a chance that youll miss your flight. dy7202 bkkosl. at bangkok there was no business class checkin similarly no fast track and no access to any lounge facilities. on board the portuguese hired plane there was no predeparture drink towels or any other service normally given. only concession was a larger more spacious seat as i was in 1c. flight crew were all very amateur appeared rushed and somewhat confused as to procedures. pre flight safety demonstration was almost non existent and consisted of an announcement asking passengers to refer to the safety information card in seat pocket. no initial drinks service given beverages only permitted with the meal service. the food service can only be described as disgraceful a cardboard box containing very basic utensils and awful food was thrown in front of me. cabin staff were not interested in giving any kind of service and almost immediately they completed the distribution of the food boxes they commenced collection of same rushing to complete as soon as possible. the entertainment system was extremely poor no choice or personal music. on arrival at oslo the cabin crew did not know which door would be used to disembark from resulted in all passengers remaining on the plane 15 minutes after arrival at the gate. baggage then took a further hour to arrive in the hall concluding one of the worst flights i have ever had the displeasure to travel on. stockholm to bangkok. flight was pretty much on time and they werent as strict with carry ons as other budget airlines but those are the only 2 good things i have to say. the plane was very old no wifi you pay extra for food the ancient movie screens did not work for more than half of the 10 hour flight and the flight attendants were not helpful or knowledgeable at all. i would never fly with them again. lgwgcn gatwick to gran canaria. unfortunately low cost airline means in this case a lot. the price was ok but its really showing what are you paying for. the seats are the most uncomfortable i have seen. if passenger next to you is a little bit bigger than the size of the seat then you are just stuck and pushed. free wifi is a good advertising option but works very slowly. it takes several attempts to make anything work on wifi. another rip off is the bar on board. they dont accept payments in euros only credit cards and uk pounds. the worst part of flying with norwegian is the rude staff. it happened both ways from london and back from gran canaria. there is a lot they can learn from easyjet. if you a looking for a very basic flight without being fussy about service on board quality of seats and rudeness of staff then norwegian is for you. otherwise i will suggest trying some other airlines. we booked a 3 week trip to thailand and started our journey on september 7th from oslo where our flight was scheduled to depart directly to bangkok. problems started immediately. aircraft had technical problems and boarding was delayed several times. during the exhaustive wait information was given in norwegian until the angry nonnorwegian customers demanded english announcements. eventually the captain announced that the crew ran out of work time. we were taken to a low budget airport hotel late in the evening to spend the night and were told that we had to be back at the airport at 5 am next morning. we returned to find that the flight was delayed again to 8 am. they decided to give up fixing the plane and arranged to fly everyone to stockholm in order to get on to a new plane to bangkok. naturally this required 3 separate flights to get everyone and the luggage there. finally we took off from stockholm towards thailand after over 24 hours of waiting. return flight had no more success than the first one. as im writing this our original flight from bangkok to oslo is already cancelled and there is no information whether norwegian is able to get us back home somehow. our original departure was scheduled at 9 am on friday 27th and now it is 5 pm on saturday 28th. very unacceptable unprofessional and below any standards considering that we are living in the year 2013. helcphhel 16 september 2013. booked my first flight with norwegian and it turned out to be my worst air travel experience. low cost airline service paying for every little service baggage seat selection drinks separately is not for me. i cannot recommend to anyone. wifi didnt work. flew malaga to munich monday 2nd december. could not print out boarding pass so stood with all the hold luggage folks at checkin. on the plane the staff hid behind a curtain and told my wife off for waiting for the toilet inside the curtain. drinks came round eventually but not offered a second one on a 3 hour flight. today 6th december arrived early at munich to catch flight to be told its delayed from 9pm until the following day at 6.30. as i write this am not yet on the flight so we will see. however the compensation for 9 hours at the airport was just food and not other help offered. claimed adverse weather was to blame but at the check in desk this evening the oslo flight was boarding so they have abandoned a non hub flight to support a flight but to norway. norwegian claimed via their handling agent that everyone got an sms which was clearly untrue as others we spoke to had not got any update for a travel delay. flight dy 1336 svg to lgw. announced 2 hrs delay. no info no excuse no apology  nothing. after 2 hrs they announced another 30 mins delay. again no info. staff had no idea what was happening. badly managed. zero communication. checked in at alicante no problems there. spanish immigration commence boarding through the gate at 20.35 for a 21.15 flight. i go through the gate into a corridor just short of the aircraft to find a locked door where all passengers are queuing. it is in this corridor that we all wait 30 mins in for no apparent reason but it soon becomes clear. 10 mins before the flight is due to take off 2 of the cabin crew appear forcing their way through the queue clutching their bags from the duty free shop in the terminal. they then go through the door to the aircraft and boarding the plane begins. there was no apology from the crew for delaying the take off or leaving us standing in a cold corridor for 30 mins. i do not like being treated like cattle. this was my first and last trip with an airline. dec 23 2013 on dy7006 from jfkarn. 12 hours before the flight i got an sms saying that the the boeing 787 dreamliner was not available and a contractor of norwegian air was hired instead to fly us to arn. the contractor was portugal based euroatlantic airlines. no explanation was given as to the reason why this change was made. upon arrival at the checkin desk at jfk the flight was delayed 2 hours. after baggage and boarding card checkin the flight was delayed further by another hour. the checkin staff at gate 9 jfk term 1 was poor in control and procedure in the boarding process. then another half hour delay citing inbound aircraft late arrival. euroatlantic operated a boeing 767. seated were tight in economy in 252 configuration. inflight entertainment were the blank white wall of the bulkhead. even though the aircraft were fitted with the 1980s tri colour projector system but no shows were offered. audio system were non operative either. the 70 i paid to norwegian for tasty meal 20kg baggage and seat choice were unsatisfactory as the two meals offered were poor. lets hope the return flight my dream will be realized of flying the dreamliner. bkkoslbkk dy7201 19 oct. dy7202 3 nov. never again. the premium cabin had 5 seats sold in it the day before. come boarding time they had filled the cabin by upgrading economy passengers. i dont have a big problem with this but come the meal service time the fas made it easy on themselves by just handing out economy meals to everyone. the breakfast was an alleged premium product but was unfortunately the worst airline food stale does not begin to describe the pain au chocolat. not at all impressed with the fancy windows that dont black out properly on the dreamliner. for the same price as premium economy with norwegian ive since flown emirates and qatar business out and economy back and find that to be much better value. i have held up on writing a review to allow norwegian the opportunity to get the growing pains out of the way. i expect less quality and comfort since its a discount airline but boeing dreamliner is more like a nightmare than a dream. four separate trips in six month 8 total legs 8 delays. premium business is a joke. only advantage is larger seat. checkin with norwegian nationals is unpleasant due to their rude nature. the staff are uninformed and do not care to inform re delays. i got to say that even as an experienced traveler im beginning to think that the major carriers have a point when they question the safety of norwegians fleet. copenhagen to fort lauderdale with the dreamliner to get a direct flight to florida. perfect airplane with really high comfort and i was just as rested as would normally be flying business. checkin in copenhagen was smooth and pleasant even without my normal privileges as a k1 member of united. but here the good part of the story ends. the advertising says free wifi onboard but the only thing i got was some no sir sorry sir from a crew who barely spoke english and were constantly talking between each other. the food was pretty bland and i had to ask for my prepaid food several times before i got it  i did wait another 45 min than my son  not so nice. barely any water during the flight which should be complementary on any long haul flights but not here. landing in fort lauderdale was a disaster and even after the long wait in immigration there where no luggage and none from norwegian to help. never will i fly with norwegian and despite the comfort of non stop i would rather spend 4 hours waiting in dulles and that says a lot laxcphlax on a b7878. service at checkin was good and fast but service on the aircraft on both flights was horrible as they only pay attention to the people who ordered food in advance. even thought the service was horrible the aircraft was very clean and new and had reduced jetlag because of the air of the aircraft. even though the snacks were really good the food that you can order in advance which my partner ordered was very disgusting affecting the score for food to 3 stars out of 5. also the ife system was really nice since it had a cool 3d map and a lot of fun games. even though service was horrible the value was great at a price of under 700 making norwegian a great airline to fly on international flights. i definitely recommend norwegian to everyone. bangkok  oslo 1 apr 2014 old airbus no entertainment bad service crew did not speak english. had to wait for 45 hours with no ac and no water. worst flight experience ever over 40 hours waiting have flown with norwergian regularly for 5 years. cabin is good and clean. free wifi. on time. good prices. ground crew contractors used outside of norwegian bases scandinavia generally lets the whole experience down. due to traffic i arrived at amsterdam schiphol airport checkin desk 35 minutes before departure with only carryon luggage. the flight had not started boarding yet the line at security which was adjacent to and could be seen from the checkin desk only had two people in it. the gate was immediately after security i.e. not a long walk. despite all this the representative at the checkin desk from menzies aviation refused to print me a boarding pass bluntly stating that i should have been at the checkin desk 45 minutes before departure time. i wasnt even given the chance to catch the flight which i had paid for. very poor customer service. so had to fork out 150 euros for a lastminute train ticket and spend the night on a train travelling across europe. wont be flying norwegian again until they use better ground staff at airports outside of scandinavia. i booked a couple of flights from amsterdam to oslo and oslo to tromso and return to amsterdam from tromso via oslo. the flight was delayed 1 hour 35 minutes and i missed our connecting flight to amsterdam thus had to take the flight the next day. upon the notification of a delay initially for an hour which ended up being 1 hour and 30 minutes on the display screen in tromso airport i had no choice but despair. unfortunately all the effort to change the flight and book an earlier flight was turned down. it was very disappointing to hear that the situation was helpless and there is nothing that norwegian could do. last but not the least the lack enthusiasm from staff to help me solve the problem was particularly frustrating. we flew in march for a trip from london to sweden. the flight back was delayed 6 hrs and 49 mins due to a technical problem with the plane which meant that we waited at arlanda airport until 4am for a flight that was supposed to leave around 9pm. norwegian refused to pay for a hotel during the delay and only gave us a voucher for about 15 each for dinner. the staff were beyond unhelpful. information was only given when you dragged it out of them. i will never be flying with this airline again. oslo to jfk on 10th april 2014. after booking tickets on the dreamliner aircraft which they promote we ended up on an old airbus which was dreadful to say the least. norwegian held this fact back about the aircraft until the last minute. it was overbooked which caused a huge problem. they tried to offer an inducement of 200 euros which not many people went for. therefore people we made to take a flight the next day. these people had bags already checked in and these had to be taken off the flight before we took off. this took time and in the process a panel door on the ac was damaged. overall it was over 2 hours before we took off. in this time we were sat on the plane without even being offered water. during the flight which was operated by hifly crew who seemed out of their depth. there was an old entertainment system but no headsets. the wi fi was non existent. therefore we watched and did nothing for 8 hours. the food which i prebought never came and we had no choice of what was eventually given. my seat was broken. in a nutshell dont fly with norwegian. the dreamliner experience is apparently switched to a 1980s euroatlantic experience. old tatty aircraft with no resemblance to a modern aircraft. the food is disgusting still you pay a hefty price for it when booking. better to actually buy food in a cafe or restaurant at the airport and bring it with on the flight. seriously this not a beginning to a vacation flying long haul on norwegian is like a 12h prison sentence. never again. copenhagen to jfk on 16th may 2014. after booking tickets on the dreamliner aircraft which they promote we ended up on a flight operated by euroatlantic with no inflight entertainment whatsoever. total confusion when the meals were delivered. choice of preferred meals was the worst i have got on a flight even compared to twa back in the 80s. never again. jfkarnosl. the new fresh vibrant norwegian long distance flights that will revolutionise air travel is in fact the worse travel experience i have ever had. service is so poor along with their prepaid food and drinks and snacks are so overpriced. i said never again on the way there but now when i have returned it is never ever again. dy7011 on 23 june scheduled departure 17.45 from copenhagen going to new york jfk although it actually left at 18.10. why would norwegian airlines throw away their great reputation weve flown with them dozens of times and always enjoyed the experience by the appalling service to ny from copenhagen. i didnt notice that the flight was not operated by norwegian but instead by a cheap charter company based in portugal. i wonder how many people look at this sort of detail when they are booking a flight on an airline company website. unless it is pointed out clearly you assume if you are booking on norwegian you will be flying to ny on a dreamliner operated by norwegian with all their promises of clean aircraft tasty food free wifi etc. none of this is the case. the cost of the flight is not cheaper if it is a nightmare journey. be advised. check before booking. on a june 10 flight from cphlax we boarded a very rundown 777200. the interior had ripped seat cushions peeling wall panels seats stuck in the recline position and an awful smell. the ife was extremely limited with small grainy screens and within 40 minutes of the 11 hour flight one of the few lavatories was shut down due to the sink facet stuck to the on position. all the above can be somewhat expected with a low cost charter airline however what was must alarming was their flight attendants. on such a long flight they only appeared in economy about every four hours. of course they were present for the preflight speech and then reappeared about an hour later to toss box lunches to each passenger then quickly pick up the trays i say quickly because the majority of passengers took one bite and knew instinctively to not eat the meal. after that we did not see another fa for four hours. there was no drink service but we saw many passengers going to the empty galley and figuring out how to open the cabinets searching for water bottles and soda. there were children running and playing tag in the aisles and around the lavatories. our flight two weeks earlier on a norwegian 787 from fllcph was wonderful. great service free wine in economy we did pay for the seatluggagemeal package and a nice ife system. what a sad letdown to pay for a 787 ticket with a norwegian air crew but then be switched to euroatlantic on a rundown 777200 with a uncaring flight crew. i recently flew from the states to northern europe using norwegian air. the whole trip was miserable. it started off with a 5 hour delay trying to get out of the states and ended up with my return flight home being operated by hifly. i am extremely annoyed with norwegian air and the fact that i was forced to fly hifly back to the states. hifly certainly does not have the newest fleet in europe and offers subpar service. after complaining about my experience with hifly to my norwegian air rep he explained that it was common for norwegian air to use this company cause norwegian air does not have enough jets and often runs into trouble with delays and cancellations. he went on to inform me the fact that i had food on my hifly flight made me lucky as he often gets complaints that hifly doesnt even serve water on its flights even the longhaul flights. norwegian air is not a company i plan on using again. terrible service delayed on tarmac at gatwick for 45 mins due to brake fault. eventually took off to faro 2 hours into flight informed that because it had started raining there we had to divert to lisbon which had a longer runway. on arrival told that buses have been organised for our onward trip to faro. nobody helped us we were all stood in the terminal building for 2 hours. norwegian could not get us off the plane quick enough. mums wanted car seats for there children etc yet again nobody wanted to know. the plane had the most uncomfortable seats i have ever sat in do not use norwegian they have not got a clue about customer service. i flew jfk to copenhagen on dreamliner in march 2014 and it was great. my wife therefore booked a rt cphjfk in may 2014. terrible. first off they switched the dreamliner aircraft for some antiquated charter aircraft from euro atlantic airways. the plane looked like a heap of junk. on the outbound flight there was no sound for movies at her seat or the seats next to hers and on the way back no entertainment system at all. they shrugged at her and gave her a standard meat meal when asked for the vegetarian meal she had ordered in advance and paid 42 dollars for each way 42x2. no pillows no blankets. why would norwegian airlines want to throw its reputation away like this we booked norwegian back in february to fly from lax to nice via copenhagen on may 15 returning june 7. one reason we chose the carrier was for the dreamliner service on the 10 hour flight to europe and we decided after adding on all the extra charges to take the plunge and go for the premium seats. i cant really say how bad norwegian air was as we never flew them except for the leg from copenhagen to nice. instead of the dreamliner we ended up on a portuguese charter 777 run by euro atlantic airways. we got nothing the antiquated system on this plane didnt work. when was the last time you had an ashtray in your armrest the food was inedible  even for airline food. the crew were on the verge of hostile and the seats were worn and uncomfortable. you couldnt even get a pillow on our return flight we had the same experience except the crew were a bit friendlier. i would never recommend this carrier. lisbon to oslo 25 june flight number dy1787. it was below expected even for a low cost. flight was delayed more than an hour. we ordered drinks which they took more than half an hour to be delivered. then we ordered a second time and the flight hostess indicated that we should go to the front and order there because she was too busy to help us. i mean its not free. we are paying customers and even for a low cost we deserve a little service. so many problems with this airline pretending to have a longhaul service. they are constantly using older leased aircraft even though they advertised the boeing dreamliner experience. when they do actually use the dreamliner any minor technical issue creates massive delays over several hours and a domino effect for days. example flt 7002 on 19 jun delayed until past midnight due to late incoming aircraft this happens every 2 weeks it seems as i am a busy traveller to europe. the website constantly has credit card problems even though on other airline sites my card works fine. last but not least a very confusing baggage policy. most airlines to europe offer at least 1 checked bag but norwegians lower fares do not make up for all these extra fees and complications. norwegian please do yourself a favor and do not play the long haul game. i will never recommend this long haul service to anyone. my friend and i flew norwegian to europe. the plane was dirty. the staff hardly ever showed their faces. the entertainment tv did not work and the wifi they offered did not even exist. the food was interesting. our flight back from europe was even worse. people gathered and sat in the middle of the plane to charge phones laptops ipads etc. the staff left all the drinks out on the counter for everyone to help themselves. bad thing with that is they also leave out the alcohol for everyone to help themselves to free beer and wine. there were many men standing around getting drunk. free alcohol is fine when its served in moderation especially on a plane. this is a disaster waiting to happen. the 1 good thing was the flight the pilot did a a great job. just flew from tenerife south to hamburg germany. flight no. dy5366. the boarding was everyone at once instead of in sections. there was plenty of waiting time. the staff were unfriendly and hardly communicated with anyone. they didnt even bother to welcome us onboard one had to pay for food and beverages. just odd that flying to tenerife from hamburg a week earlier with air berlin food and beverages were provided without extra costs. i did have to pay for a warm lunch onboard air berlin but everything else they provided we were not charged extra for. however on this flight they came twice with their food and beverages wagon and before we could enjoy the paid beverage they were asking us to return the empty cans and plastic glasses. rushed and silly. the seats as you would expect on a low budget airline. nothing fancy about the new fleet. the toilet was a total mess by the third hour into the flight. the staff didnt even bother to say goodbye when it was time to get off the five hour journey. if i can avoid norwegian airlines i will do so with all my might supposed to fly out on july 23rd from lax to gatwick. once on the flight i thought not bad seats entertainment is ok then they announce that the flight will be delayed. we sat for another 2 hours without food or drink. then 4 hours had passed people were requesting to get off the plane. after 5 hours on the plane they announced that everyone had to exit the plane and wait in the airport for further instructions. they started announcing that the flight would be delayed until later in the evening the following day. i received a text the next morning saying the flight would be at 5pm around noon the flight changed again until 8 pm. arriving back at the airport the flight was delayed a half hour. show up to the gate for boarding time around 7.30 pm and no plane. 3 hours later the flight is cancelled again. staff were unfriendly. do not fly this airline no matter what the saving is. i was recently stranded in stockholm when our trip was cancelled on an overseas stockholmoakland trip. my biggest complaint is the way the norwegian air staff continued to lie to us about the problem not telling us that the reason we were not flying was because of a dangerous technical fault in the plane. we got a variety of answers such as ac failure to a software problem. our plane kept getting delayed later and later even though they could have told us much earlier in the day so that we could have found flights on other airlines. delayed by over 28 hours. additionally the overseas planes dont have wifi and is falsely advertised on their website as well as incorrectly told over the phone by the norwegian staff. i would advise everyone to not fly with norwegian air. booked premium class seat on flights to and from europe on the new dreamliner. tiny side note about the dreamliner why do they need to automate everything what was wrong with pull down window shades they have this automatic dimmer thing that doesnt work. bathrooms are fancy and unusable. flight out was fair. premium class gets you a bigger seat but do not expect much more than that. small meal comes in a box. if you want a snack or extra soda be prepared to pay for it. i bought a box of chips which cost me 3.00 for a tiny little bag. flight home to oakland was where it really broke down. arrived at the stockholm airport arn 4 hours ahead of my departure time of 16.30. i was notified at check in that the flight was delayed two hours. sat at the airport waiting. they then added more delay time and presented everyone with meal vouchers. 100 swedish kroner. sounds like a lot until you go to buy something. finally after checking the website for norwegian i noticed they still hadnt changed the status of the flight and showed it leaving on time. i walked over to the counter where i learned that the flight was cancelled. no notice no announcement. nothing. so i do as instructed by the women in charge and collect my luggage and find the counter where they are giving out vouchers for hotels. they inform me that the flight will be delayed until 18.30 the following day no other flights are available as it is too late. i collect another 150 kroner voucher almost enough for 2 beers. i go to sleep and wake up to find out the flight is delayed again. the new time is now 20.30. so the bottom line is this. norwegian knew the flight would be cancelled as the plane was still sitting in los angeles at the time i originally checked in. it didnt even leave la until 2.00 the next morning if they had told me then that the flight was cancelled i could have had a better chance of getting another flight. i have flown from lgw to arlanda and return both times i have been delayed 5 hours and then 6 hours. no information all flights from london to stockholm delayed. never fly with norwegian unless you can wait in an airport departure lounge. once on board no refreshments and only one member of flight crew no trolley service nothing. in future i will fly easyjet or ryanair. both are basic but at least they are on time. i flew to oakland ca from stockholm via norwegian air and was sorely disappointed with the entire experience. the flight was delayed for over seven hours with no explanation or communication. my husband only found out about the delay when he checked us in online the airline did not bother to send us a notification email. we were subsequently forced to endure a redeye flight instead of the pleasant midday flight we were expecting. several of the flight attendants were snippy and rude likely due to the inconvenience this delay caused them as well. further the exit row seating is severely cramped diminishing the comfort. overall i would avoid this airline in the future and would advise others to do so as well. dy7091 july 1 2014. when we boarded the plane we noticed that there was residue all over the tray table in my seat and the seat next to mine. i alerted the flight attendant and she gave me a napkin and told me to clean it up. i would expect that the airplane would be clean and habitable. when i went to the bathroom to wet the napkin i noticed the bathroom had not been cleaned from the prior flight. once the flight started we were told that the entertainment system on the plane did not work. it did not work the entire flight even though the crew stated that they reset it numerous times. it is difficult to fly with children for 12 hours without entertainment. we paid for a service we did not receive. i ordered a meal for my wife online and stated that she had a nut allergy. when the food was being served on the plane there was absolutely no order to it and the flight attendants did not seem to know what they were serving. i asked the flight attendant about the food and she had no idea what was being served. she did however state that she thought there were no nuts but then states she did not have a roster of what was to be served. had we known that norwegian was going to hire a second rate charter company to fly us home from copenhagen where the plane was dirty the food was bad the entertainment system did not work and the staff were rude we would not have booked the flight. we will never fly norwegian again. my first and last norwegian flight from ft lauderdale fl to copenhagen connecting flight to munich and then thessaloniki was delayed 2.5 hours without giving notice by text or email on july 15th 2014. upon arriving to the ft lauderdale airport 2 hrs prior to flight we were told flight was delayed 2 hrs which made us miss both connecting fights in copenhagen and munich hence having to repurchase new expensive tickets in copenhagen re routing us to stockholm and then to our final destination in greece thessaloniki. this airline might less expensive but they charge for blankets pillows earphones food on an almost 10 hr flight. on our returning flight of 9 hours we were denied food or drinks by flight attendant our flight was scheduled for 8pm from lax to london. the boarding process was delayed an hour or so which is fine. we sat on the plane for another 1.5 hrs this was a little strange there was no explanation given. after another hour the pilot told us that we needed to be towed so technicians could take a look. after another 4 hours on the plane he announced that the plane was not able to fly. we were towed back and got off the plane. there were no hotels available so we slept in the airport that night. the next day we were scheduled to board at 8pm. the boarding time was once again delayed an hour and then an hour again. after 3 more hours the pilot again asked that the plane was unable to fly. we are still waiting to hear how we are getting to london. our whole european family vacation has been thrown off because of this airline. although it is more affordable then most other airlines avoid norwegian at all costs the flight from lax to london on norwegian airs dreamliner was superb. the crew were friendly and polite. the seats were comfortable. the entertainment system worked perfectly. the upgraded nice and tasty meal was quite good. a wonderful experience then came the return flight from copenhagen to lax. we waited 6 hours in the airport and 1 hour on the plane before takeoff with no explanations. the customer service offered a 10 meal voucher but they were almost offensive in their behavior. thinking we would be returning on the same airline that we flew to europe on was an assumption we should not have made. to our dismay the dreamliner was mia and instead we ended up on euroatlantic. as if that wasnt enough of a stunner the entertainment system was a total joke no wifi our paid for nice and tasty upgraded meal never manifested and when we inquired about it the flight attendant got irritated acting as though we were out of line to even ask. never would i fly norwegian air again without an absolute guarantee that it would be the dreamliner both ways which will never happen. i cant understand why norwegian air would choose a rickety old plane with a rude crew to substitute. the one good thing the pilot did get us home safely. delayed over 43 hours on a flight home from lax to lgw. the delay annoying as it was is made 100 times worse by the customer care or lack of. being left for two nights to sleep on an airport floor with out blankets food and water is not acceptable. families and travellers were left with no instructions on what to and where to sleep when no hotels could be provided. had a 42hour delay on jfkstockholm with no information at all about when the plane would depart and why the delay actually occurred. the only thing they helped one with was a bad sunchair that they called bed. well not really. poor airline. avoid norwegian is my honest opinion and let me explain so many reasons why last week i accompanied my niece from lax to lgw on norwegians advertised dreamliner aircraft. it turned into a 3 day delay and since we live hours away my niece had to sleep in the airport as no hotel rooms were offered. we were given limited info from the handling agents at lax for norwegian since apparently there is no actual norwegian staff at any airport. i tried to call customer service. after excruciatingly long wait times we got a very unfriendly person who sounded like they did not want to be there. i read other reviews where norwegian farms out the dreamliner sometimes to a leasing company and much older aircraft well i did not believe it until my niece got a text message that her return flight would be on such an aircraft. it is nothing like the dreamliner they proudly advertise. well my mother always said if you want cheap then you will get cheap. now i see it firsthand. avoid. we missed our connecting flight from paris to copenhagen. we contacted norwegian airlines at orly airport who informed us the flight would not be refunded or changedthe flight would still stand as is. so after spending 1000 euros to get trains to copenhagen to catch our flight it was then delayed 5 hours and they switched us to an euroatlantic boeing 777200 from 1998 instead of the dreamliner we had paid for the plane was dirty with food debris and trash all over and under seats. very apparent it had not been cleaned at all. seat arms were broken the light switch above the seat broke apart when turned on. also the tvs did not work. on some tvs there was no audio. no entertainment package games or wiif that we had paid for and been promised. also the crew seemed lost and confused obviously operating on a plane they were not familiar with. no complimentary drinks for 7 hours in between the 2 meals provided. the stewards were never around never collected trash. i had to seek them out in the back of the plane where they were standing leaning over earplugs in playing on their iphones oblivious and disengaged from passengers and their needs. after reading all the previous comments it appears norwegian maybe doing a bait and switch promising paid dreamliner tickets but providing defunct broken dirty old planes but collecting premium money for it. norwegian did it to us also. our flight was dy7091 copenhagen to lax aboard the dreamliner on august 2nd. we also never received a text or phone call about the delay. upon arriving at the airport and checking in we were given vouchers to eat to make up for the 5 hour delay. no one ever told us about the plane change. we proceeded to board a euro atlantic plane which we just assumed was maybe a sister company not the case. our flight was the most miserable flight. this plane was old dirty and even had ashtrays. we sat in seats that had white stuff sprayed all over from the previous flight and cups on the floor. one of the sinks in a bathroom was broken and another bathroom was completely out of service. the inflight entertainment or tvs did not work for most of the seats. the ones that did work had grainy and rolling pictures or no audio. my arm rest was broken and kept pinching me. you could not get a pillow or blanket. the overhead lights and remotes were hit and miss if they worked. this plane had no wifi staff that were clueless missing and just plain lazy. they did provide 2 meals with a drink. the food was ok no drinks were offered between the meals that were served 1 hour 30 mins after take off and before landing. my kids were bored and had no entertainment but me for 11 hours as their ds died while being used in the airport during the delay. this was a horrible flight for an adult but worse for a family with kids. warning it looks like this is a common practice for norwegian if you can get your money back try to or take a different flight completely. this is an unacceptable chartered plane norwegian has leased to deal with the dreamliner problem and they have been doing this to passengers for months. terrible service one of the worst flights ive been on. flew from riga to miami. my connecting flight was final call 1 hr before takeoff. the lounge they packed us in was tiny causing most of us to have to sit on the floor. inflight services were terrible no beverages were offered periodically instead you would have to request awkwardly. i dont mind being charged for what i eat what was terrible was that there was no real food to choose from only nachos chips peanuts and garbage food. this service was not available for large potions of the flight. at the end off the long flight i was feeling very starved. cost of flight included nothing which makes it hard to compare with flights that do when shopping. extra for choosing seats no included check baggage. my bag that was 5kg over weight cost 185. will never fly again. dy7087 stockholmarn to los angeleslax. do not fly norwegian airlines 2pm flight started with a 3hr delay and became a 9hr delay. 8012014. no info no updates no vouchers stuck in stockholm. went to another airline to trade in the ticket and was told no one will accept or deal with norwegian airlines. save yourself the headache. do not fly norwegian airlines. my first and last time with norwegian. i flew from stockholm to nyc on july 30th and returned on august 6th. i booked with norwegian because they offered a unique experience about the 787 and direct flights to nyc. i checked the flight status before leaving for the airport my flight was delayed more than 5 hours with a new departure of 11 pm instead of 5.30pm. i went to the airport on time to learn that the flight was definitely delayed because of a technical issue on the plane that occurred 2 days ago. after waiting 4 hours at the airport with my luggage we were allowed to drop our luggage and checkin. i waited 1.5 hrs to drop my luggage. at the desk the receptionist discreetly ask me if i would agree to switch to another flight because of overbooking the following day and norwegian would offer me 600€. however they were not able to tell me if the flight would be on time and if overbooking problems would be absorbed. i refused as i had to be in nyc the next day and he gave me a voucher for a meal. we were waiting 45 minutes without any explanations. finally we took of at 11.45 more than 6 hours after the scheduled departure. the plane was an old and dirty euroatlantic plane seats were narrow plane was dirty. the euroatlantic crew were welcoming but it didnt change the fact that the plane was so uncomfortable. to return we were on euroatlantic again with limited entertainment. the flight was only delayed one hour which was a good surprise. the plane was indeed old with limited entertainment but still better than the first one as we had larger seats and individual screens. seats were old and not in a good shape but the crew were nice and we arrived 40 minutes late in stockholm. overall my experience with norwegian was not good at all. i will never fly with them again we are currently sitting on a norwegian airplane at gatwick airport. we were supposed to leave at 7.15pm but are still at the gate at 8.32pm no one has given us any information and the plane is sweltering hot ok weve finally been told that theres a fault with plane but theyre not letting us off for another 20 min because there isnt anyone to authorise us getting off. this is a total joke. dy7006 1 aug 2014 new york  stockholmarlanda. the original booking was to take the flight on the dreamliner but that did not occur and the flight was subcontracted out to portuguese air. this appears to be a common practice for this airline and after reading the reviews is the basis of many of the complaints. we booked first class and found accommodations no better than economy. no pillows and few blankets. flight crew was more interested in socializing during the flight rather than addressing the needs of customers. no entertainment during the entire 7 hour flight. some of the restrooms were nonfunctional. food was substandard. but what concerned me most was a lack of safety culture by the staff. upon landing customers jumped out of their seats and started removing items from the overhead bins and remained standing as the plane proceeded to the airport. not a word was said to anyone by the staff. in all my years of travel i have never observed such unsafe behavior. this is a no frills airline so take this into account before you begin the journey. i have travelled quite often with norwegian air during the past. i have always been satisfied with their service until i travelled on flight dy1633 from vienna to oslo on 25 july 2014 when the walls fell in. the incoming flight from oslo was about 3 hours late in arriving in vienna. the waiting passengers were not aware of the reason for the planes delay in arriving. shortly after the planes arrival in vienna 5 or 6 austrian police appeared and started taking 4 or 5 of the awaiting passengers out for further interrogation. no explanation was given by a member of the ground staff as to the reason for the 3 hour delay in arriving at vienna which was apparently due to the connecting flight from bodø to oslo being delayed 3 hours because of fog. when we got on board at about 00.30 an explanation was given by the captain as to the delay. drinks were available on the flight but had to be paid for instead of being offered free of charge after such a long delay. the flight eventually arrived at oslo airport at about 03.00 over 3 hours late as i had 2 tickets for the airport train to sandvika i asked one of the flight attendants how i could get to sandvika as no trains were available at that late hour. i was given a short rude reply to contact norwegian airs service company at oslo airport. i eventually did and the service company rudely told me to take a waiting bus to oslo centre and a taxi on to sandvika and make a claim to norwegian air afterwards. lack of information and rude flight attendants with in my opinion little experience has made me think twice about travelling with norwegian air again. we flew low fare from fort lauderdale florida fll to copenhagen denmark cph on august 7. i had read the reviews so i knew what to expect  delays and no frills. our flight was delayed 1 hour found out via fll website  no big deal. we did not pre order food baggage or reserve seats. flying as a couple we checked in together and we assigned consecutive seats. aircraft was new media selection was good. hard to sleep  lots of interruptions. there were 9 seats per row so a 333 set up. its a 9 hour flight its an economy airline its what i expected. dont buy food on the plane  it starts at 4 cokes and 8 mini baileys. as a couple in our twenties traveling to europe on a budget it was satisfactory. we have 2 more norwegian flights while here  will review again. note on the fll airport if you have a late evening flight be prepared that the shopsfood close around 8.30  disappointed not to get a meal. not even a cup of water will be offered to you on the plane. headphonesblankets not free. i brought a big sweater  that was a good decision. flew vnoarncph. first sector vno to arn i could not buy food or drink unless i had swedish kroners in cash. i was told that the credit card machine didnt work so i asked them to make a manual imprint of the card which they do at all other civilised airlines but they refused. i then asked to get at least some water but because they only wanted swedish cash this was not possible either. the guy next to me wanted to buy a cup of coffee this was not possible because as it turned out also the coffee machine was broken. on the arncph sector cabin staff couldnt finish their job fast enough to have a break. my seat was passed in less than three seconds and i could get the attention of the cabin staff after that. i did get to my destination on time but all this is just not good enough and it wasnt cheap either. if norwegian want to be accepted as a serious airline they should start acting as one. i booked to travel from lax to lgw on 23rd july 2014 at 20.30. this was the start of the most horrendous travel experience i have had. i was travelling alone with my young son and the whole ordeal was incredibly stressful. after 4 hours on the tarmac with nothing but crisps and coke had to wait over 2 hours for this the flight was cancelled. the airline could not  or would not  provide hotel accommodation for the night so we came home. we were rescheduled to fly 24 hours later but this was cancelled too. technical issues. again no hotels and no alternative flights. just as my son and i were about to sleep in the airport norwegian did save some grace by finding us a hotel room. we eventually flew at 12.30pm on 25th july  2.5 days late. yes norwegian were cheap which is why we tried them. however these economies were evidenced with shoddy planes no support network with other airlines and they were quite frankly bullied by lax airport. even though the flight itself was faultless once it took off and the return flight fine i will never fly with norwegian again. my company and i mostly travel on sas in the nordic region. heading up our company in this region i wanted to try out the highly advertised dreamliner to and from new york. traveling to ny from cph was fantastic. i had booked premium class. going to ny i enjoyed the great seats and also quite good service. norwegian had the return flight operated by titan airways a budget carrier from the uk. with an all coach seating arrangement. norwegian did not inform us despite their website saying that if a different plane is used the customer will get informed prior to the flight. the check in people at jfk said this other plane had also premium seats. so do did the gate crew. all lies. one of my fellow travelers noticed that on his reservation document from 1 week before the trip it already said titan airways operated meaning that norwegian already knew before the outbound trip that the return flight would not be the dreamliner. norwegian however sold us premium tickets for both outbound and inbound flight. i have traveled a lot throughout my career but have never seen airline just advertising one product but selling another without telling the customer. not at the time of buying nor at the time of checkin. besides the fact that the premium class customers had to travel unexpectedly in a very tight coach seat they now also need to go through the hassle of claiming money back. it is service of the very worst kind. norwegian doesnt have enough dreamliners to accommodate all the dreamliner routes they advertise and sell. when customers pay you for a flying experience aboard the dreamliner that is what we expect to receive. instead they switched everyone onto an ancient tvless smaller nondirect flight due to the dreamliner being unavailable. im sorry to inform you however that when a plane is not booked enough and you dont want to waste money you cant just say that the original plane is no longer available. what you do is suck up the losses like a real company and fulfil customers orders at a loss. due to this unfair decision passengers had their direct flight aboard the dreamliner changed into a 2.5 hour flight to iceland a 1 hour refuel where everyone was stuck onboard and then an 8.5 hour flight to oakland. because of your decision to change your passengers to a smaller plane not capable of making the entire trip from norway to oakland without a refuel you wasted about 4 hours of our time. flight dy7063. it seems as if the downgrading of the plane is a common occurrence for this airline so i highly do not recommend traveling with them. got to airport in oslo to go back home to oakland last month. my partner and our 3 year old and 1 year old. we find out on the day of the flight that there was a stopover in iceland that they added without telling anyone. the flight was delayed by over an hour. plus this extra 2.5 hours because they needed to refuel this incredibly out of date plane they put us on. no dreamliner for us. no tv. my seat wouldnt recline. the service was awful. the flight was awful. we will never use norwegian again the worst airline i have ever dealt with. my daughters first trip to europe begins with a flight from lax to amsterdam with a stopover in copenhagen.. flight is delayed 4 hours causing her to miss connection. we were told she would be put up in a hotel since her connecting flight would be 24 hours later. she reported to us the plane was old and very uncomfortable seating. once in copenhagen she was told to find her own hotel and submit a receipt to be reimbursed later. she could find a hotel with any vacancies. the airport tried to help but they couldnt find one either. forced to stay the duration in the airport. was also told they had misplaced her luggage but were working on it. customer service is awful. no interest in helping you whatsoever we asked for a drink once airborne as the stewardess came past and she said that the passengers who had paid for a meal would be served first and that the snack bar would open for all other passengers after this time but she could give us water until then. 3 hours later the snack bar opened. having to ask for water for 3 hours was totally unacceptable. i have flown with other carriers who open serve the customers who have paid for the meal along with the ones who have opted out but all i was told repeatedly was that i would have to wait until the rest of the passengers were fed and watered many times. i will never fly this airline again. absolutely awful experience. 20 hour delay on sep 17 from stockholm to nyc. no hotel. no offer of compensation. the issue was a technical problem due to ventilation. no chance to book a hotel either since they kept moving the departure 2 hours at a time pretty much ensuring that we had to stay by the gate. supposed to leave on the 17th at 5.30pm. left at 12.30pm the next day. slept by the gate with 100s of other passengers. when we did take off  icing on the cake made us pay for our blankets never again. as a world traveler i have to say that flying norwegian was among the worst flying experiences ive had. i traveled internationally from jfk to sweden via oslo and back on a direct flight from sweden. the outbound flight was delayed almost an hour which i can live with. the boarding process was handled smoothly and expeditiously  the plane was nice and state of the art e.g. nice ptv monitors led lighting and relatively comfy seats for coach. they didnt seem to belong to a low budget airline in the least. upon boarding i summoned a flight attendant to request a blanket. i was directed to request it via my monitor by selecting the snack bar option. at first i figured that to be pretty cool and different until i realized that the reasoning behind the whole snack bar concept was to pay 5 for my blanket. definitely a first for me on an international flight. subsequently they made an announcement about food being served. i dozed off for 10 minutes while they were serving food. as i awoke i realized most the passengers had been served except myself and the person traveling with me who had also dropped off. i proceeded to summon the flight attendant and asked to be served food to which she responded im sorry but the snack bar is now closed youll have to wait until we clean up to preorder your food and walked off. i proceeded to summon a second male flight attendant and exclaimed that we were hungry at that very moment if it was possible for someone to please bring something for us. he immediately responded that there were only 7 flight attendants working the flight and that it would take a while before they cleaned up. upon going to the snack bar via my tv monitor to preorder my meal i was outraged. not only could i not eat when i wanted to but i also had to pay for my meal on a 6.5 hr international flight chicken sandwich 10 cheese sandwich 10 water 4 salad 11 snack box 10 tapas 13  all separate and individually charged. by this point i didnt think things could get worse but the worst was yet to come. upon my complaining about the poor service i was told by my ever so friendly male flight attendant that a this is all stated on their website and that i shouldve looked. unfortunately for me someone else purchased my ticket so i was unable to learn of this and i didnt think to look because i didnt know this was even possible on an international flight out of the us. b that there were several places i couldve eaten at the terminal before boarding. c that norwegian is a low budget airline and that they have to make money somehow never mind the amount of money paid for my ticket which i figured shouldve included some level of professionalism and courteous service and d that i have the option of choosing a different airline to fly with in the future dont have to tell me twice. i guess low budget also means bad treatment and sarcastic unprofessional and tactless flight attendants. on our way back the aircraft was dirty and poorly maintained. the inflight entertainment was nothing like on the outbound flight no movie selections very small and old monitors. in conclusion no one should spend their hard earned money on flying this way below average airline. save yourself the headache and the frustration. spend a few extra dollars on a worthwhile airline that treats people respectfully feeds their passengers accordingly and doesnt charge their passengers exorbitant and outrageous fees for food and poor service. on the other hand if for whatever reason you must fly norwegian make sure you pack blankets pillows bring your own food and arent hungry when taking a long flight with them. and dont ask for anything of the flight attendants otherwise youre going to get a sarcastic and rude response for the most part. sadly this airline is a misrepresentation of norwegian culture. we flew with norwegian from gatwick to tenerife. it was on time taking off however i found the service and staff very lack lustre bored and totally missing for the whole flight. pressed call button to ask for water eventually a bored looking attendant turned up no smile or can i help you  just said 1.50. nobody to say goodbye when you disembarked the whole crew looked absolutely fed up. what a miserable airline. would i use again not by choice. my family and i were held up in traffic on the m25 but arrived at gatwick just in time to clear security and board the flight. norwegian did not provide any assistance in clearing security and did not inform the gate that a party of 5 people had been issued with boarding cards and were expected to join the flight. norwegian did not arrange for any tannoy announcements that may have allowed us to clear security quickly. when we arrived at the gate it was closed and we had to wait for an hour in the departure area before being allowed to leave. norwegian then stated that the cheapest alternative flight to our destination was about 700 gbp and that this offer would only be available for a short time. on refusing the offer and returning home i managed to book an alternative flight for 450gbp. staff service has thus been rated as very poor. berlintenerife south. flight on time newlooking but very dirty b737800  rubbish left everywhere seatbelts not folded some old papers and cups on the floor seat pockets etc. full flight so no food left for purchase after few first rows just a drinks and some expensive sweets even though flight was almost 5 hours. crew was simply doing their job but no smiles no interaction with passengers. free wifi which is amazing kept me busy for duration of the journey otherwise  typical low cost with not much expectations. flew with norwegian yesterday cphals with stop over in oslo. the first plane was delayed 1 hour meaning i had 10 min to catch connecting flight before departure. however i needed to transfer the luggage myself and make an additional checkin this being norwegian law. i asked at check in if i could get some help through the fast lane security clearance or any assistance since i would be stuck in oslo otherwise. they offered me the chance to buy it even though it was their flight that caused the delay in the first place. fortunately als flight was also delayed one hour in the end so i managed to get on. in addition they have started with the same concept as ryanair you will have to fit your dutyfree purchase in the hand luggage otherwise you have to pay. norwegian just lost another 3 customers. we were pleased when they launched their london gatwick to rome service as we go to rome quite frequently. christmas 2013 they were superb. amidst considerable chaos at gatwick they left pretty much on time and got us there fine. however since then they managed to give my wife a 6 hour delay rome to london gatwick at easter 2014 turning a late night flight into an early morning flight. last night  dec 28th 2014  my daughter and i were on the 21.55 from rome to gatwick which suffered a 4 hour delay and i finally got to bed at 6.30am. they were also an hour late on the outbound flight. my advice would be to avoid. the late evening slot they have at rome means a delay does turn into a real inconvenience particularly if you are supposed to go to work next day. communication from their customer service staff almost non existent. got the feeling they were scared of us and that these delays were pretty common. also nothing to do with norwegian but rome fiumicino airport is pretty awful for being stuck at late at night. everything shut no food or drink and horrible metal chairs with fixed metal armrests so you cant lay out on even though there was plenty of space. people started laying on the floor. anyway on 6 flights we have had a 1 hour a 4 hour and a 6 hour delay so im not interested any more fortunately london to rome i have many options. high fares low service and reliability flight from munich to las palmas oneway ticket was app. eur 500. started with a delay of nearly 2 hours. no information nor apologies. the small choice of food or beverages onboard had to be paid. even the water despite the delay. seats not very comfortable service from cabin crew below standard even for lowcost carriers. free wifi onboard. summary  no choice never again. straight to the point  useless airline. why no seat reservation possible online buslike airport staff and cabin crew like what you would see on a bus journey. awful on board customer service. a norwegian version of ryanair. someone please tell me what is good about norwegian air specifically customer service before this flight i travelled to qatar and osaka with qatar airways a proper professional airline with excellent quality customer service. my flight was 0600 from london gatwick to tenerife saturday 31 january. i took an early morning flight 6.30am to stockholm arlanda airport with my 4 month old son. yes the flight was cheap but it was cheap for a reason. when we arrived at the airport they made us unpack one bag because it was too heavy it seemed like everyones bags were too heavy because quite a few people including us had to buy excess baggage. it just went downhill after that to be honest. they dont make special provisions for mothers and children. make you queue for an hour to board the plane then they are completely indifferent to the fact that maybe a mother might need help with her handbag and baby paraphernalia. what infuriated me the most was that the stewardess saw me struggle with my bag and baby but she thought it was a good time to show me how to use the baby seatbelt. even at the airport when they placed my pram with the heavy baggage no one made me aware. i was fraught and teary eyed time i got to my relatives place. with the help of two good samaritans i was able to collect my baggage and pram. again the airport staff at the arlanda were cold and indifferent. overall it was the worst experience of my life. never again will i fly with norwegian airlines. i do not recommend that first time mothers fly with them. i repeat they do not have any specific rules when it come to people with children unlike british airlines. travelled back via norwegian air from miami 2212. this was the return following med and carib cruise. no drink provided no food provided after 3 hr wait used snack bar service all sold out complained to cabin staff who explained this is the homeward trip nothing left to say service was poor is an understatement. due to fly to tromso from lgw today for trip of a lifetime to see the northern lights. it wasnt to be. norwegian pilots went on strike over the weekend but that was not supposed to affect non domestic flights today monday afternoon. we watched the oslo flight depart and went to the gate when advertised 50 minutes before departure. as we reached the gate something was clearly wrong. i asked if the flight was cancelled and was told that they were just looking into it. so i checked the airlines website. the flight was cancelled. people were called to get refunds for their duty free. still no announcement that the flight was cancelled. the rest of us were asked to collect or baggage. at no time was the flight announced as cancelled. we queued to rebook but it was clear that we would miss half of our short break. apparently the pilot due to take the plane to tromso had not reported to work. i would have appreciated some information clear and concise about what was happening. i had to resort to twitter and the companys website and this simply isnt good enough. i will never recommend the airline to friends or business colleagues and on a personal level i am bitterly disappointed not to be visiting norway to see the aurora borealis which was a long held wish which my wife had bought for me as a christmas present. yesterday my family and i flew norwegian from london gatwick to new york jfk. the flight was supposed to depart at 6.10pm and actually left at 6.32 which was fine no big deal. we knew that we are in for no service at all the entire flight since we had not booked meals. this really was not that bad because the entertainment system was the best i have ever seen. the touch screens are the most responsive in the air our real problem was landing at jfk. there was weather issues at jfk resulting in hundreds of delays and cancellations so we were lucky to land. all the international gates were in use and couldnt unload the plane. this resulted in numerous trips around the airport going to gates that claimed to be open. we need up being on the tarmac for about 2 hours and 50 minutes. the really annoying thing was that the crew was just sitting in the back of the plane on their phones. the customer rights on norwegian state that food and drinks will be provided on tarmac delays in the usa for over 2 hours. when we finally got off we went to customs which had an extremely long line with 3 officers working. after waiting for a half hour in the customs line we looked for the claim that ha our bags. there was not one screen with our flight information on it so we resorted to asking passengers where they were coming from until we found our golden ticket. we retrieved 2 bags within 15 minutes and the other we kept on waiting on. only one baggage cart was used for the massive plane so 30 bags would come then wait 20 minutes. it was extremely inefficient and caused commotion after being on a plane for 11 hours and it was 145 in the morning. we finally got the last bag at 1.57am. never going on norwegian again really enjoyed the comfort and efficiency of the newer aircraft. the cabin crew were pointedly rude and dismissive to any passengers who had not ordered a meal service in advance and overly obsequious to those who had. we had ordered a meal service which meant we also had complementary drinks and snacks. the other passengers even children were left for hours without even a drink of water. when the lovely family sitting next to us asked for water for their young wellbehaved children they waited patiently for 45 minutes and finally the dad had to go back and pick up water himself. they had not had a drink for over 5 hours. our flight was changed several times after booking which made it tricky with connecting flights but norwegian is definitely the cheapest way to fly from us to europe if you can handle the rudeness of the cabin staff who we noticed being particularly harsh with all parents who were traveling with children. the checkin staff at the desk at jfk were really helpful. flight dy7016 jfklondon gatwick. i am a frequent flyer but i have never had such a poor experience with any other airline. first on the morning of the departure date i received a text message informing me that we would not be flying in a norwegian airlines aircraft but on a hifly airbus. i paid to travel on a norwegian aircraft but had to travel on a low quality aircraft. secondly the flight was delayed by 6 hours so i had to wait around the airport for hours. norwegian refused to offer any compensation and did not even allow me to speak to a manager when the customer service advisor was rude and unhelpful on the phone. i will never travel with them again. id rather pay a bit more. used norwegian airlines to fly from lgw to lax. overall satisfactory but one incident on the return flight spoiled it all a bit. the outgoing flight was around 45 minutes late departing but did arrive to lax on time. food was pretty poor on this flight undercooked risotto is not a particular favourite of mine sandwich snack towards the end was also a poor vegetarian option a couple of pieces of bread with some cucumber and tomato thrown between them. staff were pleasant enough mainly americans. the plane itself was comfortable with good entertainment facilities. the new design made flying through turbulence a lot more pleasant than normal. however on the return flight we seemed to have mainly scandinavian flight crew and i was disappointed with how they treated the older gentleman sitting next to me. his entertainment system was broken as soon as we arrived on the plane. he caught a male member of staff as we were taking off who just waved a hand dismissively at him and walked on. he caught another male member of staff who said that if he had already reported it they were probably in the process of resetting his system. still nothing and eventually a female member came up asked if it still wasnt working and then disappeared to the front of the plane. the screen was never fixed no other member of staff offered help or even an apology. there were empty seats at the front of the plane so he could have been moved. he was wearing a hearing aid and had to put this in every time he was trying to catch a member of staffs attention. it was heartbreaking seeing him rushing to do this and being ignored. i did offer him my tv as i could share with my husband but leaning over someone else isnt quite the same. the flight itself was on time and the american flight food was much better just a shame about the crew. 3 apr 2015. they substituted a 20 year old airbus at the last minute operated by hi fly. cabin crew didnt understand a word of english meal was dreadful they didnt even cross check the doors. not an experience i would close to have for a transatlantic trip. entertainment was non existent. cheap flights are only good value for money if you actually get what you think you are buying. so much for the dreamliner experience. similar problem with another reviewer earlier essentially short noticed cancellation of flight from lax to lgw via text on the morning of the flight. the explanation was another flight was delayed due to weather and as part of the chain reaction our flight was cancelled and replaced by hifly a full 24 hours later. i asked about reimbursement of repaid accommodation in london and nobody knew. instead said i would have to wait until midnight when the oslo office opens. based on other reviews looks like this type of events occur rather frequently. buyers beware. my flight back from los angeles to london was cancelled and postponed to the next day they did offer expense reimbursement. the next day we flew with an hour and a half delay because of security maintenance no announcement onboard we just sat there wondering what was happening. the plane was probably from the 80s one that had no media screens no audio of any sort food was terrible and frankly the crew were not the nicest. i was late for my eurostar connection in london. turns out their website is going through some planned maintenance work just after this disastrous event what a coincidence. all in all you might save a little money but you will also waste a lot of time and have a very poor service. never again. my flight back from los angeles to london was cancelled and postponed to the next day they did offer expense reimbursement. the next day we flew

just after this disastrous event what a coincidence. all in all you might save a little money but you will also waste a lot of time and have a very poor service. never again. helagp on norwegian and although we are very active travellers this was our first experience with norwegian. first we found out that unlike any other airline weve experienced norwegian didnt allow us to gate check our sons stroller. next we were told the departure is delayed by an hour which turned into over two hours in the end. then we had a problem with the car rental we had booked through norwegian as norwegian hadnt informed the rental company avis of our flight number. because of that we almost ended up stranded at the malaga airport with no rental car. on the way back we received a text message from norwegian telling us the flight back will be delayed by over two hours. to avoid waiting at the airport we stayed at our hotel and arrived at the airport checkin desk about 1.5 hours later than originally scheduled to match the new departure time as we were told by the airline. only to find out that the departure time had been changed again now to an earlier time and so we missed our flight we werent the only passengers who were left behind in malaga because of the confusing text messages from norwegian. the airline rerouted us home on another flight through stockholm and again there were delays. in the end as we finally arrived in helsinki again norwegian had lost some of our luggage. and the customer service line was completely closed on the weekend. weve learned our lesson now to never again fly norwegian. my daughter organized a trip to england. we were to travel norwegian. i usually use european airlines and thought norwegian airlines were a national norwegian airline not a budget basic one. the outgoing trip was 6 hours late which basically lost us one day of our holiday. it was cramped poor service basically awful. i was shocked. on the return trip i decided to upgrade to what they call premier class. to my surprise there was no advantage in boarding the plane poor announcements late announcement of gate so everyone did not know where to go. the seat was definitely better but it ended there. plastic glasses hostile service awful food. i was frankly shocked. on arrival usually business class luggage comes out first no not on norwegian my luggage was last. it was really like a bad joke. never again. beware of norwegian airline. 4th may flight dy 5164. shambolic from beginning to end. will not be using norwegian air again. six hour delay at barcelona airport. no explanation as to why and no apology. moved to three different gates. staff not welcoming and no evidence of training in customer care. we were charged for refreshments when i would have expected them to be free after so much inconvenience. other airlines superior in all aspects. our flight from london gatwick was ok and as expected for a budget flight ok food ok entertainment quite a few people were not fed and not sure why they were not being fed. however we were. then some 25 minutes out of orlando we were notified by the captain there was a problem with landing as the weather was bad. the flight circled for some time then diverted to fort lauderdale. we were told we would refuel then fly up to orlando. after some time on the ground and 10pm at night we were told they were going to get us accommodation overnight in fort lauderdale and fly us up in the morning. if this was not possible they would bus us up tonight. we found out as soon as we got off the plane this was not the case and norwegian air knew it. there was no one to help 250 dumped passengers at now 12 pm at night in fact 5am in the morning passenger time 160 miles away from their destination. passengers in their 90s with wheelchairs and infants left in a now closing terminal in the middle of the night. with no onward help and no organised accommodation possible in a fully booked convention weekend in fort lauderdale. their was one a representative from bamhama air trying to help giving advice. groups of passengers were stuck in the small hours negotiating the taxi rate up to orlando a trip of four hours. in summery dont trust them if things go ok you will probably be fine but if things go at all wrong you will be dumped and you wont see them for dust. on the 11th april i took a flight from london gatwick to orlando. sometime before we arrived we were told that instead of orlando we were going to land in ft. lauderdale we were then told by the staff that the flight would fuel up before we take off again to orlando. after being on the plane for an hour or so we were then told that the flight would not go to orlando that night but leave the next day. however all the passengers would be taken care of by the airline since they were going to provide a hotel and transportation. after an hour we deplane and after we had immigration and customs check the ground staff said we have to care for ourselves as they could not provide us transportation and hotels for the night. i was very angry as they did not keep their word and many were left stranded. i will never want to go with this airline again. the passengers had a very poor customer service by them. laxlgw. may 27th 2015. dy7096. lgwfco. may 28th 2015. dy2500. its quite weird that for an international flight even if you are in economy class they dont serve any type of meal or drink  this is not comfortable at all. when i asked for water they gave me a little glass when i asked for a second time they were quite upset about that. i dont know any company who has such a restrictive baggage policy  why do all companies that operate internationally allow 23kg of check in baggage while norwegian offers just 20 kg. if you want headphone you have to pay 3 dollars if you want the blanket other 5 dollars. i will be first of many to rage about the service from this airline but i am one of the few who decided to cut my losses and pay to fly back with easyjet as the rest of the passengers of the 10.25am flight yesterday are still waiting to take off it is due to leave at 6.30pm fri. the flight to barcelona at 10am was also cancelled due to technical fault they were taken to a hotel as were not leaving until next day. a thunderstorm that morning stopped planes from landing. our plane went to split instead. there was no announcement from airport as airline didnt contact them instead they emailed and texted passengers that morning and most had no wifi and phones were off. in the next few hours all the other airlines landed and took their passengers but not norwegian. instead of vouchers for food and drink were had one meal at 1pm pasta and bottle of water that was all and we left at 8.30pm. we were told the plane would be leaving at 12.40am thurs i have since heard that it was delayed again to 6pm thursday and passengers went to a hotel. all attempts at contacting customer service was futile. clearly they run it on a shoestring and when things go wrong there is no capacity to fix it. we were scheduled to fly from oakland california to budapest via oslo on norwegian on may 30. we received an sms message that or flight was going to be delayed. a short while later we received another message saying that our flight would leave on time as scheduled however it would be serviced by another carrier that i have never heard of. we then found out from other passengers that the flight was cancelled and that all passengers were rebooked on a flight leaving 2 days later on monday night june 1. we then discovered that the rescheduled flight was delayed until tuesday morning june 2. i called norwegians customer service number and after waiting on hold for 1 hour and 55 minutes spoke to a rude service representative who said my only options were to cancel or to go on my trip 3 days later than the orginal departure date. i asked to be rescheduled on an alternate carrier a 3 day delay being utterly ridiculous. the representative told me that would not be possible. she said that norwegian would put us up in a hotel at oakland airport and would issue a 20 per person meal allowance. she refused to let me speak to a supervisor and would not disclose the reason why. she then proceeded to hang up on me. in my 40 years of air travel i have yet to encounter anything like this. the policies and conduct of this airline can only be described as outrageous. the norwegian passengers on the flight said this is a common occurrence. we were scheduled to go to jfk in nyc on thursday june 11 2015 at 6.15 pm. the flight was cancelled. we were informed that we could wait until saturday june 13th or wait for a plane from euroatlantic to arrive with a new departure time of 3 am. it took over 2 hours to receive food vouchers and new boarding passes. as we left the gate we noticed that the new boarding passes were issued to 2 people not us and for a different flight. we then tried to return to #50 departure gate to inform the agent of the error but were stopped by security. we repeatedly asked security for help but were redirected through various procedures from staff before being allowed to go back to the norwegian desk in the terminal not at the gate where they were first issued to get new boarding passes. after we received the new boarding passes we returned to the restaurant area only to learn that the food vendors had closed. we then tried to sleep in the airport at restaurant booths or chairs anything that appeared comfortable. at 2 am we returned to gate 50 as previously directed to find no personnel from norwegian. there was a security guard there who would not allow us to sit in a secured area. we were not allowed to check in or board until after 3 am and we did not depart until 4 am 10 hours after our original scheduled time. the original flight that was cancelled was the cause of this confusion and inconvenience. the misinformation from norwegian staff was also confusing and upsetting. none of the employees seemed to know procedure and provided conflicting information. yes flights are cancelled all the time but paying customers should not be treated this way. we were shuffled around with absolutely no regard for us. it was exhausting. the airline could have opened their lounge provided fresh food and a more comfortable place to rest since we had to wait an extended time. it was deplorable how we were treated. its not worth the cheap price. this airline has to be one of the worst organized companies. their customer service was rude and not helpful. my wife planed to fly out on a friday and the day before they changed her flight to a no name airline in a very old aircraft. we changed the flight to the following sunday and they just sent a text saying that the same thing was happening and her new airline had a fleet of 2 planes. when looking at airlines we took a careful look at the plane they would be flying in they booked them on a dreamliner and then tried to put them on a 20 year old plane. do not use this airline.  this was the return of a round trip started on 2432015. i knew about being charged for everything before i started this trip so i took food and water with me both flights. i saw what they fed for the outlandish price and glad i did not buy their food. this return trip was on 462015 from oslo to orlando. i figured it would be late. it was. but first the gate people came into the room and told everybody had to get out of the gate room. then a norwegian police woman searched the room looking under everything and all over. then they kept us waiting out in the hallway for a long time. then they started letting people back in and looking only at their boarding passes and passports. they did not search any luggage so what was the police search of the room for i think it was just a delay because the plane was not ready to fly. finally we boarded and left about 1 hour late. then as others had predicted the plane became very cold after they finished dinner. i noticed everybody putting on jackets and had to put mine on. i complained and was greeted by a rude stewardess. i then went to the head stewardess and she did turn the heat up. my home airport is tampa. yes i saved a few hundred crossing to oslo but after i made connections to where i was going i saved nothing and flew on a inferior airline. their planes do not have a balanced heating system they charge for everything and some of the flight crew are rude. as noted in some reviews customer service is poor. people used to talk about ryanair. now ryanair is great compared to norwegian. i wish ryanair would start a transatlantic service. i originally booked norwegian going jfkcopenhagenbangkok without reading the fine print as the price was comparable to other airlines albeit only slightly cheaper  or so i thought.  so i had a lowfare classification ticket which means that  despite the length of the trip  you get no food no bag checkin and no seat\\r\\r\\nassignment unless you pay another 33 euros for each service for each leg of the trip.  when you factor these costs into the overall price this ticket is more expensive with the worst service imaginable and is a health hazard too since you cant get water or anything should you start to feel dehydrated.  never taking this airline ever again. dy 4053 5 june. for the second time this year i flew norwegian between stockholm and malmö. for the second time there was a 2 hour delay due to mechanical problems. no compensation at all. the even wanted to charge 30sek for a cup of coffee.  never again norwegian had an experience ive never had in 20 years of traveling. about 30 minutes before we were to board we were all asked to leave the gate. they roped it off the crew sat down and proceeded to have their coffee and sandwiches while we all stood watching them standing outside the gate. came time to board the gate attendant let out that the flight was delayed. an hour later we were checked into the gate not the plane. at scheduled takeoff time we were finally informed of the delay. i dont care what the experience is from here never again i will pay the premium for my dignity. once departed flight was ok but before 2 hrs delay sitting at the gate. reason due to late incoming aircraft. fellow passenger informed 3 flights out of 3 this has happened to her. felt like 30 degree heat in the cabin  nothing to drink. water was for sale. never again with this airline even if seats were for free. 8 of us were booked for a flight on norwegian airlines from oakland to stockholm. then the day of departure we were notified that we would be flying on hifly airlines instead. first we had ordered assigned seats so that we could sit together because we had a 2.5 yr. old in our group and wanted to be able to help care for this first time flyer. we were not given seats together. secondly the planes air was not individually adjustable and the plane became very hot and stuffy throughout the flight. thirdly we were not offered water or drinks except during a meal and were told we could only have 1 drink per person throughout the 10 hour flight. that is unhealthy and unsafe. fourthly there was no entertainment in english including the childrens cartoons. also when cabin lights were dimmed for sleep the lights where food is prepped were not and the whole plane was starring into the lights. so needless to say the flight was horrible. we were scheduled to fly from jfk to oslo on june 2. we received a notification that due to technical reasons our flight was delayed. eventually our flight was cancelled. i tried to reschedule on icelandair but norwegian would not pay the difference. we were rebooked on a portuguese airline for the next day. the time of that flight was changed 4 times. lines at jfk were horrible  200 people and not nearly the staff to handle the crowd. we were issued a 15 meal voucher and told to submit our other expenses online. most places at the airport would not take the voucher because. we lost our seat assignments. there was no liquor on the flight  they forgot to restock  no wifi and no inflight entertainment. so we get to oslo a day late. our return flight was scheduled for june 11th. we got to the airport 3 hours early and were advised at 6.30 our departure time that our flight was delayed. eventually it was cancelled and we were placed on the same portuguese aircraft that departed oslo around 4 am. we spent over 12 hours in the airport and were never advised that we were entitled to a hotel room. again we were given meal vouchers but it was so late that every restaurant had closed. norwegian failed to update their website and our limo went to jfk to pick us up not knowing that we were still in oslo.  you get what you pay for. which in the case of norwegian as with most other budget airlines is a cramped seat  nothing more. dont look for the flight attendants to offer you anything at all. presumably they are on board to open the doors in case of emergency and nothing more. they were not hostile or rude and there was in fact something likeable about them especially during the brief moment they became animated while plying the duty free. dont look for the personnel on the ground to do much more than point you to where you yourself check your bag. norwegian was the first budget airline ive flown other than southwest airlines in the u.s. which is famous or notorious depending on your point of view for their happy go lucky employees on the ground and in the air. norwegian like other budget airlines makes its money by grinding personnel and other costs to dust. my last minute high season fare from oslo to oakland wasnt particularly bargain basement since i didnt plan in advance. perhaps if you can snag one of the ridiculously low fares offered in the dead of winter when purchased well in advance the lowness of the fare may outweigh the pain of the cramped seat the absence of food or drink and the second rate inflight entertainment selection.  the first sign of trouble was a text message i received the morning of the flight that told me there would be a 5 hour delay to my flight. instead of leaving at 18.30 it was scheduled to leave a 23.40. even though there was a 5 hour delay i was told that i had to check in by 17.30. this left me with hours of waiting in the airport at 22.30 when the flight was supposed to board nothing came up on the screens. i had heard that we were boarding from gate 15 so i headed that way only to be told by a fellow passenger that we had been asked to go to the information desk. once there we were told by a representative that gatwick had strict noise reduction policies that meant the flight was not allowed to land. flight was postponed until the next day they did not provide hotels for anyone and instead left all passengers to fend for themselves. i used my 90 minutes of free wifi to find myself a place  this was difficult as most places were booked up and by this point it was past midnight. we also had to recollect our checked in luggage and as there were no staff around to guide us this was chaos. the next day i returned and tried to check in using the computers as there was an hour long line to check in with staff. i was told that i could not check in using the computers as i had already checked in so i joined the line  at no point did i see any representatives of the airline nobody knew what to do or where to go. once i checked in i was given a 10 food voucher from talking to the other passengers i found out that it should have been 20 so after going through security i had to go to the information desk to get the remaining 10 voucher. the flight was supposed to board at 17.55. the time came and went and nothing came up on the screen. eventually we got a departure gate. we didnt board until past 20.00. onboard at my seat the reading light didnt work the television didnt work and when i brought this to the attention of the crew members they just shrugged. i understand that mistakes happen but the way that the airline dealt with it or didnt deal with it to be more precise was shocking. i still have my return flight to deal with but after that i will never ever book with norwegian again. stockholm arlanda  lax flight dy7087 30 july 2015 our flight home to lax was chartered out to euroatlantic airways. we were supposed to fly home on a boeing 787 but instead were flown on a very old boeing 777. this was by far my worst experience with a longhaul flight and i travel internationally about once every 12 years. i will not fly norwegian for a longhaul flight again in the future. i guess you get what you pay for. problems during preflight checkin process my seat was reassigned from 13d to 53a. i had paid extra in order to choose my seat when i booked and so this reassignment to the back of the plane was not something i was happy about. at least my husband and i were reassigned to seats next to each other which was not the case for some passengers. the preboarding process was chaos. all passengers were required to stay in a small holding area for more than 1.5 hours while waiting for announcements from staff. boarding took about 45 minutes to begin. there was then no further boarding announcements just a sudden chaotic surge of people toward the gate. no order of boarding by rows or early boarding was done. so the boarding process itself took at least another hour. by this time our flight takeoff was delayed 2.5 hours. features of this aircraft which were very disappointing aircraft was dirty and smelt. dust and food particles on seats trash stuck in various places including in the ashtrays in the armrests. the entertainment system was basically nonfunctional. after messing around with it we discovered it had about 4 analog stations showing 3 tv comedy programs in a continuous loop. often there was so much static they were impossible to watch. the audio outlets appeared to be for the old 3prong type earphones from the 1980s. using my own headset only allowed sound in one ear. the gluten free menu i had ordered was delivered promptly. the flight attendants would not collect my trash for about 2.5 hours after it was served even when i requested it to be collected. no climate control air vents for passengers. it was all centrally controlled so either was too hot or too cold the whole flight. with my window seat the window shades closed were very hot as we flew over greenland and canada. this made the flight even more uncomfortable. very limited beverage choices and provided infrequently. we had to go to the galley at the rear of the plane twice to request water. positives about this flight the seats had footrests which helped a bit with my lower back pain. relatively smooth flight once we finally took off.  see the review by a yeates. well done for leaving early. i was stranded at dubrovnik on the same flight. other airlines were flying in and out as normal. we eventually arrived at gatwick 32 hours and 10 minutes after we should have. norwegian then took over 4 weeks to provide a certificate of delay. they have now rejected the claim for passenger compensation on the grounds of exceptional circumstances ie the thunderstorm. the cabin crew were fine if a little embarassed and the captain apologised profusely for the service we received. a good number of the party we were in were aged 70s and 80s. oh and when we arrived at gatwick we had to stay on the plane for about 10 minutes as they werent ready for disembarkation. this is no way to run a service. disgraceful. we had to get to the airport really early to travel on the 6.30 flight from madrid to london. we had the app on our phones with boarding passes. when we tried to use these they failed to work. we were told to get in the queue and ask for boarding passes to be printed off. nobody appeared at the check in until 5.45am. the flight was due to leave at 6.30am. only 2 members of staff were present to check in when they did arrive. the queue was huge and everyone was fed up of having to be there so early and wait for so long. no apologies from staff. by the time we got through security it was now 6.15am. we ran to passport control to get at the gate and find another queue. staff seemed to know that the flight was delayed and not informed the customers. another customer got to the boarding gate and her app no longer worked on her phone she was told to go back out and get a ticket printed out and missed her flight. all this technology and it doesnt work staff very slow and never an apology. very poor service. nice crew the boeing 787 is very comfortable and the windows are terrific. the experience was spoiled by the insane procedure norwegian have for serving food an beverages. you have to book a meal 48hrs before the flight. if you do not i only bought my flight 36 hours ahead or you do not want their bad and very expensive food then you are in for a nasty surprise. they cater for all advance food orders first. anyone who does not have an advance order cannot get more than a glass of water for 2 hours into the flight. they go up and down the aisle dispensing food and wine and soft drinks but refuse to serve you if you did not book an advance meal. it is ridiculous and makes one feel like some sort of third class passenger. i paid the same price for my ticket but am penalized because i didnt opt to buy one of their poor meals. after 2 hours they open the electronic snack bar and you are finally allowed to get a drink. this is one of the most dreadful ideas of customer service.  we travelled premium from gatwick to los angeles as a family of four in august 2015. on the way out it was pretty good  clean comfy seats food ok. films and tv ok if a bit limited. however on the way back the crew were really sullen and unhelpful. i was travelling without my husband on the way back so had to look after my two boys on my own. the boys were offered lobster pasta or chicken curry. i asked what the kids option was and they said there wasnt one. i made a bit of a fuss about it so they went into economy to get some revolting corn dogs and hash browns. they didnt offer the boys any bread or a second drink. they didnt offer me wine  they forgot. i asked for a glass of water but had to ask 3 times because they kept forgetting. one of my sons tvs stopped working an hour and a half before we landed but despite saying they would rest it they didnt do that. they were noisy in the galley area during sleep periods. my other son was dripped on by the air con for 30 mins but the stewardess said there was nothing they could do about it. there were wine stains on my seat and i couldnt get the foot rest down.  use norwegian as a last resort when flying from nyc to europe via stockholm. stockholm airport is small and cozy with long lines and overcrowded waiting rooms. norwegian is a nofrills airline with charges for blankets upselling on seat displays. otherwise the norwegian aircraft fleet is modern with adequate legroom and ontime flights.  dont book with norwegian if it is just for the boeing 787. received a text 2 days before our travel to say we would instead be flying an airbus operated by hifly from jfk to copenhagen no rationale. we did have the option for a refund however 48 hours before all other flights are very expensive. i booked this flight and airline just because i could reserve an exit row seat for my husband who is 611 which was no longer his seat reservation. in addition the flight left 1.5 hrs late with essentially no updates from the staff. i also found it odd that the flight was operated by hi fly attendants not norwegian. there was no inflight entertainment plane was uncomfortable and very warm had to be 7680 degrees no air controls to adjust  made for a long night and tired next day. they did not weigh our carryon which i stressed about and was sure to stay under the weight limit. my experience for international travel seems very common unfortunately i didnt read the reviews first. i would have to assume norwegian doesnt own enough boeing 787s for the flights they are booking. after a 6hour delay our flight was cancelled. norwegian has no us partners and so is unable to assist in rebooking with another airline. they offered a full refund or a 75 refund if we went on a flight with them on a leased airplane 2 days later. the full refund would only cover a fraction of the cost of a last minute flight on another airline. we opted for the rescheduled flight. the leased plane was an old plane with narrow seats that did not recline no airvents ptv screens and no amenities for our business class fare. after arriving home and doing the proper paperwork and resubmitting parts of it again and again they were refusing to refund the 75 saying the flight cancellation was not their problem. we had a text that verified their promise and so they finally relented. do not expect any help if your flight is cancelled. you are on your own. travelling gatwick to new york on the 24th july what a disaster we had. we were told to book in at 230 even though the flight was to go at 630 so when still not booked in at 530 i get a text saying we are delayed till 930. then another text saying 1030. at 1130 we were told to go to information the first time airport staff had talked to us we were then told that we had to find a hotel but that they were all full and come back at 230 the next day.  we where then sent back through gatwick to collect our hold bags. the next day was no better two more delays  with no information as to why. then told there were only blankets and ear phones for premium class no hot drinkssnacks.  passengers spent over 23 hours at gatwick while norwegian messed about. their subcontractors at gatwick knew nothing  there arent actually any norwegian staff at gatwick  it is a ghost airline run by phone from norway. the highlight was being decanted from a plane at 3.30 am because there was no food and the captain refused to take off without it. avoid at all costs.  there was at least some food though of low quality with even coffee not hot. at no point during my experience did anyone apologise for the delay. finally while submitting a compensation claim the website timed out meaning i had to begin the process again. this flight was apparently canceled for 3 days in a row yet it was open for online booking. once i arrived to london i realized that there was bunch of people stranded in gatwick trying to leave to lax. finally they said that it may depart in the morning but it will be delayed by 5 hours. i had to sit at the airport until 5am. front desk agent and supervisors had no idea what was going on and instead of accommodating people said that there were no hotels left for the night and that we have to sit at the airport. since they had mechanical issues with the plane and it couldnt be resolved for 4 days they went ahead and put us on some kind of omni air plane. the plane was old and some seat covers were torn . when we made it to lax it turned out that they never shipped my bag and it was still in london. its been 6 days and i still dont have my belongings. the cost was great and we saved 200 on each ticket for a family of 3 to london. the boeing 787 was new and very nice. the seats are a bit hard but the lighting and luggage space is good. the staff were rude and unhelpful. since you have to buy food if they are serving those passengers and you ask for water they can be quite rude. the flights were delayed on both ends  london to lax was delayed 2.5 hours. will i fly it again  really not sure. norwegian flight from helsinki to madrid on 11th september delayed by over 12 hours. no advising passengers of passenger rights. we eventually received coupons for food but no arrangements for accommodation or rerouting. it was total confusion because no norwegian staff were on location only airport staff.\\r\\r\\n norwegian really impressed me on the outbound sector of the flight. the boeing 787 is an impressive aircraft quiet with noticeably cleaner more humid air. the check in process was efficient and quick and boarding was handled well. the food is overpriced but was edible. the return flight was so bad i couldnt believe it was the same airline. flight delayed by 45 mins at the gate but no information given. once boarding complete the cabin crew started moving my baggage in the overhead lockers without any care being taken to avoid damaging my luggage. food was served the middle of fairly serious turbulence. my tray was bouncing across the table. senior cabin crew spent a lot of the flight in the galley on their mobile phones. during turbulence towards the end of the flight many passengers left their seats and the crew made no effort to have them return to their seats. while advertised as low fare the huge cost of the baggage and food on usa flights can mean they are the same price as  full service carriers. i was unfortunate enough to travel back with my husband and toddler on norwegian from budapest at the beginning of august. what a farce we sat in the budapest departures lounge for 4 hours whilst flight delayed was displayed. finally proceed to gate was displayed  hooray we thought only to go the gate and find that the flight was in fact delayed for another five hours. why did they call everyone to the gate after much jostling at the boarding counter we were given €15 vouchers for each of us and a pass to leave the gate area where there is little by way of facility. we went back to the departure lounge and ate bought some nappies for our baby not covered by the €15 and decided to return to the gate for the rest of our wait knowing that there was at least a bar and some couches where we could try to get our toddler to sleep. when we and a large number of other passengers got through however we found that everything was closed. we naturally thought lets return to the departure lounge but noone at the desk was able to organise for us to return. some passengers had left their belongings with friends. to help norwegian then issued another €15 for us to spend at the closed bar and shops. the staff on duty had clearly not dealt with such an incident and did at least bring in pizzas and water for hungry passengers one man even managed to get some milk for our toddler. eventually the plane arrived but although the airline had by now had 11 hours to work out that transit buses were required to run passengers to the plane they had only organised one so more delay. once boarded the plane was overbooked thankfully some passengers had paid a large amount of money to travel with ba earlier on and therefore there were a couple of empty seats however it took their friends to point this out to the air stewardesses. once the online baggage that could not be fitted into the overhead lockers despite the fact that it was of the correct size was taken down to the hold by the passengers we finally took off. but norweigian were still not finished they then made an announcement that passengers could purchase drinks and food from the trolley. a passenger remarked to one of the stewardesses that this was not the way things worked after leaving passengers at the airport for 11 hours at least a complimentary drink was in order but all she did was snigger behind his back. when we returned i asked the airline to reimburse us for our extra expenses mainly costs related to our toddler to a paltry sum of c€50. they replied a couple of days ago saying that they would but wanted receipts. needless to say these are no longer with me having been thrown away after 6 weeks when i thought i really wouldnt hear anything. norwegian air are of course unwilling to compensate without them. well all that can be said on a final note is never again. i was one of the displaced passengers on canceled norwegian flight 7095.  we were supposed to fly from barcelona to london to lax. they canceled the flight in london left us for dead and couldnt get us out for three days. i had no choice but to find a united airlines flight out of heathrow which was crazy expensive in order to get home. norwegian has a month later not refunded any money in fact theyve actually charged me  for something. norwegian provided no hotel or guidance of any kind. in an effort to save a few hundred dollars by flying with them this airline has cost me a lot of money. i rarely write reviews but i hope to save someone the mental anguish ive experienced. i spent 24 hours at gatwick airport after my 6pm flight was delayed until 5pm the following day. there are no norwegian employees at the airport and their agents treated us with disdain bordering on contempt. we boarded a borrowed airplane at 1.45 am only to be turfed off 2 hours later because there was no food or drink available for the journey. after being allocated hotel rooms around 4.30am we were informed by text messages that the flight would leave at 11am and we would therefore have to check in at 10am. another text changed that to a 3.00pm flight stating that checkin would close at 1.30pm. however this was trumped by a 05.29am text confirming that the flight would indeed leave at 3pm but that we should check in by 10am. after 3 hours sleep i managed to shower and have breakfast by 9.30 which gave me 30 mins to get to check in. we finally took off at around 5pm. the return flight was reasonably pleasant but was also delayed  by about 3 hours this time. \\r\\r\\n first trip on the boeing 787 and with not up to my expectations. the aircraft was tired inside. the seat is okay for economy but i have flown better. i did not opt for any meal choice as i decided to sample the onboard ordering system which works well. however the choice of food was very limited.  all the crew were from thailand and seemed overworked and not motivated and did smile much. the entertainment system is basic the choice of music is good with a range to satisfy most tastes but the movie choice is very limited. the wifi wasnt available on my flight. to summarise you do get what you pay for. my ticket one way from oslobangkok cost 210. norwegian premium class is business on a budget. if you are looking for a bigger seat to attempt to sleep you will be okay with this airline and the price. if i had read more reviews i would have known to bring my travel pillow socks and amenities  they have not handed out toothbrushes for some time according to the steward that i asked. i saw some crumbs and trash between the seat and windows werent clean. one positive element is the cabins are not stuffy. the staff is robotic and loud. and my foot rest did not extend as shown so i used extra blankets to pad. as long as you expect little you will be fine with the meals but no bottled water offered so bring one from the lounge. allow extra time to get from and to gatwick its a hike and congested check in staff not friendly or helpful i had to do everything while the staff stood there and watched. during the flight the cabin crew were arguing about who was going to push the food trolley. the service was very poor. the price was cheaper than ba or sas but the customer service was nonexistent. i would rather pay more and enjoy the good services of another carrier. after having seen some worrying reviews of norwegian i was nervous having booked a flight from laxlgw to see family. i have done this journey so many times in my life knew how bad a delay or rough flight can be. i was close to cancelling my ticket and paying the extra few hundred to fly with a more reputable airline on this route. im so pleased i didnt. norwegian was great service wasnt amazing but no worse that any i have experienced in the past. norwegian is very middle of the road for want of a better expression. food is ok entertainment is ok leg room is ok. theres nothing amazing. if you want an airline that will get you there with the exact same service as the other airlines its a no brainer. tips just watch their flight times from lax departure requires you to get to the airport at 5pm. arrival means you also land at 5pm. book food in advance. bring your own headphones. grab an exit row seat. seriously consider getting in on the premium its as good as virgin atlantic or united airlines. the outbound flight was delayed 2.5 hours the reason given was that one of their planes was stuck at tenerife south and their engineer was joining our flight to get there. the annoying things were that the explanation was garbled apology was minimal and the complimentary drink was not explained as to choice. one cheap drink for a two and a half hour delay which resulted in us missing our paid for evening meal at the resort. that flight had old seating with limited leg room. the return flight was okay better than the first as the seats were new and the leg room a bit longer. i understand that airlines have problems but i then expect them to react in a positive proactive way to their customers and show greater generosity. the flight was part of a tui holiday package so i have no idea what the flight costs were. very disappointed and particularly unimpressed by crew on board. gave an attitude of not caring about passengers unfriendly and unprofessional. on outgoing journey no apologies for late arrival or informationreassurance about what i perceived to be a difficult landing. on return journey captain could not be heard due to faulty system steward laughed during safety announcement and did not finish. food service was poor missing rows of people and giving attitude of i just want to finish my shift. it certainly lives up to its reputation of a cheap airline. copenhagen to fort lauderdale via gatwick. lost my luggage for 4 days no compensation despite multiple requests. charged extra for regular luggage check in and extra if carry on is over 10 kilos. they do measure. luggage came to 150 dollars both ways total. no food offered free onboard but can be purchased ahead of flight. i tried it and neither my neighbor nor i liked it main meal only i didnt try any snacks. i will never again fly with them unless its short direct and without luggage.  nightmare journey. 6.5hr delay most of it stuck on the plane that was not fit to fly. crew not visible or available. no means to buy food or drink and none offerd by staff until we almost landed. very little information given apart from half an hourly text message promising we are leaving soon. no compesation offered so far unless they thing giving us complementary hotsoft drinks covers it all. never again woeful does not even cover it adequately. 1710 departure time with norwegian was postponed until 1945 early on the day of departure but was still told to check in as normal due to the fact it might be brought forward. tried to establish what the issue was and had three different reasons from various people at norwegian. three further delays and did not depart lgw for jfk until gone midnight. no uniformed staff at lgw just a hapless handling agent who was calling the same customer number as the passengers. extremely obnoxious and robotic call centre staff who were totally uninterested in their affected passengers and at one stage just put the phone down.  checked in at budapest for my flight with norwegian and all went well. upon arriving at londongatwick to catch my flight to los angeles the gate staff told me that i had to check my carry on bag even though it was 100 legal size and weight because they did not have room onboard. they insisted i pay 42 or they wouldnt let me board. the norwegian air gate staff at gatwick were nothing short of despicable. the onboard announcements every 5 minutes are worse than nails on a chalkboard. norwegian is cheap that is the benefit and the reason i use them. i have stopped using them from fco to lgw at they have been late on every occasion and the arrival time can be after midnight. the onboard menu is limited. the attitude of their crew is indifferent at best. in my opinion their crew rate as the worst of low cost airlines. if you want a cheap flight use them. apart from that if you care about service and hospitality dont. we family of 4 flew from copenhagen to fort lauderdale and back. the boeing 787 had good space between seats in economy and plenty of space in the overhead lockers. we had no problem finding space for carryon luggage. the touchscreen in each seat provided a medium selection of movies including a few premier movies. also had music and a few games chess a.o.. all movies were free of charge. the downside we had perordered food. when we were served the announcement went out that people who had not perordered would have to wait 2 hrs if they wanted to buy food. most of the staff seemed quite uninterested in the wellbeing of the passengers. overall though it was good value for money. on return flight from gatwick to new york the arrival was delayed by 1hr as we taxied from t1 to t8. something about a gate not being prepared. on the return we had a departure time of 10pm delayed by 3 hrs and received no email or phone text notifying us of the change which resulted in an avoidable 5.5 hr wait in jfk. a slightly cramped feeling in the cabin and it was a less than comfortable transatlantic experience well be sure to miss next time. i flew the norwegian flight from lgw to lax yesterday and it was one of the worst experiences ive had flying. i have never seen a ruder cabin crew. i was in the premium section and had the audacity to ask for water twice during our 12 hour flight and both times the crew made it clear it was a massive inconvenience for them. the head attendant also got annoyed at me when i couldnt get the leg rest to work properly. also the snack system didnt work at all so nobody could order food. when i asked at one point if i could order a snack i was referred by the staff to the online system which they had already announced was broken. the crew in our cabin left cups and napkins on the arm rest for the duration of the flight and then shouted at the passengers to clean it up as th flight was more than 45 minutes delayed and they needed a quick turnaround time in la. the tinted screen button on my window that the airline keeps promoting as an exciting feature was missing completely as it has slipped down inside the frame of the plane. it was also the coldest airplane ive been on which i suppose makes sense when you are charging for blankets. if the price is the only thing that you care about then by all means fly with this company however if you want any semblance of customer service i would recommend against it. i have always been impressed with norwegian on the copenhagen to gatwick route until now. flight was delayed for over 3 hours which was down to the weather that day at london gatwick which was strange as every other flight returning to the south of england departed on time. only found out before it was too late from another passenger that you could get a voucher for a refreshment seems norwegian dont want to tell you this. onboard cabin crew kept the lights on for the duration of the flight even though it was obvious passengers were tired from the late departure why do lowcost carriers do this  los angeles to stockholm and norwegian has one of the poorest excuses for customer support. there were 3 of us checked in at lax with luggage unfortunately my luggage was not delivered. after reporting the missing luggage in stockholm the nightmare started. they finally found the luggage and started shipping it around unfortunately not to the city of our travel. after seven days of misses they finally got it right in berlin which required several emails and international phone calls. we followed the guidelines to submit for expenses. i had to contact them after several months to remind them of the claim which they ignored. they sent back an offer of less than one third the claim. i send back a request and it went in to their ignore bucket.  los angeles to gatwick with norwegian and the flight quality was decent. when we flew to london we were actually early because we picked up a tail wind. cabin service was okay they are very by the book when it comes to serving the right people who ordered food which is understandable since it is a budget airline. my biggest issue was that my baggage got sent to dubai and not to london. so i was without luggage for a week. nonetheless thankfully my baggage did not get lost altogether. check in was fine with norwegian for our flight from new york jfk to london gatwick. a lovely and helpful woman. plane was good. staff on flight were terrible. wanted to ask for water and the woman serving did not hear me. as she passed by i very gently touched her with 1 finger. you would have thought that i had attacked her with the way that she reacted she turned on me in a very rude manner. we were not handed landing cards and when we asked another attendant male he said the plane was late and therefore they had not been given landing cards in an off handed manner as if it wasnt important. asking 5.00 for a blanket was also off putting. you pay for everything. to be honest the only reason we flew norwegian was because it came with our deal on the queen mary. we live near gatwick so thought it was a great idea to fly into that airport. frankly i doubt that we will ever fly norwegian again. convenient or not. i was disappointed with my first experience using them. the barcode on my boarding pass from their app wasnt recognised by the scanner at gatwick security. fortunately i had a paper copy as backup. i have never witnessed such slow boarding for a flight it took over half an hour to process everyone. when we finally got to the front we had to check our cabin bags into the hold at the gate.  i wouldnt have minded but on the plane  the overhead lockers are only about twothirds full and a lot of the bags that were in the lockers would have fitted under seats. on board the wifi wasnt working. again sure no other airline ive ever used gives you free wifi and i didnt need to use it but if you advertise free wifi as a selling point over your competitors it doesnt inspire confidence if you cant deliver it. cabin staff ignored my request for a glass of tap water for 30 mins. on the plus side the plane was incredibly new the leg room was good and the plane immaculately clean  more so than any other plane ive been on. so ill give norwegian the benefit of the doubt this time and use them again if the price is right. gatwick to new york jfk with norwegian  the airport staff were short tempered and moody. the overall experience was of customer service that does not value the customer because your getting a great price. not sure the saving is that great and i will have to think twice in future. planes are new but seats leave little room if you are 6ft tall. flight staff were not much more friendly. if your not buying a meal you are treated like a second class passenger in economy. flew copenhagen  stockholm arlanda  copenhagen out in the morning and back in the afternoon. first time on norwegian as i usually use sas on this route. outbound flight was about 20 full so plenty of space. legroom and seats marginally better than sas. flight attendants seemed more interested in chatting among themselves rather than with their customers. return flight was jam packed but crew was on top of it and certainly better than their colleagues. on time departure and arrival for both flights. drinks available for purchase a normal prices. cheaper than sas. wifi on board but it did not seem to work.    orlando to gatwick. the checkin staff was very courteous and helpful even if they forgot to give us our baggage ticket and as a result upgraded us to premium class the flight was very comfortable and the cabin crew was pleasant. the way back was a different experience. the staff at the checkin counter was nice again but the flight was a disaster. the snack bar was barely open we were ignored by the crew and  they didnt provide any free water. on top of all this the cabin was absolutely freezing.  im not going to use norwegian anymore as i ended up spending more than if i had flown a fullservice airline where seat selection baggage water and food are included.    flew norwegian from oslo to boston. the touchscreen foodbeverage ordering system on longhaul is rinkydink and a pain. snack bar is now open  forget it roll the cart like every other airline. be sure to bring your own food as hot sandwich is pretty awful. new planes  very nice but after two flights with norwegian im going back to united of lufthansa.\\r\\r\\n    our journey from fuerteventura to gatwick last night was one of the most uncomfortable i have experienced. on our outbound flight we flew in an aeroplane which appeared new it was bright and exceptionally clean. the seats were firm and there was ample leg of room. returning the plane was old heap seats sagged and even though i am only 56 it was extremely cramped. there was also mess in the rear seat pocket of the seat in front of us. i moved to a spare seat there were numerous empty seats only to find the seat was broken. on complaining to the cabin crew i got very little compassion.  los angeles to munich via stockholm and returning via oslo with norwegian. having done my homework before the flight i didnt order any food or drinks and brought my own empty bottle and snacks. the seats on the long flights were uncomfortable for a modern boeing 787. the short flights on the boeing 737 were fine. the people who had pre ordered meals were only given one or two small cups of water it seemed. i suppose one could ask for some water even if one hasnt ordered anything. crew are curt but not unfriendly. you could buy drinks with a credit card. id say lack of water was the main issue followed by seat comfort. i dont think they need to change the seats but they should at least offer water to everyone on board a few times throughout the long haul flight. entertainment is fine if you bring your own headphones or buy them. cabin temperature was very warm but comfy for me on the way there and slightly cold on the way back but not so extreme that i needed to buy or rent a blanket from the crew. dress for 50f10c weather and youll be fine. the check in procedure at both ends and the overall experience was totally fine. a decent to good value for the money i would say and wouldnt hesitate to fly them again.    tenerife south to london gatwick with norwegian. i purchased a seat for an infant less than 2 yrs  we did this as it was a long flight but it seems the checkin staff were not trained to handle this. they were very rude and rejected us saying an infant cannot travel on a child ticket and the ticket was cancelled. it was a foreign country and with a 8 months old baby we were in a mess  all due to untrained staff at the check in desk. then we had to call the call center and wait for 40 mins before they accepted us. it was a most stressful period and all due to norwegian. so if you are planning to purchase a seat for an infant beware they will ruin your holiday after taking the extra money.    i will never fly norwegian again. i arrived on sunday at london gatwick to catch my flight to new york jfk and after three hours of confusion i and many other passengers were told that no one with a british passport could board the plane because of a communication failure with the us immigration authorities. whilst this affected all airlines and was not the fault of norwegian there were three hours of norwegian staff providing contradictory and poor information and advice to passengers who were queuing repeatedly on advice from staff only to be told that they were in the wrong area. in addition because norwegian has no partner airlines the closest flight i and many of the other people could fly on was two days later resulting in missing two days of work. this was not an isolated failure. it came two weeks after my parents flight from jfk to gatwick on norwegian had to stop in shannon because of a plane part that needed replacing resulting in a delay of at least ten hours while the replacement part and engineer was driven from dublin and a replacement crew was found as the original crew had finished their shift. again if norwegian was partnered with other airlines perhaps the delay would not have been this long. i have never written a negative review before but feel a duty to inform people about these experiences and the downsides of using an airline with no partners.\\r\\r\\n london gatwick to barcelona with norwegian. absolutely disgusting was due to fly at 11.35 and its now 19.45. still waiting at gatwick for this flight. no information given and when i call the airline they tell me the flight is still departing at 20.00. my grandson is in tears as it is only a short break. would never use norwegian again.    flight delayed from gatwick to oslo by 3 hours and returning by 2 hours they didnt keep passengers informed or apologise for the delay. frustrating especially when travelling with kids. wont recommend.    highly disappointed. delayed flights both trips poor service and poor information. i usually fly from heathrow but due to timings i changed to norwegian through gatwick and have been extremely disatisfied. both flights to and from oslo were delayed with little notice or warning. the times kept getting pushed back by ten minutes with no explanation and there were no staff from the airline to explain why. once finally on the flight they didnt even offer any refreshments still asking customers to pay despite having been waiting for hours. i travel to the nordics frequently on business and i will never fly with this airline again.    flew oslo to reykjavik. i have been on norwegian a couple of times and noticed a few flaws with my flights. firstly the shoping and menu booklet are only in seats c and f which it makes it sometimes uncomfortable if the people beside you have to use it as well. secondly they have internet access on the plane which is nice but i only found it by chance. at first it looked good but i had problems going to other websites becouse i kept getting redirected to their site. thirdly and finally the service  i usually sleep a lot through the flight but i always wake up at the smell of food. when i woke up and asked the flight attendant for another menu. after studying the menu while waiting for service i started waving at her that didnt work. she walked by me but of course ignored me so i spent the rest of the flight hungry and hoping for a miracle.    flew norwegian from oslo to los angeles. we had looked forward to flying on the dreamliner for our first time and specifically rerouted our trip to be able to fly on one. the price of premium on norwegian as opposed to business class on a mainline carrier was about half. having a seat that reclined enough to sleep in along with the ability to check two pieces of baggage per person at no extra charge made flying premiun on norwegian a good financial value. however that is where our satisfaction with this lowprice carrier ended. first of all we were travelling as a couple and my partners seat was broken and would recline but the leg rest did not extend. he had to prop his feet up on a piece of luggage when the seat was reclined in order to get some sleep. when we notified the cabin crew of this they shrugged and took the broken foot rest switch from me. there was no attempt on the part of the norwegian crew to provide any semblance of service to its premium customers. there were no periodic water runs through the cabin on this 10.5 hour flight. one had to find the cabin crew who were sequestered behind a curtain at the front of the plane for most of the flight to ask for water. even in economy on a transatlantic flight on united or lufthansa there are water runs every few hours. the food offerings on norwegian were poor. the 7878 that we flew on was a fabulous ride quiet spacious with nice big windows. so no complaints about the aircraft. so allinall we were satisfied with the cheap ticket satisfied with the 787 but surprised by the poor cabin service norwegian provided to its premium customers. one can only imagine what the economy passengers have to endure. boston to london gatwick and this was my first and last flight on norwegian. i fly every 90 days to europe. the airlines i have used are icelandair ba lufthansa virgin atlantic aer lingus delta and klm. i most often use icelandair to europe and aer lingus to the usa. the new premium economy class on the b787 from norwegian was worth a try it seemed. i regret the trip. my 3 priorities are safe ontime and quiet on the redeye flight to europe. every carrier i have flown is safe. every one is on time. the seat the service the composure of the flight attendants is the difference. the chatter by the flight attendants on norwegian was difficult to imagine. from 50 minutes into the flight until our descent 5.5 hours later i was kept awake in seat 5c by the staff chatter in the nearby galley. of the last 30 flights to or from europe this flight was the only one that i wished i had never been on.    the outward and return trip from london gatwick to copenhagen with norwegian were each about 20 mins late departing but did the job and got to the destinations without any problems. however on the return flight we had an issue never encountered in flying before. we walked from row 1 to row 21 very slowly as a full flight and folk putting their hand luggage up. having arrived at row 21 we had difficulty finding anywhere for our hand luggage. the air stewardess said very tersely that there was no room for our luggage and that i had to return to row 1 and give in my luggage for the hold even though it was not oversized. there was a whole queue of people behind me and this was physically impossible. i explained to the stewardess this was not possible to do. she was so extremely rude telling me did i want to fly or didnt i. eventually my daughter and i did find some space for our luggage but the stewardess should have helped not be so very rude. flew norwegian from gatwick to copenhagen. ok so it is cheap there is no doubt. but my goodness you get what you pay for. quite a long delay which they would have known about at check in because it was due to poor weather all day and the plane was late coming in. even then took off later than the re stated delayed time. very cramped hot and uncomfortable. brusque and surly cabin crew selling over priced snacks. 2 small bottle of water anyone would not use this airline to fly long haul. i would recommend them only if money is your main concern but even then shop around as frankly i wish i had paid the extra few quid to fly ba from heathrow which also happens to be considerably nearer our house. venice to oslo with norwegian. excellent flight. left from venice few mins delay landed 20 mins earlier. the aircraft was nextgen so enough space for legs. wifi connection free but a bit slow most probably due to full flight. food and beverage quite expensive but probably common problem on low cost carriers    i used norwegian from london to helsinki and return. both my flights were delayed an hour. no explanation and no apologies and nothing.  i missed my train from the airport to the city centre and had to purchase a new ticket. the staff wasnt friendly but the positive side of the flight were the seats the screens installed on the aircraft which were used to show the security instructions and the wifi on board.  i am not sure if i will use them again. london gatwick to new york jfk with norwegian. more like a nightmare rather than dreamliner. first time and last time we fly norwegian. we had to wait over 3 hours before we were allowed to order food from the buffet cart because we had not understood all meals had to be preordered. one of the staff was extremely rude when we asked for water. no welcome on or off plane.    i was delayed 7 hours on the flight out due to a faulty plane the delay after horrendous queues at the check in area due to no working check in machines  online or at the airport and too few staff. information was lacking or inaccurate. staff quality and service was mixed. the return flight was worse. due to overbooking and another faulty plane we were delayed by 6.5 hours. those of us lucky enough to actually get on the plane rows 2434 were deemed unsafe for passengers and they were told at 530am to go to a hotel were flown back in an ancient plane with no working tv shabby seats and grotty food. as previously the online and automated check in had not worked and we had had virtually no information on the delays. norwegian is a cheap way to do a trans atlantic but isnt worth it.    our thursday flight from lax to stockholm was cancelled 8 hrs prior to departure with no attempt to accommodate the travelers. they sent an sms saying the flight is cancelled and passengers can reschedule or get their money back.  later that day they seemed to realize that they had to do something so they announced that the flight is not cancelled and instead postponed to the next day and they will soon inform us of the time but to no surprise by the end of thursday they sent another sms announcement that the new flight is now scheduled for 630am saturday. on friday i received 2 more smss each delaying the flight again and again. at the end we flow out of lax 48 hrs later in an old plane that they had rented from another airline. they provided zero service  just a very low quality food in a box. no blanket pillows or even onboard entertainment we were flying their premium class. return flight was on their own plane but still with the same poor quality. even though the plane was new the premium seats were old and worn. the food and service were as bad as our outbound flight. their customer service and information line is equally poor.     norwegian is a very poor airline. the online checkin does not allow you to see a seating chart it just tells you that your seats have been selected automatically and that you can change them at the airport. we tried to change the seats over the phone but the person on the other side couldnt help. we changed our seats at the airport even though the checkin attendant initially said we couldnt and clearly didnt know what she was doing. we then entered the terminal and found that our flight was 4h15m late. on top of that it even said on the boarding pass that the checkin assistant had given us that boarding was at 13.10 but she didnt tell us the flight was late. they gave us 10 food vouchers however. when we finally boarded i found that the plane didnt have the boeing sky interior that norwegian like boasting about. wifi was slow and entertainment was outdated. overall a very bad flight from london gatwick to helsinki.   i flew from london gatwick to boston logan and return with norwegian. i ordered vegetarian meal when booking the flight. they served me undercooked rice and some bland boiled vegetables. you are betteroff carrying packed food. the cutlery pack given to me was missing a fork so i switched the attendant light on 3 times and each time the cabin crew switched it off centrally without bothering to see me. the breakfast given to me on my return flight was not vegetarian and they told me they had nothing vegetarian. the entertainment selection is out dated and small. they are cheap in every sense of the word. hope will not have to use norwegian again.    this was the 4th time i have flown with norwegian over last 12 months and every time my flight has been delayed for at least 1 hour. flew from rome fiumicino to london gatwick. the staff did not advise us that the boarding would not start on time so we were just queueing for an hour with no indication on when the boarding will start. there was absolutely no communication and not once did they apologise the same situations occurred all four times.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    flew from budapest to london gatwick. we consciously took hand luggage to minimise time at the airport so that we could get our connecting train on the return journey as a result of waiting for our luggage we missed our train which had a knock on effect to the rest of our 6 hour journey. on boarding the plane late and chaotic process we were told by cabin staff that our bags would have to go in the hold because other people who boarded before us had too many bags. whats the point of having rules about hand luggage if no one has to follow them the cabin staff blamed the airport check in staff and shrugged as much to say i dont care. some members of staff were brusque to the point of being rude and when ordering food most of which they didnt have the air hostess was dealing with several customers at the same time and having several different conversations  very rude. if i see norwegian on any future holidays i will just look for something else  they dont do customer service.    both of the flights were delayed. furthermore on the first flight not only was it delayed but we also had to wait for another hour and a half due to an electrical problem. nothing was provided to the passengers during the wait no meals beverages or snacks. the second tier of the trip from copenhagen to madrid was also delayed for an hour and a half.    gatwick to barcelona. flight was delayed by an hour which wasnt a major issue. onboard i found the service from the spanish cabin crew unfriendly and unwelcoming. on arrival at barcelona we parked at a gate with a jetbridge but despite this they insisted on bringing stairs and a bus to carry us 10m to the airport door. got to the baggage carousel and eventually 10 bags came out before the belt stopped with more than 50 people still waiting for a bag. a rep from norwegian came to the belt and started talking on his radio  he told us that they were checking the plane to see if they had missed any bags. eventually the message came through that there were no more bags and that more than 50 passengers bags had not been loaded. without any form of apology he passed out a form and told us to fill it in and give it back and they would call us if the bags were found. he refused to supply tracking numbers and denied that the airline had any duty to supply vouchers for essentials. eventually 48h later my bag turned up. on way back my bag was not loaded and got delivered care of british airways 24h later.  i flew with norwegian from gatwick to alicante on the 06092016 through thomson and the flight was comfortable and the staff helpful and nice. the aircraft was clean. the flight home was uncomfortable the staff were rude and unhelpful they didnt do the safety routine but put a video on then turned it off then restarted it again. once up in the air passengers started to go toilet at the back of the plane were i was sat which was fine but the toilet on the right side was disgusting it had to be locked off. the staff response of  oh how did it get like that the toilet opposite was filthy with no toilet paper. never again will i use this airline.    my wife and i were booked on norwegian to fly home from palma de mallorca to london gatwick on saturday 24 september 2016. we had checked in online the night before and had our boarding cards. when we arrived at the airport for our flight home to london gatwick we queued for over an hour to be told that the flight was cancelled. norewgian had not contacted us in any way beforehand phone  email etc. and there was no norwegian representative or office at the airport. iberia staff told us that norwegian had informed them to tell passengers to make their own arrangements to fly home. all iberia staff told us that they had never experienced such a bad situation before and that norwegian had behaved disgracefully. we tried every airline office in the terminal but no flights to london were available that evening except a very busy monarch flight to london luton airport. we bought the last 2 tickets on this flight but had to ask our son to drive 264 miles to collect us at luton at 03.00 the next day drive us to gatwick to recover our car and then return home exhausted and very angry. i believe the flight was cancelled to save costs another norwegian flight to gatwick left the same evening but the company gave no thought to the awful consequences for the passengers they abandoned.   london gatwick to budapest via copenhagen with norwegian. my first flight to cph was delayed. i asked at the checkin gate at lgw to assure me that my short connection would be ensured. checkin staff could not promise but if i missed the connection i would be put on the next flight and if that flight was not until the next day norwegian would put me in a hotel. i got no help for my connection had to run 1km to the gate. my connecting plane was still at the gate but the boarding staff of norwegian refused to allow us to board saying the flight was closed. she told us to go to rebook. the counter staff was surprised to see me and asked me why i had not gone straight to the gate for my flight as the flight should have known i was coming and should have waited for me. i explained what had happened and the staff was embarrassed. she told me the quickest way was to rebook me via stockholm where norwegian would put me in a hotel and i would fly to my destination the next day. i agreed. my flight to stockholm was delayed until 01.00. i arrived at arn at 02.10 and went straight to assistance counter to ask for accommodation. i found absolutely nobody to help me. security told me all the hotels in stockholm are full and suggested i get a car go to uppsala try to find a hotel then send the bill to norwegian. i had to get back to the airport by 08.00 so that was not realistic. i arrived at my destination the next day at 12.20 more than 15 hours late after a sleepless night and having been treated disrespectfully norwegian staff or there was nobody there. i am disgusted. of 4 flights 3 were delayed. i complained to norwegian but they didnt reply.    oslo to new york jfk. norwegian advertise that you will fly in a new boeing 787 but we got an old a340 leased from hifly. the condition of the plane was disgusting. almost all seats were broken the seats were very small the inflight entertainment system did not work and when they switched the cabin lights off during the flight there were no personal lights working. the staff manning the flight were completely uninterested in the concerns of the passengers. i have logged a complaint with norwegian but no reply yet. this was 8th flight with norwegian and by far the very worst.    los angeles to gatwick on low fare. i travelled with 2 infants and airline staff and policies were not helpful. bulkhead seating was not prioritized for families. in both directions more than 1 family with small children were onboard but none got the bulkhead seating or extra space for bassinet supposedly available for young families. on the return journey staff were unhelpful prioritising their own tasks during food service over customer convenience.     flew los angeles to paris. next time i will not fly these lowcost airlines the price looks good but thats because you have to pay for everything else including water. for people like us who did not pay for meal service they didnt even offer us water also we had to pay for every piece of luggage we checked in we ended up paying 150 for luggage. if you are looking to get some decent travel experience dont book with norwegian    first time most definitely last time ever with norwegian. i can only add my voice to all my fellow travelers who were on flight dy7015 from london to new york city. i never received an email telling me the flight was canceled. we were given a hotel but not fed. we had to pay out of pocket to eat. i missed my train connection from jfk. the next day 11117 i was rerouted to sweden with a 4 to 5 hour layover that turned into 7 or 8 hours due to mechanical problems. they wouldnt let us leave the waiting room at the airport no matter how many people begged that they were hungry. i did not get to new york until well after midnight. now its 11217. the earliest train was at 3.25am. i did not get home until 5.15am. it was the worst travel experience ever. customer service was abysmal. they were complaining to us the passengers how they werent told anything it wasnt their fault etc. surly staff. apathetic and pathetic. do not be fooled by low price   copenhagen to london gatwick. i flew with norwegian on 4th of december from copenhagen to london gatwick. i never write reviews for airlines because as long as it takes me from point a to b safely i dont make a fuss but todays flight disgusted me. we had a delay of more than one hour and a half. only after embarking all and siting in the plane for more than 30 min everybody looking at the watch impatiently they gave us a lame excuse. no wifi available though they advertise it big time and old aircraft. the icing on the cake though was the rude staff. even if your customer service is not your forte at least in situations like this you can make an effort. i understand there are rules that need to be respected but there are nice ways of saying them not snapping at people raising the voice and patronise the passengers showing not only lack of customer service but also manners. norwegian please invest in training for customer service and send your staff from todays flight.    oslo to new york on december 1st. the flight was delayed for 75 minutes with no explanation. the new time was only posted on the monitor at the gate. the attitude of the staff was dismissive with an undertone of just deal with it. on board one of the first order of business was an announcement notifying those who preorder meals  that they would be immediately served and others who did not preorder was directed to the menu on the screen where they could do so. these are the cost of a few items water 3.00 beer 6.50 coco cola 3.00 sandwich 7.00. approximately 1 hr after the preorders and upper classed were served maybe 2 hours in flight a cart appeared in the aisle. we were offered a choice of chicken or beef with a side order. the space was cramped and uncomfortable. as a low cost airline if you want amenities such as a headphone blanket or headrest there was a cost factor. no wifi was available in flight. flying norwegian was a disappointment. the pilots were excellent the cockpit crew eventually apologized for the delays. we were scheduled to arrive at 2000 but arrive at 2136.   flew new york jfk to paris cdg. flight was first delayed without any notice after security check. waited 6 hours until 2am at jfk then staff put us in hotels. no news at all from norwegian. the next day they tell us the next flight is cancelled again. no further information is given. the day after same thing. the hotel informs us norwegian maintained the reservation. no news at all from norwegian themselves. finally in the afternoon we receive a text message to ask us to call a number and rebook our flight. i had to pay to call from my cellphone and 45 minutes waiting time. customer service is terrible. finally got a flight from another company. total delay 72 hours. customer service non existant. i missed all my doctors appointment missed one day at work and above all horrible customer service. i feel like we were treated worse than cattle. shame on norwegian. will never take this company ever again.    bergen to alicante. the flight started with all four attendants disappearing from the cabin 20 minutes after takeoff for their unison leaving passengers to study the menus meanwhile with the aircon set to cold. after reappearing we were informed by the attendants that only noodle soup and muffins were our food options for the three hour late evening flight. the aircon was then changed to hot.     edinburgh to hartford. bad start boarding with some passengers from a cancelled norwegian flight from previous day. before takeoff front row passengers were asked to move to the back seats to assist aircraft balance. in midatlantic captain announced that head winds meant we were short of reserve fuel and had to land and refuel at montreal.    stockholm to gatwick. you get to your destination safely and have a decent seat but their customer service could be improved. both of my flights were  delayed followed by sorry for the delay.  the flight to stockholm was delayed by an hour. i lost my hand luggage while waiting for the flight couldnt find airport security around so i reported to the airline staff who said i could file a report when i get to london. it turned out of courser that i should have reported this to the airport missing items.    los angeles to gatwick on 27 november 2017. we were due to leave at 18.35. we arrived at airport at 15.15 and were told we could not check our bags until 17.30 due to delayed flight. staff could not tell us how long we would be delayed. we were given meal vouchers for 12 each. when we went through security the gate information had departure time of 18.35 crossed out and this was later changed to 21.30. at 21.50 we were called to gate and bussed to plane. there were about 60 people on the bus and we all boarded the plane with norwegian staff checking our boarding passes. then we found our seats already occupied  they had taken us to norwegian flight to barcelona. we were then taken to gatwick flight and sat on plane for 2 hours. the captain spoke over intercom and apologised and gave no reason other than late arrival of earlier flight. he said we would be taking off as soon as we were given a slot.  cabin crew couldnt tell you anything. we werent offered anything to drink while we waited. we took off at 1215. an announcement was made that meals would be served immediately to those who had ordered one. we arrived home 5 hours late. many people had missed connecting flights. we had to drive home in the dark when we had booked a flight where we could travel home in daylight. norwegian did not do anything to make up for the delays. they update customers by messaging apps or mobile phone not everyone has one when they travel.    flew norwegian from boston to london gatwick. 26 hour delay multiple trips to airport crew noshow technical problems massive confusion lack of staff worst air experience i have ever had in 20 years of flying. even the aircraft didnt show up 26 hours after scheduled time during the second boarding attempt. an unimaginable level of incompetence.   this is regarding our inflight experience on 20th november while flying from singapore to london with norwegian. overall the experience was ok some of the positives being that the boeing dreamliner is great. seats are comfortable the entertainment system is contemporary. we got a good price also and the food on menu was not bad. however there were a couple of things which bothered us 1 one of the flight attendants was rude. most of the crew was british and there were some good attendants on the flight but unfortunately for us the man serving us was rude to us on more than one occasion. he would ask us to tell him our names before handing over the food we had paid for like we were prisoners. to others he would patiently explain the menu to us he would come and shout chicken or fish. once my wife changed her mind and asked to change her initial meal choice from chicken to fish to which he very rudely exclaimed  oh you want fish now . 6 hours into the flight he woke us to give the snack. i was a bit sleepy and asked him if we could have it later he snapped back and said no you can have it now or not have it at all. 2 there were no headphones on the flight. first of all we were not aware that we had to buy headphones. i can understand the airline is trying to save cost and pass on that benefit to the consumer but it would be good if they can add a note in the booking that passengers need to arrange their headphones or buy inflight. anyways it was only 3 so we asked to buy when we were told there were no headphones on the flight. upon asking why the staff told us they forgot to load up. on a 13 hour flight that can be a bit annoying. we spent the 13 hours without headphones. i have travelled with norwegian in scandinavia before and the staff have been very polite sharp and courteous. this crew with some exceptions has a lot to learn in terms of professionalism in my opinion.    right from the day of departure we had trouble. on the departure day i got a text stating my flight was cancelled i need to call them to rebook or get refund. we had a trip planned for 2 weeks we couldnt cancel and refund we decided to take rebook option they changed our departure airport we had to go to jfk instead of swf. we drove our car to jfk took a connecting flight to gatwick to get to edinburgh. our original flight was non stop to edinburgh from swf. i could have done the connecting flight myself if i wanted to. this threw off our whole trip had lot of my reservations cancelled. we lost lot of money right there. to top it off our return flight was going back to swf. so we had to get a rental car back to jfk to pick up our car. again lot of hassle and driving fuel and toll charges. we still did our trip even though we lost a day and lost some reservations. we came back and applied for claim norwegian said they could only refund for toll and fuel charges 32. after all the trouble we had with their flight cancellation. i was stunned to see this response. i am still fighting to get some refund. its been 3 months since i applied for claims.   flew helsinki to malaga. its always a pity to see that certain companies arent family friendly. our flight to spain had a few empty seats and the company didnt bother to allocate families with babies in those rows. there even was one passenger using three seats on his own. also to point out that if a baby is sleeping the flight attendants dont need use loud voices to ask you if youd like coffee. last but not least this is the second time that norwegian manages to lose our baby pushchair in a direct flight. the most disgraceful part is that they always smile at you and say it will come tomorrow but never does.   flew norwegian from newark to rome. dont waste your money on this airline. i ended up paying for my food luggage and reservation for my seat which led to me not saving any money for flying this budget airline. first dont even bother reserving early to get the exit row because the seats are so tight that you will be uncomfortable anyway so why even get leg room when you dont have any shoulder space. food was the worst food i have ever had which i paid 50 for. blanketspillowsnacks and even water super low of them to sell water its a human need you need to pay extra for.   norwegian are to be congratulated on providing the worst customer experience ive encountered in 20 years flying. im a regular flyer and in the past year have persisted with norwegian multiple times to travel from london to new york due to the cheap cost. never again. the service is basic verging on rude uncomfortable but is just about tolerable if nothing goes wrong. however any sign of trouble and customer service becomes invisible. on multiple occasions the airline has failed to provide the service it advertised and during the recent winter weather january 2018 successfully abandoned hundreds of passengers in new york with no communication on how they would get home or receive compensation. i can only recommend you avoid this airline  the extra cost to fly transatlantic with another carrier is worth it.   flew norwegian from amsterdam to los angeles. a two hour stop in copenhagen became a 36 hr stop i got to my destination 2 days late. every two hours they would text sorry for the delay in two hours we will update you with the time and the gate for departure. they kept me in the airport on the first day for 10 hours and then the entire day the following day. the weather was great at the departure and arrival airport but they kept saying we were delayed due to weather conditions. i checked on other airlines and they were flying fine. they are dishonest and dont care about customer service or the passenger just . the seats offer very little leg room this coming from a person whis 5 8. the seat cushions are thin and uncomfortable. dont ever waste a single dollar on this airline because they dont care about the passenger its all about dollars with them.   paris cdg to new york jfk. first time and last time. not coordinated at all. customer service line has no knowledge and still sitting on the ground at jfk since 3 hours because ground crew in paris could not handle boarding everyone on time. dont fly into a snow storm for 5 hours if you can not land at destination and then fly back to you departure city for another five hours. the next flight was moved and canceled twice and and norwegian website was not up to date. norwegian has to charter a plane to fly us to new york. they chose wamos air a spanish airline. at check in most of the boarding passes could not be printed and because of that we left 2 hours late. the food on the plane was from norwegian from the previous day and there was no customer service from the crew because they had norwegian catering on a wamos air plane. this is a 48 hour trip. if norwegian would be organized and thoughtful things like this would not happen. that was the first time i used a budget airline and never again. back to lufthansa and united   booked to fly norwegian from madrid to singapore. i cannot begin to describe how completely incompetent and frustrating this airline is. upon cancellation at 3am after sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours we were told by staff usually we would provide accommodation but there is none available. good luck. we waited until the customer service desk opened in the morning only to have the staff say we just got in we dont know what is happening. no effort was then made to answer any kind of questions some as basic as will food and accommodation be reimbursed. countless calls and emails to them later mostly unreturned and i have received half a dozen differing explanations as to where my compensation sits. i have heard anywhere between 1 week to 3 months. no staff member that i have spoken to could answer straightforward questions. they tend to overuse the phrases asap and right away although its 6 weeks later and i am still yet to find out exactly their definitions of these terms  they certainly differ to my own definitions. what an absolute waste of time and money.   flew new york jfk to paris cdg with norwegian. cheap is all they have to offer. i thought it would be enough but it wasnt. then there was the stewardess in our economy area who had no pleasantries served no water she snacked then she ignored us for eight hours until she stood before us to block our exit while she ushered the front cabin people out. finally she told us to go while a large man ran like a football player at us. he knocked me out of the way to get out of the door. for this she stood silently. what a cold and shabby airline.    new york to gatwick. my first time flying with norwegian has been my worst experience with an airline. outbound the entertainment system was down for the flight. i was so bored and they gave no compensation. return i am sitting at the gate waiting due to 2 delays so far as the flight has yet to land. i am therefore going to arrive back 2 hours late as it stands.    orlando to copenhagen via oslo. at orlando airport check in staff was one of the rudest and meanest person i have met. thanks to her manager we finally got to our flight. she did not know in europe the way they write the date is ddmmyy and not mmddyy. after she got the passport she told me my passport is expired even though i still had over 3 months left to renew my passport and thats because she could not read the correct date on my passport. the flight was very empty and a lot of space but she was giving me a hard time about my carry on that was a bit over 10kg. she said we have to pay 65x2 flight connection because we have a little over weight carry on and that bag has to be count as a second checked bag. after we were finally trying to pay the amount 65 so we could be done she on her phone laughing at something that seemed very funny to her at that time. they made me wait over an hour and half to check in because of all the problems they were giving me. another problem was that in their system my nationality didnt match to the nationality they had for me so they kept going back and forth just to see what the problem is and who could fix it. this was like a nightmare to me.     gatwick to seattle. not only has customer service been unhelpful and rude but they have thus far neglected to acknowledge the issue at hand. i went to checkin to my flight online having no indications that this was not going to be a possibility to find that online checkin is disabled. the only information i received regarding checkin from the airline was the time constraints. here i am about to check in as soon as it opens only to find out i have to be physically present for checkin at the airport which is nearly two hours from my location. i rush to get there hoping ill make it only to arrive five minutes too late and i was barred from boarding my original flight. this cost me over a thousand dollars in new flights just to get home even though i booked these tickets months in advance. the airline has been citing their checkin time policy as reason not to refund me for my unused tickets. i was unable to make any of my connecting flights elsewhere because of them and i was nearly stranded in london. its absurd that ive had to contact them to remind them that my issue is thus far still unsolved.   flew gatwick to los angeles.  i have  flown with them a couple times in the past and while theyre not my favorite airline they charge you for water ive never had a complaint until now. somewhere over greenland we hit turbulence and not the kind that shakes the plane for a few moments before subsiding. it lasted over an hour. obviously the airline cant control the weather and im not writing this review to blame them for that. but i am  disappointed by the lack of customer serviceinterface around this ordeal. the pilot came onto the intercom to announce that he had put on the fasten seatbelt sign and asked the flight attendants to take their seats. aside from that there was no comforting of frightened passengers no warning of how long to expect the turbulence to last and not a mention of or apology for the ordeal afterwards. perhaps the flight crew are used to such things but to the rest of us it was quite terrifying and i was perturbed by the lack of help during and after the episode.    unless youre very careful in how you book the flights and check your documents you will have a nasty surprise at check in as we did  we apparently hadnt pre booked our meal or our hold bags both of which had been included in our outward bound flight so we assumed the return flight would be the same. we paid 60 each to check in our hold bags and had no meals during the flight. the snack bar ran out less than an hour into a ten hour flight  not even tea available. no water offered to us at any point. only the kindness of one of the stewards after he found a spare meal stopped me fainting from hunger. seats  awful short narrow and hard. a small selection of films available no music channels. staff overworked mostly brusque from coping with many complaining passengers. unless youre desperate choose another airline.   given that we have an indian passport and a valid us visa we are entitled to a visa on arrival at dubai airport. unfortunately norwegian staffers were unaware of this and would not listen to our reasoning. this meant a 1 hour argument with first ground staff and then the customer service at oslo. we were finally allowed to check in but this was only thanks to an emirates staffer calling them and confirming the regulation. this was an unnecessary and stressful start to a holiday that could have been avoided.    newark to rome via oslo. 6 hour delay in newark with little notification other than update in 30 minutes. then was too late to make other plans. was told i would fly to oslo first to get me to rome stated it would be a quick turnaround to switch planes and crews. now will be in rome at 3am after a 4 hour wait for another plane and crew. all of this is forgiveable when one gets proper notice so that plans can be made. without such notice i am dropped of in a foreign city at 3 am without the ability to get my rental car or drive to my destination.    copenhagen to helsinki. flight quite normal. they said that the flight was express flight which had some restrictions in service procedures. according to their onboard magazine it was not in definition of express flight.  only announcements from cockpit were in swedish. all other announcements in english and finnish. norwegian should lso consider to use swedish especially on flights to finland after all its also the second official language of finland.   norwegian has left me and my child stranded in rome for 5 days ive spent 5 hours trying to get a flight back to any new york airport they are also not willing to guarantee our hotel and food costs. the outbound flight was scheduled for 12am but was suddenly rerouted from newark to at 2.30 am in the morning. no apology was issued only a mention that meal service was cancelled. dont bother calling the airline they dont pick up for hours and then disconnect after promising to connect the passenger with their help line. this is a chaotic mismanaged airline that has no interest in customer service    fort lauderdale to gatwick. the flight was cancelled as the plane ran over a metal object while on the runway. we waited for hours with no one really knew what to do and we  got a flight out two days later. norwegian did not provide any compensation for the delay in the way of discounts. i was only going to london for four days so my trip was cut in half but they did not care. it is a lowcost airline so there is no food or water unless you pay for it which i did on my way out. the breakfast consisted of a tiny piece of turkey and cheese on a dry roll and minute pastry. they charge for the luggage which is 60 if you are even slightly over. they are cheap and you get uncomfortable seats. the staff were nice to me but i could see they were overworked. if you have to fly cheaply this is the way to go but leave your expectations for anything other than a lowcost at home.   huge waste of my time and money. 1 day snow storm in north east. all flights were flying the next day from all airports. they cancelled my flight on wednesday 7th with 24 hours of notice and could not get me back to the uk until the following monday a 5 day delay. they pay for very little. you are picking up all the costs of that delay. your car parked in the airport  food extra clothing washing your clothes and losing your work and leisure time for 5 days. completely unacceptable. this was a snowstorm. a 2448 hour delay is acceptable. after that they should be putting you on other flights not stringing you out for days on their overbooked flights.   what can i say i received an email yesterday asking for volunteers to cancel this flight and receive a refund and 200 euros when you have planned something for a special birthday and paid for a hotel is that really something youd want to receive or consider ive now got to spend the majority of my birthday at the airport because of the incompetence of norwegian. dont sell us a service you cannot then provide us with you leave customers deeply disappointed. your offers of complimentary food doesnt make up for the 8 hours of our holiday we will now miss out on. its so poor. this wasnt cheap we paid out a lot of money. also norwegian changed the carrier to hifly and now ive just seen there is no information re our flight until 15.00 pm and initially the flight was supposed to be at 6.10am. how can you treat customers like this    this is the most disorganised airline ive ever booked with. ive had 2 cancelled flights within 10 days so disappointing as it was my 40th birthday treat. i have now had to ask for a full refund and use a different airline as i have no trust in them. their customer service is shocking ive had no apology no understanding and its cost me 120 in phone bills calling their hotline which i intend to claim from the airline. my advise would be to not even consider booking with them.   i got to gatwick 1 hour 20 min before my flight. typically this time is not a problem since i had no checked luggage and was flying to my home country. i tried to check in at the kiosks but they werent working so i was told to stand in line. i was waiting for over ten minutes in a long line then told an employee that my flight was leaving in an hour. they told me that check in just closed even thought it was 1 hour 5 min before my flight. i asked if they could reopen since i was there in line before the hour and they refused. i asked to speak to a manager and they said they couldnt help me and i needed to buy a new ticket. i talked to several people who were extremely rude and unwilling to help. i fly from london to the states several times a year and have never had this happen. i have never dealt with such a rude inconsiderate company in my life.    last trip from madrid to reykjavik my suitcase was damaged. i know how difficult it is that a low cost airline pays for a damaged suitcase so i went directly to the checkin desk of norwegian on reykjavik airport. there i showed the damaged suitcase to an employee asking where could i make a formal complain. she told me that they dont have customer service desk at reykjavik airport and that i could only complain via internet. so the day after i sent an email explaining everything. some mails after they offered a compensation of just 50 euros instead of the 220 euros my suitcase cost. the reason i didnt complain at reykjavik airport but via internet. exactly i just did what they told me to do. be careful if you have any damaged suitcase i think the strategy is to tell the customers to complain via internet so that they will only pay you 50 euros. its a shame how low cost airlines try to trick the customer. i thought norwegian were more serious. if i can avoid flying with them again i will do it no doubt. if you get a damaged suitcase with them complain at the airport.   oslo to helsinki. our flight was cancelled due to technical issues and a mandatory staff break. we were traveling with a rather large group and norwegian left us waiting for information about our flight for almost two hours. the staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful and we got no apology what so ever. we were supposed to be in helsinki late on sunday and we got booked for a flight on monday at 7 oclock  almost 24 hours later than scheduled. after almost two hour of waiting for customer service we got an unfriendly welcome and a flight that would land at 16.00 in helsinki and a pathetic 15€ food compensation. a small portion of our group that travelled with hand luggage only got promised a ticket to sweden and were promised a hotel and a flight early in the morning. when they got to arlanda no hotel was given. they slept at the airport. this is a horrible experience and we will never fly with norwegian again. written at the airport after 15 hours of absolutely horrible service from norwegian.    i flew from ny jfk to paris orly and they changed the airport of departure and the associated time of departure and arrival two times from jfk to newark some weeks after booking the flight and from newark to jfk five hours before the departure and from cdg original arrival airport to orly where i had a connection flight to venice. i was already heading to newark airport when i received a message saying that i had to go to jfk. the expected departure time was already delayed by a few hours compared to the departure time from newark. but the delay and the change of airport werent enough already and the flight departed with 5 hours 42 minutes of delay after 2 am. we didnt receive any sorts of information during the time we spent waiting the flight disappeared also from the airport screens for a few hours and nobody was able to tell us anything. we didnt even receive the care it is mentioned on the website in case of delay what youre entitled to right to care if youre involuntarily denied boarding or your flight is cancelled or significantly delayed as outlined above youll be entitled to meals and refreshments vouchers in reasonable relation to the waiting time provided it wont further delay departure of the flight two telephone calls telex or fax messages or emails. i was lucky enough that i didnt additional 35€ for the meal on board because they had no meals available for the people who paid the meal in advance. i missed my connection flight from paris to venice and i had to pay a new flight at a higher price and i arrived in venice 8 hours after the supposed arrival time. i asked for a refund for the new flight i was forced to take and compensation for the more than 5 hours delay. first it took more than one month to answer what they replied is that they deny responsibility for the delay and for the continuous change of airport of arrival and departure. the only refund i can have is a ridiculous amount of 21.80€ which is the price of the public transport from orly to charles de gaulle.     i was flying to oslo from jfk on a sunday night the airport was super crowded due to the snowstorm on march 21 flights were postponed until sunday. i tried to do a selfcheckin on one of the machines near the counter checkin area it was unsuccessful so i had to wait in line to get my tickets printed from the counter. i asked staff if she could weigh my hand luggage to see if it was over 9kg which i was 98 certain that it wasnt and was asked to weigh my backpack as well and the total was 13 kg. she told me i had to pay 65. no airline has asked me to weigh my hand luggage and backpack together. as a low cost airline you have to pay for water food or snack and a blanket.   this was a shockingly poor experience. was ticketed ewrbcn and was originating at ord. had checked in at ord and received a text message from norwegian saying that the flight was rerouted and will depart from jfk for regualtory reasons. this was a first for me in many years of traveling. not wanting to take the two hour cab ride from ewr to jfk at rush hour i rerouted domestically to lga and of course got separated form my bags despite assurances they would make it. got down to jfk t1 to discover massive queues and confusion at norwegian check in. they had rerouted several flights that night from ewr and there must have been 1000 people checking in for their flights. long security queues as well as there are several other carriers flying to asia that time of night. no restaurants open in t1 at this hour and norwegian lounge access in the alitalia lounge was more like a city public bus terminal there were people sprawled all over beer cans food wrappers dirty plates all over. complete chaos at the gate with no sense of organization. no norwegian employees anywhere in sight. left two hours late. pilot explained it was weather that caused the rerouting of the flight but a simple check of flight status at ewr showed no other flights rerouted to jfk  only norwegian. i found this airline to be awful. there was no response to my complaint no apology for what happened that night.    in 2017 we were on the first scheduled norwegian flight from los angeles to barcelona. it was quite exciting for everyone including the cabin crew. so i chose them again for our trip this year to barcelona and we were disappointed. the boarding process was tiring and chaotic resulting in a late departure. the cabin crew while efficient were not particularly friendly. we went through a zone of heavy turbulence with no communication from the flight crew as to the expected severity or duration. the boeing 787 seemed cramped compared with the seating on our return flight on level a330. as on our first flight sandwiches and other menu items were sold out when we most needed them. there was no wifi on.    worst airline ever. last minute cancellation no communication took us 4 hours to reach a representative to rebook finally rebooked us on another airline and when we reached the airport we were told norwegian had overbooked the other airline. waiting on stand by until boarding. luckily we did get a place on the aircraft. return flight also cancelled 45 min before departure. we were rechecked on another fight with a detour through iceland. reached jfk with a delay of about 5 hours only to find out that our bags were left in gatwick. they didnt even offer water to passengers after delaying them for over 4 hours. inhuman and lousy representatives. never ever going to fly this airline again. when offering refund on a flight they will only offer you refund for one way. they expect you to fly back on a return trip even when they cancel the flight. like you are supposed to magically fly back when you dont even make it there.    flight was okay everything is do by your self at check in. no service during flights under 60 minutes. expensive to buy checked in bags. wifi did not work.    i bought premium tickets several months in advance however i was placed on standby and downgraded to coach before getting into the plane given that norwegian overbooked the premium seats. i was told by the staff that there is nothing they could do to help i should contact the airline by phone to request a refund. the refund is not automatic if you try to use the website and email you dont get response. it is difficult to get someone to answer the phone and when they do they claim it would take 46 weeks to evaluate the case. the whole thing is really outrageous disappointing one of the worst experiences with an airline i have had.   norwegian on two separate occasions have changed my flights for my upcoming flights from london gatwick to new york jfk. the limited option choices were fly with someone else fly out later missing arranged plans and fly out earlier at additional personal expense. they did not seem to have genuine care about the inconvenience they have caused without giving an explanation why the changes occurred. as a rewards member i thought they would hope to make some sort of effort to accommodate me but my response was very much a sense of ‘well these things happen and we cant help not really the answer i wanted. after a few messages back and forth they confirmed they werent interested in keeping my business or future business. i would avoid booking at all costs.    los angeles to rome. placed a bid for upgrade to the premium cabin that was not accepted however when getting on plane seats in the premium cabin were available. when we mentioned that we had bid to upgrade and we were interested in upgrading to the premium cabin we were told that it would be 400 each. we explained our bid to the stewardess and were told to contact norwegian and they would likely pay us back the difference. unfortunately we in two different rows received the middle seat in the middle aisle. with the people in front of us reclining their chairs it was nearly impossible to get out our seats to go to the bathroom or to walk a bit on a 12 hour flight. horrible seating arrangement in the center aisle for a premium seat. the woman seated next to me unfortunately spilled her entire glass of red wine on me early in the flight. when we both notified the attendants of the situation there seemed to be absolutely no urgency to address my dilemma. instead i sat there for over five minutes as the red wine soaked into my clothing before alerting another attendant of the situation. finally i received a dinner napkin to absorb the full glass of wine on me. we communicated with their head office multiple times while we were in europe for over three weeks. we finally received a communication back close to two months after our flight notifying us basically that we could go pack sand.    i reached singapore airport for my flight to london in apreil 2018 and was told that i would not be allowed on the flight as it was overbooked despite my booking it 6 months ago. i was told i would have to call norwegian from the airport to rearrange the flight myself as there were no employees from the airline at the airport available to speak to. i was on hold for so long that it cost me 50 just to rearrange my own flight. after making a claim after arriving in london i was told i would not be refunded this money and not once was there an attempt to help me out or apologise. i was stranded and received no assistance from the airline despite it being their mistake. i will certainly never fly with them again    i flew norwegian in economy from paris to oakland and then upgraded myself for the way back. i was pretty happy with the outbound flight as i paid a very small price for an 11h flight. i booked the cheapest fare so i only had a carry on could not choose my seat and had to buy food at the airport but i still i was happy with my choice seat was okay and legroom was more than decent. i was disappointed with the return flight in premium economy. premium line at oakland was a joke so was priority boarding. lounge access was nice but the one in oak is so small it was crowded when i arrived. about the actual flight my seat was very nice and large but the staff was unprofessional. moreover no vegetarian option and premium meal below the quality of what you could find on air france or lufthansa economy menu. taking into account the low price i paid for it i still think it was a good deal but i wont upgrade next time its not worth it    copenhagen to los angeles. 45  meal ripoff the 3course meal consisted of salad very small portion with olive oil for dressing the main meal i had the beef which was ok plus a drink had a beer and for dessert a very small brownie which one was supposed to wash down with coffee. i was still hungry. the meal was given in a box that opens in two halves. ihad tv dinners for 2.95 that filled me up more. there is a snack 12 hours before the end of the flight which was just a sandwich a brownie and coffee regular size. for 45 i expected more. but one more bad experience they skipped over me while serving the lunch boxes. since not every passenger ordered the meal online they used a list printout with the seat nbr and name i suppose so an oversight by the flight attendant can happen and is forgivable. when i made the attendant aware of it she demanded i show my boarding pass and putting the onus of proof on me as though i tried to cheat the airline out of a meal. that said i would probably fly with them again but bring my own sandwiches.    . as a lowcost airline norwegian charge for literally everything. seat reservation on the lowfare is 35 10kg is your combined carry on and personal bag allowance. you dont get a free meal you have to preorder and pay for it. you dont even get a drink soda juice or coffee or snacks if you dont pay. if you need a blanket pillow or ear buds you need to pay.  they dont even offer water. i asked for it when the flight attendant skipped me and she handed me a plastic cup. when they were going around with a coffee i asked for it knowing that for nespresso coffee you have to pay but this was a regular coffee and the flight attendant looked at my airportbought sandwich on the tray and asked if i purchased a meal on the flight. when i answered no she said you have to pay for coffee.  when i arrived to the jfk two hours before my flight i saw the longest ever checkin line. they changed the gates just before boarding. im writing this is because they charged me 100 for 0.5kg more in my carryon  personal item. cabin baggage must be below 10kg so everything you have with you has to be 10kg or less. they dont even give you receipt for that but instead they stamp your boarding pass with ‘paid.     chicago to gatwick. i had a terrible experience with norwegian even after i paid for the upgrade to premium. at the airport i was told there was no dinner service so was given a voucher for use at the airport which was decent. however they also ran out of food for breakfast so i never got that. in addition the plane landed over four hours late with no apology or explanation. when i filed a claim for compensation they stated the plane only landed three hours 41 minutes late and that the circumstances were extraordinary so they declined my claim.     prague to oslo. anytime i fly with norwegian the flight is delayed. the customer service is not helpful and they do not provide any compensation for transport. yesterday i arrived to oslo over 2 hours late which would not be an issue if i would not arrive in the time of no public transport service.    venice to new york via copenhagen. flight got cancelled they did not pay for overnight stay made flight out from pisa the day after. they made me pay for my bag to new york as i had no prepaid luggage and unless preordered and paid for they make you pay for food  and they lost my bag. has been 3 days and still did not receive it.    gatwick to madrid. economy class seat pitch quite tight but comfortable enough for short haul. flight packed so slightly uncomfortable. crew mostly spanish and mostly not very welcoming unless you were spanish  they appeared to get more attention. i bought a toasted ham and cheese sandwich as it looked pleasant in the menu photo. what i received was a tiniest toasted sandwich i have seen and very burnt. i pointed out how burnt it was too the steward and he told me it is the last one i was in row 6 and they had just started service. so i kept it. i then noticed he was servicing the passenger on the isle seat who ordered the same and  yes  miraculously a perfectly toasted ham and cheese sandwich materialised so not happy with the way crew were treating me. flight arrived pretty much on time. and the wifi was not working.    new york jfk to gatwick. i was supposed to be flying on the boeing 787 and booked premium economy. one month before my flight i was sent a text saying that the 787 was not flying on that particular day i could therefore either cancel change my date or leave as is. i contacted and changed my date to a day earlier. i was assured that this would be on a 787 plane. on arrival at the plane an a330 leased in from hifly the premium seats were torn my aisle seat had been changed to a middle seat. my overhead locker was stuck down with duct tape the seats did not recline and i was unable to watch the antiquated movies choice of 5 because there were no headphones. the staff barely spoke english and just shrugged. i booked an extra night in a hotel and paid for an additional days car hire in order to fly on the boeing 787 only to spend 7.5 hours staring at the seat in front of me. there was no wifi on board. when the food arrived i opened the table only for it to collapse. an attempt to complain to norwegian was met with put it in an email and we will get back to you in 68 weeks time. when i asked to speak to someone higher i was disconnected. i  will now go back to virgin and pay the extra to at least know what i am getting.     gatwick to singapore. the seats seem roomier they have a nice movie selection but i had never received such bad treatment by disgruntled flight attendants. i have flown with norwegian in short 2 hour flights and everything okay but i saw a number of people who were unaware that they were not going to receive any meals or drinks free. flight attendants ignore you if you didnt book meals. i asked for water 3 times and only the first time they brought me a halffilled tiny cup of water the other 2 times the fa never brought anything. luckily i brought a tiny bottle of juice less than 200 ml but it saved me from dehydrating same with the wrap i bought before entering the plane. i ordered a small bottle of albanian wine and a baguette on their interactive monitor and the fa brought the wine which was as described but the baguette was a small bun for 7 usd. she didnt give me time to complain but im going to fight the charges on my credit card since this was different to what was on the picture.    paris to fort lauderdale. i felt left out during service because i did not realise i had to preorder a meal for a 10 hour flight did order a snack which was not good. not a hello nor a goodbye when boardingunboarding the aircraft.    the negatives of travelling business and not being able to choose your flight. thanks to my booking including food i was lucky enough to sample the food that was woeful small and came with two drinks throughout a 10 hour flight. were you opting for this flight because you wanted to save money then you receive nothing onboard unless you pay for it. im 62 and had nowhere to put my legs the seats were leather or faux leather and the cabin incredibly warm  a blanket or pillow is extra. at least the crew were welcoming and competent unless you wanted some sort of service. the woman in front was in economy but apparently paid for premium and didnt get a meal a drink or the cabin she paid for. it wasnt until she kicked off she managed to get food and drink. the 150 hours of online entertainment was about as good as virgin used to be in 2008.    newark to rome. the seats are so tight and very uncomfortable.  on our return flight we were passed by on the food and drinks. they werent going to give us water until we informed them that we were premium passengers. the flight attendant insisted we were not on her list which was embarrassing for us. when she finally brought our food reluctantly it wasnt fit for us. this airline is cheap in every aspect.   new york jfk to milan via copenhagen. we used norwegian as our choice of airline. the airfare didnt seem so bad at first 1800.00 round trip. but then there is the cost of the luggage since we had a layover in denmark we had to pay the luggage cost from nyc to denmark and then from denmark to italy. they charge not only for luggage but also for water yes water on a over 8 hour long trip they didnt have the courtesy to provide the customers with water. they also charge for blankets food snacks everything. the sits in the airplane are very uncomfortable and they dont recline not even 12 inch. they crank up the ac in the airplane so if you dont have a sweatshirt youd have to buy their blankets otherwise youd freeze. on our way back from italy we left from malpensa airport. our flight was supposed to leave at 1350 on june 8th. the first bad sign about this whole experience with norwegian was that there was not any norwegian presence at the airport. we arrived the night before the flight at the airport and looked around and saw absolutely no norwegian presence anywhere not a sign or desk. i had to check by travel documents to make sure i was at the right airport. there was an airport strike and 99 of the flights were cancelled. but of course our flight wasnt in fact the flight left 2 hours earlier and my wife and i and quite a few other passengers werent informed. no announcements no emails no texts. i called their customer service in the us and got a busy signal. i then called the denmark customer service and because i was calling from italy from my us phone the signal was terrible and they couldnt understand me at least thats what they told me but i heard them loud and clear they didnt want to bother with my problem. i called them a second time and the customer service heard me but after a few seconds put me on hold and hung up. i called the us customer service and finally got a hold of someone who did not care or helped me. she said i had to find someone in the airport to help me. after a while my nice manner with this customer service representative worn off and i gave her a piece of my mind about norwegian airlines. needless to say i got ripped off by an airline company that only care about taking advantage of customers with bait and switch tactics terrible service terrible customer service. in my mind for some reason i thought that european servicecustomer service would be a lot better then any other part of the world but right now its the worse possible. norwegian did not refund my flight and i had to book a flight back from malpensa to nyc and the only airline available that would fly that day was emirates and for last minute booking for 1200.00 for two people direct flight was fantastic. i think all airlines should look at how emirates takes care of their customers and learn from them. they are an amazing airline.   los angeles to paris. we booked premium flex seats. when we loaded plane were put on a hifly airline fight which is a portuguese airlines. they had no premium class. no one was told about the change. we paid for their premium class and was put on a plane that dinner trays didnt even work. they had tape holding seats together. they still never said anything to any of the passangers. we had the same problem flying out of milan. our flight was canceled without any booking options. total fraud. do not fly norwegian    this is a low cost airline and their premium economy is low cost even if you end paying as much as a airline. i originally booked a rt ticket from lax to cdg and cdg to lax. however i had to cancel at the last minute my laxcdg portion as they switched their aircraft from their new boeing 787 to a leased a340 from hifly with apparently no or little in flight entertainment and very old seats. fortunately the cdglax portion was still operated by a boeing 787 from norwegian but i was still disappointed. weight limit for check in luggage is 2x20 kg. agent at paris check in counter wasnt particularly friendly. the lounge at cdg is very basic with some soda white and red wine and snacks such as chips and cheese. boarding was disorganized but they did board premium passengers first. after boarding they offered a preflight drink of water or orange juice. seats are old style business class recliners quite comfortable with decent leg room. they only provide you a slim blanket but no pillow or amenity kits. soon after we took off they offered drinks but no snacks. then they served the main meal which comes in a box and looks like a regular economy meal. no snack was offered during the flight. you can supposedly order drinks including alcoholic drinks free during the flight from your ife system but beverages including coke and sprite were out of stock. ife offers about 40 movies but remains quite limited.    2gatwick to gothenburg. flight was cancelled. no customer support at gatwick we had to move around the airport several times without any useful information and no one from norwegian to deal with the cancellation. the norwegian web interface is full of bugs and the view is not consistent with the ios app. consistently generates these technical errors without major explanation and it gives a phone number in norway. customer relations are not helpful more on the rude side.    newark to paris orly operated by euroatlantic airways. norwegian is the worst airline i have flown. they nickel and dime you for everything and do not offer complimentary drinks we had to practically beg for a cup of still water. the seat was uncomfortable legroom was limited there was no entertainment or internet and our reading lamp did not work. the flight attendants were charmless and unhelpful. when we arrived in parisorly we had to wait 2 full hours to retrieve our bags. our flight back was similarly miserable when we arrived in newark we had to wait over two hours to disembark.     oakland to barcelona. the seat had good leg room. the cabin was too hot waiting for take off. not all of the entertainment systems were  working. no announcements re food entertainment systems tablet replacements etc. when we landed in oakland had to wait a long time for luggage handlers to deliver. before flying i tried calling for seat assignment. i asked for exit row both going and returning. turns out i did not get exit row coming or going from bcn. some of the ticket machines in oakland to print boarding passes did not work.    boston to gatwick. flight was delayed 2.5 hours because the incoming flight was delayed. the airport agents were late opening up were not helpful or friendly and very unprofessional. the airport screens said they open at 5pm and they were there but just chilling out and chatting. they finally opened at 530. and then the same group showed up at the gate still chilling out chatting and checking their cellphones. and announcing delays. they finally offered meal 10 meal vouchers as required by eu law 5 minutes before they started boarding without telling us where we could use them. by then it was 11pm and the food places were either closed or out of food. i had selected seats online when i purchased the tickets but the seating chart didnt match the actual aircraft so we ended up in the front row by the cabin door no underseat storage and next to the galley. i would not have chosen these seats with an accurate seating chart. the flight attendants offered no help in storing our carryon and didnt let us know that carryons only had to be stored during takeoff and landing.   our 930pm flight took off at midnight and about 1230am they offered dinner.  my wife used her jacket as a blanket and was told when we were about to land to either put it on or store it. this was the worst flight weve been on.    the flight from madrid to london leaving madrid on a monday evening at 18.15 is never on time. i have taken this flight several times in the last year and can honestly say it never is on time and i am not talking about 30 minutes or an hour usually it is 12 hours. on my last flight we were more than 4 hours delayed the reason given were technical problems whatever this might mean. i started flying with norwegian probably 2 years ago and was really pleased with them. not only the price but also the service. i have to say that especially in the last year they have developed into one of the worst airlines for many reasons but especially on this route.   norwegian staff in orly paris airport lied to our plane members multiple times regarding a canceled flight. they sent us an hour outside of paris by bus to a hotel and told us a bus would pick us up for our flight but when we got there the hotel staff said they booked you a room for tonight and have you leaving tomorrow after we had slept in the airport overnight. they refused to give us passengers any food when we hadnt eaten in 24 hours and slept in what looked like a refugee campsite with mini cots. worst airline experience ive ever had. norwegian you treat people with no respect and very inhumanely.   we were informed three weeks prior to our scheduled trip that norwegian would not be operating our flight. it was changed to euro atlantic. this was going to be an older aircraft with fewer amenities. with only three weeks prior to our trip it was going to be too expensive to change to another airline therefore reluctantly we decided to still fly with norwegian. our flight to rome was uneventful. no issues. on the flight from paris to new york when we arrived at the airport we received a text message 2 hours before scheduled departure that the flight had been canceled. we discovered from other passengers that this was the second day in a row this flight had been canceled. there was no one at the norwegian customer service desk to help nor could you get a norwegian representative on the phone. we eventually had to purchase a ticket with another airline the next day for double the amount of our ticket with norwegian. we have filed an online claim for our refund and three weeks later we have not received any type of response on the status of our claim. this by far is the worst airline ever   i have booked a ticket for corfu which apparently is not refundable or at least thats what the customer service said even if you call them up a month prior to departure. the dates for direct flights for my destination greece even during the summer are very few so unfortunately i cant book another day that is convenient to me that would not require me to spend 15 hours at some oslo airport. therefore i would recommend to use this company only for their main flight routes i.e. norway flights and try some other one for different routes that actually have an adequate flight schedule.   the airline told us that they did not have an aircraft for our flight. after a one hour delay they told us they were putting us on a malaysian airlines aircraft. we had the option of either complying or getting a refund without any compensation for the fact that we would then need to pay extremely inflated sameday ticket prices or stay in a hotel until the next available flight. malaysian airlines aircraft was very very old without any basic amenities for a standard international flight and with no inflight entertainment for an 8 hour flight. i will never fly with norwegian again    los angeles to paris. we were booked on a boeing 787 but were then told it would be an airbus which was then overbooked. our reserved seats side by side were changed to 2 in different rows which we only found out at the airport. the airbus did not have an airline name on it it cant have been norwegian since they boast of only having boeing 787s. the flight personnel wore no identifying uniforms and conversed in portuguese and were rude and inefficient whilst inflight entertainment was minimal  not ideal for a 10 hour flight  far inferior to that of the boeing 787. i have made my concerns known to norwegian customer services asking for explanations. after four weeks i have had nothing back from them other than a confirmation that they received my complaint. i maintain that their lack of service and reaction gives the lie to their boasts about customer satisfaction.     gatwick to orlando returning from boston in premium cabin as part of a big birthday celebration. the out journey was very good but the return was the worst i have encountered. problems started at check in with staff refusing to answer questions on why we had been moved from seats 1a1b to row 7. i asked repeatedly if there were any issues but was told no. we arrived at the aircraft turned left to find a downgrade to economy despite holding a premium ticket. the cabin staff said not their fault and called ground staff who told us to sit or get off and if we did not move quick they would get police to forcibly remove us. 4 weeks later and no reply from norwegian no refund as per eu law and 10 hours to their call center only to have the call cut by staff after waiting more than an hour each time.   flight was delayed last minute due to a police intervention as a group of passengers had to be removed and arrested. the crew handled this very professionally and did all security checks quickly so we could take off as soon as possible. but once we were airborne the inflight service was another story once they started the food and beverage service cabin crew constantly had to go back and forth to the galley to get foods or drinks. it took them ages to give passengers what they requested process payments and reach the next row. they also seemed not to bother about this. i was very annoyed as i just wanted a bottle of water and had to wait for more than 45 minutes until they finally reached my row. this is usually faster with their main competitor. also i find it outrageous that easyjet uses an old gbpeur exchange rate. gbp 1.80 is definitely not 2.50 eur at the moment i think easyjet crews are usually very professional but they should be overall more dynamic. other than that plane was tidy and in all comfortable for the low cost standard.   it has been nearly two months and 8 requests for assistance to no avail. my travel partner was reimbursed for hotel cost due to a cancelled flight the correspondence clearly stated we are sorry for the cancellation of your flight. yet i am being refused compensation for the flight i paid for our flight and the cost of the rental car and dinner to get us to our destination. we could not have made the next day flight and still made our connecting flight from geneva to london so we rented a car and drove overnight. how is it that she is being reimbursed but i am not we were both scheduled on the same flight and she paid for our hotel stay. how many different customer service agents do i have to correspond with until i can speak to someone     athens to manchester. seems standard after reading some reviews here. they stopped me at the gate and charged me 60 euros for an oversize bag that ive taken on a few dozen other flights with no trouble. third slot has some metal bars at the top that shrink what you can put in by a cm or two and they know it. never flying with them again no matter what their price.   gatwick to athens. once we got to the gate a flight attendant told us that we could not board the plane because we had 2 pieces of luggage 1 hand luggage and 1 small laptop case and both of them were oversized. then she explained that some policies hadchanged and we do not meet the criteria or had accepted the new policies that had been sent to our email. then we were ask to combine our luggage into 1 even though they were oversized after 20 minutes of us trying to fit a laptop case into a very small handluggage she told us that we could now board to the flight but we had to give our handluggage to be stored at the bottom of the aircraft. another 5 minutes till we had placed our luggage and we were told to follow a nice ground staff so we could handin our baggage and board from the back. we were supposed to be seated at the 2nd row.    belfast to gatwick. very unprofessional staff. before boarding the flight at the airport gate the member of staff checking passengers in kept coughing not really covering her mouth then handled passports and boarding passesmobile phones with etickets without using sanitizer it felt very unhygeinic. the air hostess doing the safety demonstration burst out laughing along with the cabin manager while doing the safety demonstration the cabin manager then hid behind a screen to avoid been seen laughing. they safety demonstration was disrupted and not completed. the staff snacked on sweets throughout the flight making announcements with a mouthful of sweets sometimes. my bag had to be moved to the overhead compartment to which the cabin manager muttered god not this again before moving my bag above. the flight was also 50min delayed to which the captain said sorry for being a few minutes late didnt seem to realise that 50mins late can be very disruptive for passengers.   easyjet for sure is a low cost carrier. you get what you pay for. the flight from london to munich was completely full and its not particularly used for business traveling. everyone is bringing a carry on bag and the easyjet staff are very strict about their regulations you get what you pay they check it at the gate. the seats are quite narrow but id say for short distance flights its ok. also the staff seems to be pretty young.   flew manchester to santorini. simply put this was the worst service i have ever encountered when flying. when waiting to go home in the hot sun with a 3 year old we had to wait in excess of 3 hours while the airport authorities tried to get 37 volunteers not to fly. no reason no explanation was given. chaos ensued. no representative from the airline was present instead the airline left the announcement and the dealing with how to sort out frustrated tired ill and angry passengers. the airport staff were poorly behaved rude threatening both physically and with the police. apparently after boarding eventually we were told that a member of the crew had fallen ill. this according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. problems occur yes. but the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. compensation was offered for volunteers. but no guarantee of a flight back within a week was given. so compensation meant nothing. those who did choose compensation had real difficulties getting back to their connecting airports. the compensation did not cover car parking food hotel accommodation etc. loss of earnings connecting flights. easyjet simply did not handle this very well. it appears this is frequent occurrence. the airport staff told us too i shall not fly with easyjet again. simply put they did not care about their customers. proof  no apology no announcements and they did not have one of their staff step off the plane to come and explain. this would have helped a lot. no food or drinks on the return flight too rubbish. makes ryanair look like one of the best services    liverpool to madrid. our last experience with easyjet has been appalling. we got our tickets a month ago but when trying to check in the night before the flight it turned out that there are no seats left on the plane for us we arrived super early on the day and were told that easyjet oversells the seats and that we were standby passangers. we had to wait for everyone to board and for the crew to check if anyone did not arrive leaving empty seats empty but paid for. stressing over not getting there for a close relatives birthday the money lost that we paid for the hotel wasted holiday day booked off work are just the beginning of it. people must know that when they think they are getting seats on the plane they are only really getting a possibility of a seat. we were absolutely appalled with the fact that the company got paid twice for our seats my wife sat in the place of someone who did not travel due to serious sickness discovered very recently as his friends told her and both her and the friends of that person were disgusted that easyjet would not accept refunds but will happily pass that seat to someone else who paid the same money and should have their own seat. we dont understand why getting the ticket and seat is not treated a contract but instead easyjet has the right to cancel it last minute and tell you that you are not going on the plane for which you bought the ticket not due to weather or technical problems but as a result of their greed. what a terrible example of customer service its unbelievable in 21st century and it has to change or we should all change the airline we use.    gatwick to funchal. very poor planning. they made all passengers to queue and wait in the rain when it is 5 degree celsius with strong winds. there is an elderly couple in their 80s in front of me who stood for over half an hour outside in the wind and rain waiting to be boarded.    porto to bristol. no communication. flight considerably delayed not only from previous airport but the one before that. given that easyjet knew this they only advised this well after they asked us to go to the gate. this delay was not put up in the departures display. how inconsiderate or idle.    bristol to malaga. i checked on line 5 days before our departure. unfortunately i did not realise that my son who is 4 years old was allocated a seat separated from me from the aisle. once there i asked the steward if there was anything he could do since my son starting crying and was refusing to sit next to a stranger and fasten his belt. the steward told me that if i wanted that i should have checked in a month in advance  or pay extra he added that the law allows them to separate the children well if there is any law that allows that it should clearly be changed thankfully other passengers offered their place and we managed to sit close but i found this very upsetting and the stewards answer unhelpful. on our way back at the boarding point families with young children were offered to board with priority but then they ask us to pay extra to sit close to our children is this what easyjet considers as family care or in our society you need to pay for everything on their website they advertise their service where by paying you can sit close to the people you care most and the motto iseasyjet generation. appaling   flew easyjet from geneva to london stansted. horrible airline the prices are low but the service is terrible. no information given to passengers 5 min before departing no one at the station. it is the last time i will be taking an easyjet flight acknowledging other prices of other airline companies it is better to pay more at least there will some sort of service. this company is a disaster.   london to geneva. i just want to share my experience over the past few years. during that period my flights have been delayed 810 times. mostly they were evening flights and the average delay is about 90 mins. avoid if you can. ill never fly again with this company.   i found the eastjet website to be clear and userfriendly. i booked a flight from catania to naples and was very pleased with the efficient bagdrop and friendly and helpful ground staff. boarding was slightly delayed as two blind passengers needed assistance. i noted though that only one staff member went out of his way to help the blind passengers. far too much handluggage was allowed aboard the flight and it was a concern that the cockpit door was left open for quite some time as the pilot chatted with various people. i bought a drink and the cabin crew member walked away without rendering the change. i had to call one of his colleagues and even then i was given the wrong change and had to challenge it. no apology was received. disembarkation was quite well managed and the although there was a 40 min delay it was acceptable. easyjet competes well with full service airlines and i shall consider flying with them again.   this is more advice for fellow passengers than review since we all know how terrible this airline is. we were meant to fly from lisbon to funchal for our vacation the flight was canceled they kept us waiting for 3 hours before giving any information. they said bad weather was the cause other flights managed to land though so this wasnt the case we then waited in another line for 6 hours whilst 600 people were being seen by 1 member of staff who after getting to the help desk denied working for the airline and said shed didnt have information for us an we should request a refund please never do this as they arent liable for client care ie no money for hotels or new flight. they couldnt put us on a flight until a week later which was past the date we flew home we booked into a hotel for two nights after already paying in madeira the next flight was 500 more after contacting them their response was the same as the help desk no refund will be given nor will they help with accommodations 20 of us in the same situation all receiving this outrageous information. absolutely horrible experience cost us 1200 as result and a flat out refusal for reimbursement never again easyjet    luton to tel aviv. i had heard bad reports about easyjet to say the least but i was prepared to give them a chance and be fair minded. on departure from tel aviv i was crammed into an airport shuttle bus to take me to the plane.  my seat location on the aircraft meant that i was pushed into by crew and other passengers. on arrival at luton i found out that they had lost their bag. no apology from easyjet whatsoever. ground staff took their time to file a report and i used 5 of mobile phone to liase with my brother for pick up because of the mess. after six days into the trip i still dont know where my bag is or when i will get it back. thumbs down to this unprofessional and incompetent airline.   missed flight from berlin to rome due to ticket counter man saying we purchased the baggage package for sports equipment instead of baggage. he sent us to the insanely long customer service line. in line i realized i could upgrade the baggage myself. i did so in 30 seconds and went back to him letting him know i had done this showing him receipt proof. he said i still needed to stand in the customer service line and get confirmation from them. i went back to the line and finally after 1 hour of waiting all he did was print a reciept that i already had on my phone. finally when i got back to the check in counter they told me check in was closed and that i couldnt get a refund and they wouldnt put me on another flight. later i checked my original baggage package i had purchased and i did not get the sports equipment package. i shouldve been put through the first time and let on my flight. they made me wait 2 hours total pay additional money for a luggage package that was correct in the first place and waste 226 euros and most importantly made us lose our day in rome and the hotel that we had already paid for. ive never seen such an unprofessional company in my life and would never recommend easyjet to anyone   awful service didnt even get greeted at the entrance. no staff offered to help elderly get their luggage in the overhead lockers. all cabin space filled up quickly and while everyone struggled to decide what was happening people had to walk back off with their suitcases. then the two staff including the staff manager did not organise themselves very well and my child that struggled with her ears couldnt even get a drink. they stopped serving food and drink as we were descending. didnt think to ask if they could offer a closed bottle of water did not even acknowledge me or apologise or see if we were ok. ridiculous service and a bunch that dont know how to organise themselves. budget service or not its a service that was paid for.   london to barcelona. our flight was cancelled which wasnt too much of a surprise however communication from easyjet staff was sadly lacking. passengers were more or less left to their own devices they offered us a flight to the uk which was no where near our home and no public transport was available at the hour the flight landed. the whole experience was very unpleasant and the airline clearly rate customer service as unimportant. in this day and age it is simply not acceptable. i definitely wont be flying easyjet again.    this flight back to gatwick was 8 hours late. after 4 hours not only the easy jet gate attendant but the easy jet app was telling us that the flight would arrive within 15 minutes. after that it suddenly went back to arriving another 3.5 hours later. when we looked into it we realised the aircraft still hadnt left london so clearly they know there was no way it would arrive within 15 minutes. the gate attendant said it would appear on the radar any time now this was worse than no communication with their passengers. we were deliberately mislead. never flying easyjet again.    malaga to bristol. return flight from malaga booked with easyjet. we were told when booking in our flight was cancelled. no alternative flight was offered other than a return to a different uk airport 4 days later. i was advised by disinterested staff to find another flight home on the internet. i had no phone and no internet as a result. i have now managed to find another return flight. my main gripes are 1. staff disinterested 2. easyjet are supposed to offer accommodation and transport while sorting another flight  none of these were forthcoming. 3. as a woman i my own i am stranded in a foreign city with limited money and no idea of how i am returning home with no attempt at help from easyjet. in short very very unimpressed.    amsterdam to vienna. at the check in i was not allowed to take my handbag with me because it counts as a second hand luggage. the first 510 people were allowed to take their bags with them which seems very unfair. after already waiting for about half an hour to enter the plane i found bread crumbs and hair on my seat and the window was and full of finger prints. apparently the flight got delayed for one hour because one of the stewardesses got sick and her standby flight attendant wasnt around. if that wasnt enough the flight got delayed for another 2 hours which means i had to spend 5 hours in the airplane for a flight that should only take one and a half hours. because i obviously did not expect such a long delay i did not bring any food with me and i had to buy the expensive food on the plane.     gibraltar to manchester flight cancelled on 22 april. we were a party of 9 myself my partner 3 step kids and 4 of their friends. no assistance from easyjet ground crew in finding alternate transport hotels meals etc. managed to get a flight from malaga to doncaster for the 7 kids and malaga to southampton we live in the midlands near stafford so not ideal for myself and my partner both departing the next day. this really was the very best we could get. easyjet emailed on 7 may and in doing so have entered a contract to confirm they would be paying the kids expenses claim amounting to 609.63 alternate transport 216.63 hotel 180.34 one time gesture of goodwill meal 141.69 one time gesture of goodwill transfers 70.97 no reimbursement as promised has been received. i also put in another expenses claim for myself and my partner. no reimbursement for this has been received either. judging by the number of complaints and cancelled flights i dont know how they manage to keep flying.   \\r\\r\\nour flight was cancelled and we had to arrange our own flight back to london and accommodation. easyjet then expect you to fill out an online form to claim your expenses back this was a flight back to london on sunday meaning everyone had work to return to but couldnt do so because easyjet just seem to take bookings without taking into account all the most important factors. the weather was perfectly fine but they used the weather in france as an excuse to cancel a flight on sunday night the accommodation was sorted out by easyjet using their app on your phone but we had to wait around like clowns for a shuttle bus only to be taken far away from city central but close enough to the airport we had to wait around while having nothing interesting to do because the hotel they arranged was situated near a motor way system. please avoid using their services on the weekends because you will suffer alot if they cancel your flight and youre left stranded in a foreign country unprerpared for this sort of scenario.    santorini to gatwick delayed by 40 minutes. worst airline ever. been delayed after checking in both ways. still waiting to take off on a plane that smells. rather pay a few more  for a decent airline that you can rely on.    milan malpensa to paris cdg. flight cancelled and rebooked for the next day. even on the next day the flight was late more than 1 hour. i lost a whole day of work. reason given staff had been working more than allowed as if easyjet doesnt know when their flights are scheduled  this happens when companies only look at costs. i am a weekly commuter between milan and paris. out of my last 60 flights 36 were delayed by at least 3040 minutes. that is pathetic and bad. if one adds the recurrently chaotic boarding procedures cdg is the worst and the terrible f&b offering on board the ridiculous excuses given by ground staff always given pretty late ie sometimes 1 hour after notices have been sent by the app and customer service that doesnt give a damm as not answering emails and complaints...id be tempted to say easyjet is the worst airline i know. but seemingly management doesnt really care as on this route there are very little alternatives.    basel to barcelona. will not fly with this company again. they cancelled our flight only after 6 hours of making us wait even though they knew the flight was cancelled 6 hours before. then once they told us they made us wait another 2 hours to try and get us to leave without reimbursing anyone or paying for hotels like is required. after waiting they kicked us out of the airport and did not offer another flight for 3 additional days after the original flight.   berlin tegel to vienna. this route was operated by wdl aviation on behalf of easyjet and it was a rare chance for me to check out an aircraft that is neither boeing nor airbus. it was a bae 146  interior was relatively cramped in a 33 configuration and it looked rather old overall. there was also a dead bug trapped behind the window of my seat refer to pic below. caught sight of the first officer for this flight who was a young lady. still quite an uncommon occurrence these days even with all the gender equality. no entertainment or refreshments were available for this short hop across the border. decent for a short point to point flight no more no less.    berlin to paris. my flight was on thursday july 5 at 915. i wake up at 6 am and i was in airport at 7 am. when i went to check in i found the flight was cancelled already. easyjet does not have desk in berlin airport. nobody helps us to find other flight to paris we were exhausted in airport for 4 hours finally we bought train ticket from berlin to paris at 130 pm. we arrived to paris 1030 pm. we get to hotel 1130. horrible day from 6 am to midnight. i payed 160 euro more than air plain thicket for train ticket and i lost one day of my trip to paris. still i did not received my money and expense of taxi and food in train station. very unprofessional airline zero customer service. even we asked to call them to asked some information for refund of my money and expenses but they said easyjet does not have phone line in airport ridiculous.    me and my wife flew to ibiza from stansted on 5 jul 18 for a short break 4 days. checked in with no hassles at all quite a easy system using the app and only carrying hand luggage. we queued to board and the check in staff where stopping i would say 1 in every 4 or five people and charging them for extra baggage if they had it even including a hand bag or a man bag. we were one of the people that got charged 47 for extra baggage i was frustrated as three people in front of me had the same bags as me. the lady at the desk was rude and would not discuss the issue we just had to pay. we finally got onto the plane after being charged 47. we had a good holiday and left our hotel roughly 1930 on the 8 jul to return to uk via ibiza airport. again went straight through security with absolute no dramas in spain the staff were much more polite and not looking to make a quick pound whilst browsing the duty free i received a notification on my phone that the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 mins later another flight delayed by 4 hours then roughly 2100 flight cancelled. we left gate are and went to find the easyjet information counter when we got there we were offered a flight three days later which was no good due to being back at work the next day. we explained this and were told you have to buy your own return flight if you want to go earlier. thats fine if you have a spare 500 which what it ended up costing all in. there was five easjet staff at the counter 1 lady was working and the other four were doing nothing even though there was around 200 people in the same boat. 1 working 4 doing nothing so frustrating. we managed to get on another flight via majorca to london luton which was 53 miles from where my car was parked. i will never fly again stay well clear.    bristol to barcelona. as i am taller than most i paid extra for a front row seat this was a mistake as we had the wall between us and the exit area we had limited leg room. once we had boarded the passenger next to us boarded she was a flight attendant that knew the crew. so they embraced and had extended conversation. the conversation went right through the pilots announcements and the safety briefing  this was by a flight attendant who was a passenger talked right through the safety briefing. as soon as she boarded the attendants gave her a bottle of water then as soon as we took off she got two gin and tonics well before any other passenger had been served  did she pay of course not. then she was given the toasted sandwich no charge the cold meat what ever that was no charge then the chocolate cookie no charge all before any passenger got a inking of being served. the crew and her continued dialogue ignoring the remaining passengers. this type of service really does put off regular full fare paying customers from using their service we the full fare payers are subsidizing the friends of crew. what type of message is easyjet sending out to the world.    nice to geneva. do not take this airline they are the worst. my three last flights were all canceled just 40 mins before flight. this is the most unprofessional company i have flown with. service is horrible always late or canceled and always making up stupid excuses.     i had 40 min airtime flight from stansted to amsterdam and then way back. the flight was 2h 40 mins delayed and 1h 40m delayed on the way back from amsterdam to london stansted. this is ridiculous. and each time they make lame excuses that the flight earlier was delayed etc. really bad experience.    geneva to krakow. easyjet goes from bad to worse. i remember times she it was most reliable and very correct company. this year its a disaster. every flight is delayed for various excuses. im a frequent flyer i board once per week. flying on time is a big exception. its normal for them to board on time and keep waiting on a craft for an hour or keep at the gate with no info. half an hour delay become a standard and noone cares about passengers connections. besides stuff is less and less qualified and motivated. sometimes they hardly speak english and make no effort to make themself understood. im really disappointed with the company performance. with a hub in geneva it unfortunately lost all swiss or eu standards. now im at the airport and see that will get info only at the scheduled time of departure. so two hours waiting with no information.    edinburgh to munich. easyjet is getting worse. i used to fly with them which was a basic but positive experience most of the time but over the last months all my flights have been delayed. they seem not to manage to manage their connections when they blame unforeseen circumstances for delays and cancellations. on the top of that the customer service seems to be  based on providing false information on the airport that everything will be refunded etc. which is not refunded afterwards and they appear not even to be obliged to answer your email    you get what you pay for. worst airline experience ever.  we arrived at the the airport 2 plus hours before scheduled departure. i saw that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. the flight was pushed until 1130 am and didnt actually take off until 1211 pm. we decided to walk around and buy gifts for for our family inside ams airport. we get back to the bag drop area and are informed that we wouldnt be able to check in and would not be allowed to get on the flight. keep in mind that this was at 0947 am which is 1 hour and 43 minutes prior to delayed departure time. we go the help desk and the one agent didnt get to us until 1002. she was rude when speaking to us.  instead of the normal bumping and compensation i think that easyjet turned it on the customer under the online checkin closes 2 hours prior to scheduled departure clause. it does not specify on the email airport counter closes at that same time.  there was no communication to me that flights from rome to munich were cancelled. no email no text no call. customer service desk doesnt open until 8 too late to sort out how we can get reimbursed  to fly on a different airline.  it seems like theyare one of the most noncommunicative airlines judging from the volumes of people that have experienced issues with the airline. this airline is cheap for a reason.  travelled from edinburgh to luton on 300515 and returned on 070615. being disabled i requested assistance on both journeys.  the staff at edinburgh were superb both times  but the staff at luton were almost nonexistent. on arrival at luton we were taken to the baggage hall and told to sit at the side where we would be attended to. i could see my case going round and round and it was eventually removed and taken to me by another passenger. when an attendant eventually arrived after a very long time he was rushed off his feet as there was such a shortage of staff.  on the return journey i was almost reduced to tears.  i rang from the booth for disabled assistance and was assured someone would be with me as soon as possible.  i rang twice more and both times was assured someone was on the way. eventually a very kind parking attendant went to investigate matters and someone arrived within 10 minutes by which time i was almost passing out with the heat as it was like sitting in a greenhouse with the sun beating down and i had waited an hour and a quarter  again the attendant was run off his feet through lack of staff and i had not even been checked in so much for having to arrive 90 minutes before the flight.  as it was the plane was late otherwise i would have missed my flight.  having said all that all staff were very civil but it did turn my lovely holiday into a nightmare.  if easyjet are committed to helping disabled people have a smooth journey from start to finish they need to get their act together and liaise with oes re passenger assistance especially in this day and age. may i add that the cabin crews were most helpful as were the oes staff at edinburgh where the service is most professional. the gate agents declined our backpacks as personal items to go under the seat and informed us we had to consolidate them into our full rollerbags in order to take them on the plane. of course we could not accomplish this. the agent then informed us they would have to be checked at 45 per bag fee and this could not be done until all others had boarded the plane. we could have bought the two rollerbags a seat on the plane for half that amount of money. after tagging our bags the agents did not seem to be able to figure out how to charge us so they told us to give our bags to the luggage handler at the bottom of the airplane steps and get on the flight which we were holding up at that point. we felt very manipulated and embarrassed and will not use this airline again despite its favorable pricing. its a great bargain as long as you travel naked just to print the boarding pass was a nightmare. i tried for several times and i did not succeed. that was in rome. i asked a friend in uk and we did not succeed. we made a round of all the shops in town that could help us but they could not we went back and tried many ways at last after many many attempts we had this boarding press printed. a real nightmare and a loss of time. moreover to bring the guitar in the cabin i had to pay 50 euros. i really would not recomend it. my husband made arrangements for our europe trip months in advance. we were due to fly out of paris through easyjet to berlin. our flight was at 7 am. we arrived at the airport 1.5 hours in advance only to find out the airline requires you to checkin online. the clerk argued that it was too late. how is it possible that they could give our seats away when there was still 1.5 hours left until our flight left. in any case they were not helpful in trying to book another flight. they were fully booked for days. we ended up taking the shuttle to a different airport and booking a more expensive flight for 13 hours later. the seats onboard were awful as i could see the seat covers were torn and seat tray table would not latch properly to stopper they kept falling off. this was the case with every seat. the flight did not have a facility to warm milk for my baby. i know its a low cost carrier but many essential things are offloaded. passengers are not even offered water on board that should be free. i really do not see big price difference when i compare full service carriers over easyjet.  i havent flown with this airline for 8 years. seating much better than in past. staff look smarter but still old easyjet poor staff attitude herded on and fed the expensive usual. at the end the proverbial goodbye thank you for flying us etc. no screen to watch route and the captain flying out couldnt say anything about the route. friends who flew with a sister holiday airline had really useful data regarding route. so really no better.  horrendous experience both myself my 2 year old and my husband were allocated seats in different rows. when i requested help with this on the plane i was told to sort it out myself the flight attendant also informed me if you wanted to sit beside your two year old you should have paid to do so. i had already paid almost 600 for the 3 seats and since minors cant travel alone i assumed one of us would be seated with him. it was obviously something i hadnt even thought of an in hindsight even though i shouldnt have to pay even more it would have been the safer option however my complaint is with the way it was dealt with by the cabin crew and the distinct lack of customer care. i encountered rudeness and aggression and was spoken to like i had done something terribly wrong. i am disgusted.  i am pleased to say easyjet performed well for the busy summer season for our flights to and from la rochelle to visit family. we didnt have bags but did get to the airport very early. outbound ezy8995 14.40 15.3017.05 17.37 july 28th. once in the departure lounge a 12 min delay was posted with the inbound aircraft 30 mins late. around 30 mins before scheduled time of departure we got told to go to gate 52. boarding was predominately hassle free but people could just walk on the plane. we pushed back at 15.00 and left gatwick at 15.30 which was 50 mins late. the cabin crew were friendly and did apologise a few times for the delay. the food was quite expensive but still not as bad as ryanair. we landed at 17.37 and deboarding was done quickly. the delay was acceptable as it was the 3rd return flight of the day in the summer. inbound ezy8996 12.35 13.2512.50 13.20 august 5th. once in the departure lounge a 25 min delay was posted. we boarded quickly around 10 mins after the aircraft arrived and were off quickly and on time. we were advised a flying time of 50 mins which is extremely quick in comparison to the average duration therefore service was rushed. however it was good to catch up with the delay. all in all the easy jet service was normal and the delays were bearable for the peak summer season. flights costs 95 per person with row 7 seats prebooked. the flight itself was ok typical low cost airline food inedible and coffee poor. seats cramped aircraft new and very clean and neat. the problem with this flight was the terrible check in at catania no priority given to flight departure times all flights in one rugby scrum queue jumping was the norm. we arrive a full two hours before the flight the check only opened an hour before departure and we barely made the flight absolutely ridiculous. flight cancelled after lightning strike. kept us on plane for 1.5 hrs crew said alternatives would be sorted out. no easyjet employees to assist approx 130 passengers. 2 menzies staff trying to handle a planeful of passengers by offering buses to edinburgh or stansted. easyjet knows nothing of customer service. we paid through the nose for flights for the 6 of us with lufthansa tomorrow. it was not easyjets fault that we were delayed by bad weather and so we missed our connection to edinburgh but they tried to profit from our distress by demanding 120 to transfer us on the next flight to edinburgh the next morning. no offer of a hotel. turned to british airways for help who got us on their last flight that evening. what a difference better seats free drink and snack and happy staff. i flew easyjet from cdg in paris to biarritz this week. before i left i measured the size of my carryon luggage to ensure it fit the easyjet requirements. it did. yet when i arrived at the gate i was told i had to check my bag and pay 30 euros. i complained and asked to speak to a supervisor. this was the worst experiences i have had on a lowbudget carrier. ground staff were tenacious about my luggage. completely unacceptable especially when the luggage fit the parameters of easyjets policy. ground staff didnt like my laptop bag and wouldnt define it as one. luton to belfast international. i paid extra to pick my seat. there was a biting cold wind with gusts to 50mph. boarding was really slow so i got to stand around on open steps for several minutes whilst people got their stuff packed. when i got on board my carefully chosen window seat turned out to be next to a screaming baby. i swapped with one of the parents so i was then one row away from a screaming baby. on a flight with unallocated seating i would have picked a seat 15 rows away. the next time i flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. there were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. it meant i had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when i should have been on my way home. they are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. it takes too long to board so they end up running late. if im boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat. however with easyjet if i am queuing outside i want everyone onboard and seated as soon as possible. when ive got a choice i will use some other airline. first the easybus service was nightmare as we werent able to get on the right bus as it was late and when it arrived my kids and i couldnt get on. when we got to the airport we were forced to pay 25 for luggage being 1 kg over weight. if that was british airways that would be fine. for the flight you have to pay for food which the prices are ridiculous and the food isnt that amazing. 1 year prior to this occasion my kids and i had to fly to spain and unfortunately easyjet messed up our booking and we had to miss a weeding my advice is only go on easyjet for a weekend out with your friends other than that better fly on british airways or another airline. they sold me 4 oneway flights instead of 2 flying out and 2 return between rome and basel. the 14th i flew out to basel. on the 15th i showed up at basel and they explained i had tickets to fly out of rome again  without ever returning of course no problem they allowed me to either change the two tickets for 289 euro or throw out the old ticket and buy two new for 279 e refused to check me in to my flight from paris orly to nice because i arrived at the checkin desk 43 minutes before the flight. forced me to buy a pair of new airline tickets at a cost of 150 euros on the next flight. i was in line for 13 minutes. at the next flight i made it through security in 8 minutes. they didnt start boarding until 18 minutes before departure. forced my husband to pay 30 euros at checkin because his carryon was 1.8 cm taller than their published standard threatened to charge us 50 euros if we took it to the gate. my carryon passed at checkin and at the gate they tried to force me to check it for 50 euros because it would not fall all the way into the baggage sizer of its own force. first experience with easyjet will be my last. have travelled on numerous occasions with easyjet in the past. i hope i never have to travel with them again. went to amsterdam last friday 24 may on 10.10 am flight. had booked in one piece of luggage and we had a small trolley case. check in staff told us to put case in size gauge. we had no worries as this piece of luggage was used in march to travel with easyjet to geneva. we were wrong as the wheels were not fully in gauge and we had then to pay 25. we were angry and embarrassed re this. as we waited to be checked in not one other passenger was asked to even remove their luggage off trolley just us spoke to supervisor on site waste of time as expected. she just said she would ensure all staff were advised to check size of hand baggage. this didnt happen. any way the case was classed as hand luggage on our return trip. first flight paris orly  rome may 22. we stood for boarding for over an hour before being told incoming aircraft was 20 minutes late. passengers were still getting off plane when we were on jetway and we had to stop for another 5 minutes. took an hour to get luggage. if it could get any worse next flight venicecdg 1.30 hour flight june 8th was supposed to board at 8.40 pm. due to a crew change we did not board aircraft until 2.30am arriving 4.30am june 9th over 6 hours delay with everyone pretty much spending the night in the airport. consolation food voucher. flew to athens and back didnt pay a bargain basement price either and yet the price kept hiking up further with every turn. when we arrived at gatwick we had to pay an extra 100 for the 2 cases we had. i hadnt interpreted the message on the website correctly and assumed the charge option was given if travellers wanted to take more than the usual one suitcase per person so i ignored the option to pay for luggage online. before the trip i received an email saying the return flight time was changed to a late flight with no alternatives so thought id pay another 16 online for extra leg room so we could sleep more comfortably. got to athens check in and even though we had no extra weight we were asked to transfer stuff into hand luggage. i told them i had paid for extra leg room for the flight and they had no record of this either unfortunately for us i had paid this extra online so i had no receipt. i attempted to sort it out and was told to go to see a woman on the reservations desk. i crossed the airport and was met by the most arrogant obnoxious woman i have encountered in a customer service role. it was clear i was going to get nothing and nowhere. flew rt from paris orly to rome fco. flight was ontime but service was lacking. this is a nofrills airline and you pay for everything. snacksdrinks onboard are extra and pilot flies through turbulence instead of around to save fuel and youre limited to one carryon bag. even though we did online checkin we were still made to wait with all other passengers checking their luggage so that the baggage gestapo could nail us for extra bag fees. my wife had a purse plus a carryon bag so they hit us for 30 euros. spend a little more and fly with dignity. flight fcomxp may 28th 2013. it has been one of the worst experiences no information in the airport. only the crew onboard said what was happening at the time of boarding when finally staff in the airport had to show themselves staff were rude. i am a frequent easyjet flyer and im changing my mind fare and getting comparable to other airlines and services were once good now are worsening and assistance is pitiful. we returned from munich yesterday after the worse flight we have ever had we booked seats with extra legroom as my husband has sciatica and needs extra room as soon as we entered the plane we were told that we would be putting the plane at risk by sitting in our booked seats. when we complained we were treated in a very arrogant and rude manner by the cabin crew who seemed to think our plight was very amusing. there was no apology and no alternative seats offered. the plane was also old and scruffy. this was our first and last flight with easyjet. i am writing this on behalf of my aunt who only just flew from gatwick to moscow. we arrived at gatwick nearly 2 hours before the flight to be greeted by a huge queue to check in bags we had to join. i guessed early on that the queue was pointless as there was no way anyone could get through it in time for the flight. the check in staff were just calling people out of the queue just before their flight closed. we had about 5 minutes to check in the bags before the flight closed. i had paid for an extra bag through the web site. not having used easyjet for several years i assumed all would be well. but no buying an extra bag does not mean you have extra weight allowance. told to speak to the supervisor and come back. as we came back we were told the flight had closed. in the end we went back to the supervisor and he managed to get her onto the flight minus the extra bag. i will never fly with them again. geneva  london 11th june flight u28463. flight delayed 5 hours. onground staff couldnt care less. as a compensation i got a voucher which was not even enough to buy a sandwich and a drink. onboard staff were negative and not caring about passengers having a good flight experience. they acted like a nasty teacher at school reprimanding everyone. i fly a lot with many airlines but from the overall experience this one is honestly the worst. avoid if you can  especially when often they are not the cheapest booked on a flight from madrid to lyon on tuesday 2 july which was scheduled to leave at 1.15. after boarding the pilot informed us that the plane was defective and we were offloaded. 7 hours later we boarded a plane which had been flown from gatwick. apart from being given a 9 euro refreshment voucher which we queued for one hour to receive after seeing a line forming there was no information from ground staff. no attempt made to find alternative flights. we spent 9 hours in madrid airport and i received an emailed standard feedback form which allowed me 50 characters to write my comments. ground staff were rude to passengers at both boardings shouting at passengers about their hand luggage. i was extremely unimpressed that there was such little concern for the welfare of passengers. we lost a day of a very precious holiday arrived at our hotel in lyon at 11.00pm. flight was fine but bag drop we checked in online was dreadful. we arrived 2.5 hours before departure. no staff were at the bag drop before 1hr 50 mins before departure by which time there was a huge queue back to the door of the terminal. at the beginning only two desks were manned and it took us over an hour to get to the front of the queue. however once our bags had been tagged we had to join a further huge queue with our bags to put them on a conveyor belt the staff were rude and disinterested. fortunately the security staff and passport control were quick and efficient and then we had to queue again to get into the gate. the gate had virtually no chairs and we ended up standing and queuing for over 2 hours. in fact the only free time we stole for ourselves was 5 minutes to go to the toilet. a truly awful experience. very disappointed in easyjet. flight ez5014 bordeaux  gatwick bodlgw. flight ezy1974 paphos to manchester 21.55 21st june 2013. travelled with my mother and 7 year old son after an extra weeks stay due to illness. quick and easy check in on time take off and early arrival back into manchester. aircraft was clean with adequate leg room. my gripe is that the flight had around 25 english soldiers flying back to the uk i have to say the majority were absolutely fine but we had 3 sat in front of us throughout the flight were joined by another friend that stood up directly at the side of me for me for the first 3 hours of the flight. i am all for having a good time but the steady flow of alcohol that was served then lead to disgusting language being used i spoke to the stewardess about asking the man to sit down in his seat but was told that there was not much they could do. i felt she completely dismissed my comments and was not even willing to speak to them about their language. there should be a cut off point where alcohol is no longer served flew to prague on 14012013 the bag drop was good plenty of desks the boarding was chaotic no preference to speedy boarding. the girl just opened the door to the walk to the plane and shouted boarding now and walked away  as a result it was chaos. outward flight very good but extra leg room not as good as ryanair. return flight on 17072013 a complete nightmare bag drops desk completely unable to handle the number of passengers no priority boarding. asked for a cold beer in flight and was told they were warm as they had not enough storage to have cold drinks although they offered to put ice cubes in the beer overall not a patch on ryanair. cagliari to milan. issues started before checking luggage in i purchased priority boarding and priority checkin option to have enough time to eat something but the baggage drop started 30 min late and they didnt setup a priority counter which meant i had to wait for 1 hour. the whole boarding procedure was a complete mess boarding gate was not clearly specified and the signs were not updated. they took the people with priority boarding outside on a mini bus 25 min before the aircraft was ready and they left us in the mini bus under the sun with broken air conditioning. on the aircraft we had to wait 1 hour. 1 additional hour while certain passengers were offloaded. would not recommend. monday 1st july  departing glasgow at 19.55 arriving gatwick 21.20. ezy894. i am fed up with the poor standards of customer service from easyjet. everything is geared towards themselves rather than the passenger it would appear we are there for their convenience not the other way around. i am fed up of standing around particularly at glasgow when the board is flashing final call and yet we have not moved a millimetre onto the aircraft. having encouraged us all now to take hand luggage rather than pay the exorbitant prices to put luggage into the hold they are now using gestapo like techniques to force you to put it into the hold as the flights are full. this latest ploy now  no check in staff  is another example of poor customer service. their flights are no longer cheap and the seatleg room is nothing short of ridiculous. flew from geneva switzerland to venice italy. had a good first experience. the rest of my flights with them were horrible. second flight i flew from milan italy to paris and i could not believe how rude the staff were. i thought maybe it was just a bad day for them so i used them again flying from london to aberdeen scotland. again the staff were even more difficult to work with. the person i traveled with and i both had 2 bags each which was a mess in itself. each of us had one bag and then one carry on however mine was a little bit bigger than the cart you have to put it in. all they needed to tell me was that i needed to pay extra for baggage and weight and i would have been more than happy to pay the extra. however they made a huge deal about it and were so incredibly rude in front of everyone. i could not believe the lack of customer service. well its a budget airline and you get what you pay for i suppose. i flew last year from bristol to inverness as i often do. i checked to see if the flight was on time before i left and it was. by the time i arrived at the airport it was delayed. so i went online to check the flight status and it still said on time. i went down to the easyjet counter on the ground floor to report this politely at first and was met by a miserable woman who brushed me off. when i still politely persisted she simply ignored me. i then told her not very politely that i would report the matter to easyjet to which she replied she did not work for easyjet but for another company contracted by easyjet to handle enquiries what a nonsense. the flight itself eventually left some time later and arrived without incident. but i made a full report of my experience with their staff at bristol airport known to them in writing for which i received an grudging apology. i am completely appalled by how easyjet is managed. i brought a tiny rolling suitcase with me to london when i flew there from nice and on the way back they forced me to pay 40 to check the suitcase. the staff member who forced me to pay was completely unprofessional and told me i wouldnt be flying if i didnt check the bag. i will never fly easyjet again. flight out to almeria on 19th was good good service although i was asleep most of it however flight back on the 28th was terrible the check in queue was delayed and no one thought to tell us why plane was delayed when we finally got onboard. onboard they had run out of food due to not ordering enough then was rude about it did not apologise and carried on could not believe how terrible the staff was they was all over the place will be avoid easy jet in the future newcastle to amsterdam. we found the check in lady unhelpful when we said we would like to put our hand luggage in the hold she said their would be plenty of room onboard as the flight was not full. we were in row 26 and upon boarding there was no room for my daughters luggage and it had to go in an overhead locker at row 3 when telling a crew member where she was sitting they shrugged and said never mind. the staff at amsterdam airport were much more helpful and pleasant. living in geneva and in budapest i have no other choice than to fly easyjet since they are the only one with direct flights. from my 20 last flights with them only positive points were that they were finally on time some staff were friendly and planes are generally clean and well maintained. but all other issues are catastrophic from the reservation system to the boarding procedures. in budapest passengers have to walk within fences on the airport field then wait on cattlelike warehouse without seats water toilets or food for minimum 30 minutes. has anyone flown an airline which fails to take any luggage on board. arrived at arcelona airport mid morning last wednesday 4 september and noone had a case no cases were onboard unbelievable. no information given as we landed or when we all stood watching an empty carousel. next step of course was a huge 2 hour queue to talk to the one poor girl on the easyjet desk. we flew to turkey this year. we paid 400 each 3 of us. we were delayed at liverpool for 2 hours and i couldnt believe for the price there was no inflight entertainment or inflight meal. they say you get what you pay for but im sorry this was a rip off the seats were uncomfortable and squashed and staff were unhelpful and rude. on return we only had turkish lira to which we were told they only accept euro or sterling so we couldnt buy a drink on the plane. we were offered tap water. this was the first and last time we fly with easyjet my son and i travelled to gatwick on 3713 from belfast international. i had hand luggage bearing in mind i travel with the same case every time i go to visit my son. it would not fit into the grid by a quarter of an inch the wheel stopped it and she insisted i pay 40 which i refused. my son got the case in passengers behind were looking and getting very impatient because of the hold up. people do not need the this kind of behaviour when travelling. to be honest i find belfast international staff not very helpful at the best of times. geneva to nice on 29th august 2013  1st flight in the am. obviously got up extremely early to make it to the aeroport on time checked my phone and email before hand just in case flight was delayed. arrived was informed by other passengers not checkin person who conveniently forgot that the flight was 3 hours delayed. the official reason was technical issue with the plane the agent then added wed rather passengers were alive and late than the alternative. 2 hours later we find out its actually missing crew members because of poor organization. i nearly missed my connecting flight. easyjet does not care its not their problem. i will never fly easyjet again. we were asked to board at milan malpensa only to find we were left in a hot and stuffy jetway for 30 minutes this wasnt an error as it happened two weeks later on another easyjet flight at milan this is obviously done for the convenience of the staff not the comfort of passengers. flew from berlin to amsterdam with my wife and 3 friends. there was no help no elevators for a friend who was not able to walk due to knee pain. inconsistent implementation of rules. one person in our group was told that she could not take her purse as it was too big other one with the same size purse was not stopped. other passengers carried two pieces and there were not stopped. i was told at the ticket counter that i could carry my empty back pack but the lady at the gate said no. we had to walk in rain outdoors no umbrellas no covers on the ladders. travelling from london gatwick to paphos on 2492013 with my wife. had 2 bags weighing approximately 14kg and 16kg and a hand luggage which we and also our daughter took on the plane in more than 10 different easyjet flights. at the check in procedure an impolite female employee asked us to put our hand luggage bag in the gauge. no problem at all. although the whole bag went in i had to put a little force to take it out since it is a hard plastic one and stuck in there. she refused to let us take it to the plane and charged us 69.00 25 for the bag and 44 for 4kgs overweight of our 3 bags. when i informed her that we used this bag many times on easyjet flights before  the last one being 5 days before on our travel from paphos to gatwick  she refused to accept. our lovely 5 day london holiday was ruined. needless to say that other people on the flight had much thicker and bigger had luggage allowed on the plane. furious and disgusted. always said will never fly again with easyjet but then because of the price we did it again. but what you get for the price is a flight back and forth  thats it no service meaning being friendly attentive professional. its not a bus ride its a flight either my husband who is 2m tall always has to argue why he needs to sit at the emergency exit due to legroom or staff are just unfriendly or there is always this fight at the checkin cause of 10 grams too much weight or 1 cm of too large of hand luggage. its not fun and only stress flying with easyjet. the fares are cheap but its like paying to be tortured seats extremely cramped. they will not allow you to put anything under the seat in front of you so your purse is your carryon and theyll charge you to check what should be your carryon bag. most european rollers are smaller than u.s. ones so your roller wont work. our first flight from brussels to berlin cost us 50 euros extra when they took my roller at the gate. my husbands roller was allowed. on the second easy jet flight from berlin to paris we paid the counter charge of 30 euro for my roller only to have my husbands roller denied at the security line adjacent literally to the ticket counter for which we paid another gate fee of 50 euro even though we hadnt left the lobby. while in the security line a woman on our flight was worried about the time. she said i know this airline and if youre not at the gate a half hour before departure they will deny you boarding. so we begged ourselves to the front of the line and ran to the gate. at least in brussels they were calling people up on a flight that was next to depart. if you are under 25 and making a short trip then take easy jet. if you are an american on an extensive trip avoid them. what you save in air fare is not worth the fees you will pay at the airport. i will say the inflight crews were very nice. rome  paris in october. despite having checked in online after having virtually been harassed to do so we encountered a massive queue at the bag drop in rome. way too many passengers and way too few open desks. with our flight nearing the cut off we wouldnt have made it if they hadnt called us over to another counter  a blink andyoullmissit announcement. with boarding starting in ten minutes desk staff was not even able to tell us our boarding gate. having made it there boarding was slow and confusing with no announcements made of any kind. we were bussed to the plane but could only board through the front door which slowed things down even more. flight was uneventful staff was polite but not especially friendly. all in all the only positive aspect of this flight was the fare. everything else just showed that this airline is operating on the cheap and isnt even trying to hide it. lgwskg roundtrip. very good value for money. on time flights nice checkin area at gatwick airport clean and modern aircraft reasonable prices for luggage friendly website easy to book a flight. i have been flying with easyjet over the last 10 years and my recent experience with them was a disappointment. i took a return flight from edinburgh to iceland last month and in general from ground staff to cabin crew most were rude and impatient. i was disappointed with their lack of helpfulness and customer services considering my previous experience with them were mostly good. on the return flight our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours easyjet gave us 3 voucher each which was even insufficient to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee in an expensive airport likes kef. easyjet used to be my first choice of low cost carrier in the uk but their staff attentiveness really need to be improved. copenhagen to london gatwick flight ezy5370 and ezy5365. november 1st  4th. i will not fly with easyjet again. sure it is very cheap but you dont actually get what you pay for you get much less. for a vacation it will make you stressed that you paid 50 euros in additional fees there and 50 euros in additional fees back. for a business trip it will make you uncomfortable for the rest of your journey abroad knowing that you had no space to breathe and sat in a poorlymaintained aircraft as transportation. it was my first time flying easyjet and definitely my last. listen to the reviews above because these are true stories and i just experienced a common negative review above. easyjet forced me to check my bag in for 50 euros oneway at the gate even though i have taken this bag every time i travel as a carry on. the surprise fees at the gate were more expensive than my ticket. dont let the low prices online fool you. i and my wife travelled on 14 nov from lisbon to gatwick flight ezy8720. airport staff rude and impatient lack of helpfulness and customer service. forced to pay 35 euro and check one luggage even though this was as specified slightly bigger bag maximum size of 56x45x25cm which holds man suits. forced my wife to put her purse and souvenirs bag into her suitcase. during boarding her suitcase was not allowed saying there is no room on overhead storage and took the luggage. arriving at gatwick this suitcase was missing. very bad experience with easyjet. my wife aged 73 followed all blurb pushed out by easyjet especially the luggage allowance. she packed her small suitcase and also a small handbag with 2 xmas presents. she was demanded to empty the small bag into her case damaging the presents of course people who had bought goods around the airport came along and they where allowed to carry on their purchases in bigger carrier bags. luton  olbia  gatwick. luton airports small terminal resembled a crowded lowend shopping mall with a large food court. the passenger security check was wellmanaged. there was little seating in the almostwindowless departure lounge though there was somewhere to buy a coffee amid the duty free gauntlet. you wouldnt want to be delayed here. the walk from terminal entrance to boarding gate was relatively short as was the quick taxi from aircraft parking stand to takeoff. at the boarding gate gate 16 many passengers crowded precariously for at least 10 or 15 minutes over the entire length of a long and steep stairway with their cabin baggage before being able to access a small groundlevel room where passports and boarding cards were slowly checked before exiting into the open air to walk across the tarmac to board the plane parked nearby. my single carryon bag complied exactly with the airlines specified 56 x 45 x 25cm maximum dimensions including handles and wheels. at the boarding gate a member of easyjet staff selected passengers with wheeled bags from the queue for baggage assessment. my bag did not quite fit a metal framed gauge indicating that it was oversized. i was required to check it in and pay a 40 fee on the spot. not negotiable. the gate staff were blunt unsympathetic and appeared hardened to this procedure which felt like a scam. i still had to carry the bag to the aircraft steps and locate a holdbaggage loader to accept it. after boarding had finished there was ample empty space in the overhead lockers for my regulationsize cabin bag. admittedly my soft shell samsonite wheelie was full which may have distorted the dimensions slightly but easyjets exacting customer unfriendly approach felt out to get. be warned on the return flight from olbia my bag  the very same bag  just fitted a similar gauge and i was allowed to take it in the cabin. on both flights the cabins were tidy but with grubby carpet. there was no choice of seat unless you opted to pay more in advance which was randomly allocated at the time of online check in. the seat pitch was very tight though just tolerable for a twohour flight not for anything longer. the cabin crew both outbound and inbound were friendly and efficient but did nothing to stop noisy young children from running up and down the aisle throughout the entire flight and also made too many announcements. the announcements promoting food and taxfree sales and so many pricesavings were intrusive and relentless. pity the easyjet frequentflier there was no complimentary inflight catering but drinks and some overpriced unhealthy snacks were offered for sale. the outbound flight departed from luton on time and arrived a few minutes early in olbia. the return flight began boarding on time in olbia but departed 30 minutes late. this delay appeared to be due to desperately inefficient ground handling staff at the boarding gate in olbia who seemed to lack any sense of interest in getting the flight away on time. we made up some time during the journey and landed 20 minutes late into gatwick. we arrived at gatwick north terminal though the flight was sold as arriving at gatwick south terminal. the boarding pass also indicated arrival at gatwick south terminal. no announcement as to the change of terminal was made by the crew and anyone unfamiliar with gatwick airport would have been unaware. the potential for this anomaly to cause problems for customers with pickup arrangements is obvious. overall easyjet was a thirdrate airline experience. bare minimum transportation for a fullservice price and the feeling of having been rippedoff. innsbruck to gatwick. was supposed to land at south terminal but diverted to north terminal but passengers not told. overpriced food and indifferent service. rude customer service and no email address on website. madrid to paris and return 4 days later. both flights were late due to boarding delays. it really does seem to take much much longer with allocated seating. i used easyjet before for years and never had problems choosing a seat. the easyjet check in agents at paris were unbelievably rude to everyone and insisted on checking the size of every bag even when they were obviously far smaller than limits. it used to be so easy with easyjet  not anymore unfortunately. like many we had a horrendous experience travelling or trying to travel with easyjet fromto gatwick on 2425 of dec. nothing can excuse the abysmal treatment by easyjet of the passengers who were forced to await repatriation from malaga on 24th dec. poor information of passengers throughout especially on the 24th with passengers lurching from delay to delay eventually ending in cancellation after a 78 hour wait in the terminal. being given a voucher for the value of 4.50 euros in an airport in which a can of coke costs 3.70 euros and a brownie 3.50 euros. having to queue for 2 hours to rebook following cancellation with 200 passengers served by 2 staff eventually reduced to 1 after which we were all told that all the rebooking was useless as we could rebook ourselves or check in normally the following day. ferried to a hotel and having to queue in the rain and wind for over an hour while a single person was booking in 200 passengers one at a time. ferried back to the airport the next day at 11 am only to be left in terminal c for over 7 hours with virtually all facilities shut down no attempt to hand out any snacks or refreshment and only one harassed easyjet rep in attendance being clearly out of his depth unable or unwilling to announce anything and to address anything. absence of sensible and correct information from easyjet with the only source of semireliable information coming from passengers with access to the web or contacts in the uk. had to endure hours of waiting as an aircraft scheduled to take us to gatwick was diverted to alicante without explanation for hours with wild rumours circulating on its destination chances of its return and any time estimates. offered crisps or some lowcost choc sweet and a drink as compensationfor the 7hour foodlessdrinkless wait in an otherwise abandoned terminal. my own verdict is that easyjets support framework in malaga is totally inadequate and poorly equipped to deal with unforeseen events. staff are poorly trained and poorly motivated having no understanding of the importance of talking to passengers and keeping them informed. your food arrangements in case of serious delays are ludicrous all characteristic of an airline who has forgotten or never learnt the importance of customer relations alongside its raison detre of maximising its profits. manchester to bilbao 24th december 2013. flight cancelled due to poor weather weather was bad at bilbao. this was handled very poorly by easyjet staff. a man announced flight cancelled and to rebook at easyjet service desk. vague information and they suggested going home to rebook online. navigating their website on christmas eve was again very unclear. alc to lgw have utilised easyjet many times on this route during the past year however sad to say that this may be the last. the cabin crew were rude unapproachable nonexistent and rude. they quietly moaned about the passengers within earshot and acted as if cabin baggage was an inconvenience even for their frequent fliers  including us. as there was insufficient room in the overhead bins for others hand baggage they pushed them in front of the empty seats behind us as this caused discomfort to myself i made the crew aware and they repositioned it. the flight attendant felt as if she was doing me a favour. have flown with this airline since their infancy circa 1997 with no complaints. this was such a shame. my comments relate to the absolutely awful quaintly named baggage drop. to read the easyjet web site this sounds like a casual walk in the park. it is not. departing gatwick we were in a zig zag for 50 minutes with the staff constantly going up and down pulling out passengers who were likely to miss their flight thereby pushing the rest of us back in the queue. however worse was to come on the return leg from copenhagen when we were in a 60 minute baggage drop queue due to there being just one desk open  easyjet will not pay for more. on this showing just what is the difference between check in and baggage drop. ezy8403 lgwdme 2012014. would give no stars if i could. appalling customer service. we were informed at the check in of an hour and a half delay went to have a lunch as now had the time. the flight went on time leaving a few passengers behind. called the customer services according to their information the flight was delayed and still boarding the ground staff said the flight had left. after a very stressful afternoon the company accepted the liability and rebooked us on another flight the next day. not worth the money saved poor customer service. genevabacelona one way thankfully. the problem with easyjet is the ground staff. my bag weighed 20.5kg as shown on their scales and they insisted on counting it as 21kg and proceeded to charge extra. i thought i was dreaming. they could not be that fussy and mean. i asked them to reweigh and it was 20.5kg. they were fussy mean and petty so i had to take an item of clothing and carried it on. the rudeness of the ground staff continued till the gate. with easyjet you dont save anymore and when you do it is not worth the hassle and bad blood. never again. they might be the cheapest but thats for a reason. as a frequent flyer i have never used easyjet but did a quick trip to germany and needed just a cheap flight instead of transatlantic. you are treated poorly by employees that cannot be bothered. the cabin staff were fine its the boarding staff that i have a problem with seeing passengers getting charge 55 euros for a case which was only a few millimetres too big. i will know if i travel again in europe would rather pay the extra few pounds and travel with a decent airline. paris to london. the crew member in the boarding line was extremely rude abrupt and uninformative. it was all in relation to cabin baggage being more than one bag mind you the second bag for us was a tiny handbag. we flew from italy to paris with no problems carrying exactly the same baggage. we were then rudely pulled out of the line and asked if we understood english in a condescending voice after being given no time to try and fit our handbags into our luggage. we were then sent to the boarding desk because we couldnt fit one in. the crew member there had no idea why we were sent there so he sent us back. we were then told it was going to cost an extra 55 euro for a bag 1cm thicker than the allowed thickness which is outrageous not to mention we were well under our weight limit. i then noticed that some other passengers had cabin baggage as big as the one we had to pay extra for and put in the hold and also a large handbag or briefcase. in one country we are allowed certain things and the next we are not. for the same company in these countries policies and procedures are different obviously as a result of poor management. i would not recommend anybody use this airline i would rather pay extra for another airline and will be in future. returned recently from barcelona back to newcastle paid for one case in the hold and carried one shoulder bag onto plane couldnt believe the size of the cases people were carrying onto flight some bigger than my case no one was asked to put bag into bag sizer or indeed no check in staff even bothered to look over the counter. my issue i have with this is apart from stupidly paying for a suitcase when i could easily as it turns out take into the cabin but i was also refused to put my bag into the overhead lockers as they have to accommodate the larger cases my shoulder bag was the proper size for the flight but as it turns out it was too small. i was told that i had to put it on the floor along with my coat it was too tall to fit under the seat in front i had a very uncomfortable 3hrs unable to move my legs the crew member was extremely rude and didnt care about the discomfort. surely the airlines need to have an idea of the weight of the luggage on board an aircraft at newcastle there was virtually no hold baggage apart from ours. if we had been the last on the flight i could understand it if there was no space in the lockers but i was on fairly early in the queue the cases overhead were crammed and one of them was taped closed obviously previously overloaded 1st trip with them going out seemed easy enough. all customers took hand luggage as we didchecked with easyjet to make sure what was allowed. 1 size handluggage handbag not included no room onboard so our bags went into the hold. poor service on board  passing items over you no excuse me discussing other passengers in front of you. then flight back from paphos got charged for my handluggage and not allowed to take my handbag on board only 1 item allowed  not told that before i travelled. other passengers allowed to take 2 items. parisberlin schonefeldparis on 2022 february 2014. did not notice any particular problems except the boarding process in berlin. the part b of the airport from which easyjet flights depart looks like a hangar with no ventilation and places to sit. there is a huge line for boarding moving very slow. they started boarding before the plane arrived and all the passengers had to wait in very small room overheated with no fresh air. also they write that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure while in reality it only starts at this time or even later. i guess that is completely unacceptable even for a lowcost. i flew from edinburgh to london. the crew members checking boarding passes at the gate were rude and uninformative. my bag was too big for the cabin but then i was told i wasnt allowed my small handbag on board even though i was allowed both bags on my flight from london to edinburgh. when asked why the sudden change in policy she had no answer and ignored me while i stood there clearly confused. i also feel that policies should be consistent throughout all airports you are situated at and all crew should be informed and enforce these policies. without question the worst flying experience in my 45 years of travelling. departed late kept us queuing for 45 minutes no communication. returning from amsterdam the furthest gate out no elevators no bathrooms rude staff who put us through unnecessary steps to measure our baggage kept asking for our boarding basses for no reason barked at us and when i put my luggage in the measuring box and it fit i was told it doesnt fit comfortably and made us pay 55 euros each even though we had already paid extra to bring larger bags on board. for that amount of money i couple have flown a civilized airline like klm. gatwick  valencia. when i arrived with my small suitcase and a small backpack with my laptop the assistant told me i could not enter with two bags. at the same time the other passengers came with one suitcase but with many objects clothing bags in hand. it was a robbery 45 for a small bag. never again will i fly with easyjet. less customers less issuesthat was a comment yesterday from one of the easyjet representative at gate 17 from london luton to berlin schoenefeld departure 18.15 pm. they have done anything they could to get rid of customers. i flew with my 3 year old son who i paid full price for. i didnt want to take an extra luggage for him due to the many stairs on the way to the gate. therefore i took one piece of luggage which was one inch too big. it was only one luggage for both of us. nothing else and they charged us 45 pounds. another customer same issue who had no cash and only a atm card to pay for his oversized back was refused to enter the aircraft until payment. luckily another customer helped him out. never again with easyjet. the easyjet customer service is really pathetic with no flexibility. i arrived at the boarding gate 25 minutes before the flight departure for a short flight from amsterdam to luton and was not allowed to board the flight while the gates were still open. i paid additional euro 80 and had to wait for more than 3 hours to board the next flight. i am frequent flyer and was shocked to see to me it was a deliberate attempt by easyjet to earn more money. copenhagen to basel switzerland no issues except the walk to the terminal was literally a mile baggage was checked for size deemed acceptable but because flight was full they put it with checked bags no charge as it was correct size. several days later we flew from paris pdg to copenhagen. this time the agents were very rude pulling people at random out of line including us to tell us we had to pay 110 euros for our 2 bags same bags same clothes as they had to be checked in. we had no choice but pay it cost as much as the flight. very poor customer service. easyjet hand luggage system is a joke. all hand luggage was allowed on the plane even if it did not fit the new standard size. having much smaller bags meant that we had to have 2 pieces under the seat so that they could fit 1 non guaranteed bag on the overhead locker. you are positively discriminated for taking a bag that is smaller that the new guaranteed size. next time i fly i will be taking my usual size bag as this will end up in the overhead locker and i will get my leg space. no checks on the size of the luggage was performed at time of boarding. it took an extra 30 minutes to load the plane due to the chaos. daughter flow from paris to bristol with laptop bag and cabin luggage treated ok on the french side. flew back to paris from bristol with same luggage treated very badly had to pay an extra 45 for laptop bag welcome to rip off britain. gatwick  valencia. when i arrived with my small suitcase and a small backpack with my laptop the assistant told me i could not enter with two bags. at the same time the other passengers came with one suitcase but with many objects clothing bags in hand. it was a robbery 45 for a small bag. never again will i fly with easyjet. i recently took three trips from uk to lisbon madrid and return  never again. ground staff are uniformly rude the boarding process chaotic and cabin crew do their best to ignore passengers. the one bag policy is not true  plenty of people came on board all three flights with two bags many with large shopping bags. on one flight i sat next to a pilot flying to crew a plane back to the uk. he and the cabin crew talked non stop about how hard their jobs are and how many hours they work very unprofessional and plain rude. i have been flying with easyjet for years on a regular basis and have recently been disappointed with how rapidly their customer service has declined. the last 3 times i have attempted to fly with easyjet have been disastrous and unnecessarily stressful with little compassion or understanding from staff who can only read legal requirements. the first was when i had a flexifare and attempted to change to earlier flight as per the terms and conditions of this flight but due to an error of assigning the right reference number they charged me a whole new fare. a month later i was going home for the weekend to see my family i live in london my family in belfast and arrived at the airport on friday to be told the flight was overbooked and they could offer me a flight on sunday afternoon which of course was useless. this flight was reimbursed with the standard compensation which only just covered the return flight i lost as this was with a different airline. finally last weekend when i didnt think easyjet could ruin another trip for me i arrived at the airport intending to get my 8pm flight to edinburgh but the plane had been substituted for another flight so we would only get our flight at around 1am i asked customer service if they could arrange a hotel or taxi as i would be arriving to a city at 2.30am and i had been planning to make an onward journey but they refused saying my options were 1 to accept the delayed flight and get a refreshment voucher 2 take the 9.30 flight to glasgow. i decided to go to glasgow and would have made the last train to my onward destination but low and behold that flight was also delayed. so instead of arriving at 9.30pm to edinburgh i arrived to glasgow at 11.20pm. i asked for a refreshment voucher but was told i had a choice between accepting the late flight with a voucher or the glasgow flight  what options easyjet will push away their loyal customers for becoming too greedy. cdgbiarritz. on 11 a & b seats speedy boarding  better pitch. no disappointment. however we paid for better seats. after doors closing a passenger came from a normal seat and sat in 11c. some airlines would prevent it. however the situation was worse as that passenger was extremely rudethreatening and talllarge invading my space all the time. crew did not act and we did not know what to do. it could have been avoided by them. lgwven 17 july. if you wish to be treated like cattle and snapped at by the ground staff then choose easyjet. cabin crew are ok but ground staff terrible. you can carry a sizeable trolley bag but if you have a laptop and briefcase they are not allowed even though the combined size and weight is half that of a trolley bag. do not expect logic or intelligence to play a part. third time flying and delay is 2 hours plus each time. sitting in geneva airport and all 3 flights from here london  2 flights venice other have delays this afternoon 7 july 2014. an easyjet employee had just lied to us he was not aware of any delays to our flights minutes away from an announcement of a multiple hours delay so that we enter duty free zone where there is obviously no service desk of easyjet. all delays are due to faulty aircraft and not weather conditions. vote zero out of 10 for easyjets faulty aircraft no service desk  absence of client service and unqualified staff. my experience with ryanair recently has been significantly better  no delays and landing on time. flew from lgwbfs. first of all our cabin baggage was just 2 centimetres too long and because of that wanted to charge us 45 pounds to put the bag in the hold. very rude about it. gate agent who thought she had a little bit of power. so they have us a rubbish bag out of the bin to put our stuff in. by the way this bag has flown in the easyjet cabin before without a problem. when we boarded the plane we told a cabin crew member and rudely said to us you must have got away with it before but you didnt this time. we even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers we told a crew member and he said well im not checking the bag sizes. no customer courtesy next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didnt choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. my grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. we asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. not one bit of sympathy the man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window no courtesy from the staff no help outrageously not allowing our bag on because of the wheel being 2 centimetres too long when bigger bags we saw were allowed on 7.45 flight from gatwick to gibraltar diverted to malaga due to fog my son travelling alone aged 16. member of crew says on tannoy bus service will take you to gibraltar thats it. remember it is 135km away. my son quickly goes to toilet gets through passport control and gets his suitcase one of last off carousel goes to find bus and nothing  no easyjet rep no directions nothing. he reckons max 10 mins from when he got his suitcase to when he was out in foyerconcourse etc. eventually he finds the easyjet malaga desk on a different floor basically zero interest tough. numerous calls to easyjet uk  absolutely hopeless said they had no obligation to get you to your end destination if you missed a bus they provided they admit they never do a head count on the bus. we have a 16 year old 135kms from his destination and easyjet on site answer is tough go and use public transport. fcoprg. flight went well and in fact arrived early. seat cramped but i got what i paid for. prgfco. flight was full during boarding there was this rude ground staff. she forced everyone to cut down their baggage to one piece per person. i told her that during our flight to rome they allowed us to bring 2 pieces per passenger. she said things like i dont care what you did in rome this is prague follow our rules. this is unacceptable easyjet needs to train their employees. ezy5336 17th july 2014. on the plus side easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. firstly the baggage drop at gatwick is woeful. you really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because ez cant be bothered to have all the desks open or rent some more. staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. perhaps its better not to arrive too early and just wait for the late shout  its probably quicker its not as if ez dont know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. the 2nd irritation is being called to board when at the gate. this isnt really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen eg toulouse and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. again its for easyjets conveniencesaving not the customers. why call family groups first so  they can stand for longer rather than call them last sometimes easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. for me id pay a small premium for a decent airline. but if you dont mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board theyre ok. better than ryanair though. lgw to nantes. they say you get what you pay for but this was more expensive than the scheduled flight from london city. i fly multiple timesyear normally long haul and i have never seen such rude uncaring staff as the ground staff at lgw. as commented upon by another reviewer silly me for checking in a bag as this then meant that i was told to stow my laptop under my seat as the overhead bins were for those with trolley bags. checkin was a scrum added to by having to climb over those whose bags were overweight by a couple of paperbacks and were forced to re pack their suitcases. never again. gvavce gvalut lutgva gvaory orygva. a terrible airline usually late has own rules which it does not follow poor security poorly trained staff at gate and on plane. the only reason to fly easyjet used to be the price but with the delays and increased baggage costs you need to add about 50 to fare to compare. flight with family rome to basel. at boarding no information of which gate to take. waited for 2 hours until we were brought to aircraft. in front of aircraft bus turned around and brought us back to gate. no information why. after 4 hours we were told we might get a flight at 10 pm instead of 1 pm to geneva then bus to basel  at 3 am in the morning when the airport was closed they promised us a refund which was later denied and only given a flight two days later. service the worst i have ever experienced. unacceptable. will never use again. flew from lgwbfs. first of all our cabin baggage was just 2 centimetres too long and because of that wanted to charge us 45 pounds to put the bag in the hold. very rude about it. gate agent who thought she had a little bit of power. so they have us a rubbish bag out of the bin to put our stuff in. by the way this bag has flown in the easyjet cabin before without a problem. when we boarded the plane we told a cabin crew member and rudely said to us you must have got away with it before but you didnt this time. we even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers we told a crew member and he said well im not checking the bag sizes. no customer courtesy next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didnt choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. my grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. we asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. not one bit of sympathy the man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window no courtesy from the staff no help outrageously not allowing our bag on because of the wheel being 2 centimetres too long when bigger bags we saw were allowed on will not be travelling with them again i had a 3 year old daughter with me coming from barcelona to newcastle they put my 3 year old sitting by herself while i was in a different aisle. luckily was travelling with family and a man sitting next to my sister said he would chance seats with her so she didnt have to be by herself. staff onboard were so rude. i travelled prague to rome. i checked one backpack into the hold. i was carrying a small backpack which weighed about six kilos. i had a small bumbag around my waist which contained my valuables. i was told by this arrogant rude tall staff member to place my small bumbag into my backpack as he deemed it to be an extra bag. i have been travelling for 40 years and never come across this pedantic ridiculous rule. there were passengers there with three times the amount of my land luggage and many of them had their valuables in bags around their necks as well as their hand luggage. we also had to pay extra money from split to rome for hold luggage because it didnt come up on the easyjet software app and it cost us more money at the airport. i wont be flying easyjet anymore. prague to rome fiumicino terminal 2 18 august 2014. ground staff were extremely rude about their overhead baggage policy. cabin crew was more bothered about gossiping rather than serving the passengers. poor instructions ground crew unhelpful cabin crew distasteful and unprofessional as they say you get what you pay for but the prices i paid were not far from a normal schedule fare so will look elsewhere next time. a first and last time flight experience. flight from gatwick to prague in late august. we followed the rules about bag dimensions and weights and checked in 1 bag each and proceeded to the holding area. finally a call that our flight was boarding and an extended stampede of passengers to gate 25 only to find we were further held before boarding. here we were met with a very unfriendly ground staff member telling us that we were only allowed 1 bag not 2 as we were carrying 1 x wheelie  1 x accessories. having checked with the ez web site just 10 days earlier which clearly indicates that a conforming carry on bag and an additional accessories bag was acceptable my wife and i found ourselves along with plenty of other passengers in a difficult space trying to squeeze our accessories bags into a single carry on. having got into the plane that was about 23 full the pa system was telling us that small bags should be stowed under the seats in front of us. clearly the people at ez have no idea about presenting a uniform message. in my case 3 different messages. does the left hand really know what the right hand is doing a further delay occurred when the ground staff wouldnt issue a receipt for gbp 45 for an unfortunate passenger who couldnt squeeze 2 into 1 and it had to go in the hold. rightly she refused to board the plane until a receipt was provided which saw us with a departure delay of around 30 minutes. the aircrew seemed more interested in themselves than providing a customer focused service. poor instructions ground crew unhelpful cabin crew distasteful and unprofessional as they say you get what you pay for but the prices i paid were not far from a normal schedule fare so will look elsewhere next time. it was my first time using this airline and i will never use them again. i bought the ticket from rome to nice on february 2014 for the flight on 11 september 2014. in march i received notice from them that their daily flight from rome to nice would change from 11.55 am to 7.15pm. i had to change my own schedule because i know what kind of headache i would get trying to get a refund from them. on the day of the flight i found out that theres no use of printing your own boarding pass beforehand because theres still a long line at the check in desks. theres no separate lines for bagdrop. after dropping my baggage i was told that the flight will be delayed for 40minutes. then during boarding the crew told me that i couldnt bring my hand bag because i already had a back pack with me. i had to drop one or pay 55eur. i offered 70eur cash but was told they only accepted credit card. i will never use this airline again. friday night flight from glasgow to london gatwick. we arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern scotland. flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. at checkin we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyjet would try to push the flight forward. the opposite happened. our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. there were no easyjet representatives to speak to only gate staff. when they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. they eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. the aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes  not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. the captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. we were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. this in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. it was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. to our horror the aircraft parked at the south terminal replacement aircraft had next flight from there meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the north terminal where the flight was destined. fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the south terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. to top it all off easyjet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation. booked a one day return flight amsterdamgatwick v.v. to attend a funeral on december 12. whilst in the uk we heard of the computer problems at nats but were relieved to hear on the way to the airport that problems were solved. arriving there 3.5 hours before the flight was due we decided to have something to eat. then a got a message on my iphone we are very sorry but your flight ez 8883 has been cancelled. please contact easyjet.com etc. this prompted us to go to the easyjet desk but unfortunately there were already some 200 people before us in long rows with only 2 easyjet employees to assist. therefore i fortunately decided to change my booking online and managed to get a return flight the following day in the evening. then after 1.5 hours an easyjet employee climbed on a stand and shouted that everybody should see to changing their booking themselves and that accommodation to spend the night had been arranged at the hilton hotel. upon arrival there hilton knew nothing and was full to the brim. so back to the easyjet desk only to find out that there were no more rooms but also no more easyjet employees fortunately we managed to find some spare bedrooms in the block hotel at gatwick. even getting a boarding pass proved to be a problem as i had changed my booking using my iphone i was of course unable to print my boarding pass. so we went to easyjet in the south terminal and asked them to print the boarding pass. that was not possible we had to go to the north terminal as we would leave from there. after some talking the man behind the desk told us check in was not open yet but after we told him we had already checked in electronically he managed to come up with two traditional boarding passes. my gripe is over a flight from verona to lgw  problems were caused by italian strikes and on checking in at the airport we were informed that an 11.45 flight had been delayed to 19.15  not only informed by the checkin lady she also wrote it on our boarding pass and it was showing on the airport screens. she also told us to return to the airport at 1800 hours. we said to the very nice lady who disappeared about five times as they were obviously being briefed on what to do that we were going back into town for the day which we did. due to the delay and a 3 hour drive on return we were looking at booking a hotel for the night at gatwick but just to check whether we were being told the truth about the 19.15 departure time i decided to check when the rescheduled outward flight was going to leave lgw on the easyjet flight scanner  because it was actually in the air and on further inspection our flight had been rescheduled back to 1250pm  showing on both easyjet and airport websites. jump into taxi and return to airport. easyjet and their agents must have known at the time we were dropping our bags that the outward flight was actually happening as the plane must have been loaded and on the taxiway at lgw. also easyjet made no attempt to communicate with us by email or mobile phone. talking to others on the flight they had been asked at checkin to leave contact details and had been phoned one family from about 40 miles away had got back home and had to turn around again almost immediately. we were incredibly lucky not to miss the flight. i recently booked a trip from london to jersey for 4 people on easyjet which was a complete mess. one of the passengers arrived separately from the rest of us. he processed to easyjet checkin desk to get a boarding pass and was given the wrong boarding pass by the staff member. he never checked the boarding pass and managed to clear security at the airport with it. when the remanding 3 passengers tried to clear security with our boarding pass this was then it was discovered that the boarding passes were mixed up. this took sometime to be resolved but eventually did. as it was nearly time for our flight to leave we hurried to the gate only to find that is was already closed. at no point during this period did easyjet page us to advise that the gate was closing or that it was the last call for us the passengers. we had to go back to easyjets desk in the departure area and waited over 45 minutes before someone came to the desk to see us. we had the use the phone on the desk to call an easyjet staff member 7 times before someone arrived. when someone did arrive the matter was not handled with any urgency. we were taken back to customer service desk and were told that it is our responsibility to get to the get to the gate on time. in order to change the ticket we would need to pay. we advised them of the error made my easyjet staff of giving the wrong boarding pass to the wrong passenger. we also asked why we were not paged and was told that easyjet doesnt page customers. they will only do so if you have checked in a bag. we did not check in any bags as we were only going to jersey for a day. i told the agent it was discrimination as easyjet assumes that all passengers are literate. also it is common practice for airlines to page passengers if they have checked in and not arrived at the gate. we were offered the next easyjet flight which was in the afternoon at nearly 4pm which meant our day trip would not happen. tried phoning customer service and we were meet with the same no help attitude. in the end we when to jersy and was only able to spend 2 hours. a very unsatisfactory trip. since then trying to get customer service to take some action has been terrible. travelled arrecife to liverpool 8th january having had a great flight outbound some days earlier ex manchester with monarch. the contrast could not be more stark. boarding passes indicated a boarding time of 18.05 for a 18.35 departure. approximately an hour before the due time boarding was announced which came as a surprise. an entire planeload of passengers were then processed through the boarding gate only to be left standing in an unlit hot covered walkway for just short of 30 minutes. whilst my husband and i are able bodied there were any number of elderly passengers and very young children amongst our number who quickly became tired. this was an unpleasant experience but we were staggered to learn from regular passengers on this flight that this is standard prior to departure. from the moment the cabin doors closed pretty much until the wheels touched the tarmac in liverpool 4 hours 15 minutes later those of us in the rear rows of seats were subjected to an absolute barrage of noise from the staff in the rear galley. during a long evening flight it clearly never occurred to them at any point that their passengers may wish to have some peace in which to rest read or sleep. even the trolley service was conducted in between their gripping chats on many occasions causing them to have to ask passengers to repeat their orders as they clearly hadnt listened to them in the first place. we were both glad to finally exit the aircraft and both agreed on walking across the tarmac in highs wind and rain that we would not have had much confidence in this cabin crew to competently handle anything outside gossip and moaning. will we fly easyjet again trust me never. after having to dangerously carry my 15 month old daughter her pushchair and 2 bags of hand luggage down two flights of stairs to get outside to the aircraft. i have to say you get exactly what you pay for a flight. totally disgusted none of the staff at newcastle easy jet offered to help. although i must add after struggling at gatwick a lovely member of staff took my pushchair off me in the departure lounge as she seen i was alone with a young child hand luggage and a pushchair. flight itself was fine. but easyjet you really need to brush up on the service your staff provide lisfnc. delayed by 30 minutes due to what seems a terrible lack of organization at easyjets hub in lisbons airport terminal 2. there were 3 flights of easyjet leaving all at the same time. this terminal consists in a suffocating atmosphere with considerably bad infrastructure and used only for departures of low cost airlines. i was assigned a seat at the last row of the plane and not only there wasnt no window  in what it seems a business measure to book the more possible passengers at the expense of the seat pitch  but the plane itself was a really old a319 very degraded but the worst was the total lack of cleaning on the plane the seats textiles had a vivid brown in an absolutely act of negligence. the portuguese male flight attendants chat a lot between both of them loud and clear as if the passengers were interested in knowing about their lives. easyjet tends to be an excellent alternative choice but this time failed low of expectations. and please stop selling cameras among others throughout the flight. it seems like a bazaar not a plane. low cost seems to equal non existent customer service from easyjet. long queues at bag drop worse than other airlines checkins plus long queues at security  missed flight even arriving 2 hours before checkedin flight. 65 per person to rebook on a later flight not what you want on a 3 day trip to amsterdam. easyjet dont want to know  never flying with them again. recently flew lgw to mxp and return over the half term break. inflight the service was fine. delayed significantly by weather on the way out but that can happen. what was shocking however was check in at lgw. yes i know it was half term but it took 90 minutes to do a bag drop simply because their process with very few check in staff saw constant delays as those turning up late for other flights were whisked to the front of the queue. so if you want to avoid a queue arrive late if you like queuing arrive 23 hours early. just ridiculous edicdg. booking the flight online with easyjet was simple and quick. the experience at the airport was busy and chaotic and ground staff were miserable looking and abrupt with some passengers. flights on both routes was on time which was good but the cabin staff were poor in their duties and also miserable looking and not very welcoming. i would not use this airline again and would rather pay more for a better experience. easyjet are good in the air but awful elsewhere. they cancelled the flight to aberdeen on monday. about 10 minutes after they had directed all the passengers to the gate 3 hours late the flight was cancelled and 200 passengers were told to go and see the customer services agent in the departure area. of course there was no one there. eventually a single rep turned up and had to deal with us all. after 30 minutes those with no baggage we were led away those of us with hold bags waited another 30 minutes before we could reclaim our bags and join the queue for a taxi to the copthorne hotel. the promised a shuttle bus but it never materialised. the boarding passes issued for the replacement flight the following day sent all passengers to the wrong terminal. it takes longer to get from the gatwick runway to the terminal exits than it does to fly from aberdeen to gatwick. there is always a palava getting off no steps no chocks. too windy. then a bus to the wrong terminal the final insult. as i sit here waiting for the flight home easyjet are once again apologising for the late departure of the flight to gatwick. not their fault it never is. seats were hard felt stiff after a 4 hour flight. not comfortable at all and they had the cabin heat turned right up. at larnaca airport queued for over an hour standing even after check in and security. the airport and easyjet were a let down. easyjet is only good for a 12 hour flight. this is my first and last time flying easyjet. on the last leg of our honeymoon my husband and decided to book easyjet because it was cheaper than other airlines for an hour and a half flight. big mistake. we got to the airport at 10.45 am for our 1.20 pm flight. right away they notified us at the baggage drop that our flight was delayed two hours due to a technical difficulty. about an hour before the delayed flight time we were notified at the gate that the flight was delayed another two hours due to a technical difficulty. we went downstairs to customer service to discuss our options. the representative was hostile and extremely rude telling us that the only option was to wait. we wasted the entire day at the airport and will miss all of our reservations. the best part is today is my husbands birthday. in fairness i know all airlines experience technical difficulties from time to time but it seems much more frequent of an issue with easyjet see easyjet reviews. spend a little more and book with a reputable airline to avoid spending a full day of your precious vacation at the airport. flew with hand luggage only so i went straight through security into the south terminal at gatwick. great terminal with enough shops and great views at some locations especially cafe rouge. boarding the plane was a bit hectic as everyone is supposed to just charge at once. felt a bit like i was in a herd of cattle. once on the plane i headed to my reserved seat. the flights to and from toulouse were quick without distruption. i knew easyjet is a budget airline so i expected the worst however to my surprise the airbus a319 i travelled on was very modern and the seats were very comfortable with a generous amount of legroom. during the flight i noticed that the crew were there for your safety and nothing else. all of the crew were french so asking for anything might have been a challenge. every announcement was in french and then with difficulty translated into english. i was a bit surprised considering its an english airline but maybe these flights are run by another division of the airline to suit the majority of the passengers on board. overall i was impressed by their no frills service and would recommend flying with easyjet on their short european routes. will the 21.35 pm flight from london stansted to glasgow ever leave on time its never a short delay and the customer is never given any prior warning of delays although stansted airport updates on your phone tell you of incoming flight delays  so common sense would tell you that if flight ezy 218 from glasgow to stansted is estimated to arrive at 22.30pm then flight ezy 219 cannot possibly leave at 21.35pm or am i missing something i booked easyjet for a quick weekend trip from amsterdam to rome. the departure flight was 5.5 hours late arriving at 2 am the next day instead of 10pm i was so tired the next day from no sleep it impacted our weekend trying to catch up on sleep. the return flight was even worse. they kept delaying the flight and delaying the flight then cancelled after midnight. the blamed it on the weather so they didnt have to pay hotels. there was only a light shower at around 6pm and all the other airlines were departing except for easyjet. the customer service is horrible. no one cares about how delayed you are. we were stranded in rome because all the flights out were booked. i ended up having to book another airline to get out of there. they were not apologetic for the huge inconvenience. the baggage fees are ridiculous. i will never travel easyjet again. every time i fly with easyjet the flight is either delayed or cancelled. i had promised myself over 18 months ago to never use easy jet again but this week i had a last minute travel and the time of departure and airport was very convenient with easyjet so i decided to give it a try. i was hopeful the airline had improved. outbound flight was about an hour late return flight was three hours late. on top of that no one was available to provide information finally found a desk with a person that was giving a food voucher for the passengers being delayed. the total voucher was 4.50euros  barely sufficient to get a bottle of water and maybe a coffee. seats dirty this time the tray table was broken and didnt latch. i was told that the easyjet flight was full and all carry on bags now needed to be checked unless you were speedy boarding. i complied and didnt put up a fight. then countless people came in behind me who were not speedy boarding and were allowed to take their carryons with them. it seems the policy they told me was a lie. its obvious that they just needed to check a certain amount to make room. next time i will put up a serious fight. this is ridiculous. if you need volunteers thats fine but dont lie to my face easyjet. its just not good business easyjet really are terrible. cutting cost at the expense to customer service would appear to be their mantra. they are full of untruths regarding punctuality. awful awful experience every time i fly bit unfortunately they have a monopoly on this route so no option  and they know it first thing easyjet need to address is their staff need some training in customer service what a miserable sullen and in some cases rude bunch of people thats from check in staff through to cabin crew rude and ill mannered. there was an odd one or two and i mean two max who were bordering on half pleasant. flight was delayed but we were still herded onto the plane and sat there with a 4 hr delay we were eventually maybe after 3hr and 45 minutes offered a plastic cup half full of water which you had to go to the back of the plane for. granted  mid air we were offered a drink and pringles or a chocolate bar but you would have thought the cabin crew were paying for this out of their own pocket. it was begrudged. i would say nearly all if not all passengers were from the north west and even though we were cooped up passengers were annoyed and fed up but there was still a good banter amongst the passengers. easyjet take note you could have had a lot of irate angry passengers to deal with and quite rightly so. amsterdam to rome with easyjet. first time they said it would be delay for 40 minutes after that another reason happened and they said delay for 5 hours. we only got 135€ voucher for foods or drinks at schipol. after wait for another 5 hours they said another 5 more hours delay. total be 1040 hours delay from the original time. yes it happens. they gave us an information sheet which is contains if we will got the full refund and compensation about 500€ each person. and the result only the full refund ticket and they said the compensation will we get if we onboard the flight. who will on board the 10 hours delay flight no one. how smart easyjet. the customer service at schipol also doesnt have a good hospitality at all. they talk each other about you in dutch language cause they think you wont understand what they said. so if you have a little bit more money just buy another one who can make your journey more satisfied. paris to venice with easyjet. the most unfriendly airline ive ever flown. from charging an extra 55 euros in a self evident scam to force me to check a bag that would easily have fit in the overhead to crowding passengers on a bus and making them stand for a half hour before opening a plane nowhere near the gate at paris orly this is absolutely the worst. spend the extra money for a real airline. worst experience ever. had rebooked my easyjet flight in the morning for 100 pounds to a later flight. then had a cancelled meeting so i could be there earlier and take the original flight. i read at the formal website that there is no check in counters in copenhagen so go all the way to the gate just to be told that there are check in counters and and changes have to be made there. plane is in front of me empty seats and no  they will not change it at the gate. my original flight was 3 hours later and was 50 minutes delayed. flight seats could not recline and the plane was full of advertising. first and last flight ever with easyjet their seats are the most uncomfortable of budget airlines and easyjet objective is not customer service but to extract as much money out of you as possible it was a late evening flight and the attendants spent an extraordinary amount of time selling their tat in duty free. we were in row 30 and god forbid the attendants speak quietly lots of loud aimless chatter  so thanks i didnt want to try and sleep on upright tiny seats anyway. we flew from larnaca to gatwick far too long for those awful seats  and never again. get what you pay for i guess the drive to bristol was good the parking was good the bag drop plus was quick efficient and friendly fast track through security was good as was priority boarding. then it all turned pear shaped. the captain told us there would be a maximum delay of 1hr 10mins because of computer issues at brest air traffic control. we finally set off 1.5 hrs later with no further warnings or explanations. we had paid for extra leg room seats but were not warned that for the person sitting nearest the window in row 1 the only extra leg room seats was limited by the slide stowage so it was only okay if you had no left leg the seats were like church pews upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch this despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright after about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. we were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness rather than efficient. the descent into funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a missed approach due to the cross winds being outside the aircrafts limits. we briefly joined a holding pattern but were diverted to gran canaria. we were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt. as it was now nearly six hours since we last ate we asked for some food. we were told they could not serve hot food now and anyway all the food would have gone off and not be fit to eat instead they handed out complementary pringlescrisps and plastic cups of water after at least an hour the pilot decided to return to funchal make another attempt to land. if that failed he would take us to mainland europe. the descent was much smoother and the landing was achieved. we finally landed 5 hrs after our allotted time at 12.20am it was a relief to disembark after 9hrs on the aircraft. fortunately our car hire had stayed open for our flight so we were able to get ourselves to a hotel and find a room for the night as it was now too late to pick up the key to the apartment we were renting. we have since discovered that earlier flights by other airlines took their passengers to other islands and paid for overnight accommodation. easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour  there being no taxis at the airport whilst the circumstances were not all the fault of easyjet and indeed we had expected problems with the landing this airline made a bad situation many times worse by their appalling attitude and shoddy service. suffice it to say we are not looking forward to the return journey after which we would never travel with them again still at the airport  our easyjet flight has been delayed several times and we are at our fourth gate change so far. bogus announcements rushing passenger from gate to gate for immediate boarding waiting at the new gates just to be told to rush to a new one. what prompted me to write this review is not only the apparent lack of organization with this airline but mainly the arrogance of its staff smiling at each announcement while passengers getting frustrated. not a single we are sorry or we apologize. at the end of the day including all the extra fees charged such as seat assignment and luggage checkin this airline is just not worth the trouble and the demeaning staff attitude herding passengers left and right. having used my hand luggage on many previous flights i was disappointed to find out that it was slightly too big to meet easyjet rules. i was charged 45 to place the bag in the hold one way a charge that easyjet publishes. the attitude of the jobsworth checking hand baggage size was one of arrogance with a patronising tone. i would have no problem paying a fee but 45 is a ripoff and can never be justified. i have had 2 other flights with easyjet recently. the last one was delayed by an hour which wasnt too bad. the previous one arrived at the destination 21 hours late having been diverted to edinburgh and we were then driven by coach to liverpool.  awful experience with easyjet travelling from lyon to london gatwick. before checkin had to stand for over 30 minutes as there were no seats door unopened at gate. then delayed by almost 2 hours due to staffing problem. was lucky to have a seat at the gate area most passengers did not. asked for some water or food but easyjet insisted on charging. ground staff unhelpful and did not apologise once. inflight the captain did apologize but again no free food. almost 2 hours late.\\r\\r\\n gatwick to aberdeen with easyjet. we were fully aware of the baggage policy of easyjet before we booked our domestic flight and chose to book and pay for one bag to go into the hold. due to flooding around crawley our train suffered long delays and we got to the airport with minutes to spare for boarding missing the bag drop deadline. i had to go to the gate with my cabin size case and a medium handbag where the attendants rudely harrasssed me for 45 and forced me to put my case into the hold. they didnt give a monkeys that i had already paid to put a bag into the hold and 45 what annoyed me even more was that the flight was only 75 full so my case could have easily fit in to the overhead locker and only one piece of baggage for a woman  once home i requested through their customer services department some apology for the way i was treated but didnt get one even after going through twitter. this was the worst customer service i have experienced. i will never be using this airline again. easyjet from manchester to belfast. i dont ask for much on short flights of this nature apart from a reasonably on time departure and arrival so i am rarely moved to write a review. however on this occasion i think the attitude of the young man in charge of the cabin left a lot to be desired. we were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two once everyone was on board i noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so i asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. the young man said no because we would have to pay an upfront fee to do so. however we already had easyjet plus because we had reserved row two seats. okay he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when noone else was sitting there. however there was no excuse for this easyjet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. there appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. at this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. there was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. instead he yelled excuse me sir at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was in fact properly activated. there was no apology. they simply resumed their conversation about christmas gifts they had received. lyon to bristol. we were a family of 8. ranging from 6  70 years old. my 70 year old father hurt his knee whilst we were away so was walking with crutches. when we arrived at the airport we asked for a wheelchair it never arrived. he walked from terminal 13. we queued to book in again asked for a wheelchair. they told my parents to sit and wait and a wheelchair would arrive. they told us the rest of our group had to carry on through passport control leaving my father with my mother to wait for the chair. they never checked on them to see and the wheelchair never arrived. my dad then had to walk through security and a 15 min walk to the boarding area.  when they arrived in the boarding lounge they told us what had happened. dad sat down on one of the chairs and a staff tripped over his bad leg. she only turned around when my mum lept to try and cover his bad leg. she didnt stop to see if he was okay. i asked another staff if he could have assistance from the boarding lounge to the plane  she said she had to see his boarding pass checked it and said its not written on his boarding pass. she begrudgingly let him go to the front of the queue. a very disappointing journey that could have easily been different if any of the staff had taken time to deal with the situation properly. to say we are angry at the level of customer service provided by easy jet would be an understatement . all this meant was you have to stand around longer than everyone else. i had to stand around waiting to board and this was after i had my ticket scanned for almost 30 minutes. dont board people until youre ready to board on checking in our party of 11 all for our easyjet flight from liverpool to faro our cabin bags were measured and found to be the correct size for the lockers. at boarding one of the party was singled out and her cabin bag was found to be to big  this is in spite of it being deemed the correct size in the measuring receptacle at check in and in spite of the fact that another passenger with exactly the same cabin bag was waived through. when the party finally boarded there was no locker room so obviously they had to get rid of a few. we would happily have checked our cabin bags in at check in but were told there was no room. she had to pay 45 and has been refused a refund. the service on the plane was non existent the cabin crew spent 30 minutes eating their breakfasts and ignoring the needs of the passengers. will not fly with them again. first and last time i fly with easyjet from manchester to copenhagen. departure kept being postponed. screens showing one thing apps another and website a third. the only airline i have ever used where your handbag was considered hand luggage and had to be tucked away in you cabin bag. a very disappointing journey overall. cramped seats and nickle and diming for everything. i put an abbreviated version of a name accidentally on a ticket and they wanted to charge €65 each way for a simple name change. i decided i didnt care about the leg room because it was going to be such a short flight. i arrive at the airport and the board of departures shows the flight is in checkin and the gate will be determined. 20 minutes before the take off time passengers receive a text saying flight is canceled until next day. obviously you can imagine the troubles this would bring and i can only help easyjet will redeem itself slightly by refunding my entire flight and paying for the new train tickets ill have to buy.  easyjet from madrid to geneva and one of the worst airlines ive used. they were rude at the beginning when i was just staying online to the departure. a man came to me and said that i only can have one bag with me. i had one carry on really small luggage and one small handbag. i thought he was kidding and just ignored him. but when i was about to board he said that i have to pay extra 60 euros because i have two bags with me.  i paid. he put the sticker on my luggage and i continued my way to the plane with the line. unexpectedly a woman is coming to me very aggressively takes my luggage and says i need to take this bag  i said wait a minute i just paid for this bag she says thats why i need to take it you cant take it with you onboard. you only allowed to take one bag well that is ridiculous and not even an effort to be nice to me. never will fly with easyjet again.  i was travelling easyjet from madrid to edinburgh to attend a wedding reception straight from the flight so was carrying only 1 carry on trolley case within required dimensions. i queued up very early only a few passengers in front of me to ensure i got onboard fastly and i could put my bag in. when i reached the door of the plane the ground staff tried to snatch the bag from me but i asked why as the overhead lockers were empty  i explained i was going straight to a wedding reception and that my dress was at the top of my case ironed and ready to put on and this is why i had a seat and the front of the plane and queued early  they were kind and understood and told me to speak to the crew. i then encountered a very smug crew who didnt want to know about my need or wouldnt explain why my bag was being offloaded when it was still empty  he said it was a full flight but surely its first come first served for baggage space to which he sang with a big smile on his face you have agreed to the terms and conditions when you bought the ticket so if you dont like it please leave i was in shock of this and had to ask again to make sure i heard right  asking me to leave because i had asked why i couldnt put it there when it was empty  absolutely no empathy or warmth and seemed to take pleasure from it and made eyes with another crew. he then instructed them to remove my bag and wasnt asked if i needed to take anything from it  i later realised i was left without money or my motion sickness medication and didnt feel comfortable to ask if my bag could be retrieved due to the unapproachable crew  this made the flight miserable. the captain did make a pa to apologise for offloaded bags after landing which was professional so was it too much for the crew to use his discretion and be human or atleast apologise for the situation also i fly regularly with easyjet and for the price the flights are okay but be warned if you have a cancelled flight last november my gatwick to amsterdam flight was cancelled easyjets internet connection went down and the passengers were left to fend for themselves with the assurance from the easyjet ground staff that all expenses would be reimbursed. i have contacted them dozens of times since with no progress. im now in the midst of a 45 mins call yet again to their switchboard. the backoffice is abysmal and unaccountable and im out of pocket. short flight from luton  amsterdam with easyjet. cabin crew were extremely rude and unfriendly to passengers wanting to purchase fooddrinks. whilst i appreciate that it was only a 40 minute flight telling the passenger in front to hurry up and make a decision was down right rude. liverpool to amsterdam return. me and my boyfriend went away for a few days to amsterdam. as we were waiting for our gate to open our return flight got cancelled. so i asked staff where do i go to find out whats happening and he told me to go up the stairs and carry on walking and then another member of staff told me differently. anyway when we got the information we needed our flight got cancelled. we had to fly out the next day. we had spent all our money in the airport and we got left with nothing. they put us up in a hotel and told us food is provided for us. the hotel tried to charge us for the breakfast as they said it is not provided.  i would never fly with easyjet again. bristol to newcastle returning from edinburgh. nothing special makes either flight stand out it gets you from a to b and back again. seats are hard and with a tight pitch so anything more than 7590 minutes duration would be hard to put up with. all flights full and as expected usual scramble for overhead space. something lacking with them when compared to a regular airline  budget airline characteristic probably. would i use them again yes if there was no other options available.    i was travelling from larnaca to gatwick. because of the bad weather we landed in liverpool. the problem is that the company leave us there without any help about how we travel to gatwick. it was 4 in the morning and we were trying to find money to buy a bus ticket for 100 pounds to travel to gatwick. also i have to mention the bad behavior in all flights of easyjet i travelled especially to this one. two weeks after the flight i sent them several emails without any answer. im calling them everyday waiting about 30 minutes everytime and no one answer the phone. dont trust easyjet.    naples to berlin. biggest disappointment and worst experience ever. they kept us for an hour in the plane on the ground in napoli due to bad weather conditions in berlin. they flew later and decided to fly to hannover after giving in to the conditions. they promised transfer coaches or other solutions. after staying in hannover for almost an hour they decided to fly back with the forecast still showing storm after passengers started complaining loudly they offered anybody who wanted to get off the plane to do so but on their own account. they would not hand out our suitcases and left us alone in hannover to organise our getting back.  easyjet left us alone. i write this while sitting in a bus on a stormy highway in the middle of the night being awake for 18 hours now and having found connections back home myself.     nice to luton on easyjet. delayed flight with no apology from the flight deck nor cabin crew. cabin was old tired and filthy the seat pockets hadnt been cleaned and behind the tray table was covered in previous occupants chewing gum. cabin crew werent the friendliest ive encountered nor the most professional laughing in the middle of several pas was not impressive.    rome to geneva with easyjet. the flight was planned to depart at 20.55 but then we got first notification that the flight would be delayed 30 minutes. after few minutes we were notified additional delay of 1 hour 40 minutes and the last we got delay notification of 2 hours. after the latest notification we were informed that we would get voucher of 4.5 euro for snack only sandwich. vouchers were given when they called people for boarding which means basically no time to take the snack. besides when they called people for boarding the plane was not arrived yet the latest etd was 23.35 with eta 00.10 and atd was 11.31. we landed safely in lyon because they mentioned that gva airport was already closed at midnight and we were not informed before. considering the eta was after midnight they should have seen this possibility but they did not mention anything to passenger before. we missed our train connection because of the delay and we arranged last minute bus travel which we missed as well due to the arrival was in lyon. thankfully they still managed to make bus transfer to gva airport. we arrived in gva around 3 am. considering the arrival time the total delay was around 5 hours and we were stuck in gva airport at 3 am. very bad experience.    flew gatwick to jersey. lets face it easyjet treats their customers like cattle. we boarded the flight which was to be one hour in duration. the flight actually boarded on time and without incident. when everyone was boarded the captain came on to say that the flight was to be delayed because of weather in jersey. he said it was going to be delayed an hour to start but could be delayed as much as four hours before the flight left. so here was a full flight in an uncomfortable airplane with children and families on board that was going to just sit. what upsets me here is that the crew knew about this potential delay prior to boarding and still put everyone on the plane. the plane did finally leave 5 hours later. the passengers were forced to sit on the hot plane with no air no food no drinks for 5 hours. once the flight left it was a one hour ride to jersey. manchester to venice. due to problem with plane the easyjet manchester departure was slightly delayed and some passengers could not fly as the plane that was substituted was smaller. we did get on the flight but all our seats were changed for a short flight and being older children this was not a huge issue but we had paid for allocated seating and it took several unanswered emails and eventually a long and no doubt costly call to easyjet to try to claim the payment back. they tried to offer me free seat allocation on the next flight as im hoping never to have to use this airline again i politely refused and was told a refund would be given in 510 days  time will tell return trip was delayed but no announcement made or info given when finally boarded in venice the cabin staff were to say the least brusque we were seated at very back of flight and of course no room was left for baggage rather than try to help by checking overheads at the front of the plane a staff member thought it appropriate to just shout at my daughters to sit down when she explained she had no where to put her baggage and could not go against the tide of still boarding passengers to check the front she was told she would just have to put it in the hold how this was going to be managed by my daughter was not mentioned and clearly the staff were not going to help  eventually another staff member did find some space and called my daughter down from her seat at the back to the front to store her baggage  not a major issue but overall the experience is one of lack of care whilst safety should always be paramount they seem disorganised at best and uncaring at worst helping a passenger could actually save them time in the long run and when they are obviously running late and working against a tight time frame you would think that experience would of taught them this  the whole customer service ethos has passed them by and i got the impression on both flights that passengers were very much a necessary evil and the cabin crews life would be so much better if they just didnt have to deal with them. service not great communication poor every time ive flown the flight has been delayed overall worth paying a little more for a better experience. arrived at stansted for a flight to prague with easyjet to find out it had been cancelled. there were no emails no notification prior to our arrival. staff werent willing to help us. just telling us your flight is cancelled and there is nothing we can do. supposed to fly out on saturday morning and fly back tuesday afternoon. all they could offer us was a flight out on monday for half of our party. not willing to help us find alternative flights. just said that we are on our own. london gatwick to corfu with easyjet. delays at airport were bad enough but we also had another 1.5 hour delay sitting on aircraft before it taxied to runway. no info forthcoming regarding the delay. no welcome on board due to staff talking amongst themselves. crew more interested in themselves than passenger needs and poor attitude when passengers called them for requests  this was more than i could bear given that we were the paying customers. this was my first and last flight with easyjet as the return flight was even worse.    london gatwick to isle of man with easyjet and it was appalling. ive flown on 4 flights with easyjet this week  uk domestic to belfast and iom. the first flight was 1h 40m late bfs to lgw 1h 50m late lgw to iom 9 hours late but not cancelled so thats okay then and lastly iom to lgw. im being told to proceed for boarding when the aircraft hasnt even landed so boarding is at least 45mins away. i have been fobbed off with lies ignored and endured rude staff. theyre all tired fed up and had enough of going the extra mile and i dont blame them but the excuses for delays have been laughable. atc strikes in france  not within 2 days of my flights severe weather causing delays  none high pressure over the whole of europeuk with no weather apart from beautiful clear skies. awful airline who havent got enough staff or resources to operate their service. a good price is as much use a chocolate teapot if you dont arrive somewhere near the planned arrival or even on the same day. unreliable.    the easyjet flight from bordeaux to amsterdam was my worst flying experience until the flight back that is. first off the deceitful way of announcing delays google told me the flight was going to be delayed 2h50min straight away but easyjet said 10mins then 20mins then an hour then we stand at the boarding gate for 40. finally i board to sit next to an overweight undershowered fellow. all we got offered was a glass of tap water. got to hand it to easyjet though they managed to get us back in 2h50min just 10mins shy of the limit to get our money back. avoid this company.\\r\\r\\n    rome to paris a last minute change of boarding gate 10 minutes walk without notification new gate closed 30 minutes before takeoff very aggressive staff offering no solution but treating you like a cost flight missed. as usual client assistance provides no information no reimbursement no possibilities to change our flight. only return flight available is two days later for 500 eur more.  would be the last time we book with them.    verona to gatwick easyjet flight delayed by more than an hour. no explanation from the airport pa system. i have the mobile app that says flight delayed because of necessary maintenance work before take off at gatwick. what does that mean the app maybe be cool but adds nothing to the passenger experience. we are still late and ignorant.    gatwick to edinburgh. after delays of 2 hours which is quite good for easyjet our gate was announced. this was where the drama started. we went to gate 55d which was the same gate the glasgow flight which had been called earlier. after about half an hour of trying to figure out who was at gate 55d they decided to move the edinburgh passengers. they moved us to gate 54 which was back through the check in desk. on getting there we were told we could get through. so the 100 or so passengers were trapped in a glass corridor in the blistering heat. after another half an hour they decided to move us in to what looked like a departure lounge that time forgot. basically seats and that was it. i asked one time during the next half hour if could visit the bathroom and was told no. when an announcement finally came. the first one of the day i hasten to add the the flight was cancelled. we then had to wait about an hour until they decided to escort us out of the airport through passport control even though we were domestic which took another half hour. after finally getting out of departures we were expected to stand in a queue for cutover services with one person on the desk. im pretty sure i would have been there 2 days later which ironically was the next flight they were offering. i know eastjet is cheap but if it wasnt my company that booked the flights i wouldnt fly with easyjet ever again.    i fly with easyjet at least three times per week.  yesterdays flight from edinburgh to gatwick was delayed by an hour. we then lost time for some unknown reason and arrived even later. when we arrived at gatwick the pilot couldnt park the plane and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a tug to push the plane into position to enable the jetty to be attached. if i wasnt tired and hungry it would have been comical. today boarding should have commenced 50 minutes ago we have been left standing for 50 minutes with absolutely no explanation in the sweltering heat of the departure lounge. so it looks like my return journey will have a similar farcical delay. if you are flying the edinburgh to gatwick route do yourself a favour and use british airways. you will be surprised how similar the fares are. and for the record i am not a british airways employee i am a disgruntled easyjet customer. in conclusion i only have myself to blame for booking a flight with easyjet i guess its time for me to practice what i preach.  due to fly london southend to amsterdam. yet another easyjet delayed flight due to technical issues second one from southend in a week 4 hour delay at 7.25am perhaps someone at easyjet maintenance should set an earlier alarm to make sure passengers dont lose half their break in a departure lounge. frequent flyer but recently tried easyjet for first time because of the cheap last minute tickets. huge mistake. ive never had a worse flight experience. the flight barcelona to basel was an hour late leaving the gate because of some technical breakdown. once we started taxiing it took more than 30 min to get off the ground. not clear why the taxi took so long but we could have driven around the entire airport several times in that time. they have luggage requirements different from all other airlines. they appear to make all of their money running this luggage con. you can only have a single piece of luggage. they dont tell you during the long wait in line either. they purposely wait until you are just about to board so you dont have time to rearrange your luggage. if you do manage to consolidate your luggage they are waiting and ready to throw the other shoe at you oh that luggage is too bulky andor heavy. they charge you 60€ to check an extra bag. it is that or miss your flight. they are not even polite about it. 6 of us got caught in exactly the same way on this flight. after that the ticket price is no longer competitive. adding insult to injury the luggage bins in the cabin are huge and could easily fit luggage much larger than ours and we flew with them all half empty. nothing free is offered in flight to eat or drink. what they do sell is grossly over priced. the last straw was at the arrival walking up and down stairs with droves of other people down long tunnels. additionally they took forever to send the luggage to the belt at destination basically guaranteeing we would miss our train at the destination. we are dreading the return flight which will be tomorrow. never again.    we arrived at toulouse airport 11th july to find our flight 21.50 flight to gatwick delayed and nothing open in the terminal not even drinking water available. flight eventually left at 1am next morning so should be home shortly. apparently previous crew had run out of flying hours so a replacement crew had to be drafted in to get us home. the plane starts to descend to land at gatwick wheels down and then a steep pull up full power and we are back up pilot then tells us that as we are so late the main runway is closed for repairs so he attempted to land on second runway but due to bad lighting and visibility he aborted landing. he was then going to circle for 15 mins while they reopened the main runway. next announcement was welcome to stansted. we were then told to wait on the plane while they sorted coaches for onward travel. 20 mins later were we told to make our way to arrivals for the transport home but once we were in arrivals we were then told to make our own way home 2am in the morning and seek compensation on the easyjet website. we eventually arrived back in gatwick at 9am another day off work. so far now 22nd august despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation no refund of our bus fares no explanation. easyjet customer service is anything but a customer service. they have employed every tactic to not give us a straight answer. when everything is ok they give a good service when it goes wrong lookout. in reality we could have flown 1st class on ba for what it has actually cost us for these cheap seats. we were unfortunate enough to have travelled on easyjet flight ezy8612 from malaga to london gatwick on 27th march which was diverted to liverpool. after the flight delay which exceeded 3 hours on leaving malaga we were subsequently unable to land at gatwick because the weather had deteriorated. no reasonable explanation was given for the delay. regarding the issues with our flight it was almost unbelievable that we were left stranded at liverpool airport with no arrangements made for our onward travel to gatwick. even more outrageous was the fact that the airline was continuing to charge passengers for food and drink on board while we were being held for hours on the tarmac before disembarking at liverpool. we have never experienced an organisation that appears to reagrd its customers with such contempt. we wont be using easyjet ever again and would advise others not to use them unless they are willing to accept this kind of service.    we booked a summer vacation to europe  landing in paris. we used easyjet to book airfare from parisbarcelonaparis and a week later for parisnapesparis. trip to barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal onto busses then to a plane on tarmac  similar debark in barcelona.  inconvenient slow. on the return trip an easyjet staffer pulled us out of line measured our bags. one bag was 1 too long. she said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. we were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. later looking online it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bagpurse per passenger is general but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carryon bag is allowed. very confusing.  i can embrace the concept of a lowcost carrier but be clear about what youre not offering. not even water soda juice or crackers was provided. seats do not recline. friendly helpful service was nonexistent. staff at bcn to help with complaints did not exist either. worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight  we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. had i not happen to wake up and check my phone at 330am we would have been totally screwed. as it was i spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 oneway tickets to naples.  easyjet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. the return flight was an air france flight. that wasnt cancelled. so now i needed oneway tickets expensive and last minute even more expensive. what did easyjet offer in compensation they would rebook me at no charge another flight to naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. two issues.  next available easyjet flight was 5 days later byebye vacation.  value as for 12 round fair purchased a month ago. i will never fly easyjet again. wish i could rate lower than a 1. for the last kick in the pants easyjet also booked my rental car. though i was clearly booking a 7 day trip to naples they only reserved the rental car for 1 day.    i travelled from belfast international to malaga on 17th may of this year with easyjet. tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall i found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. in normal circumstances i could endure this for a short three hour flight however a fate would have it the seat in front wouldnt stay in an upright position  it was in a permanent reclining position  it was broken. i asked the stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do which was reasonable. she seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so i sat with the lady in front practically sitting on my lap. after a couple of hours i decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. so i sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. the chief stewardess rudely asked me why i was sitting there so i told her that row 16 seat was broken. she said i would have to pay extra to sit at the front so i asked her if i would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours  she said not and that i would have to return to my broken seat. as a matter of principle i refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to row 16. on my return home i sent a complaint to easyjet on 29th may. i received the following response right back dear easyjet customer thank you for contacting easyjet via our online form. we aim to reply to you within 3days although in busy periods this may be longer. well be in touch soon. regards easyjet customer services. that was on 29th may 2016  it is now 3rd august 2016 almost ten weeks later and i havent heard anything more from easyjet. seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesnt surprise me one little bit. i am a reasonable person who realises that things go wrong now and then but the disgraceful attitude of staff onboard and the total ignoring of my postflight complaint proves to me that customer service is very low on the priority list.  booked a weekend in bristol travelling from bristol to glasgow with easyjet. on both legs of the journey at least an hour delayed in flights. no explanation given. speaking to other travellers this seems par for the course. will definitely take the train or drive next time. flew palermo to london gatwick. excessive delays with not enough info provided during my last 4 flights with easyjet. the last two times we incurred over two hours delay due to passenger removal and security checks. only water provided during the long waiting on the plane. they used to do food service with two trolleys one starting from the front and one starting from the back of the aircraft. they now start with two trolleys from the front and no sandwiches are available when reaching the last five seating rows. disgraceful. no interest whatsoever if there are small children. it used to be a very good company now it simply is a cattle transport. i and my family will never use easyjet ever again. quite frankly the tickets are in reason of 200250 gbp per person every time we travel so not interesting anymore for this kind of disservice.    easyjet flight from majorca to gatwick was delayed by 4 and half hours. our taxi driver back in england found out before we did. was told at the airport it was due to a plane mechanical at first. then told no staff so had to borrow staff from belfast and luton and send them over on an empty plane. got told at the airport we were all entitled to 250 each. the lady at the desk even rang her manager to double check. now back home being told were getting nothing as it was extraordinary circumstances and we are entitled to nothing. they gave us food vouchers. however the plane had basically no food onboard.\\r\\r\\n we have flown numerously with easyjet and nearly every time they have run out of hot food. if it was once or twice i would be happy to say thats life but i think this last flight was the straw that broke the camels back. the cabin service was appalling as the crew spent more time in the galley than looking after their customers. it is only a 2.5 hour flight from faro and they eventually came to us nearly two hours into the flight only again to say there was no hot food left. all i want to know is is this a company policy to carry limited supplies which surely is false advertising or is it just ineptitude by ground services i dont expect a golden service but i do expect to able to except what is advertised on offer.  today my wife and i flew easyjet from vienna to london and i have to say that this was the worst flight i have been on. 1.5 hours late due to the cabin door not closing and traffic control. there was nothing provided to the customers such as tea or coffee while we waited and even had to ask for landing cards. what terrible service. would not recommend them and i certainly will not be using them again myself.    the easyjet flight from milanmalpensa mxp to romefiumicino fco takes less than one hour so the inevitable discomfort of somewhat limited elbow room and legroom is acceptable. the flight was a few minutes early at takeoff and several minutes early at landing service being limited  both ground an onboard  to the very essential there is little to comment. overall a simplified reliable and very convenient transportation service.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    flew easyjet from luton to palma. delays with both outward and return flights no explanation until you are on the plane communication is very poor attitude seems to be you are lucky to be going at all never mind the affect of the delays with very young children travelling. also flew with easyjet in june and last november and was delayed on those flights do any flights take run on time customer service could be much better if communication improved and less delays. london to athens return. late by well over an hour both ways. chaotic boarding and slow cabin service. no value to cost of ticket so back to a professional carrier for me. budget airlines are only worth the discomfort and impersonal service if they are punctual. the additional cost of ba would have represented real value to me. so no more easyjet.    corfu to gatwick. it is known at corfu airport that passengers are bused out to and from the aircraft. therefore when being bused out  easyjet are ripping you off for the speedy boarding fee as they is no option to speedy board  just chaos. then when you write to them to seek a refund they say they are not responsible for the airport atmosphere  go figure they must conduct an assessment at corfu annually therefore they are aware of what the airport atmosphere is their answer to this is not acceptable and i am just making people aware of their ripoff  not interested attitude on 18th march myself and three members of my family traveled with easyjet from liverpool to barcelona and our return flight was cancelled. receipts were kept of expenses incurred but seven months later the claim is still not resolved. staff shocking customer service disgraceful and would never recommend the airline to anyone. the whole experience has been traumatic and easyjet and its staff unbelievably bad.    we got the classic bait and switch carrying our bags onto the plane. paid extra so we could bring standardsized carryon bags on board were told they were fine when we checked in but when we got to the gate were told one of them was too big. because we were forced to check at the gate they charged an extra fee so the 80 to check the bag was almost more than the cost of the ticket. what a racket. whats worse when i contacted them to complain they simply replied after weeks of waiting and multiple contact attempts that this was standard policy. the flight itself made us feel like we were living in an infomercial with the flight attendants selling all kinds of junk up and down the aisles.   luton to copenhagen with easyjet. poor service. still on the ground writing this review while the cabin crew run around like headless chickens trying to offload bags. this airline lets customers take a big bag in the cabin rather than let them put them in the hold then spends 30 mins offloading luggage that does not fit. net result is we dont take off and still sit on ground. easy does not describe them. poor quality airport poor quality planes and poor quality service. i pity the poor people who work for them in service. totally bad experience.    gatwick to hamburg. paying the extra for premium boarding and baggage made this flight just fine. i avoided the fights over bags seats and other chaos that occurred around me. the in flight magazine looked like paper ready to use in a bush toilet. the staff looked a bit frazzled but all in all a fun flight. worth paying extra.    lyon to luton with easyjet. worst system i paid for hold luggage while checkin in and they charge me again at the airport. no consideration for their system failure. now spending time getting my money back. plus a very stringent cabin luggage policy. its better to go with other budget airlines.    stansted to edinburgh. flight delayed and there was no apology. we were kept waiting on the steps of the plane in the cold. i had to clean my seat as it was dirty. i will not fly with easyjet again as this is not the first time and the service needs to improve. used easyjet for years with no problems but this flight had a farcical ending. pilot had 2 failed attempts at landing in gibraltar due to wind so we diverted to malaga but after a few minutes diverted to seville with the excuse it was windy at malaga too. landed at seville and were kept on the plane for over an hour while they worked out what to do. could not go back to gibraltar as weather worsened. eventually bussed back to gibraltar which took 3 hrs and finally arrived there at 8pm instead of 11.55am. at no point were we offered a drink or food on the plane  unless we paid for it. a goodwill gesture of free food or drink would have made a huge difference. the next day we discovered that both flights after ours had landed in gibraltar and all flights into malaga had also landed  why couldnt our pilot i am aware landing at gibraltar can be hazardous and have been diverted to malaga on one occasion a few years ago but the detour we had to endure seemed pointless and totally unnecessary. all i have had from easyjet is a text thanking me for my understanding  we are not impressed with easyjet and their pilot skills or their customer care on this occasion.    liverpool to barcelona in july 2016. a four hour delay in liverpool airport escalated into a cancellation and then led to us being advised that we would have to take trains to london and stay in a hotel overnight in order to disrupt our holiday the least. we were reassured that we would receive reimbursement for the above only to be told after over four months of correspondence that in fact the answer is no we wont be receiving any such thing leaving us over 300 out of pocket and with a head full of bad memories truly a toxic airline average at best when things go right but easyjet merely shrug any blame or responsibility off as soon as anything goes wrong.    munich to gatwick was dreadful. the negative experience started long before departure. easyjet use terminal 1 at muc but there were no indications on the boarding pass of which zone to use for bag drop  i ended up having to ask at the information desk and then trek all the way down to zone z by the sbahn station. some simple signage and advice on the app or website i did check before travelling would have allowed my taxi to drop me at the right place. passport control not within easyjets control i admit but they should be making representations to the authorities  was incredibly slow. security was fairly quick. then boarding  ive rarely had a more unpleasant experience. coming through the gate at the last and final urgent call i am greeted with the dreaded bus. already packed of course and more passengers pile on behind me well after cutoff time. we stood on the bus  cramped cold uncomfortable  for over 15 minutes before we were driven to the stand. boarding once off the bus was quick enough we taxied on time and were in the air by 0955. seat was the usual cramped lcc arrangement. no recline at all. slept so no idea on service. landed slightly ahead of schedule and then rather surprisingly got a jetway to the plane so at least i didnt have the horrors of a bus both ends. one good thing  baggage delivery was swift.    manchester to munich. a dad traveling with two young kids was kind enough to help me put my suitcase in the overhead locker only to then straight away be told off by one of the flight attendants for putting his jacket in the overhead locker as well. since when is that a crime. then the flight attendant impolitely ordered the dad to unload everything again and to only put things with wheels in the overhead locker. it was horrible to watch how that staff who should be responsible for taking care of the passengers treated that very helpful person.    booked a couple of days to belfast and back to luton with easyjet. my hand luggage was taken both times to store as a check in bag. and when i mentioned to the crew that i chose hand luggage due to time saving reasons and had to check in my bag on the way to belfast already her reply was in that case you know that you need to come first and queue up and bag will not be taken. it was said in a very rude way and i dont think its right at all for easyjet to force people to do so when you are traveling only with hand luggage. at least the man that took my bag made me smile.    flew easyjet from gatwick to fuerteventura. automated check in chaotic. flight time delayed initially by over 3 hours subsequently 2 more changes causing confusion and inconvenience. poor communication throughout. held in gate area for ages then herded onto tarmac and stood in freezing conditions for 15 mins. crew arrived late despite lengthy delay. flight short on already limited menu options and only served first refreshment after 2 hours of 4 hour flight. appalling experience.    venice to naples. i always travel with a hand luggage if my trips arent longer than a week. yesterday at the airport in venezia marco polo they wouldnt let me pass with my hand luggage although it fits the official proportions of the companyairport then they made me pay 60 euros for the luggage an absurd price i paid more for the luggage than for the flight. i always travel with the same luggage but thanks to the person in charge from easyjet i had this problem  other passengers pointed out to me that they passed with luggage bigger than mine. so my advice is dont ever pay those 60 euros if you get in the same situation as i did report it to the airport do what you need to do but dont pay that money. 10 people who came after me had to put the luggage on hold that is to send it for free because the plane was full so for them they could do that but i had to pay 60 euros.    luton to geneva. on 23rd february myself and my partner have checked in our luggage then went to the gate 11 as indicated in the screen tv in order to board the plane. while in the queue the easyjet staff told us they are delaying the flight because of weather conditions there was a strong wind and we should go to the waiting area for further update. they told us to monitor the updates on the tv screen. we went to the waiting area but the status of the flight has never changed from gate closed. after an hour we got hold on one of the rare easyjet staff we asked for information about the flight and she told us that the flight has gone. we did not understand how this has happened. we have asked them to put us on the next flight but there was no one to help us. they were sending us to each other with no help at all.  they were sending us to a place in the airport which they call desk 6. they told us to use the phone in this desk to contact easyjet staff and tell them our problem. we tried this phone for 30 min but no one was answering. when we could get out from the airport security zone we went to easyjet desk in order to put us on the next flight they asked us to pay 80 each. how can they make us pay for their mistake the manager of the desk at the check in area was rude to us. the attitude of the staff on the ground is inacceptable. if i have to advise better pay 50 more and travel with a decent company..    flew easyjet from gatwick to keflavik. i had to pay a 105 to check a bag that i have been flying with for a month all over europe. i didnt know that on these low cost airlines that you dont get any checked bags and when paying for it it was also overweight. the staff are rude and demanding probably because they are under paid and unappreciated. i have not been on the plane yet and if it is as bad as the service i hope it arrives in one piece. please do not make the same mistake as me and fly a better airline.    easyjet flight ezy1821 on 19th april from manchester to antalya. having travelled extensively for over 50 years never have i experienced such appalling intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. from the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight.  whilst i understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with as do all other customer facing roles the majority of yesterdays passengers appeared to be middle aged sensibly behaved golfers & regular well mannered holiday makers. we were all initially warned that the crew had a list of passenger names whod made purchases from manchester airport dutyfree and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found guilty they would have the dutyfree confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. an example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to tenerife and was conveyed as if this was a threat. one  does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. as far as i could see most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. the inflight safety demonstration then commenced but the steward paused it and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be returning to the terminal and wed be going nowhere. much as i fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples there were many others there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. i did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. i witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger behind his back as grandad. another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. when the cabin steward announced that in flight dutyfree sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in turkey. we subsequently did not purchase anything from dutyfree in protest to such slanderous remarks nor did fellow passengers nearby. it was a relief to disembark in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. i have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before however on this occasion i feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay. i enjoy flying as a rule and have never come away from a journey feeling nervous of the crew. i sincerely hope we dont encounter this particular crew ever again. i will also think hard about which airline i choose to put my business through.    marrakech to gatwick. worst experience flying ever. the seat was filthy and stained had to wipe it off. the card in the seat pouch was covered in an unknown sticky substance. my girlfriend and i recieved multiple flea bites which i assume was from this flight. when the meal cart finally arrived we had very little selection to choose from.   london gatwick to inverness with easyjet. flight finished boarding 10 minutes early and we left the stand early only to be caught up in traffic queues waiting to depart. the crew seemed tired as i think it was their last sector of the day. the pilot was extremely informative which i love when there is no ife.   london to alicante with easyjet. told to put my hang bag into my luggage. while me and my family members i did this the staff continuously shouted i will miss my flight and have to pay making me panicked and anxious. flight was 30 minutes delayed. 5 empty seats available where i was not allowed to swap and sit with my family and had to sit alone. disgusting behaviour. rude staff.    venice to budapest. beware of extra charges at the gate. they had plenty of overhead carry on space for luggage. i had one duffle bag and my purse and was charged 60 euro for my duffle bag to be in hold.  flights are cheap but they get you with their bag checks. i have noticed many other airlines doing the same thing.   belfast to gatwick with easyjet. really rude checkin staff then uncomfortable seating on plane that squeaked really loudly every time i moved. they might appear cheap but you get what you pay for. if you can afford a little more to fly with a reputable airline then do it  be aware that theyll sting you for baggage if they can its how they make their money.    frequent flyer on this flight madrid to gatwick. i dont know if i am unlucky but 95 of the times has been delayed  i understand you are not paying for a premium service but i cant really understand how its possible specially from london airport the flights are usually delayed.    miserable 10 hours spent waiting for a delayed easyjet flight to gatwick because of a fault with the plane. very disappointed and will never use this airline again. no help offered from airline staff to source alternative flights and final delay of 14 hours.    flew london gatwick to aberdeen. easyjet during winter times been a good option to fly to and from gatwick. for what you pay flight was on time and went rather smoothly. the cabin crew were friendly. will keep using them every time i need for gatwick flights. better then ba at least you know what to expect.    horrible service from london to amsterdam with easyjet. asking to squash my little hand bag into my suitcase so i could take it onboard. stupidity i saw several people carrying two huge bags in front of me and the staff members didnt say anything to them. always delays with boarding. have flown several time and have never bordered on time. as a result delays in landing as well. the aircraft is always dirty. will not fly with them again    aberdeen to luton. i left a book in the front pocket of my seat and remembered just as i got off the plane. i wasnt allowed back on so a member of the airline crew went to check the the seat. they came back saying nothing was there. maybe they couldnt be bothered to check. i wouldnt recommend this airline.   the easyjet flight from naples to paris scheduled for 2.5hrs. on arrival at airport told flight cancelled. offered alternative flight to lille with bus trip to paris. the 2.5hour trip ended up taking 7 hours and 50 minutes. easyjet did not attempt to inform passengers of the plans. we boarded flight to lille having been told we would need to make our own way to paris by train. but once on plane we were told we would be catching a shuttle bus to paris that would take 2 hours. the bus driver told us the trip would take at least 3 hours not 2 hours. on arrival at paris airport the bus driver did not know how to enter the airport. hence time spent parked in middle of road whilst he made phone calls to find out info. i repeat the 2.5 hour trip took 7 hours and 50 minutes. we were not provided with any food or drink whatsoever during this prolonged trip. no apologies were made. the little bit of information we receive was incorrect. we boarded the plane expecting a train trip to paris but ended up with a lengthy bus trip that we were told would take 2 hours but ended up being closer to 4 hours.   there was a half hour delay on my most recent flight from berlin schonefeld to pisa with easyjet. flight quality is fine. i understand youre not paying for amenities so its ok that its so basic. there are no outlets or screens and of course you have to pay for food. in my experience customer service is quite terrible and sadly the only thing i remember. i normally have a jacket with me for cold air temperatures inflight. i have never been told that my backpack cant fit under the seat because it can and it does fit in front of me and i need to put it overhead or that i need to put my jacket on or overhead for takeoff and landings until this flight. and i am a frequent flyer. this nitpicking which coincidentally was only for me felt ridiculous. with all the addons eg. 18 euros per kg overweight checkin baggage its not even good value. i will not take this airline again.   would not fly with them again. delays on the aircraft are unacceptable. putting you on a plane and then having you wait for over two hours before take off that is disrespectful. and having it happen on both flights from tel aviv to london shows a pattern. for sure this is the last time i ever fly with easyjet.    this review relates to a flight from toulouse to london gatwick in august 2017. i shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as i can. firstly i found the website easy to use and clear and followup emails were constructive and informative. i found the easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. checkin as operated in toulouse was efficient and the staff wellpresented and polite. while checking in i was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. the flight to london was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. i witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. i assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. during the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and i saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. the safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. snacks were available for purchase. the crew failed to deal with an irresponsible parent who allowed her child to run up and down the aisle during the flight. disembarkation was orderly.    flew liverpool to belfast with easyjet. worst service going didnt inform us of a 1 hour delay until they had boarded us including a screaming child. made us stay seated for 1 hour plus whilst they waited for an extra attendant. no drinks or anything. why not leave us on the airport common sense would dictate that. plane was full of screaming kids getting impatient. full marks for easyjet on poor services and how not to run an airline. they knew the staff member was sick the night before so why not the issue then   flights to and from edinburgh to geneva were late by over 1 and 1.5h respectively. on both occasions easyjet was the only airline with a substantial number of delayed flights according to departure screens. it appears that the problem is systematic unrealistic scheduling. the second point constitutes an aknowledgement of the fact that the destinations were eventually reached.    larnaca to berlin sfx. this was my worst experience flying. it all started when i was on my way to to the airport when i received message that plane would be 40 minutes delay and while at the airport another when it said 2 hours and 15 minutes that was bad but ok. plane departed 2 hours later than scheduled but thats when fun begin captain told us that we might not be able to land in berlin because airport is closing at midnight and we might not get exception which was the case so we were diverted to rostok. we were told that buses will be waiting for us when we exit the terminal and message from easyjet said that cabin crew will be there to assist us and will give us some food and drinks. reality was a bit different when we got out there was one bus which was close and driver nowhere to be seen we were one of the 3 aircraft and cabin crew got into their shuttles and left ive stopped one from other aircraft from my already left and she told me to ask person at the airport there was no person at the airport. it took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. i could understand that things like diverting can happen but the way easyjet handled that is beyond terrible i thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this. i used to fly with easyjet often and it was my favourite budget airline but im done with them and i wont be flying with them again.    flew hamburg to london luton with easyjet. boarding experience was horrible. there was no system whatsoever they were not boarding families with kids or people with speedy boarding cards first it was just a random boarding which i found stressful and unfair. staff looked unqualified and unprofessional.    flew london gatwick to barcelona. this airline is the only thing that tarnished our holiday. 2 hour delays meaning arriving at our hotel at 4am we felt tired the next day. delays going home waiting around to get our boarding passes checked twice the plane then took ages to leave and fly home.    porto to manchester. the experience at the airport was great staff friendly and the process was very smooth. the staff on the plane were very unhelpful and made you feel like everything you asked them for was a chore. the trolley had traveled down the isle of the plane once but when asked by my partner for a coffee was told is that all as the trolley has already passed once. then didnt ask if sugar or milk was required and then returned with one empty sugar packet which i had to request to be changed.  i didnt know it was a rule to only ask for items once the trolley has passed once this isnt written in terms and conditions when booking the flight the return journey home would have been more pleasant with the addition of friendly and smiling flight attendants who had the willingness to provide good customer service or just act like they wanted to help even if they didnt want to.    gatwick to malaga. very bad experience on 2nd october my flight was delayed with more than 2 hours. instead of taking off at 5 pm was delayed to 7.30. there was already another flight to malaga same time with easyjet. was no information on the screens as to what gate so i  went to information desk they didnt know exactly. running around stressed and got to malaga after 11 pm. had to pay extra for a taxi in order to get home. not happy    athens to gatwick. i added a hold luggage for the flight and asked for a fragile tag. the lady behind the counter seemed uninterested and i was told that the company doesnt provide any. i was carrying an item which i had bubble wrapped but i found the way the situation was handled appalling. they didnt even suggest a solution or seem to care any less about my concern. i was so disappointed.     amsterdam to gatwick. probably the worst airline i use by far. today is a delayed flight of 30 mins. they dont treat their customers well have poor service and generally a bad attitude from the staff. flights are delayed or cancelled at random and they overbook the flights leaving people frustrated and stressed. the name easyjet is ironic i feel.    olbia to manchester. after waiting for 3 hours we found out from the manchester airport site that our flight was cancelled. nobody at olbia had informed as to anything more than they were working on the toilets on the plane. the crew visited the airport toilets walking through the departure lounge they then went back to the plane and ascended the skies without us. this is after the captain had told us personally that he would keep us updated. nearly 300 people wandered around the terminal at 11.30 pm looking lost and confused. i could see what was coming so i rang a hotel and booked a room. when i went outside the terminal there were no taxis due to there being no flights due until the morning. i tried phoning but were told no taxis then one taxi appeared and took us to the hotel. easyjet posted on their website that we could have a free flight a week later at the same time or have a refund. we had to fly to milan the next day to get part way home then on to manchester the day after that. we met some of the other passengers on the flight from milan who told us they had to sleep on the olbia terminal floor. we cant get through to easyjet and have not been contacted.   it is not easy with easyjet. at berlin schoenfeld airport the queue was extremely long and there were only 3 counters opened. checkin staff were rude and unhelpful. i feel that the airlines main aim is to be voted most on time carrier at the expense of passengers. the app does not really work when you have more than 2 boarding passes. for example i could see that i had 4 boarding passes on the app but i could only open 2 earlier passes. after the checkin staff also could not open the other 2 boarding passes he issued us with paper passes but he issued my sons pass twice and not mine causing further confusion and distress at the security gate. overall not happy with easyjet. but a positive point on easyjet in comparison with other budget carriers they allow a child traveller to have a free checkin of a stroller  car seat. also instead of spamming with offers on hotel and car rentals they could alert travellers on what is likely to happen at any particular airport eg very slow security as i am sure that they would have data on the number of passengers who missed flights.    madrid to paris. as a student on a budget i thought easyjet would be a good airline to fly because it was cheap.  they made us get in line for boarding much before they were ready to board us resulting in every person getting on the flight standing in disorganized lines for at least 30 minutes. the staff who was checking me into the flight proceeded to make me pay 60 euros for my bag even though i paid extra when booking the flight to have more than one bag. i tried to explain this to her and she told me that wasnt possible and forced me to pay for my bag. when i tried to ask her questions she continued to be dismissive.  overall i am extremely disappointed with my easy jet experience and will never fly them again.    gatwick to paris. ive waited 10 flights to see if things would improve  they didnt. once you have checked in for a flight on the app even if you change your reservation the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted confusing. the way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. then you cannot change it yourself.  by the way you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. i like to check in on the way to the airport once i know i will get my flight. no you have to check in way before. once the check in with the app or via their website didnt work so i tried to call the customer service helpline waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldnt do anything. you are now on your way to the gate it is 12 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. normally no stress not with easyjet where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight so you run to realize it hasnt started boarding. in short if you have a short connection forget about your connecting flight.  you think you are better off with a more expensive flexi fare ticket that is what we travel with. good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security but in paris at easyjet terminal there are no fast security lanes while in gatwick all the lanes are decently fast.  but then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream you are entitled to board first but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all standing in the jetway until you can board the plane.  the flight in itself is more or less ok the staff are usually smiling except when they bother you at the first and emergency exit rows to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders.  this time they bothered me saying that i needed to fold my ipad cover during the descent in a way that i wasnt able to use the bluetooth keyboard which is part of that ipad cover.    dortmund to luton. this was the last time i used easyjet. i dont care if i need to pay double the price for a ticket. i passed the check in dortmund airport head to my gate and waited to board. i had a luggage and a backpack as i had my suit in my hand luggage and didnt want to ruin my suit. my two bags were less than 8kg so there was enough space to combine them in one. easyjets employee told me in a very rude way that i need to put everything in one luggage and told me you get what you pay for. of course i put everything in one bag but easyjet should have in mind that it doesnt do as a favor when we pick it as a flight service provider.     gatwick to malaga. my husband and i travelled with cabin bag approved size with extra bag. i was with laptop bag and my husband with small back bag. 2 ladies on that morning wouldnt allow us to carry laptop bag & small back bag we have to put them in the bin. they didnt even offer to keep the bag for us collect on the way back. is this reasonable coming back at malaga to gatwick i have carried a small handbag no problem at all.     flew easyjet from london stansted to prague. flight was on time boarding experience fairly easy. seats ok. we ordered a drink from their inflight bar about 30 mins later 40 mins until landing we asked for another drink only to be told they were going to have a breakfast so would not give us more drinks surely you have a breakfast before you leave the house or if you must eat on a 90 minute flight you can take it in turns to make sure staff are available. absolutely ridiculous. poor customer service. gatwick to hurghada. i understand technical problems cant be avoided. but to be delayed two hours due to it being fixed i can deal with although still ridiculous when you have boarded the plane that then problems are noticed. the main problem is that now after a two hour wait we have a further couple of hours to wait as the current crew has said they are finishing their shifts. we now have to wait for the new crew who still have to travel to the airport. unprofessional and no compensation sorry does not fix things i would not even rate a one star they dont give you that option though.    adelaide to perth. the obsession with carry on baggage weight that includes computer or handbag for a total weight of 7 kilos makes passengers paranoid and uncomfortable just in case they are 1 kilo overweight. this puts unnecessary pressure also on staff. weighing hand luggage on boarding caused confusion and many customers complain. this is obviously a revenue raiser despite that they are concerned about safety. get back to reality thats why your ratings are so low. look at what the best low cost airlines do.    hong kong to hanoi supposed to be a short 2 hr flight but its already been delayed 2 hrs and its estimated that itll be 3 hours. the worst part is that didnt inform anyone for a very long time so were all waiting around. there wasnt even anyone at the gate desk for over an hr after the delay. then we get switched gates and the girls that finally show up at the desk are pretty much just on their phones even when you walk up. pretty much killed a day in my short stay in hanoi. wont fly them again.    cairns to sydney. i negotiated an exit row seat at checkin and 5 minutes before take off i was advised that i and the others in my row had to change seats. i asked why and i was told that it is usually due to young families that need to be kept together. i said no problem and gathered up my things. as i was about to move to my next seat which was much less appealing than my original seat i saw the passengers who i had changed seats for. it was four men middle aged. who had arrived late and appeared to have been drinking. not a young family but some blokes that wanted to continue drinking together and obviously had some friends at jetstar who accommodated them. what a joke this is not the way to be treat full fare paying passengers and i and my business will not use jetstar in the future.    phuket to melbourne. ive never had a worse flight experience than what i experienced with jetstar international. i flew from melbourne to phuket first and incurred issues with the staff. the service was absolutely horrible. not once did staff walk through the cabin to offer water to passengers on a 9 hour flight nor did they comply with our requests when we asked for water. i had to call staff multiple times over several hours before receiving a small cup of water. i also paid for comfort packs and received them two hours into the flight. the flight back to melbourne from phuket was delayed 6.5 hours making me miss my domestic flight back to adelaide and requiring extra accommodation to be purchased. all the airline gave passengers for this inconvenience was a 20 food voucher when in reality many like myself paid 600 due to their inconvenience. i would not recommend flying jetstar under any circumstance. staff do not seem to have any consideration toward passengers and overall service was appalling.    dont waste your money and time. jetstar has increasingly become worse each year. we have had four flights cancelled. you end up paying more for accomodation when your flight is cancelled  once after a 12 hour wait they wanted to send us back home we had to argue to get a cheap dirty accomodation organised near the airport. the next time another flight was cancelled and we were offered accomodation and we said no. never trust where they put you. while waiting around at the airport you also spend so much money for food and lose your precious holiday time. better to spend a little more and secure your holiday and business travels with other reliable airlines. the worst is the staff and clearly their lack of quality training. they have no desire to help you out inform you promptly and show a compassionate attitude during cancellations. they are slow as turtles on land and couldnt care less about customer care. we have had three flights cancelled due to engineering issues. their aircrafts are unreliable and the engineers unable to deliver speedy and quality repairs. how can they have so many issues so often i feel scared to get on their planes. we will never fly with jetstar again. not only are the prices cheap  all other aspects of jetstar is cheap. dont waste your money and time.   hobart to melbourne. two flights two issues. first flight from hobart to melbourne cancelled no notification no reason given for cancellation. all of my contact info was correct and i was on a local phone system received texts and email from other people. next flight was three and a half hours later it took off much later than that. i asked to be put on another flight as i had a meeting in melbourne at 5. jetstar refused because they had a later flight. offered refund but i had to eat all the fees so the full refund was about 60. booked on a virgin flight for 200 more but got there. second a policy issue. flying from cairns to hobart via melbourne. jetstar will not check baggage through. had to retrieve bags in melbourne recheck them and go through security wait at checkin counter all over again. when i asked an employee why we could not check through he said that they were such a budget airline that they refused to pay for someone to sort the bags as they come out of the plane. he was completely embarrassed by this policy. from a customer standpoint it is tremendously inconvenient. i will never fly with jetstar again from perth to melbourne for a conference on 13th day before cancelled to fly out at around 5pm with qantas then delayed until after 8 eventually arrived in melbourne accomodation at 4am. had to be at conference at 8am. to add insult to injury today we are again cancelled and rescheduled to leave at 6.50pm after our initial booking was at 10am. i will never fly with jetstar again scheduled to fly on jetstar at 1.30pm to the gold coast for a wedding. left my work early flight was cancelled with no other jetstar flight to board. we had to be placed on a virgin flight at 6.45pm that evening. missed out on family gathering. no explanation from jetstar as to what happened. melbourne is the second biggest city in australia and jetstar cant get there act together.  i flew hnlsyd and a month later sydhnl. i was actually traveling from vancouver to syd and broke up the trip by flying air canada yvrhnl return for about 550 and the jetstar for about 1100 plus all the extras. i had to stay one night in hnl each way adding 500 hotel. with the jetstar extras the cost perhaps 500 less than a direct flight. plus i was trying to break up the 1516 hour nonstop flight duration.  jetstar  i had a cordial reception checking in at hnl. the rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. the boeing 787 is a nice airplane as they go. i paid extra for a good seat which was a great boon on full flights. that was good value for money. i paid 40ish for the meal it was a rude joke both times. the meal was mushy minimal and miserable and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. the most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged 125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. there wasnt a weight scale where i was staying so i couldnt have prepared myself for the problem. my carryon backpack was at the carryon weight limit so i couldnt switch items into that. so it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. i paid and then fumed for the next hour or two. the only way jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. but they were very stern. in most of the reviews people are willing to forgive jetstars faults because of the lower prices. i dont agree. a price is a price and a fault is a fault. if jetstar worked on its faults and upped its prices slightly it could delight customers instead of annoying them as it so often does. i think ill flight direct next time either qantas or air canada. jetstar insist frequently enough during the online ticket purchase process that passengers must get to the airport 2 hours prior to departure which we dutifully did arriving at melbourne airport a bit before 4 am to catch the 605 am jetstar flight to sydney. when we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. got our baggage tag and got in the queue. then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours regardless of where they were in the queue. at one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. when we finally got seen  after a riot nearly broke out  the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. we had to run like mad. our flight was at 605 am  i dont care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags food seat assignments etc  its a nuisance but fine. ill pay as long as i get the service. the lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety it is maddening and made me angry and resentful. i cant believe this airline is a qantas offshoot. in the end dont bother with the 2 hours early part. it does not make any difference trust me at least not for domestic flights departing melbourne. get there 45 minutes before your flight flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and youll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules. basic definitions of service do not apply here and it is not first come first serve as they claim. it is next flight out gets first priority which makes for a highly stressful experience. definitely not worth the aggravation from my personal experience. we were checked in at flight gk109 from tokyo to sapporo. 15 minutes before boarding time we recognized some problems because japanese passengers were discussing something with jetstar airline staff heavily. no one spoke english but i understood the word canceled. i asked for a manager to come but they say we had to go to the checkin hall again for checkout. to make the story short no assistance no information no help was provided. i understand this is cheap airline but also the worst try air asia which has excellent staff and organization for comparison. absolutely awful customer service and outlandish fees for baggage travelling with jetstar airways from bali to cairns. its worth flying a more expensive airline as you will get massively overcharged for your bags with jeststar so it is not worth the savings. we were charged 570usd for 2 bags that is twice the price of our tickets. will never fly jetstar airways again and will certainly never suggest to anyone else. very disappointing. flew jetstar airways to bali a few months ago on the recommendation of a travel agent and once again to phuket last week. never again  improvements must be implemented urgently. cabin crew were noticeably inattentive to the extent that rubbish piled up on tray tables. i asked for a blanket due to a sudden drop in cabin temperature but was told the airline did not carry any despite the seat in front of me being supplied with one. worst of all  one of the cabin crew picked up a large bottle of water in front of me drank from that bottle and replaced it on the tray with other bottles  presumably for use with other guests. a health issue surely a very serious lapse of standard practices which management must address. on checking in for my jetstar airways flight at cairns the checkin terminal wouldnt accept my booking reference and said to go to the service counter. when i got there the lady behind the desk took ages to serve me. when i said that i needed to check in she said that i had to use the kiosk. i explained that it wasnt working and she said that i would have to line up in the regular check in lane with everyone else. i told her i had no hold luggage and she then insisted on looking at my carry on bag and weighing it. it was 300g over the 7kg limit and said id have to pay and check it in. throughout she was rude and surly. when she dealt with my friend a nonnative english speaker she treated him as a second class citizen. this was the first time in about 3 years that i used jetstar because id had such a horrid experience with them flying from gold coast airport to sydney and swore to myself never to use them again. we were made to stop for an additional bag check after doing through the standard immigration and international security. this was just before take off whilst waiting for boarding. they took away my water i had just purchased and food. ive never had this check done before and i would say it is almost certainly to make you buy something on the plane. this is forcing you to buy through them which surely is against certain rules  processes. honolulu to auckland via sydney. jetstar is the worst airline i have ever flown with. it started before the departure. we booked our flight and could not add pieces of luggage online. when we wanted to check in at the airport the staff then explained we have to pay €101. who travels for without any piece of luggage  i already paid a lot of money for the flight. during the flight we then realized that we do not get any food unless we buy an overpriced snack. honestly i pay for a flight honolulu to sydney and there is no single food offered  twice the flight attendant brought us 1 cup of water. coffee should cost €3.50 in my opinion even incomprehensible. movies music and other one had of course to pay for  as an example you could buy about 4 minutes length for 5 music video. at the end i can say confidently that jetstar is the worst airline ever excuse my language.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\npeace jetstar ruined our holiday. at 3.42 as i was riding home from work i had left early for our 630 jetstar flight to melbourne and received a text message that said the flight from sydney is cancelled. for options told to check email or call 131 538. no explanation that was it. i rushed home to make the call. after going through all the call options waiting for a long time for which jetstar apolozied but i was waiting and waiting. i was put through to a call centre. i provided all necessary details again and the overseas customer service lady tried to appear helpful by saying the cancellation was due to engineering difficulties and that she would try to put me on the partner airline qantas to melbourne. she asked me to wait so i waited  and waited for a very long time then she hung up desperate to try to redeem the weekend i called again and went through the entire wait routine again. this time the lady informed that all flights were fully booked but if i could get out to sydney airport in 8 minutes we may be able to catch the 530 flight by this time it was 452 peak hour traffic time and although we live in chifley about 20 minutes to the airport with no traffic this was totally impossible  it was friday afternoon peak hour while waiting and talking on the phone i had logged on to the internet to find that there were some available seats on jetstar flights going to the alternate melbourne airport avalon same night. i asked if we could possibly be booked onto one of these flights as although it was very inconvenient we would still be able to arrive in melbourne that night and join other family members who were already successfully travelling to melbourne from various locations using other airlines. i was informed that if i did this i would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that i would not be refunded. i asked if i could speak to her manager and she said that was not possible she would read out my options which were to cancel and apply for a refund through customer care which would take 15 days or she could book me on a flight the next day 1245pm was the earliest  a night and day of our 2 day holiday ruined as we had to return to sydney the next day sunday at 630 pm. i explained and she said all i could do was present my case to customer care. i asked if she could put me through to customer care and she said she did not have a phone number for customer care and that i had to go online email them and wait for them to examine my case up to 15 days as above. totally frustrated i asked again to talk to the manager. she said she would put me through to someone then left and again i waited for a long time. there was no response on the line so i called again same wait process and asked the woman not to hang up on me this third time and that i wanted to know if i took a flight that night on their partner airline would they refund me for the flight i had already paid for and pay the cost difference for the new flights this cancellation being jetstars eng. fault there were still seats on these other flights. she could not tell me. i couldnt afford the additional fares so i had to ask her to book me on the 1245 flight saturday only to have to return the next day. we missed out on important family time together. jetstar you ruined our holiday i have not had an on time with jetstar over my last 5 flights. they wouldnt know what an on time flight was if it hit them in the face while walking around the runway trying to pick up the pieces of their reputation. adding to that they dont even inform you of a delay until you get to the airport  my 88 year old grandmother can send a text message so surely someone at jetstar knows how to work a phone. appalling service. the flight from christchurch to auckland was cancelled. no prewarning. this is the second time i have experienced this with jetstar in one month. its hard to be professional and get to a meeting in another city if you travel with jetstar airways. they offer a range of reduced price seats which tempts patrons to use their service. price is irrelevant if the plane doesnt fly. jetstar airways flight from bali to brisbane. overnight so no real comment on cabin service. flew business for a sleep on the trip. checkin fine walked into the business class cabin. first thing i said was i have flown in a lot of business class cabins and this is the worst i have ever seen its no more than premium economy. food was poor quality the same as other airlines economy class. will not be flying jetstar again. brisbane to honolulu via sydney with jetstar airways. schedule changes prior to flight which i wasnt notified about. rebooked on flights which gave 35 mins to connect from domestic to international in syd. 2 hours 10 minutes in the checkin line – no exaggeration. then we were given seats 10 rows away from each other although we had paid to be together. we disputed this and eventually were assigned seats together. once onboard people were in our seats and had same seat numbers printed on their boarding passes however they had not paid for their seat requests. crew asked me if i really wanted to split up a family boeing 787 made my throat very dry. uncomfortable seats and armrests not padded. toilet flushes while sitting on it. the filthy toilet seat closes on my back when i am sitting on the toilet. on return flight toilet in the small cabin around row 12 was out of order and the cabin smelt terrible.  i asked for a cup of water and was handed a 1.5l bottle to pour myself whilst standing. crew napping dayflight 9 hours and toilets were filthy. i could go on. worst experience ever. after reading many comments i realize that i am now one of many but do yourself a favor and never fly jetstar airways no matter the price. hidden fees plus no service plus lousy attitude. admired to making lose our flight by their mistake and our compensation was not charging us extra to catch the next flight. flew with them four times while in australia and problems every time. we booked and paid for our jetstar airways flights from bali to melbourne direct flights. two hours before check in i get an email saying the flight has been cancelled because of engineering requirements. we had to re book our flights at a later date and the best we could get was bali to brisbane and then brisbane to melbourne. thats ok what im not ok with is been charged extra money by jetstar for a 4 hour longer flight and being offered zero compensation. a joke of a company with terrible customer service. we traveled twice with jetstar in november 2015. only complaint is that wed selected seats on line aisles across from each other. once on the plane we seated and strapped in only to be told by a young couple who said those seats belonged to them even though we had printed boarding passes with those seat numbers noted. naturally we called a flight attendant over who ordered us out of the seats and gave them to that young couple. the flight attendant told us to move to a window and middle seat in the back of the plane. these days one does not argue with flight attendants or they throw you off the plane so we just gave in. we always try for aisle seats because of the ease of ingress and egress. sure we lived through it but it was not fun to be treated in a nasty manner by an employee of the airline wed paid actual money to for services. the flight was dirt dog cheap so i guess we got what we paid for. cheap price cheap experience. honolulu to sydney via melbourne. after our jetstar flight was cancelled due to major engine issues we still await word on how they are getting us home. it seems jetstar has abandoned its passengers and whats worse will not pay for our accomodation or food while we wait to be flown home. its only after taking matters into my own hands by calling the airline and booking another flight that im getting out otherwise im sure i would have been here a lot longer. with no money to pay for this either i had to take out an overdraw on my bank account leaving me in debt. still awaiting some answers from this abysmal airline they call jetstar. i booked a last minute one way shared flight from singapore to perth on monday january 25th 2016 with jetstar airways as a qantas frequent flyer. i added the max bundle which gave me 40 kg of luggage seat choice and lounge access. my check in was done in a unsmiling perfunctory manner even though there was no queue. the qantas lounge was wonderful and the highlight of this experience. the seats are standard throughout the plane small plane central aisle with three seats either side. my seat was worn vinyl and very uncomfortable. my meal was unappealing and unfortunately the sauce was spilt onto my leg as it was being served. the staff never acknowledged my experience nor offered any apology. my family commute often via singapore and i will be avoiding this flight from now on if it is serviced by jetstar.  honolulu to sydney with jetstar airways our carry on size baggage exceeded the airline 7 kg limit so we were forced to check it and pay 160 per bag an extraordinary high fee. then one of the bags was damaged on the flight and they refused to refund the fee and are asking us to jump through various hoops to get reimbursed. on the return trip they failed to bring my walker up to the aircraft for me to disembark with. baggage was damaged a second time. the staff seemed exceedingly poorly trained and indifferent to customers. quite a frustrating experience. our return flight from singapore to melbourne was cancelled by jetstar and we were forced to spend an additional night in singapore. whilst waiting in the jetstar line at changi airport the single lady traveller in front of us showed us her cancellation letter from jetstar which said she alone was entitled to be reimbursed sgd150 for accommodation incurred. each of the four passengers on our booking also received this letter emailed to our travel agent by jetstar. having put in our claim for reimbursement we have been advised by jetstar that as a booking of four passengers we were only going to be reimbursed sgd150 for all four of us for accommodation it is impossible to get a reasonable room in singapore for 4 people at this rate. its the first time we have flown jetstar overseas and it will be our last. jetstar airways from cairns to sydney and a nickel and dime airline paid 300 to check 2 bags on my flight. they acted like it wasnt a big deal and there was not a thing they could or would do to help my situation. this is all because we didnt check the box to check our baggage when booking through a third party website  an option we dont remember seeing. you have to pay for all drinks except a cup of warm water. you dont save money with this airline and they will nickel and dime you until you pay just as much or more as another airline who has all of their fees upfront. auckland to christchurch with jetstar airways. i would rather have spent more money and reduced the chances of delay. at first an sms said that the plan was 90 minutes late. when checking in the flight was a further 90 minutes late. a total of three hours. i went through a period several years ago when i avoided jetstar for similar reasons and thought they may have improved but was obviously wrong. wont go back for a third time. bali to melbourne via perth with jetstar. they charge you exorbitantly 150 audpiece for luggage that isnt prepaid. any luggage after the single piece per person is charged at the rate of 25 austr per kg. they hit you with this when youre checking in and have no recourse. if you protest even minimally they threaten to deny you boarding. jetstar also cancels flights without any notice and leave you at the airport with no reasonable alternatives. they cancelled our dec 28 flight and offered to book us a new one in 4 days time we of course lost the first nights deposit 320 aud we had placed on the hotel that we were then forced to cancel. the promised refund for the cancelled flights has not yet materialised. be warned.  have done the denpasar to melbourne route with jetstar for the last few years and always dread the flight home  the indonesian cabin crew do not seem to have time for customer service and seem abrupt to the point of rudeness. only interested in getting the cabin service over so they can sit and chat amongst themselves. have encountered this now on 2 occasions. whether its a language barrier i dont know but no comparison to the friendly australian crew  will choose another carrier next time for return leg. jetstar provided an excellent lowcost service from melbourne to hobart. a departure time of 0605 ensures that approximately half of the passengers fall asleep before the aircraft leaves the ground. thus inflight service is quick and efficient. i purchased seat 1d for 11 because i needed to exit the aircraft asap. the downside was that nearly every passenger swiped my head with their shoulder bag whilst boarding. i wont do this again in a hurry. the flight departed on time and arrived early. the passengers are the problem. a pleasant request to return tray tables to the upright position is not rocket science. jetstar is doing an excellent execution of affable lcc operations.  jetstar airways flight from honolulu to sydney on january 28th 2016 due to arrive in sydney on jan 29th at 3 pm. we were due to board at about 8 am after being queued in the longest queue to check in hundreds of metres long and then walking to the jetstar lounge which was not opened for ages. just about to get onto the aircraft when there is an announcement that the flight is cancelled due to engine issues. immediately there are text messages to our phone confirming the flight cancellation and giving advice about contacting airline for a refund. that was the last communication i got from jetstar. if i had waited for them to contact me i would still be sitting in honolulu. shipped off en masse to the airport hotel with vouchers for 30 worth of food per person per day which gets you about one course in honolulu. the buses or taxis which never seemed to arrive and we get there about 2 hours later after collecting our luggage and lining up like a flock of sheep on the sidewalk. we sit in our hotel for the best part of 2 days. no communication from jetstar. jetstar extends our time in the hotel for an extra day. no news about what is wrong with their plane our how long it will be till it is fixed. no suggestion of any replacement aircraft or switching us to qantas or hawaiian. when i go back to the airport i am told they be able to get you on a flight on about the 3rd or 4th of february. i go back to the hotel manage to eventually book a flight with air new zealand to auckland then to sydney with qantas. we finally get back to sydney on january 31st in the afternoon. still have not heard a word from jetstar. they probably still think we are in the airport hotel.  denpasar to sydney with jetstar airways  extremely poor communication and service. had thought the lack of coordination and shabby service on the way was just perception however on return i now understand this is simply jetstars standard. flight was delayed without explanation by 5 hours and then further delayed by abother 3 hours. airport staff unable to give details regarding onward connecting flights or expected time for arrival. for me the delay resulted in a 36 hour working day without apology or compensation. not good enough jetstar. this bare basic service is definitely not worth any minute ticket saving. certainly would never travel use again. have flown jetstar business international on many occasions and the crew has always been energetic engaging and very pleasant. on this flight from melbourne to singapore though the crew were robotic devoid of personality and as much as i hate to say it soulless. at one stage a fa came past and tapped her index finger on the arm rest where the tray table is stowed to indicate for us to get the tray out i guess speaking would be too much to ask for would fly jetstar again but hope to get a crew with personality. ticket cost 166.00 one extra bag cost 350.00. travelers beware. ive been on eight flights using four airlines in the past eleven days throughout australia and new zealand and today i checked into my first jetstar flight from christchurch to auckland. i went to the kiosk as i have numerous times this week prepared to spend up to 50.00 for my second of two bags. i was referred to the counter. once weighed i was informed that i was allowed 21 kilos about 3 kilos less than the standard suitcase weight maximum. they explained that i had only purchased one bag and that i no longer had the option of adding a suitcase to my fare. they informed me that i was 23 kilos over and that would cost me 350.00. quantas and virgin happily charged for my additional bag and it was about 50.00. astonished by their assertion i asked if it would be possible to purchase it online. they promptly canceled my boarding pass and gave me an 800 number to call. i spoke to an agent and once again i was quoted policy. when i asked to speak to a supervisor they told me to speak to a supervisor at the airport and again i was quoted policy. i thew out my shampoo and conditioner shifted a few things into my purse and briefcase and checked in. i picked up a cup of tea before boarding as i have 100 times before and jetstar made me throw it out before boarding. thought it was odd as the other airlines always allowed it. then they tried to sell me tea on board. its small change but how tacky. great airline if you enjoy being duped. ill never give jetstar the opportunity to do it to me again.    queenstown to melbourne. in my 40 years of travel this was the absolute worst service ever encountered. as a result of a minor problem with australian visa and jetstar refusal to assist we missed the first leg of international flights and had to rebook. this resulted in spending two nights on airport floors loss of a paid hotel accomodation and rebooking fees. the visa was a very minor issue and a competing airline a few feet away took care of the matter for us in a matter of minutes after jetstar refusal. unfortunately jetstar had closed the boarding gate and we missed the flight. the counter personnel at the queenstown airport were extemely rude. in addition the jetstar website is very confusing. at the time of purchasing tickets one month in advance i paid 50 luggage fees. at the time of boarding we were charged 420 additional fees for two pieces of luggage. the fees were paid and at the next stop in auckland enroute to melbourne the agent attempted to collect additional luggage fees. again the personnel were extemely rude and required receipts for the previous payment because the computer didnt contain records. we contested these charges after returning home but received only longwinded explanations as to why jetstar bore no responsiblity. this is the absolute worst airline and the most expensive of all the flights due to luggage fees rebooking lost hotel charges.    poor jetstar check in staff at christchurch airport. it was terrible service to guest. i added the wheelchair service for my grandma but they didnt prepare staff or the wheelchair. i brought it from outside by myself and even then they were asking me to take her to aircraft. ok i understand it gets busy but when i arrive at the boarding area they made me wait and boarding at the last. it was 7am flight and im really disappointed in jetstar service.  jetstar were terrible from start to finish flying from manila to singapore. having booked my ticket online and prepaid for hold luggage and a meal on board i was told at checkin that i hadnt paid for baggage. the check in attendant was adamant that i hadnt paid but after a phone call to their service centre it was confirmed that i had paid for baggage and food. problem solved  or maybe not. once we had taken off the prepaid meals started arriving having been through this process a number of times with other airlines i had my boarding card out ready to be checked. 30 minutes later my meal hadnt arrived so i spoke to one of the flight attendants who were again adamant that i had not paid for a meal even though check in had confirmed this. i even showed my booking confirmation to which i was still denied a meal as it wasnt on their sheet. i was point blank refused a meal. fairly cheesed off i wrote in to the customer service department to complain. the service didnt get any better in fact i would say it got worse. having explained the situation i was offered a aus25 voucher to be used on jetstar.com. auckland to new plymouth with jetstar. if you want to have a hassle free experience do not book jetstar. i have been on multiple flights with jetstar  as i am a student i always go with the cheapest option because i simply cannot afford to pay other fares. every jetstar flight i have travelled on to or from new plymouth has been delayed with minimal warning. this morning i had a 6am flight that was cancelled however because i know of the unreliability of this airline i made sure and checked the website app and my email prior to leaving which said the flight was on schedule. i found out when i arrived at the airport that the flight was cancelled due to crewing requirements i asked when was this flight cancelled and jetstar said at 3am. i did not get an email until 5am stating the cancellation a time in which i had already left for the airport. jetstar offered a bus service down to new plymouth or a flight the following day which is completely worthless to me as i needed to be in new plymouth by 7am. so instead i asked for a refund which is going to take 2 weeks to receive. i do not recommend this airline  the cheaper fare is not worth the hassle that will end up costing you more.    osaka to sydney via cairns. when i am paying over a thousand bucks for a return to japan on low cost airline jetstar i am paying the equivalent for a return flight to europe. so surely the term low cost airline refers here to the shoestring budget jetstar its service is based on and not the price tags of its flights to japan. i am venting my frustration because there is a lack of competition. jetstar is the main airline offering services to and from japan. on this particular journey the flight was cancelled due to technical errors with the airplane. as a result it is taking hours to get things sorted for accommodation and rebooking. yet i am paying a more than lowbudget price for the flight.    newcastle to cairns via brisbane. can you believe that checked in baggage had to be claimed in brisbane then what to do with a suitcase for 5 hours ground crew told me that at their discretion i may be able to go through the screening team and pointed to stairs. this however was not the case so i lugged the case back down the stairs. if there is so much trouble with a domestic flight it will be a dark day before i venture on an international flight or another domestic flight. this did not happen on the outward flight but that was with another airline.  sydney to honolulu with jetstar. the flight was cancelled without notice. i flew all the way to sydney from perth early in the morning. when i got off the plane first thing i saw on the screen was that the flight was cancelled. i wasnt even notified and no suggestions from jetstar besides stay in sydney for another 2 days to get the earliest possible jetstar aircraft to honolulu. i ended up booking another flight to honolulu after getting to brisbane at my own cost. i will never use this airline again.   jetstar flight from singapore to melbourne cancelled at short notice without reason. rebooked us on a delayed flight to brisbane. no information at all from the airline upon arrival at singapore. we were left to fend for ourselves  a family with small children. flying to brisbane but still unclear how we will get to melbourne. avoid at any cost.   rarotonga to auckland with jetstar. most unorganised set up to ever exist. havent flown with them in years because its always a bad experience but had not choice on dates and times this time around. no surprise jetstar still manages to stuff it all up. late departure because of paperwork problems then even later departure because they managed to double booked seats on the plane. simple things they cant get right. id rather break my leg than deal with this outfit again. hong kong to melbourne via singapore. extremely unreliable. i couldve not have inflight entertainment or meals. i would not have care as much about the delay but my god are they disorganised flight was delayed by 21 hours. scheduled for 350pm then rescheduled for 545pm then again for 620pm. checkout from the hotel was changed from 200pm which would have worked out great to 1200pm. now im stuck in the airport for 6 hours with zero assurance the flight will be scheduled for the time specified. pay the extra couple of hundred for a better airline or if you have no other choice dont bother extend your stay a couple more nights and book with another airline otherwise theyre likely to extend it for you in your stopover indefinitely.    sydney to cairns. terrible experience at checkin. my husband and i traveled to australia with his parlor guitar as he played at a wedding here. the airline would not let him carry on his 34 scale parlor guitar. insisting it wouldnt fit in the plane and there was no way to even handcheck it as we boarded. this guitar has traveled all over the world in cabins without issue on much smaller planes. when we boarded the overhead bins were huge generous fit in even the smaller bins. the airline lied to us and lacked any sense of good judgement or customer service. we paid over a hundred dollars to store the guitar at the airport. jetstar  today you earned passionate detractors. what a terrible experience for a working musician and tourist in your fine country. virgin assured us they would have allowed it in their cabin. last trip with jetstar airways. badly done all around.\\r\\r\\n    three months out we purchased and paid for return tickets melbourne to bangkok. i added the business max package as this was our holiday of a lifetime through europe and my wife had 5yrs earlier donated a kidney to me. i wanted this to be a special experience. 4 weeks out the return arrangements were changed from a direct flight to coming via singapore with a different code flight. a little inconvenient but not being seasoned travelers didnt worry. at 5pm the day before departure jetstar emailed that the outbound flight was cancelled. their call center organized seats on a qantas domestic to sydney and connected to qantas to bangkok. the call center were deceptive in not disclosing there were no business class seats available on either leg. when asked the seat numbers we were told these would be allocated at the airport. at the terminal when all was disclosed jetstar after 12minutes wait advised to see the jetstar staff at the terminal. our qantas flight was due to leave at 6.30am jetstar staff dont start work till 7am. this flight was our only option to make our connection in bangkok. after our holiday and 2 days before bangkok we found our seating allocated bangkok to singapore as 1a & 1b. we boarded jetstar asia to find their is no business class and apparently you order meals in advance on their web site but non of this was ever advised and so no meals were provided. a coffee was 4. the embarrassment of having your meal tray down and being bypassed was incredibly stressing. the last leg singapore to melbourne was business class. some compensation was negotiated but not to cover the hurt embarrassment and disgusting treatment at the hands of this airline.    denpasar to cairns. not flown yet and most unhappy. now on second electronic scheduled departure time change no problem. on original booking i paid for extra legroom seats. confirmation of acceptance of new flight time requires confirmation of original seat selection. final stage demands another payment of the seat reservation fee before acceptance. i am not aware of any european airline that resorts to this rip off practice. jetstar has no system of communication with a human only ask jess which gives a load of useless questions and answers. sept 2016 flight date is a dummy to tick the boxes booking for dec 2016. melbourne to kuala lumpur via singapore. i was travelling in new zealand and i received an email from jetstar informing me that my flight on 4th december to kuala lumpur had been cancelled. there was no backup plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. the next available flight was the following day – the 5th the original date i booked and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. we called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. we needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. when we asked if we could book other tickets back to kuala lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. it is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from jetstar months in advance. so no flight no other options except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. to add on the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. upon checkingin in new zealand for our flights back to melbourne we spoke to the customer service at the airport. in less than 15 minutes they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th december which was what we have been told that the flight was full. fast forward to the day of the flight 2 days later – once again another frustrating email which stated a delay in the flight from 1200 hour to 1350 hour. bearing in mind that we have a transit at the singapore airport the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from singapore to kuala lumpur was at 1945 hours. however on the plane the captain announced that the eta was at 1930. logically speaking we expected that the jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in singapore for the kl flight. hence they would have been aware that the melbourne flight was delayed thus wait for these us to arrive. on our way there we even heard them calling out name so i immediately stop by the information counter to request for them to hold the gate as our flights were delayed. the gate was closed when we arrived. we explained ourselves but once again nothing could be done despite already having our boarding pass in hand. they even checked our seat numbers but still the same answer. at the transfer counter i was told by the airport staff that the flight we had just missed was the last flight out. and to top it all the representative only showed up after close to 2 hours later. no apologies nothing. it was as if nothing had happened and we should be thankful for the arrangements made. when it was our turn he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. i asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do. i even asked if we could book any other available flight and get jetstar to reimburse the full cost. the answer is yes but the next available flight was at 2145 hour when it was already 2120 hour.    our holiday package to hawaii and return flying sydney to honolulu included jetstar which made us hesitate but the chance to fly on the new 787 won us over. this flight was the pits the checkin system crashed as we were checking in so the whole airport experience was slower than usual. on boarding the plane and seeing the seats for the first time we were stunned  17 width and 30 pitch of the cattle class seats would be good for our 9 year old grandson but these are not fit for any adult. i am not the smallest of 64 year old males nor am i the biggest but my shoulders would not fit giving me no wriggle room. we paid extra for an exit row thank heavens for that so we had plenty of leg room. the 333 configuration is far too tight for any sort of comfort. the aircraft is actually very noisy compared to others we have flown on so you need a good set of noisecancelling headphones. we also paid for the food package which was not worth it  lousy food we are still trying to identify the meat. the hotdog for breakfast  on the return flight was unexpected and we had to wait ages to have the rubbish collected. the staff are not a happy bunch of vegemites rarely smiling and rarely seen as they all managed to go to the back of the plane and have a sleep  something which we could not achieve. never again will we fly jetstar.    i am appalled at jetstar for not providing me suitable accomodation or an alternative flight. i was flying back home to sydney from melbourne. they cancelled my flight due to weather but gave me no more than two hours notice and offered no other options for alternative flights either with themselves or another airline. the staff were very unhelpful. i recommend anyone to pay slightly more for a better airline.    brisbane to denpasar. first time flying jetstar internationally and first time on the boeing 787. have flown jetstar within australia for a pleasant experience and found the crew friendly and obliging. did not enjoy flying jetstar internationally. the difference in service and seating between the two is like chalk and cheese. i am 186cm and booked the exit row with seat 23c. cost was 45 for the exit row which in my view is very acceptable. plenty of leg room but seat is narrow with hardly any padding. seat was very uncomfortable. booked the bundle which included a meal which was a cold chicken type rice salad. worst meal i have had on an airline. crew were not friendly and appeared disinterested. once they gave the meals out which was early in the flight hardly saw them again. for a six hour flight would have been happy to pay for a bottle of water but you do not see them to do so. loved bali and can not wait to go back but not with jetstar    denpasar to auckland via melbourne. we left denpasar airport a bit late due to several excuses the main excuse was paperwork. we have already boarded the aircraft and waited on the ground for about an hour which made us miss our connecting flight to auckland. ground staff was a bit slow on giving us information about what was going on which made some of us very stressed and uncomfortable. the connecting flight that we were meant to be on had already left at 11.05pm when we arrived at 12am. jetstar gave us accommodation and told us that we were on the next flight out which was at 9.10am but due to the immigration not giving us indonesians visas we were unable to go to the hotel which meant we had to make ourselves comfortable in the transit area which weirdly you had to call someone to open the door for you it is so impractical when you are in a rush. we were given food vouchers worth 20 each no shops were open at that time so we were starving. we were going to get our boarding tickets at the gate and the ground service were very aggressive and so unfriendly and rude which put us off so much. overall the cabin staff were alright but ive seen happier more friendlier cabin staff on other airlines. i recommend that jetstar should really get their services to prioritise customers that have had disrupted flights and also train their staff to be more friendly and not so rude and aggressive. it would have made it more pleasant if the ground staff were more helpful and informative. also on the flight from auckland to denpasar via melbourne our baggage had been left in melbourne for around 34 days. our baggage was meant to be checked in all the way through to denpasar but obviously did this not happen. not sure who to blame melbourne airport or jetstar but this is really not a good way to start a holiday. we had to leave for surabaya on the very next day we arrived in denpasar which meant we had to drive 3 hours to the airport to claim our bags. we were stranded without clothes for 5 days.   sydney to melbourne with jetstar airways. i bought this ticket for my family trip mainly because of its price and i expected the service will be not as good as the more regular airlines like qantas. but overall theyve met my expections on the magazine only entertament system tiny lavatory as well as the food and drink. but one thing that had exceeded my expections was the seat. the pitch was resonable for a domestic flight at 29 inches fairly wide and the headrest was just as good as other airlines. overall a great experience for the price.    i booked a flight perth to melbourne to visit my sister that flight was fine and i had two very small bags with me going and did not have to pay and check bags. but returning the we were all lining up to get on plane and i was pulled to the side and my bag was weighed and it was 23 lbs for two bags so i paid 50. to make matters worse the was a lady behind me no credit cards just cash which they would not take and they said you have to pay in order to get her bag on the flight. the lady was crying and the airline person did not care airline policy she said we only take credit cards only  so i paid for the lady. when getting on the plane there was lots of bins empty and empty seats. once we were up in the air the bar opens up and they said we take credit cards and cash to the nearest paper note cost of the drink. i have never seen this before.    christchurch to hobart via melbourne. international flight and i wasnt aware how bare bones this flight was. the seat was worn and poking me in the back. they charged me an 160 for my bag from christchurch to melbourne and another 90 from melbourne to hobart. this was the same price as my ticket. my return flight is on qantas same price and they are giving me free baggage. flight also didnt include any drinks or food or any sort of entertainment. id say spend an extra 100 on a different flight and do not fly with this terrible company. just scamming people. plus you shouldnt have to fly for 4 hours with such standards pend even more to take your bag.     i was meant to get the 0910 flight from wellington to auckland and then would have a 4 hour wait to catch an international flight back to the uk. i turned up at the airport just before 7am and was told the flight had been cancelled that morning and id have to go on standby for a flight that would arrive in auckland at 1250. i advised this would be impossible as id miss my international flight. after a lot of talking the lady of the checkin desk managed to get me on the standby flight that should have left at 0835 but was late and eventually left at my originally scheduled flight time of 0910. i had 5 mins to get to the gate and through security. i was grateful to get the flight but very unhappy with the lack of communication from jetstar airways leading to the cancellation of the flight. lots of other passengers who also turned up for the cancelled flight stated they had not received any cancellation texts or emails. one person stated they received the message at approximately 5am. the plane itself had good leg room on the seats and the luggage came out promptly on arrival. i would hesitate using jetstar airways again.    hong kong to singapore. i experienced awful customer service when i recently flew with jetstar. outside drinks werent allowed on the plane despite the general terrible food served. horrible attitude of staff on the ground. and in general the policies around outside food and drinks are not clearly communicated. i would not recommend anyone to fly this airline most definitely not families with little kids.  sydhnl star class. typically poor experience on jetstar. exceedingly long queue for business class checkin of 45 minutes they were checking in 3 flights using only one counter for business class. several agents standing around doing nothing. inflight experience leaves a lot to be desired. star class bears no resemblance to international business class standards. seats are much more akin to us domestic airlines first class seats with limited recline limited legroom and a worthless footrest. when the passenger in front of me reclined my knees were jammed against the seat. i measured 6 inches of space between the seatback and the front edge of my seat. do not be fooled into thinking this class is a bargain at any price. cabin service was cool and indifferent. cabin attendants served meals and disappeared for the rest of the flight. certainly not worth the money and extremely poor value. sydool. arrived at the airport on time. flight delayed 40 mins because crew had to come from a different aircraft. after crew arrived they did a quick check and started boarding the flight. however cabin crew were very rude. crew virtually ran down the cabin serving food i had my wallet out ready to buy something any food would anyone like any food. then right in front of my face a massive high five. cairnssydneyphuket in business class. was not allowed to sit in business class on the 3 hour domestic flight but was allocated an exit row on the a330. not sure why we could not be seated in business like on the other a330 sector. no food or drinks offered on domestic sector. seats in business are really premium economy and the only inflight entertainment option was an ipad that was only given out after the meal service. crew were clearly disinterested and one almost barked at me when i dare go to the galley to ask for an apple juice as there were no drinks runs between the services on this 9.5 hour flight. had the misfortune of flying business class from brisbane to phuket. booked to fly out of brisbane at 8am and arrive in phuket at 10.30pm the same day. we checked our bags in the morning and by 11am the following day jetstar had managed to get us to melbourne with no luggage. i understand that issues with delayed and cancelled flights can and do happen but the total lack of communication was unacceptable. staff basically didnt want to know us and we were left stranded. totally unacceptable especially for a business class customer. i have just flown from melbourne to sydney and it was the most dreadful airline i have ever flown. the check in procedure at melbourne airport was appalling and i waited over 1 hour just to drop my bags off despite having an eticket. staff were rude and abrupt and when i complained i was told this is only your opinion. the planes are small and cramped and onboard staff were just as rude and treat you like a sheep not customers. the plane was delayed and very dirty as well. save your money and book another airline even if its slightly more expensive. my wife just booked flights and made a mistake booked flights on the right dates but the wrong way round. i rang jetstar to see if they could help me out to change these flights around to the right departure and arrival. i have flown with them for 4 years and when i speak to someone to get it changed they try to charge me 150 more than what it would cost me to rebook and lose the money i first booked with. all i got was its policy nothing we can do but we are helping you the best way we can. its ok when they change my flights have flights late with no word of a sorry or explanation. flew the jetstar equivalent of business class this week sinmel and was very disappointed hardly any leg room hard uncomfortable seats which do no recline much food quality was poor and selection of on demand movies and tv shows was also severely limited. i asked for a pillow and was told there was a blow up one in the amenities bag. it was an extremely uncomfortable neck pillow and the expected duvet was in fact an old grey blanket. the overall offering from jetstar just does not come anywhere close to competing with air asias lay flat beds in their premium class with pillows and duvets. jetstar does not even given priority baggage to business class passengers definitely not worth paying the extra money stick to economy if flying jetstar. perth to bali. this must be the worst airline that i have ever travelled with and i have not even left the ground yet i make the booking for a pleasant time of day and even pay extra for the privilege then within a week they reschedule it to a horrible time. after four phone calls and several weeks of aggravation they finally manage get a booking on a flight leaving at 9 am  ok not a bad time. then we arrive at the airport to be told that they have transferred our aircraft to a domestic route and we are rescheduled from 9 am to 4 pm  ok bali at 8 pm hotel at 10 not bad. then an hour later they reschedule to 7 pm departure midnight at the hotel and a days leave wasted and i have not left home yet myself and partner flew sydney to cairns return. from the international terminals we could purchase sandwiches and muffins on the forward trip but they only had mars bars or crisps on the return trip at 7am in the morning. pretty ordinary for a 3 hour flight. the seat in economy on the a330 are very tight my knees were on the seat in front flight attendants never smile. never again. jq038 to bali and back. the seats were awful. they are so tight once the person in front reclines you have to recline your seat. we paid for all the extras the food was very limited so we had to buy food anyway they forgot our comfort pack and in fact we found later into the flight they gave it to someone else who hadnt paid for it. the entertainment was very limited and the sound quality was terrible. the staff were non existent and inattentive. travelling domestically and flight was delayed for 3.5 hours. never once were passengers advised of why flight was delayed or when it could be expected to depart. constantly changing departure times up on electronic displays. staff surly and uninformed as to details of delay or when flight was to depart. customer service and simple communication seriously lacking. 3rd bad experience. will never fly them again. melbourne  launceston. staff rude and not interested in passengers. no boarding call made and had to run to gate after hearing the final boarding call. plane delayed further as they hadnt fuelled the aircraft. seat pitch very poor and seat uncomfortable. hardly any legroom. food and beverages ok. just like any other airline same old food. i would not recommend jetstar. booked and paid for qantas tickets return sydhnl. on arrival at honolulu airport we found out we were in fact flying jetstar. after taking our seats we were told that as we were qantas passengers we would be getting a comfort pack 2 meals and 2 drinks. asked for an ipad each to watch movies but were told we needed to prebook them. there were spare consoles but they were for the passengers who had paid for them in case they had battery issues when the meals came around i asked for a water and a juice but was told flatly that i could only have one cold and one hot drink how ridiculous cabin service was non existent when the steward eventually came to take our order they had run out of diet pepsi with 4 hours still to go in the flight. the best thing about the flight was getting off the plane and getting on the qantas plane back to brisbane. what a pleasant change in the staff from glum to cheery. never again jetstar had a flight from dunedin to auckland. scheduled to leave at 1900 left at 2050. seems they were short of a steward. classy not scanning of boarding passes. i have never heard ok giggle you can all go now. then waiting for a shuttle at akl with a passenger from wgtn also on a flight with a long delay. seems she was told the same story of being short of a steward. two domestic flights delayed for hours with the same excuse. what is going on star class sydhnlsyd 572012. being bumped from the allocated seat i had purchased 6 weeks before my flight. i took my 86 year old mother for a family holiday. because she is frail i am 190 cm tall and my wife needs to care for my 8 year old son we delayed our holiday for several days in order to secure the 3 aisle seats we needed. can you imagine the humiliation i suffered in front of my mother and other passengers when after we had taken our seats the ground staff came into the cabin and demanded i move to a middle seat or else the planes takeoff would be delayed. in order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. however as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. because the armrests on the starclass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later to be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. i do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract. let alone humiliating myself and making my mother very uncomfortable during the flight. unfortunately because of the limited number of starclass seats on these long haul flights we were unable to fly starclass on the return leg or rent an ipad to entertain my son because they only load 47 units on long haul flights from honolulu even during school holidays. flew roundtrip from singapore to siem reap in august 2012. i checked in online a few hours before and saw that my ticket was for no baggage. if i wanted to check a bag at the airport the cost would be 70. they limit carryons to 10 kg. my bag  perfectly acceptable by most airlines was 10.4 kg. i was informed had i bought my ticket on their website i could have paid just 20. the fare was not inexpensive either. so much for lowcost airline. customer service is horrible. screaming kids all the way melbourne to singapore. staff did nothing about them toddlers were allowed to run up and down the aisle disturbing other passengers. bought 3 tickets 6 months ago with assigned seating in row 1. we were all bumped off our seats when we went to check in. wondering why we were moved from row 1 a very rude staff member barked at me saying there are babies on this flight so we need the bassinets seats. well on boarding there were no babies in row 1. seats were cramped and no leg room whatsoever once seat in front is reclined. audio selection was very poor on some strange ipad type of unit. beware of jetstar business class absolutely dreadful. just today my family took an a321 flight from melbourne to hobart. my family moved to our seats and when we sat down we could see food scraps on our seats and on the floor. the plane left at 4pm one hour late and looking like a pigsty. the captain apologised for the delay and promised free refreshments we then were offered a cup of water. on the 12 august we eventually flew auckland to singapore. the flight was meant to leave at 10.15am. so we arrived at the airport and checked in  nothing said about any delays just that a gate hadnt been assigned and to check the board. went through customs told the flight information on our boarding passes was wrong  incorrect flight number the board had a gate but no time we went to the gate and found other people some of whom had received text messages saying that the flight was delayed until 14.45 or 4.45. after what would have been boarding time some jetstar staff eventually appeared. first we were greeted with  didnt you hear the announcement then we were given  reluctantly  10 vouchers to keep us fed and watered for the next 5.5 hours. had we been told this at checkin we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. jetstar dont allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. when we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldnt be delayed then they delayed us as they tried to find 15 missing people  probably the ones who had been told 4.45 instead of 14.45. never again. melbournehobartsydney. average service on all flights but very poor ground staff service in hobart. staff were very unhelpful and rude. flight delayed for two hours from hobart with no prior notifications. surprised how this is the best lcc in australia. my jetstar experience began with the website not taking my booking properly and checked baggage wasnt booked. for this they charged me an additional 70 to check my 7kg bag on a flight that didnt cost much more for myself. flight was late took an extremely long time getting on board due to lack of organisation. probably the most uncomfortable seats ive ever experienced. the hostess was snarly. i ordered an ipad for the flight and the selection was terrible. australia to phuket return in business class. i have never been so disappointed. i was in seat 4k  when the seat belt sign went off the passenger in front reclined and the space was less than economy. by the time i was able to ask a flight attendant to ask the person in front to move the seat forward a bit they refused as they said he was asleep the seat pan width was 28 cms to the tray table it was almost impossible to eat and equally impossible to get out. jetstar business class is the worst leg room i have experienced and to have that in a business class is unforgivable. absolute nightmare is the only way i can describe the situation we found ourselves in upon arriving in melbourne from singapore. our flight to brisbane was cancelled. despite warnings i booked return airfares to singapore. the flights werent that cheap once you paid for all the addons. no food is provided unless you pay for it. in fact youre best to prebook because the food runs out. back to melbourne. jetstar offered us an alternative flight on qantas. we wanted to go home early to save us hanging around the airport for hours. we were offered one flight which left later than the one they cancelled. no effort to be conciliatory. given the fault was theirs they should have made at least some effort to be more helpful. we couldnt check in our luggage because the paperwork wasnt done. we were forced to stay at the airport for 9 hours  only 1 without our bags. put this one down to experience but can guarantee ill never fly jetstar international again. my 75 yo father flew jetstar domestic adelaide to melbourne. i arranged this flight for him online as he is blind. at the jetstar checkin adelaide he was charged 70 for having a near empty cabin bag that was only 4cm over length. technically a breach of cabin baggage dimensions but he was not aware of this. took all his spare cash to pay it so he had no cash to pay for a taxi at melbourne airport. he is unable to use an atm. he explained all this no consideration given no assistance offered. the attitude was take it or leave it. will never fly them again. awful right from the get go. very poor legroom little recline on seats. no entertainment. very bad service from inflight staff. this is easily the worst airline ive been on. you get what you pay for. budget price  budget everything. jq1 sydney to melbourne a few weeks ago. the standard of service and customer communication i received from this airline was horrible the old a330200 aircraft was dated and the leg room was bad even for economy. ground staff treated us more like cattle than passengers if it wasnt for my ability to run with the crowd i would have been trampled whilst boarding as there was no line or structure to this process. once the cabin crew completed their food and beverage service you never saw them again until disembarking. once we landed it took them about 40 minutes before we received our luggage. all over very disappointing  you get what you pay for what a terrible experience. once you have booked your tickets they make it nearly impossible to change your details. tried to ring them up from bali to add on luggage and after a 2 hour wait got someone who couldnt speak a word of english. got to the airport and explained what had happened and was told straight that they didnt care and to fly another airline if i didnt like it. they then charged me 160 for 6kg of luggage. it didnt get any better once on board. the leg room was non existent and my knees where against the back of the seat in front for the 3.5 hour flight. had to pay for any food and drinks with your credit card and again rude staff. will never fly with jetstar ever again. sinmel. very disappointed by the performance of the cabin crew. for a flight of only 6.5 hours the crew took 2 hours 45 mins to serve drinksdinner and 1.5 hours to serve breakfast. bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. i took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. in between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. probably the most disruptive flight i have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up. no respect to passengers on this night flight. syd  mel on jq1. boarding delayed and rushed causing departure from the international terminal to be 40 mins late. although it was a sale fare the service was poor and communication with passengers was limited. seats were uncomfortable and narrow and the selection of food and drinks was minimal. the landing was terrible and even resulted in some applause from the passengers ill stick to virgin or qantas from now on  and i wouldnt even consider jq international after this experience. bneper and return. outward leg ok apart from the fact that this is a long flight and the seats are very uncomfortable and narrow forget about sleeping. poor selection of food and drinks onboard. return leg terrible direct flight to brisbane was split by jetstar into a permel and melbne with 2 hour wait in mel experienced rude service will not fly with them again. hnlmel. delayed 49 hours kept on runway for 3.5 hrs with airconditioning on and off for up to 30min at a time little information from the cockpit. eventually we were returned to the terminal to be told flight was cancelled spent next two nights awaiting more information given a disgraceful 250 jetstar voucher as compensation  horrible experience. i have never flown this airline without a delay and yesterday a cancellation of my flight. extremely poor customer service from counter staff and the offer of a bus added salt to the wound. their service is inferior their reliability nonexistent. my wife and i flew from tokyo to osaka. flight itself was on time the inflight service was acceptable we didnt pay for food which doesnt come free anyway and the seats while a bit tight were ok for a flight of less than an hour. the ontheground service however left a lot to be desired. we missed both our inbound and outbound flights and both times we called ahead to explain our situation. the first time we were able to change our flight to an early one the next day when we had to change our flight on the return flight the woman on duty refused to even look at us informing us tersely that there was nothing to be done but cancel or pay for another flight. we took anas star flight and had a much better experience with excellent service. still a cheap airline but they seemed to understand their relationship with the customer. launceston  sydney 22313. arrived at airport 7pm for 8.15 departure only to read departure board  flight delayed until 9.35. no texts sent to advise prior. at 9pm the board indicated flight cancelled  no announcement until 5 mins later mad scramble to line up for vouchers. had to organise own taxis. given 35 voucher for fooddrink and 15 for bf. next morning back to airport for 10 am departure. by 9.50 still not boarding  no announcements. finally on board 10.05  no apologies  then sat on tarmac until 10.40. departed and finally captain announced at 11am sorry for delay. staff advised that due to no catering in launceston there is no fresh food available nor ice for drinks. only good thing was they have given us a 100 voucher off next flight dare i chance it again. flight to sydney 2nd may 4 hrs late leaving. not advised at check in and travelers advised in the departure lounge 30 mins before flight departed. offer of an 8 refreshment voucher. cheapest sandwich in the airport costs more advised by staff to use it at the donut stand. no empathy from ground staff made it worse the uncaring person at the desk was a manager. the next scheduled to sydney left on time leaving customers whose earlier flight was cancelled still waiting. a little bit of empathy goes a long way and it was certainly not forthcoming from jetstar staff. flew back qantas today what a pleasure. will never fly jetstar again. we booked months ago a flight to bali which jetstar cancelled. no refund has been received after many weeks and i have been told it may even take 12 weeks to see the refund. i managed to get a more expensive flight & longer flight on garuda. well done jetstar for insisting on payment immediately upon booking and then not returning it when you cancelled our flight. poor business practise and i recommend to everyone to be very mindful jetstar will cost you money when they cancel their flights flew melbourne to adelaide with a toddler and baby. unfortunately flew jetstar as it fitted in best with nap times. staff didnt even try to help as i struggled up the rear stairs with baby in sling toddler and bag. consistently the worst customer service of all of the australian airlines. reiterated why i will only ever fly jetstar if the timing and route is by far the best option. two flight delays from melbourne airport in two days of travel is pretty poor service. very disappointed in the staff at service desks who were uninterested in passenger concerns. will never flight jetstar again better off spending a little extra for a more reliable service. travelling with jetstar return to singapore from australia on a airbus a320. no pillow no leg room find it very difficult to get in and out of the seat. no complementary drink. airfare over priced for what you get nothing. after travelling with other cheap airlines with the same aircraft more leg room better service free drink pillow and cheaper fares. booked on jq60 sin to darwin 26 jun for timings that didnt involve a red eye flight. however flight departure delayed from 7.35pm to 10pm and became a red eye flight. my previous trip on jq64 was delayed almost 2 hours and the one before on jq60 was cancelled and all passengers bumped to the red eye flight. the flights to singapore from darwin have a very bad on time performance and this can be confirmed through the flight status tab on both the jetstar and qantas sites. i do not recommend this airline. on jq816 from sydney to brisbane. tried to check in at the computers but could not do so because i was mistaking an i for 1. went to one of their charming ground staff to enquire why i had no luck checking in. if looks could kill she looked at me and said cant you see i am dealing with someone else and then barked at me to see the service desk. i then got check in ticks and the computer decide to sit my two children away from me. looking forward to the rest of the trip with jetstar. flew on jq959 from cairns to sydney. many bad things can be told about the bad experience with flying jetstar old dirty plane a long delay without any information provided until the scheduled flight time has arrived an attempt to charge for every little thing but maybe the worst think about jetstar is the rudeness of the ground crew and the flight attendants. in the case of jetstar low cost airline  low cost crew. never again. hubby and i travel to bali regularly on business and as neither of us are teenagers and hubby is 6ft 3 we prefer to travel business class. in our experience jetstar is not as good as it used to be. attitudes of airline staff are pretty dodgy with only one air steward on our recent flight seeming at all interested in passengers. it is a budget airline but the cleanliness of the cabin should not be compromised. chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight. to top it off the young couple in the seats directly in front of us reclined their seats as far back as possible so neither my hubby nor i could move his knees were literally squished into the back of the seat. when we asked the air steward to request they pop their seats forward slightly so we could at least move our legs the response was very cool but they eventually acquiesced. when paying so much extra for a little bit of comfort some consideration for the customer is expected. lift your game jetstar not good enough hobart to melbourne jq714. supposed to travel 17 october at 2240. booked our seats about 10 days before travel 10 fee and got a printout. made the mistake of not checking in when we arrived thinking the seat booking was sufficient. so after waiting 2.5 hours to board we discovered that we did need boarding cards. the supervisor then told us it was too late numbersnames had gone to the captain and there was nothing he could do  catch the next flight in the morning. where do we stay shrug. sent us to the jetstar desk to register for the flight and we were told we had to pay 150 late booking fee asked the supervisor if he could waive the fee as we had no choice but to book late. no cant do that. airport closing soon  see you later. no attempt to help or suggest any  accommodation or anything. found some nice people who helped us find a hotel close by  189 not much sleep. my question is why if weve booked and the supervisor goes through the list to make up a manifest can they not make an announcement to check if people whove booked and paid for seats are in the transit lounge apparently with online booking this mistake does happen from time to time. secondly why is it so hard to just call up the captain and request the addition of 2 more passengers  who already have booked seats its called customer care. jetstar clearly dont know what that is. refused boarding on jetstar because i was 3.5 minutes late for check in with only hand luggage. ticket bought through qantas but it turns out you cant check in to a jetstar flight using the qantas website. no redirection to jetstar website no assistance on the phone. stuck overnight in hobart without even a toothbrush. no attempt to try and get me on the plane. boarding then called 5 minutes after i arrived at check in desk. charged 100 late fee and then travelled the following day in row 31 with no window. sinmel star class business. really disappointing crew chatted loudly on this overnight flight. i went and spoke to them as theyd woken my son  ignored me and went back to joking and laughing loudly. breakfast not offered and 90 minutes from mel was too close for them to offer even coffee no eye contact from crew upon boarding or leaving the aircraft. the most personally disconnected flight ive ever taken. the entirely foreign crew may have culturally contributed to this. flew with jetstar from mel to bne using a price match fare which was booked quickly by the polite jetstar agent over the phone. ground staff at mel airport were polite and assisted with checking our two bags under my name onto the flight. the flight attendants boarding the flight at the gate were extremely rude yelling at passengers to move forward in the long queue. once onboard the service was better and the crew were quite friendly at times offering to retrieve bags from the overhead compartment. one of my bags didnt arrive in brisbane  which is curious because it was checked in at the same time as the other bag. i was told that it didnt make it onto the flight and that they would only be able to send it by courier the next day. overall you get what you pay for but i wouldnt travel with jetstar on a flight longer than 2.5 hours. unfortunately i travelled with jetstar over the long weekend as it was cheaper than other airlines. it was ridiculous  so chaotic unorganised and there were no staff at any of the gates. firstly my online checkin was not working so i called their help desk and the lady on the phone was not even listening to what i was saying. on my return flight there was no identification of the flight number or time at the gate gate changes over the speaker that were incorrect nor any staff there to help with any queries. both flights were extremely delayed and the flight crew were not helpful. bags were moved by the flight crew and they did not inform the passengers. it took over 35 minutes to board the plane. the most annoying part about the whole thing was that the lines to board were crazy  we were told to line up once we were all lined up and waiting in line they decided to change the way in which to board to seat 1937 first. on both my flights the flight hostesses were rude very unhelpful and kept hitting the back of my seat without apologising. i would never fly jetstar again it was an awful experience. it was not smooth easy or stress free. my flight outbound had a huge delay  1.5 hours and i was not informed by sms nor email or a phone call. normally reliable however do not use jetstar to fly to bali from darwin. on two occasions the flight has either been extremely delayed or in this case cancelled. there was little communication with passengers the board just switched to a different time which happened to be 5 hours later. all we got was a 50 off our next flight voucher which expires by end of the year. i will never fly jetstar again. our seats tray tables and magazine section were filthy the magazine actually had chewing gum stuck to it the window was filthy. an hour leaving perth and 12 an hour circling bali. yes i can wait 3.5 hours for food no issue at a 10.05am departure time. the flight home a 10.45pm departure from denpasar keep in mind that there is no food at the new airport except chips sausages when youve arrived the required 3 hours prior and then boarded a plane which will arrive perth at 2am people need to eat. we were in row 10 by the time food arrived there was none left so they offered us a hot meal i dont mind paying but first you need to have food and secondly it needs to be edible. so i paid 35 for 2 meals we couldnt eat and 2 bottles of water. flew jq944 from melbourne to cairns then onto osaka jq15 business class then osaka to fukuoka the next day. returned on 6th january fukuoka to osaka gk550 then osaka to cairns jq16 business class cairns to melbourne jq947. the japanese legs were fine as was the outbound flights to japan. though the return flight from osaka was average. they forgot my sons meal during dinner service i had to ask them for it they did apologise though he ordered chicken and got beef and i said nothing as i figured it was all to much trouble for them. then the girl going through the cabin offering desert tea and coffee missed us completely. once again i had to ask. the fight from cairns started good with a very helpful girl at the counter. some of the crew were terrible. then a rather rude women on the crew ordering people to sit down marching up and down the plane and the two crew members sitting down the back during the whole trip gossiping in loud voices. as an australian it was embarrassing. as a regular flyer ive got to say the service is pretty average and it really is hit or miss. some staff members are very good while some are woeful. but i guess you pay for what you get. oolsyd. booked the 16.00 flight to find when i got to the airport that it was cancelled and i had been moved to the 19.20 flight not very helpful with infants. crew acted like they didnt want to even be there. food was overpriced and i knew that from my flight there so bought food at the airport for less then half the price. no entertainment offered onboard. bring your own entertainment. seat was very uncomfortable. arrived at 22.00 and airport closing. no staff there to help us. bags didnt turn up on carousel told our luggage would come with qantas tomorrow afternoon jetstar are in the habit of cancelling flights with little notification time 45mins before flight time via an email and then abandoning passengers after transferring them to closed airports. ground staff less than helpful and claimed that this type of service is to be expected from budget carriers. they appear to be overanticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination. totally unacceptable when travelling with children and being left outside a locked airport terminal after an hour long bus transfer at 1.00am. my 70 year old mother flew jetstar from hobart to melbourne and was targeted to weigh her baggage very small suitcase  handbag and when it was just over the 10kg limit was told to pay the 70 or leave things behind no empathy no consideration blunt and rude. whilst it is ridiculous that you have to weigh both your suitcase and handbag the exorbitant fee and accompanying rude treatment is even worse. the cost for baggage is 10 if you pay prior and 70 if they target you on the day. how they can justify charging 7 times the standard fee i will never book anyone on jetstar ever again. fly at your peril. hobart  melbourne  perth. hobart to tullamarine on a fairly new a320. aircraft was pretty clean and tidy and me and my wife got our allocated seats. flight was on time happy to say. jq968 tullamarine to perth was a different story. check in manager very rude even after i produced my asic and advised her that i was fully aware of the conditions of being in an exit row. inexcusable behaviour. flight was out on time on a new a320 but i cannot understand the cabin crew. a person should not do a job like this if they are not cut out to do it. sure the flight was a red eye and as a frequent flyer i can accept that this can affect your moods. but the fact that one staff member cabin manager was putting meals on the floor another male member of staff who conveniently wore no name tag was slamming around and making as much noise as he possibly could. he was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. and then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs  well you get the picture. paid a full fare for this flight and in my view if this is the way jetstar operates their business they do not deserve any of the domestic market. will never use them again. flew jetstar tokyo to sydney via gold coast. flight was delayed by an hour. i tried to buy drinks on the plane and staff rudely informed me that they dont take cash aud or jpy and only credit cards which i didnt have. to be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. flew back to tokyo on air nz a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference. chalk and cheese. seats are uncomfortable and have minimum legroom even on a large aircraft such as the a330. cabin crew are rude and their polyester polo shirt uniforms are awful. check in staff appear to be overworked. for short haul flights jetstar are ok but for anything longer than 4 hours your better off going with a full service airline. last month was my second flight on jetstar from melbourne to bangkok return. food and drink both have to be purchased on board or online during booking which is fair enough as it is a cheap airline fare. leaving melbourne we were aware of this and took our own sandwiches and bottled water purchased in the duty free area at tullamarine  no problem. on both return journeys  at bangkok airport  our bags were searched before boarding and all water was confiscated from passengers. although we could purchase drinks and snacks using a credit card onboard we did not. surely jetstar could at least provide free bottled water to dehydrated passengers. maybe i just expect too much. jetstar is a lowcost carrier but still they could do a little better in some specific areas to avoid disappointing their customers. for example i was flying 3k764 kixmnl and they offer online check in. but when you get to the airport the special line for online checked in passengers is closed and you have to queue with the regular passengers. the local jetstar staff doesnt seem to understand the concept of online check in and frequent travelers would agree with me that its quite annoying. the overall friendliness of the onboard staff is average or below average. perth to brisbane. flight cancelled after waiting in the airplane from midnight to 3.30am. rescheduled for the following day and new delay. attendants tired and not offering support. when i eventually get into my seat ill leave another review but thats not for another 2 hours just a minor 7.5 hour delay. what is so spectacularly unacceptable was the lack of timelyaccurate information so now we have wasted a day here in melbourne and lost a precious day of our holiday. we chose jetstar as it flies direct from melbourne to honolulu rather than qantas which goes via sydney to save 4 hours. foolish us. our first and definitely last ever flight with jetstar. i write this as i spend over 12 hours at changi airport after jetstar cancelled a flight from singapore to perth supposedly due to bad weather in perth. there is no bad weather in perth today and other airlines are flying there. we and our fellow passengers believe they have given this excuse to avoid responsibility for passenger accommodation. for this reason we simply will not trust them again. we were warned though so the lesson has been learnt. flew their singapore to cambodia new service back in february. checkin tried to charge us for excess luggage on the way back after we had paid for 30 kg already. tried it on the couple in front of us also. luckily we had our original online bookings done via qantas docs printed with us. our friends on the earlier flight during the week were made to recheck their luggage in singapore but we were not also another level of inconsistency. fly silk is my advice until they have got their act together or fail which may not be far off looking at the way they seem to be going. sadly we thought it was emirates but it must have been a shared flight with qantas. oh well never again sorry qantas. relocating to new zealand so had excess luggage. had called jetstar twice before travel to check the cost and on both occasions was told 15 per kg. at checkin was charged 25 per kg and was told that 25 per kg is the international excess baggage charge regardless of destination. the excess baggage cost more than the actual flight ticket. checkin staff could not care less that we were given incorrect information over the phone twice. poor customer service and unethical business practices in my opinion. flight jq 151 syd to chc. 5th june 2014. travelling as a group of 4 3 names were on the manifest and 1 was not. despite showing the loading attendant our confirmation for the passenger she showed absolutely no concern and would not make any further enquires. the result was that we had to fly on leaving our friend to sort things out in sydney. this he did and it was found to be a jetstar error. the rudeness and total unhelpfulness of the person in charge of the boarding gate shows just why this airline continues to rank amongst the top of the list of unpopular airlines. never again jetstar. what a terrible excuse for an airline. my daughter was in australia for 4 months in a study abroad program and as we live in hawaii i made the mistake of booking jetstar to honolulu as it was the only nonstop from sydney. i purchased their max. checked baggage allowance of 40kg wouldnt let me buy more although i thought she might be slightly over since basically every other airline allows two fifty lb bags to be checked they cap it at two 44 lb bags. she was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay 25 per kg. i told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk. she was on a half full flight and 4kg was going to matter they also weigh purses as part of this luggage scam because you are only allowed 10kg carried on. if you are overweight they probably make you run laps until the plane boards. flew on a short flight from sydney to ballina. we were on one of the older planes with very small leg room. seats didnt recline and uncomfortable journey. service was average nothing to note about. the return flight was much better on the new aircraft. better comfort and leg room. service the same. ballinamelbourne on a320. paid about 100 or so for a one way ticket which i purchased on qantas website . baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the qf website about incremental charges for excess baggage. travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg  ie 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. jetstar charged me 300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. qantas should be reprimanded for selling jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesnt remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. qantas customer service people in melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a jetstar issue even though jq is owned by qf and the ticket was bought on the qf website. jetstar employees in melbourne were unsympathetic said i shouldve known read the policies etc. one even suggested they should be charging more and didnt think 5001000 was out of line. this airline is completely out of control and i vow never to reward either company with my business again. i have flown with them 4 times recently for 3 work meetings and 1 weekend trip. on each occasion my flight schedule was changed at the very last minute usually by 4 hours. one change even involved me having to swap a direct flight for one with a layover in bali with 1 days notice. this flight was again changed on the evening before the flight. on arrival in singapore for a connecting flight to bali i discovered my luggage had been completely destroyed due to a heavy oil leak not from within my bag and having been crushed by other heavy luggage. the call centres could not be more unhelpful if they were staffed by a group of chimpanzees with typewriters. returned from hobart sunday 67 on the 10.30am flight. stood in a queue for more than 50 minutes to get bags checked in. this is very poor service jetstar. jq 29 melbkk on b787. first trip on the dreamliner which might as well be named nightmareliner. i found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from jetstars a330 which are generally appalling. i found the seats and aisles to be tight. quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept kneeing me the entire flight  suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. the ife looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical jetstar manner you pay for it. the mood lighting and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. there is also some serious disinformation that jetstar should retract  they claim there is shared seat power on the aircraft. i didnt see it in my seat and when i asked the fa he said only the exit rows have it. there is a usb connector for peds but no shared in seat power. it is another example of jetstars notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. as for the flight it was on time out of mel and early into bkk so credit to jetstar for that. crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for jetstar. summary neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner. wouldnt go out of my way to fly either jetstar or their b787. this was the first time i have travelled on jetstar and since qantas does not fly from perth to singapore i thought i would give jetstar a try. what a great mistake that was yes i understand it is a budget airline but there was no service at all when they delayed the flight for more than 12 hours i got to the airport about three hours in advance when ground staff said one can check in only two hours prior. an hour passed and when i approached them again to find out the flight had been delayed until the following morning at 4.40am and passengers would be able to collect a meal voucher worth sd8.00 and that was it. we could not check in until 6pm. the least jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than aus10. to hang around with luggage for so many hours at terminal 1 is not fun at all and an inconvenience. almost all the passengers said they will never fly with jestar which i think is sad just because the management cannot be bothered to show that they actually care about their passengers. i have travelled from bangkok to melbourne on 1007 with the new boeing 787 jq30. i have never experienced such poor seat design and configuration in my life leg room is nonexistent if you drop something on the floor you can not pick it up. width of the seats is such that you have to keep your hands in your lap at all times. seats can barely recline. im not a big person. they crammed 340 passengers on this plane which normally carries 250 people with other airlines. i will never fly with this company again and i highly recommend to all other travellers to avoid flying with them no matter how the cheap fares are. such a waste of a dreamliner. we have just travelled to hawaii on jetstar and it was a nightmare from the start. at melbourne airport we waited almost 2 hours at the checkin desk even though we had done so called online check in. when i told the girl at the desk she told me i was lucky  some people wait 3 hours. then we waited almost 2 hours on board to get anything to eat or drink because we had not paid the outrageous fee for meals since being in hawaii i have spoken to several of my compatriots who swear they will never travel jetstar again. personally i am dreading the return trip to melbourne on friday morning. so much for qantas frequent flyer card which i have had for 20 years. a very dissatisfied customer. i flew 4 times in two weeks with this airline. narita to cairns cairns to sydney sydney to melbourne melbourne to japan. at narita airport the staff were friendly i would expect nothing less in japan. australia is where the drop in service is found. the first few flights were fine. staff seemed a bit unfriendly. melbourne was a whole other story. ticket counter staff the staff were chatting with each other and did not notice me standing in the economy line. the girl took my passport without a greeting and continued talking to her coworker. in a condescending tone said you know this flight is 2 hours late right never an apology for the inconvenience. i was given my ticket with no explanation about where the gates were or how to handle this delay. i decided to wait at the gate and get information there. the 11pm flight now said 1.30 departure with closed next to it. i had no idea what this meant and other customers seemed confused as well. my ticket said 12.30 boarding in pen so i just waited. at 12.45 a gate staff member came to the gate but made no announcements. at 12.50 we find out they will start boarding at 110 once the plane has been deplaned. boarding the female gate attendant at least said thank you to each customer the male said nothing. just scanned all of the boarding passes like a robot. i was surprised they never checked our passports even though it was an international flight. flight the flight had about 100 people. the airplane could probably hold about 340 people. still all the customers were assigned seats right next to each other. the flight crew announced that you may notice how empty the flight is. please wait until we are in the air to choose new seats. once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. very poor customer service by airport staff flight the seats were actually very comfortable. my intention was to sleep through the flight. unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. her exact words you ordered the meal. as we were landing the flight crew not the pilot made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. all in all  not the best experience. the food was good. the ipad rental is ridiculously expensive and from what i heard doesnt offer a lot of selection. the flight attendants seems rushed or irritated when they did their jobs. the ticket staff were unfriendly. ill fly jetstar for the price but never for the service. i will never fly this airline again. our flight at the moment has been delayed 11.5 hrs and increasing as i sit at the airport. we have missed the singapore grand prix day 1 race and concert which we had tickets for. the communication to let us know what was going on was appalling. by the time they decided to let us know what was going on the earliest flight we could rebook for was 10.5 hrs later. my advice is never fly jetstar. i was flying jetstar domestically from adelaide to brisbane and i only had carry on bags. my bag was only slightly overweight and not only did they make me check my bag in but they charged me an extra fee of 70 despite the fact that i didnt have 70 at the time. we booked a holiday deal to the hayman islands for travel between 69  99. we arrived at the airport on time to checkin as their mobile checkin services were down. we were advised by a very rude staff claiming the service counter closed ages ago meaning they decided to close their counter earlier. we showed him we had sufficient time to checkin but he ignore us and denied boarding. we have no choice but to transfer our ticket the next flight on the following day for 50pp losing one night hotel stay and half day on the island. both the airport staff and call center service was appalling. no consideration or sympathy whatsoever. will never fly with them again. flew from sydneymelbournebangkok and back. the staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. there was no consideration to the urgency to make adjoining flights. landing back in melbourne it took them 40 minutes to get our bags onto the turnstile because the machine was broken so thus missed adjoining domestic connection. on top of that melbourne custom officers were slow and condescending. my family and i caught a flight from sydmel and i was very disappointed. the cabin crew were extremely unhelpful. there was no inflight entertainment whatsoever not even the radios you could use on your arm rest like on other domestic airlines such as virgin and qantas. when we arrived in melbourne jetstar had lost my luggage. they contacted us in saying it should show up in 3 to 4 days and we were only in melbourne for 4 days it seemed like they didnt care at all i would never travel with jetstar again. flew bali to perth on jetstar. i had used qantas ff points to book a rewards flight and ended up on jetstar as qantas does not fly internationally out of perth. go figure. i paid for front row seats so had lots of legroom. i got the legroom and thats it. the seat was hard as a rock and i duidnt want to recline as i would have suffocated the poor passenger behind me. the staff completely disinterested and no service offered. the best i can say is we arrived home safely. we will never fly jetstar again. air asia is far better. travelled from gold coast  cairns on sat 18102014 with walk on bags no charge. returned on wed 22102014 with walk on bags as same as gold coast  extra charge 50. my family of three traveled from manila to sydney. we were delayed 2 days in manila and were not informed when our flight will be until the last minute. they put us up in a very nice hotel in manila while we were waiting. the morning of the flight they decided to take everyone to the airport at least 3 hours before the flight. i guess they were going for the guinness book of records for the longest queue ever. because they didnt start checking people in until all the bus loads had arrived. little did i know this was a sign of what was to come. we had to change at darwin to a connecting domestic flight where we arrived about 1pm. as our connecting flight was not there yet they put us up in a hotel in darwin. we had to wait in a queue in darwin 3 hours for our new tickets. that plus the 2.5 hours we had to wait in manila plus an hour at the hotel. all this waiting in queues with a 12 month old infant. the flight from darwin to sydney left about 2am. a family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. they were put off the plane at darwin because their baby had eczema around its mouth. wasnt the whole family just the father and 3 kids. mother was waiting for them in sydney. the pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. i witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge. one of the flight attendants coldly carried the sleeping girl and dumped her on the bridge. a memorably bad experience. if you have a family dont fly jetstar. they also promised to give us 200 worth of coupons each for future flights which turned out to be 50 when we tried to get them. hnlsyd and hbasyd return. first of all our flight from hobart was delayed by nearly 2 hours. when we arrived in sydney were told that no luggage had been loaded. it was very windy in hobart so i get why this happened but we were off to hawaii. had we been given notice before checking in the luggage that this was a possibility we could have got our swimmers out and left the big bag in hobart. anyway jetstar managed to give us about 3 different stories about when our luggage would arrive in hawaii and each was completely contradictory. i spent perhaps 3 hours in the first couple of days trying to chase down what was going on. on the hnl syd flight the attendants all seemed to be lovely but were absolutely hopeless. they were disorganised we didnt get a veg meal that we had ordered. the cabin was an absolute pigsty too  there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers rubbish in the seatback compartment. i took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. we got back to syd late and we missed our connecting flight. i had tried twice before leaving hnl to check in online it wouldnt let me. tried again before going through customs wouldnt let me. i then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. i asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. very long story short i ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. i have travelled with jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 31. last time on a flight from hba to mlb i organised booked and paid for transport via jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. the thing that i think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up. had we had decent communication and correct answers it would have been manageable. flew melbourneosaka kix via cairns and tokyo naritamelbourne. flight over was on a 787 which was nice and new. return flight on an older a330. seats reasonably comfortable on both flights. both flights on time. service is basically nonexistent. crew seem so disorganised. not sure what they do for the majority of the flight as you do not see them. if jetstar are much cheaper fly with them but all in all even considering they are a low cost carrier flying with them is a nothing experience. flew meldps on 14 nov on the 787 neat new aircraft  food was disappointing  not worth the 15 aud. you are better off having a nice feed at the airport before take off. drinks etc as expected overpriced not many options once youre in the air. staff were doing the bare minimum to make things better. just because its a low cost carrier it should not equate to a low level of service. certainly will be considering other options before booking jetstar again. business class jq47 from bne to bali. we had to walk from the airport building along the runway to the plane on the scorching sun. flight was delayed more than hour due to wrong meals being loaded. business class seats are total disaster more like premium economy. touch screen is worse than any screen in economy class on any other airline. it was freezing cold during the flight. on my way back from bali to bne i spent few hours in the premier lounge which was hardly better than average pub in bne. walking back again from the plane to the building in bne. never again jetstar. this airline should only be used in desperation as you last option. the ground staff which should be friendly and helpful treated me disrespectfully as if was my fault. i arrived at sydney airport 40min before my 5.25pm scheduled departure for melbourne and for several minutes was unsuccessfully trying to get my boarding pass using my qantas frequent flyer card at one of the automatic machines. when i was unable to get my boarding pass i approached the help desk. at the time i managed to speak with an assistant it was exactly 30 min before my scheduled melbourne bound service. the service clerk informed me that i am now late for my flight and all other flights to melbourne are fully booked and i can only fly the next morning. being very unhappy with such treatment i informed the clerk that i will not be using jetstar airline in future and then arranged my flight with qantas for 6.30pm. flew mellst. arrived early at airport only to be told we werent able to use the bag drop. checkin staff were rather rude. plane was old and dirty. flight landed 5 mins late. cabin crew were quite good. overall you are better off flying virgin. flew between sydney and uluru. the flights themselves were what you would expect from a budget airline. the checkin process however was a total shambles. at sydney airport there was just one long line for all their departures. using the automated checkin machines was a waste of time  when we eventually reached the checkin desk the baggage tags wed carefully put on were unceremoniously ripped off. we were still in the middle of the long line having arrived two hours before our scheduled departure time when we heard someone shouting our flight number. with great difficulty we managed to extricate ourselves and baggage from the maze. eventually we found the checkin desk where our flight number was being shouted. the checkin clerks were complaining to each other that they werent being sent the right passengers. the return flight from uluru wasnt much better despite being the only departure that afternoon. at the checkin they waited until all the passengers arrived before they very slowly began the process. very galling to watch them sitting behind the checkin desks doing nothing while we all stood in line. even when they did condescend to start work they seemed to believe that chatting between themselves was a higher priority than dealing with their customers. value for money i would want to be paid to experience that again. sydbne jq824. boarding at sydney was utter chaos since for some unknown reason we were using a tiger air gate far from the usual jetstar gates which had very little seating. the jetstar airport crew had absolutely no idea what was going on and made boarding announcements by shouting at us and ordering passengers around. the previous flight was late arriving and it was a nightmare trying to disembark and then board passengers in such a small space. the flight itself was okay but the amount of legroom was very limited making me uncomfortable. departed 35 minutes behind schedule and arrived 25 minutes late. as jetstar is a budget airline i was not expecting high standards however the quality was disappointing. next time i would be more than happy to spend a little extra to fly qantas or virgin. poor trip with jetstar will be happy if i never travel with them again. our direct flight was cancelled sydney to phuket and we were then sent through sydneymelbournephuket meaning an extra few hours before we even left australia. once on board our melbourne phuket plane the seats were quite comfortable. meal times were different we had paid and preordered meals but no they had no record of that even though it was printed on our ticket. this meant we had no meals as only those prepaid and recorded were put on board. we could then purchase a toasted sandwich or pie most uninteresting and unsatisfying. the staff were less than helpful daughter had an infant and was not offered a spare cushion or any other help. how else can you get out of darwin to bali jetstar cancelled our flight without much reason given come back tomorrow  so lost a whole day in bali with all that went with that next day oh dear were diverting you via melbourne. so back thousands of miles and then onwards to bali  more lost time. compensation offered was laughable. sincerely given apologies no way. they dont seem to be able to say sorry. as this was the first step of my journey home to england it didnt help that they also lost my luggage. they dont seem to have any up to date systems even though i gather theyre a part of qantas not that theyre going to admit that. first time with jetstar to bangkok on 17th december. the flight from singapore to bangkok was fine. 15 minutes into the return flight to singapore we had to return to bangkok as ice had formed on the wings. we waited for more than 2 hours at the airport without knowing what would happen next. there was no communication between the ground staff and the passengers. we did even get a drink from the ground staff. only when we approached the staff then we realized we had to stay in bangkok for another night. without giving proper instructions we were lead like blind mice around the airport. we waited again for more than half an hour before we were transported to a hotel near the airport. the ground staff were not be able to handle the situation well which left us feeling lost and frustrated. this will be my first and last flight with jetstar. flew melbourneosaka kix via cairns and tokyo naritamelbourne. flight over was on a 787 which was nice and new. return flight on an older a330. seats reasonably comfortable on both flights. both flights on time. service is basically nonexistent. crew seem so disorganised. not sure what they do for the majority of the flight as you do not see them. if jetstar are much cheaper fly with them but all in all even considering they are a low cost carrier flying with them is a nothing experience. i commented earlier about my bad experience from melbne last week well the return flight from bnemel jq006 was no better. the flight was delayed by well over an hour due to jetstar not being able to find a passenger. dont we all scan in for a reason firstly we had to be there well before as it was an international stopover flight for our domestic portion so i had to queue at customs. then they decided to delay 300 passengers on australia day then after already costing me 247 more from the trip up they wouldnt even give us a drink. i was told i had to purchase one and the staff couldnt care less. never again. booked flight perth to singapore take off time 12.10 am ten past midnight. flight was delayed because of bad weather until 1pm one o clock in the afternoon. we had booked this flight so that we could allow for up to 89 hours delay because we know that they are famous for not taking off on time. we had to catch a cruise so the 13 plus hour delay which we ended up with would make us to late for the ship. we were told by jetstar staff there would be no refund and the only thing we could do was to try and get seats on singapore airlines which after lots of running around the airport we were able to locate singapore airlines office and managed to get the last 2 seats at a cost of over 1000. we then proceeded to fly the same route that jetstar could not fly because of bad weather. tiger airways also took off on time jetstar being the only airline grounded because of bad weather. if we had allowed ourselves more time and booked the same flight 24 hours earlier we would still have had to wait until 1300 hrs because the flight the night before had also been delayed. flying return from perth to melbourne. our initial flight was due to leave at 10am only to receive an email the night before at 9pm informing our plane had been cancelled due to scheduled maintenance we had to very quickly rebook ourselves onto a plane that left at 12.45am or 1pm the next day. we were lucky to get seats on the 12.45am flight however the seats at the very back of the plane designated for cabin crew. because this is a budget airline we really didnt expect many thrills but the back seats allow for little room to recline and the three seats in a row are so compact it was the most uncomfortable experience ive had on a plane. the seats are like cement the faux leather is super sticky and the leg room is ridiculously tiny if you are larger than a size 14 im sure you would be terribly claustrophobic. the cabin crew also burnt the coffee which stunk out the entire cabin. luckily for us this flight did get us in to melbourne 8 hours earlier than we had first booked so a small positive to say the least. on our return journey from melbourne to perth  only four days later  we were due to board the plane having been called over the speaker to get our boarding passes ready to then be told over the speaker that we think the plane has been cancelled. we had to quickly run out to the departure check in grab our checked in bags off the carousel and attempt to be rebooked onto another flight. thankfully we were changed to a flight operated by qantas to perth via adelaide with an extra waiting time of 2 hours in melbourne airport. again things turned out well for us given you get ife on qantas flights and fooddrinks are included however this experience really does remind us that paying the extra cash for an airline virgin australia or qantas is much more reliable. im all for flying cheap airlines but this experience was a joke how can one airline have so many problems in four days not once did we receive a sincere apology from jetstar flight. jq 27 12 jan. very bad experience. never again. travelled with jetstar to phuket because they flew direct. they were not cheaper than other airlines available at the time just the flight times were good. everything on this flight came with an extra cost. food drinks entertainment and even a blanket for our daughter who was feeling cold came at an additional cost. i think jetstar have poor service and are a rip off. i will not fly again or recommend this airline to others. sydbne jq824. boarding at sydney was utter chaos since for some unknown reason we were using a tiger air gate far from the usual jetstar gates which had very little seating. the jetstar airport crew had absolutely no idea what was going on and made boarding announcements by shouting at us and ordering passengers around. the previous flight was late arriving and it was a nightmare trying to disembark and then board passengers in such a small space. the flight itself was okay but the amount of legroom was very limited making me uncomfortable. departed 35 minutes behind schedule and arrived 25 minutes late. as jetstar is a budget airline i was not expecting high standards however the quality was disappointing. next time i would be more than happy to spend a little extra to fly qantas or virgin. had the worst travel experience with jetstar. the trip over from brisbane to honolulu was ok but upon coming home i received an email at 11.42pm saying that our flight was delayed. after ringing them i was told that it would be leaving two days later at 12.45am. i was put up in the airport hotel and given usd 30.00 for meals. the following night i was given a note under my door saying to get to the airport at 12.00am so assumed again that our flight was delayed again. yes it was it wasnt leaving until 3.00am when ringing jetstar and going onto their website i was told that it was still leaving at 12.45am and again the website said that as well. many frustrated and angry customers we all proceeded to the airport. no one at jetstar knew what was going on and after waiting for over an hour a non jetstar customer service lady proceeded to tell us that it wasnt leaving until 3.00am. apart from her not one jetstar representative agent came to talk to anyone on the flight. where is the customer service sydney to honolulu business class on 10 february 2015. the moment i got into my seat i was taken down memory lane of the 1990s. the seat of jetstars business class was exactly the same seat taken when youre flying business class in the 1990s. the only thing that was added were the two inseat power points. makes me suspect that jetstarqantas cut corners by reusing the old business class seats from old airframes and installed them here. like the old business class seats the inflight entertainment ife is a very bulky ipad with equally bulky battery pack. the first meal dinner i was given a choice of two dishes. after dinner i ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milkcoffee. i ordered scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as scotch and soda. for breakfast i was given two choices take it or leave it. this is where jetstar cuts costs again. instead of hot meal youre given a bowl of cereals. the seats were hard and i didnt sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. personally i wouldnt recommend anyone to bother buying business class as it is really not worth it. i have flown business class cathay pacific and premium economy air new zealand and jetstars business class is below in standard compared to air new zealands premium economy. hawaiian airlines will start offering premium economy starting 15 march 2015 and i will be seriously considering this option. perth to singapore. nothing special but this what you expect flying with budget airliners. returning we were scheduled to fly from singapore to jetstar on the 2.20am flight. on arrival we saw that the flight was listed as cancelled. we proceeded to speak with ground staff who vehemently denied any knowledge of flight cancellation and to their understanding the flight was still scheduled for departure as planned. we proceeded to check in and entered the departure gates. 2 hours prior to departure announced that the boarding gate had been changed. we went to this new arbitrary gate number but there was no boarding or ground staff in the vicinity. we waited patiently for 1.5 hrs 20 minutes prior to scheduled departure another passenger arrived to inform us he had confirmation that the flight had been cancelled. we were left to seek out the jetstar information counter at which point the counter manned by 2 young and inexperienced staff members was swarmed by hundreds of passengers both from the cancelled flight as well as passengers from other flights seeking out their departure tickets. it was 2 hours before we were able to speak with a jetstar ground staff who informed us they would place us on the next available flight  which could possibly be the flight on the following day or even a few days down the road if a seat could not be secured. when asked about how passengers could go about making claims or trying to find alternative flights out of singapore jetstar staff could only offer a measly piece of photocopied information sheet explaining that the flight was cancelled and that should passengers choose to find their own alternative flight carrier that this would mean jetstar bears no responsibility in fully refunding claims. i booked a flight from bali to melbourne with a stopover at darwin. the return flight was delayed by 3 hours thus i would miss my connecting flight in darwin. at the airport they refused to tell me what replacement flight would be available. they gave me a number to call which was invalid. had to call the australian customer service and they kept insisting that i somehow get through immigration in 15 minutes to catch the connecting flight and they couldnt give me a replacement or to talk to the staff at the airport there is no jetstar staff at bali airport just some other company staff that issues the boarding passes. after all the trouble they put me on a flight to sydney which would connect to melbourne but i had to spend 9 hours at bali airport and miss work. if anyone wants to get anywhere on time and without any hassle then definitely avoid jetstar. we flew tulla to bali and return the new 787 is a nice aircraft seats were good. we paid a lot of money for these flights due to school holidays and easter 2487 for two adults. to say they give you nothing other than your seat is very true you pay for everything else a pillow and blanket is 10 i purchased meals online prior to trip which cost another 60 and for movies each way another 40. luggage took over 45 minutes to be unloaded when we returned to melb. would not fly with them again unless it was very cheap just like their service. cant believe qantas own this very budget airline. hate to say this but next time it will be with garuda who supply a full service. cheap and nasty sums up this airline. flew denpasar to adelaide and as soon as i joined the checkin lines i was glad id booked my return trip on virgin australia. queues at checkin were horrendous and the melbourne flight had been cancelled so many of that flights passengers were shifted onto the adelaide flight. on board people cant pay cash for food and drink which seems ridiculous especially if they aim to save time. i was sat in the middle of the plane and they took over an hour to reach me and by the time they got to me theyd run out. when i asked for a fourth beer they stopped serving me because id had enough which is ridiculous given a i was paying for it b even a teetotaler wouldnt get intoxicated on four small cans of beer and c their service had been lousy. if i go back to adelaide next year i think ill pay a premium to go with singapore airlines from surabaya where i live even if i do have to backtrack and add 2 hours onto my journey because one doesnt get all these annoyances on fullservice airlines that you get on these budget carriers. i flew from sydney to bali. the seats are uncomfortable the inflight entertainment screen was too close and of a poor selection the seating  leg room was uncomfortably small i am only 62 kgs and 1.67 tall . on flight back from bali to sydney the air con was blowing icy cold air onto my neck and when i requested a blanket i was told that i did not choose the pamper pack at 10 i did not want pampering but just protect myself from this cold blast. too much take and no give with this airline. the cabin crew were not accommodating at all. i do fly to bali once or twice a year and this was my first jetstar flight to that destination never again. they are ok for short flights within australia but do not have the class for passengers to endure a longer trip. i have just traveled jetstar return perth to cairns australia. even for a sometimes cheap airline the planes are made for cheap travel. the seats are very thin hard plastic uncomfortable extremely close together made for short trips within asia not the long legged australians. the magazine holder has been shifted to the top of the seat to allow closer seats so expect a knee in the back the whole trip. the service was on a par with the planes very poor even by qantas standards abrupt messy rushed food stale and poor quality. appalling. unreliable. outward flight delayed. plane not clean. rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at boarding gate. such late notice none received by sms left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. we were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. staff claimed captain had called in sick. surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. to cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. no apologies. not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. very bad pr. dont try to speak to senior management about your experience or have them contact you  jetstar claim they have no direct line. first and last time we travel with this airline. booked through qantas who code share. have travelled other qantas code share internationally on several occasions and never had an issue. jetstar is low budget low everything. never again never. jetstar star class is not worth it. flew to honolulu with jetstar for holidays the tickets were not cheap but i think it was more premium economy at business class prices. no priority boarding. no priority baggage first off and last to get baggage. the all thai cabin crew did not seem to have been well trained they were very friendly but the service was slow and haphazard. some meals came out fast others really slow to arrive dessert of ice cream was liquid when it finally arrived. food would be classed as average for economy on most airlines definately not what i would call business class. seats were not that comfortable and had lacked in legroom the seat in front hit my knees when reclined. inflight entertainment of ipad took an hour to come out after departure and there was no place to hang it it was in my lap while i ate meal over the top of it. not exactly classy. it was three times the price of an economy ticket and definitely not worth it. i am one very unhappy customer and will never fly jetstar again. flew sin to per last week. as it was an evening flight we checked the jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. on arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. the reason was fog over perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. we were each given meal vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. 7.15  not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. when we approached jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. we were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in changi airport watching time pass. when the flight eventually did depart after 4am following a long delay on the tarmac we were then brought the dinner meals that had been prepurchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening not being interested in eating dinner at 6.30am this was further money wasted. the small amount of money saved by booking this budget airline was not in the slightest bit worthwhile and i would never fly with jetstar again. i booked a return ticket from adelaide to sydney. flight delayed nine hours. check in took two hours and the staff were rude and unprofessional one was even eating lunch while checking people in. plane was not cleaned before departure  the dirtiest plane ive seen. then the flight attendant failed to notice that the pax in front of me had his seat reclined before departure was left there for take off and for landing. no apologies  nothing. never again. very disappointing. perth  singapore flt 4k132. departure times changed by jetstar multiple times due to bad weather. from original 10.40pm to 11.40pm to following morning 08.00am to 2pm. when at gate for the 2pm departure told flight cancelled due to crewing problems. taken on coach from international terminal to domestic terminal to reclaim baggage. after 2030 minutes waiting for baggage to arrive on carousel told to return for 2am flight or offered option to cancel. a terrible experience. 12 hour delay perth to singapore due to weather notified 24 hours before flight even left. all other airlines ran on time and reported no serious issues with weather. rang jetstar to ask for alternative flight after fighting the automated voice recognition system for 15 mins was forwarded to customer service. they gave us the run around and said something along the lines of cant control the weather and there may be more delays. a friend in singapore said rain no worse than usual this time of year. i think it has to do with old technology used on the airplanes so cannot navigate in rain or fog. booked jetstar 3 times and flight cancelled 2 times my flight was first being rescheduled to the later time of 4am. after checking the flight was cancelled and i was only informed via sms just 3 hours before departure. i was already on the way to airport and it was midnight. no more jetstar. flew hobart to melbourne then to phuket and back again in may 2015. never again will we use them. from check in to the cramped seating to the appalling lack of service from rude cabin staff is just plain terrible. there was no meal offered on the melbourne to phuket leg or on the return leg. this is just not good enough. we also found the dreamliner aircraft very noisy. never again. spent 13hrs at bali airport before being advised flight is cancelled. unable to find anyone to speak with from jetstar. finally get a flight 28hrs after original flight. advised by captain what had happened better late than never. hot beverages no they are cold beverages. look at the picture of the coffee on the menu as to what is actually served. flight crew some lessons in responsible serving of alcohol are needed. seat comfort my arm rest was taped up with duct tape. travelled may 7th honolulumelbourne jq2 in economy class. paid 700 for a one way ticket no food no entertainment no service basically. was seated on seat 41a armrest between seats was held together by sticky tape. seats were the most uncomfortable ive ever traveled on. cabin crew was on the verge of rude and indifferent. toilets very dirty. the flight was delayed by 3 hrs trying really hard to find a positive here but unfortunately nothing positive bout the whole experience. back to hawaiian airlines for sure about 6 years ago i swore never to fly on jetstar again unfortunately urgent circumstances required my family and i to fly from auckland to wellington nz. normally we would have taken an air new zealand flight but flights all full and we had a time dealing to get to wellington. cramped seating and sub standard service from start to finish pretty much sums up this awful excuse for an airline. qantas must be ashamed to have an association jetstar. we get to wellington and in a rush to make a function and in true jetstar form no bags arrive off the conveyor. after almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags several customers like myself started making approaches to jetstar. apparently the machine that unloads luggage from the plane is broken and they didnt have another. made worse because they were too cheap to hire one from air nz to get the plane unloaded. 50 minutes later customers were starting a small riot wanting to know what was going on. jetstar never made any pa announcements nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. they arent a cheap airline to fly on anyway. by the time you buy a ticket then a meal pay extra for a bag etc you could have purchased an economy ticket on another airline and had all the extras for free and excellent service. jetstar offer a very poor service even in their so called business class. the seating is cramped with the seat in front reclining right in your lap and the drinks service very poor with one glass of wine with your meal and thats it i was not offered a top up at all. inflight entertainment was poor with a selection of about 8 watchable movies and some tv shows overall the entertainment was very ordinary. i would not fly this airline again considering the poor service and seating. there are other choices on this route in business class for around the same price. firstly they did not serve drinks prior or even with the meal  this service took place after dinner. secondly they took so long to clear the dinner service that passengers were taking their trays to the galley themselves and stacking them in piles inflight entertainment is very expensive. seats very uncomfortable and did not recline back far enough to be comfortable and allow sleep. jq30 on 16th june was my first flight on the new dreamliner. in row 2 of business class i had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. there is an inherent design problem with jqs configuration row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts row 2 seats access and space. when the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. i reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of business class reclined to limited extent. this meant that i was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. the exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically if you are on the sunriseside of the craft you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that i ate in a space of less than 30cms. the food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 business class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front. i will not use this service to seasia again as economy with carriers like cathay is far more comfortable and better value. i know jetstar business class is not really business class but we have used it frequently to fly to thailand and singapore and when it was starclass it was good. this last trip will be my last i did not enjoy it at all. my husband and i did not sleep a wink as the seats were just too uncomfortable. i fail to see why we should pay the same price as row 1 passengers we were row 2 when we have nowhere near the amount of legroom as row 1. service was very average and i believe if you choose and pay for exit row seats with a premier airline in economy it may be cheaper and more pleasant. sad to see the service decline as it used to be a reasonable option. from now on its either true business class with a better airline or we just dont go   for a weekend trip from sydney to melbourne i had tried to use qantas group points and pay only to find lots of  block outs on sun afternoon. so ended up on qantas domestic on the way down and jetstar on the way back up. at the time of booking i was able to get seating for qf 443 so not jq 526. and no that q doesnt stand for quality more like questionable. called jq after being on the phone got seating i wanted. even got charged for it though i wasnt advised of this. although i have the qf app which after the flight showed jq526 i had to download the jq one as well for some reason. all the way tripit showed it as qf443  qf478 operated by jq jq526 ah well. it then changed from exit row to  4 rows to 1 row to ultimately another 11 rows and exit row. we got to the airport in time to get some dinner then realised bag drop only available 2 hours before flight and check in on the machine 3 hours before flight. it then asked if okay with exit row but still got shuffled around. though staff at the counter fixed it having seen some charge had been send through which amex showed as pending. still not sure why. flight was may be 34 full. last time i flew jq was probably a decade or so ago thanks for reminding me why even for short haul.    auckland to christchurch. before my trip i had purchased the particular seating both from and to auckland. and jetstar had sent me the confirmation of my seating after i had made the payment. when i got to the airport i found out that they just simply changed my seats both from and to auckland. i told them i had purchased the seat and had the confirmation for it. they didnt want to help at all.    bangkok to melbourne. this is a scam calling this service business class  it is nowhere near it not even premium economy. i have flown with jetstar on this route to and from bangkok numerous times since its inception but this is the last time ever. everything has gone down hill so much in the two years since i last did it. check in was a debacle at bangkok with economy passengers checking in at business desk whilst we waited but no economy check in agent called us up and economy passengers got priority  boarding is like a herd of cattle swarming and again no priority. i was most angered by the meal service which was very sparse linen napkins replaced with paper ones no second cup of tea just quickly swiped the tray away. breakfast was a piece of cake and margarine not even butter. really really disappointed and despite being a frequent and loyal customer i will not be back.    bali to melbourne. had two flights delayed. the first was for operational reasons  from looking into it i just think they were trying to squeeze in an extra flight we never got an explanation. we have two young children so the alternative flights they offered for the first delay didnt work. ended up canceling and re booking flights a few days later at a significant cost. the second flights also ended up being delayed by a day due to technical issues. i can understand that it happens sometimes and was ok with it. jetstar offered to pay for accommodation and a meal allowance for the 4 of us up to at total of of us 700. i have receipts etc but have so far been offered reimbursement of of us250. i emailed twice no response and spent about 7 hours on live chat getting nowhere and making me feel like i am the one in the wrong. this is only half of it but im not going to go on.     melbourne to sydney. i paid extra for extra leg room because i have a knee issue seats changed without notice only after complaining i got a 50 dollar voucher. next time tried to use said vouchers great they spelt my name wrong the voucher is unusable flight goes up in price more than the voucher is worth while it takes them a week to change the name.     denpasar to singapore. beautiful experience at this airport with staff. there were smiles and patient explanations given throughout. one of the ground staff at my flight had assisted in explaining why my odd shaped luggage was not suitable and needed to be checked in at the airline counter. feeling skeptical at that point and ready to lose that piece its a kite light and small but has poined ends and hence handcarry abroad was not allowed was pleasant to find luggage arriving in 1 piece. we did not purchase check in luggage space and hence was surprised by the additional service provided to check in our kite at no additional cost. a very big thank you to the ground staff who attended to us.     singapore to sydney. worst experience ever with customer service. they double charged me and didnt refund me even though i provided evidence. my flight also got cancelled from singapore to sydney. my husband daughter and i were meant to be on the next flight. waited 6 hours because they couldnt simply generate a boarding pass for my infant. i will never fly with them again.    phuket to melbourne. booked for 1020pm luckily i looked at my emails and saw it was not going till 3.30am. we had to book another hotel near the airport and because it wasnt delayed by 6 hours cant claim. they gave us a voucher to get something to eat at a burger place. no chips no coffee only nuggets and fish burger and the staff were very rude. we will never travel jetstar again. we paid top dollar for our trip dinners extra baggage etc. we had an awesome time in thailand but going home just spoiled our trip .     jetstar is the worst airline my partner and i have ever flown. the flights are delayed every single time we have flown. no food vouchers or any compensation were ever offered. their staff are rude and inconsiderate not to mention they know nothing to do with whats going on. they have never been helpful in any situation we have encountered with them which are many. we were moved to a separate flight on another occasion and had to talk to 4 people before they moved us back and when we questioned why we were moved in the first place they wouldnt answer and we are positive its because the flight was oversold. there are consistently issues with their flights and we will never be flying with them again.    flew melbourne to sydney. the jetstar airways is the worst airline that i have come across in last 15 years of regular flying experiences. their staff at checkin are not nice and are inconsiderate. the flights are almost always invariably delayed. the flights regularly get cancelled. the cabins can be untidy and are not clean.     sydney to auckland. terrible experience from beginning to end. the flight was cancelled while we were in the line to check in. we were offered an alternative flight with qantas however it was 7 hours later and we had commitments back in new zealand so asked if we could arrange a refund as we would have to purchase flights on another airline. the customer service manager agreed and said shed make notes in their system regarding the details. we purchased last minute flights on an alternative airline at horrendous expense being last minute and flew home. when i went to follow up the refund i was bounced around no less that five different people and pushed to online chats noone being able to assist and all saying that we had boarded the plane and taken the flight. no notes were ever put in the system and they had to launch an investigation. two weeks later they send me an email saying that as per their terms here was a voucher to the value of the flight. i replied saying that the customer service manager had agreed to refund the flight given the circumstances and received no reply. i resent the email a week later and also received no reply. every aspect of the dealing was absolutely horrendous and took a lot of self focus to breath through it and not react in an angry fashion. at least writing this review has given a means to express my dissatisfaction and let it go.    denpasar to sydney. absolute worst experience ive had in 20 years of flying. jetstar promised to compensate my friend and i for a mishap they made and then ignored our calls and emails when it came time for payment. im totally disgusted at how they treat customers and would always recommend travelling with another airline.   sydney to honolulu. worst airline in the world. had ordered meals and paid for meals which they did not have on board when we flew. the so called customer care person emailed to apologise and provided vouchers which are not transferable have to be used in six months and have a host of other conditions which makes them very hard to use. also he has failed to respond to any emails we have sent. the complaint was taken by the stewardess onboard so they just sent an email with excuses and then sent these worthless vouchers and ignored all other correspondence. jetstar are quick to take your money for pillows meals entertainment etc but do everything to ensure they dont give you a refund in cash. they send these highly conditioned vouchers which clearly you will have little chance of using so they dont provide the service and then also keep your money dont fly with jetstar.    ho chi minh to melbourne. tried to upgrade my seat from economy to business. upgrading via the site gave me errors. called the phone numbers on their app 2 in vietnam both wrong numbers. found the correct numbers eventually  phone went to the hold music and hung up after 10 mina twice. went to the airport early to upgrade jetstar staff told me to wait for check in to open and do it at the counter. went to counter and they said i had to do it before check in opened and its too late now  and it was the same guy that told me to wait. the kicker though he grinned at me. crew on board just chatted to each other and were barely seen. in addition 5 flights with jetstar equals 33 emails 4 flight changes 17 smss different contact number for each email emails to check in for flights they cancelled.   jetstar website said if they have changed their confirmed delay time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes they dont notify us unnecessarily of a potential flight delay that can be brought back on to schedule or does not eventuate.\\xa0they have failed their guarantee. the flight arrival time was changed without any notification. if i didnt go online to check. i wont know. they change the arrival time but not departure time. i feel like i got tricked. i was planning to catch another connection flight but i couldnt make it. it is meant to depart at 7am but till 7am we are not even boarding. if jetstar notified us earlier we could have got another flight. they are so unfriendly too. i called the hotline and they said i can move to an earlier but when i arrived they said it is full. also the airport staff is very rude and unfriendly. i feel like treated second class just because i am flying economy. the flight attendants are the worst. please never ever ever fly with them. totally disappointed. everyone is waiting at the gate but there is no staff around trying to help us out.    flew brisbane to sydney. worst flight attendants on my flight. checking in and boarding was fine but the flight was terrible i had a crying 1 year old who just cried nonstop being her ears were sore not once did any of the 4 flight attendants come to see if she was alright. i was blocked in my seat so i couldnt stand with her and not once did any of them come to see if she was okay or if she needed anything. they would just walk past everytime. they looked miserable and so untidy they basically looked like they had just woken up. i am so dissappointed all other airlines i have travelled offer the most amazing help and support. i will never ever travel with jetstar again.    melbourne to sydney. i have been flying for business for 5 years no problems but today jetstar charged 60 dollars for my bag weighing 9 kilos. change of clothes computer and a toothbrush. that is utterly ridiculous as it is well undersized and fits in the overhead locker easily.     terrible airline flew queenstown to bali via sydney. will never fly with them again of course its a budget airline and i understand that but seriously its a joke. we purchased luggage for 35kg then when we arrived and tried to check in they tell us 32kg is the max nowhere does it say it can be in up to 10 bags they weigh your carryons to the t. 7kg and no more. so here we are at the check in counter being pregnant trying to put on layers and layers of clothes which we are just going to take off after security and put right back in the bag so whats the difference. ive never had an airline weigh and criticize our carry on luggage. we still ended up having to pay another 100 dollars for another checked bag at the counter. first she said it would be 75 dollars then when we are abour to pay tells us oh its 100 dollars because you have another stop. so we ended up paying an extra 250 for nothing. we could have just booked qantas for cheaper have our bags included no hassle with carry on weight a meal included and complimentary alcoholic beverages included. worst experience with jetstar. would not recommend.    brisbane to sydney. unhelpful rude and didnt care about me making my international flight in sydney. would not recommend to anyone. the worst flying experience ive ever had. i would recommend flying any other airline besides this one.   i would not book with jetstar airways again and would not recommend it to anyone. my flight from auckland to palmerston north was cancelled a few hours before i was due to depart. i have since learned that this is a common occurrence with this airline. we were offered other flights the following day but believe that at least one of these flights was also cancelled thankfully we did not take the chance of finding out and booked with another airline. during our flight we heard stories from other passengers of repeated cancellations   booking online was simple as was the self check in and bag drop. however the departure gate was right at the far end of the terminal. it took ages to get to and it included various flights of stairs. once there there wasnt anywhere near enough seating made available to sit and wait before boarding. this was made worse by very weak airconditioning. this is despite the airline requesting all passengers be there not less than 30 minutes before boarding time. it was a tiny plane. i was unable to move whilst in my seat and due to lack of space only got to make use of 1 of the 2 armrests. cabin was dirty all over. as was the magazine which had all the puzzles filled in by previous passengers. my ticket said i was to get a 10 meal voucher but this never occurred. the menu was pretty awful anyway and staff service nonexistent. it was a very boring flight even despite its brevity as there was no inflight entertainment. at least my bag came out very quickly the other end. in summary the best parts were start and finish but very poor in the middle.    sydney to cairns. a while back i was involved in a car accident and approximately a third of my body was burnt. i now wear compression garments which act to compress the skin. i go to the gym and weight train approximately 4 to 5 times a week and regularly go jogging and hiking. over christmas i flew from sydney to cairns with jetstar. i booked an exit seat as i am 6 foot 2 and i like the leg space. on arriving i was told i was not allowed to sit in the exit as i was not physically capable of doing anything. after trying to explain that i had no issues at all and the garments were only for burn compression i was moved to another seat and told to contact jetstar if i wanted a refund. if that was not enough of an insult i boarded the plane to find that my seat and the other exit seats were filled with people who i highly doubt were able to physically help anyone. i was obviously discriminated against purely on my appearance and at no time did they consider my situation.   my flight to brisbane was cancelled due to weather i had a flight to mackay the following morning departing at 8.55 am. they were not able to connect me with another flight. after being on the phone and waiting in line for over an hour all they would offer me was a jetstar voucher stating they could not give a monetary refund. my wife spoke to them and informed them the reason for my trip was to visit my terminally ill father they requested a hospital statement before they would issue a refund. they also offered me a voucher for the flight i would miss tomorrow. i then had to pay 400 for a flight with another airline. i will never fly with jetstar again. they are callous uncaring and unprofessional.    bali to cairns. i understand its a lowcost airline but their excess wait for baggage fees are excessive i had to pay 100 each way to have five extra kilograms and then on the return trip had to pay an extra hundred dollars for excess carryon luggage that had to be checked. it wasnt so cheap one that was all over with. if i ever fly this way again i doubt i would use jetstar.    sydney to denpasar. the crew seemed very disengaged smiled on entry then never again. meals were tiny for a premium price. rubbish from meals was not removed until just before landing. drinks coffee etc. came around around 1 hr into the flight then not again unless you paged the stewards. no offer of water for the flight unless you called the stewards. they seemed uninterested in the passengers hiding in the middle end prep areas. seats were cramped and flight full. return to sydney was worse. all water was confiscated prior to boarding. again flight crew seemed disinterested in the passengers and meals were as above. no water unless asked for. unfortunate as all water taken before boarding by bali inspection of bags at the loading gate.  the crew seemed unhappy or dissatisfied and gave the bare minimum of service. again not happy with having to pay for everything including old tv shows and music. ill never travel jetstar again on any flight over 1hr.    gold coast to auckland. probably the worst flying experience in 50 years of travelling staff rude and arrogant paid extra  for luggage to be told as i was slightly over there would be a 225 excess charge and not to try to swap goods from suitcase to hand luggage to swap weight as hand luggage would be weighed at boarding and if heavier would be confiscated  paid extra for front row extra legroom that wasnt in system.     sydney to honolulu. they charged me 300 to take my carryon claiming it was too big. i saw others that went through with similar sized but they said they had to be backpack sized. if too heavy u kinda understand but not for 300  to top it off the agent was rude and i heard other agents complaining about customers that had questions. my flight was bout 9 hrs long and all i got was half a cup of water offered to me. everything else i had to pay for.  none of their movies music or games were free either. so in the end the flight cost wasnt cheap at all. for 8 a movie i could buy the dvds to keep never flying with them again and i advise to pay a little extra for better services and meals on flights.    melbourne to brisbane. i paid for 20kg checked luggage. i only used 9kg. 11kg under weight. my carry on bag was about 1kg over the allowed 7kg the work laptop does it every time jetstar charged me an extra 60 for the privilege of carring kgs i has already paid for. i fly fortnightly. frequently with jetstar. i wont be flying with them again.   flew jetstar airways from phnom penh to singapore. does not allow carry on the same size as every other airline doesnt inform you when you book the ticket then charges a fee almost as much as the original ticket price to bring carry on luggage. i realize this is how budget airlines make their money but their carry on policies should remain in line with industry standards or be presented honestly. dont fly this airline.    adelaide to darwin. literally the worst airline ever dont expect to travel on the flight you booked with jetstar. constantly changing times and destinations with no options except accept or receive credit. if you buy a travel voucher make sure you make it known to the staff. they will not always offer you anything.    sapporo to tokyo narita. you might think you are saving a few bucks upfront but in the end you will pay out the nose. the bag drop line took over one hour. the flight was delayed one hour because they didnt get the baggage count right. we missed our bus transfer and had to buy new tickets. not that big of a deal. then on our way home from sapporo to tokyo we checked in waited a few hours only to find out that our flights were cancelled and wed be missing our connection to canada. we scrambled to find a different airline but are now paying 3x more for flights early morning taxis train tickets that arent being used and extra baggage fees. i will never recommend them to anyone. the airplane itself was fine. at least you have that going for yourselves.    sydney to gold coast. i got to admit jetstar has raised the bar. this is my second flight with them this year and everything went smoothly. i checked in online and getting through security was a breeze. boarding was controlled with great to see a lcc getting this done correctly. once onboard i found the cabin crew a unenthusiastic as it was very routine with the attitude of get it done and over with. the captain made one announcement and did not even mention flight times. again passengers seated in emergency exits were not iritirated with safety procedures. overall the flight was great but they need to refine their customer engagement.   booked to fly napier to auckland. i am not one to write a review but jetstar has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. i even went through the effort of reading other reviews and it would seem most others are on the same page as i am. i dont write a story of my experience with jetstar i will compile the issues i had into bullet points. jetstar iphone application doesnt notify of any errors with checking in online. jetstar staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. they overbook flights to which they try make you feel responsible for. seeking renumeration on a jetstar fault seems like an extremely difficult task. if you are in nz a want to fly somewhere use air new zealand. they were kind friendly and more then happy to help after jetstar left us stranded.    \\r\\r\\nsingapore to sydney via cairns. worst airline ever. removed foam from seats so you can feel knees of passenger behind you in your spine. they make you pour out or throw out water bottles at gate then they charge for water on flight. if you go over 7kg baggage allowance by a small amount they wont let you take out a jacket to wearreduce weight 60 fee. do not fly.    melbourne to sydney. ive been flying around the world for years used more than 30 different airlines.  today when flying jetstar as a flexbiz traveller their highest traveling class for domestic flights i was choked by the unpleasant behaviour from the checkin staff. when calling for a supervisor shes telling me that she is the one. to the point is that on my booking confirmation it says hand luggage is maximum 14 kg for business travellers. my two bags combine a weight of 14.1 kg. now the staff tell me maximum for domestic business is 10kg says nothing about that in the email confirmation. i tell her about the email and she acts cocky like im lying. now when showing her she claims that thats only valid for international travel. then i ask how i could possibly know that when it says 14kg on my domestic confirmation. her answer is that everything is clear. we were already paying for 60kg checkin luggage for two people. they had us reorganize our packing over 4kg claiming its for security reasons. then what they are saying is that its more secure with 14 kg on international flights and that most airlines in the world flying a320s isnt safe enough as they are not applying these ridiculous rules. now the fact that the so called supervisor refused to give me her full name says a lot.    sydney to melbourne. jetstar staff need to learn what customer service is they do not know how to welcome their customers speak or address no hi how are you may i help you sorry the flights been delayed move here put your bag here pay here terrible monotone announcements customers or even hold a conversation very rude in approaching customers even though we are all waiting back an hour for their delayed plane. not worth saving the extra 50 to go budget airline. to top it off just tried contacting them direct to provide feedback and was cut off by the customer service person who diverted me to an online survey instead.    our flight from townsville to sydney was delayed twice due to engine problem on 14th feb causing us to miss our connecting flights to hawaii. we are trying to make a claim through travel insurance. this process is very difficult to get information on the flight.   jetstar business class is equivalent to premium economy on a fullservice airline at best and even then struggles to achieve the same standard as qf prem y for example. on this flight from sydney to denpasar food offerings were meagre and among the worst airline meals ive had in over 30 years of frequent flying. service was poor e.g. items not cleared in a timely manner i ended taking my items to the galley myself and saw other pax doing likewise. ife selection is also paltry. and not that anyone else probably cares but the classical music audio selection should be renamed easy listening. my dessert choice was unavailable as well a firstworld problem i know. but when paying a2400 for a max bundle fare one might be excused for expecting better. no priority tagging of luggage is on offer so i also endured 40 minute wait for bag at dps and also on return to syd. basically one of the worst if not the worst valueformoney trips ive ever taken. only positives were that flight was uneventful and ontime.   flew singapore to ho chi minh. would never recommend jetstar to another person. its not good when you loathe an airline before you even board the flight. when the check out page says xx you hit confirm and then you get a receipt saying you were just charged xx20 with no explanation it shows the company has no values and keeps fees hidden until you cannot back out. many other airlines out there i recommend always choosing another.   flew melbourne to sydney with jetstar airways. worst experience ever they are definetely not a flexible airline got charged 25 for an extra kilo. also got told by the crew that the plane was 40 min delayed. later on they announced that they over sold the tickets on purpose to that trip and its first time in a while everyone turned up so they were trying to offer a voucher to 2 people willing to travel later in the day. ripoff. this company is not a lot cheaper than others that will offer way better conditions to flight. not worth the stress   honeymoon trip flight to rarotonga was substandard. no water we had requested but they seem to have forgotten and we werent that thirsty anyway to follow up flight attendants only chatting amongst themselves and you feel rude interrupting them. the plane was too cold and had been told that they dont offer blankets. if you want really bad service definitely fly with jetstar. cancelled return flight leaving us stranded at the airport. our return flight back to auckland from rarotonga had been cancelled and jetstar gave us the wrong information for our recovery flight leading us to miss it completely. they have taken no accountability for this lack of communication that shouldnt be an issue in the first place for any reputable airlines or business and have never apologised for their error. there was a group of 3040 of us who missed our flights because we werent given the correct info. who is running this this whole ordeal has been very frustrating and stressful and have received no sufficient help or support from jetstar throughout this whole process. we will never fly with jetstar again and will strongly advise our network or friends and family to do the same. the cheap prices are really not worth the stress that comes with travelling with jetstar.    denpasar to melbourne. when boarding our flight we found that the seat extra legroom were not available. we advised the crew that the seats we had booked and paid for 6 months ago were not the seats we had been allocated. after a lot of running around we were told that the flight had been oversold and that we had two options. get off this flight and try to find our own flight with extra leg room seats. sit in the seats we have been allocated not extra leg room okay so you will hold this plane while our luggage is unloaded. no was the answer. just take your seats you are holding this flight up. we sat in the seats allocated not the seats paid for. we were told that we would be contacted by someone from customer services within 24 hrs. no that didnt happen. we spoke to jess via a chat nothing they can do we took a trip out to the airport today to jetstar customer service and spoke to a very abrupt man who told us there was nothing he could do. no one can help no communication with jetstar for a complaint just speak to a computer chat line. whilst on the flight we were ignored by the staff and not even offered a cup of coffee. we book the extra leg room seats for a reason why not contact us before boarding and offer another flight if they had oversold them. i cant believe that business can treat customers like this it is an disgrace.    flew christchurch to sydney. really really cramped this is a new low even for jetstar economy. you have to sit up completely straight to avoid knocking your knees on the seat in front. food tray hits your stomach and i am average weight. hello jetstar im not a sardine dont bother thinking you might get a cup of tea 4.00 for a cup of hot water and a tea bag just low.   flew adelaide to sydney. i understand that jetstar is a budget airline and that the best quality of customer service flight comfort and safety cant be expected. however its extremely unreasonable to do carry on baggage weight checks at the gate and not at the checkin outside of security and then require passengers to pay 60 dollars to check in a bag. had we been given this option we would have put more weight into our actual checked luggage that still has extra room in it. had we been given fair notice of this then we could have easily gone back out of security and added more to our checked bag. the staff at the gate were extremely rude and not willing to explain why we couldnt just add our bag to our checked bag weight allowance or why the bags that people were being forced to check in were all the charged the same price when they were all different sizes and weights. we had a customer service agent rudely address us and i boarded the plane feeling id been robbed. i know that this wont change any of jetstars backward policies but i hope that in the future jetstar is more prudent about how it goes about monitoring the weight going onto the plane. dont use these methods to try and squeeze more money out of your passengers—its wrong.    melbourne to brisbane. worse airline cheap for a reason. bad customer service they just treat you like a number. they change flights charge you 60 if your carryon bag is over by just a little bit they make you walk to the plane from the gate even when if its raining bad they just do whatever they want and their planes are small and uncomfortable   jetstar max bundle is a complete rip off and simply awful much better to fly economy on a premium carrier like thai airways instead for around the same price. jetstar is not a good airline at the best of times. i wouldnt fly jetstar but when i need extra baggage allowance 40 kgs as i sometimes have to travel with a lot of technical equipment for work it has been a good option in the past. but jetstar gets worse and worse as an airline year after year. i got the max bundle as i thought it would make the flight more comfortable and would reduce the cost of adding 40kgs anyhow. neither was true. i did not get my upfront seat selection the upfront area of the aircraft for max bundle is behind a whole section of economy class seats that werent even available as an up front option with the max bundle. so the whole upfront seat selection is a lie. what else do you get with the max bundle. one really small bad meal. apparently a voucher to use on another jetstar flight if you cancel. i didnt need to but i can imagine the process is at least as awful as the rest of the booking process. what you dont get with the max bundle a blanket or anything to make the flight more comfortable. inflight entertainment. all that costs a lot more. you also dont get the seat you book. it also took 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive at the carousel from this jetstar flight. conclusion dont buy the max bundle on jetstar fly economy on a premium carrier like thai for approximately the same price.    honolulu to bali via sydney. after being told several time we are leaving in an hour they then at 10 am cancelled the flight and told us to come back same time the next day. we did and it happened all over again. we were told to come back at 10 pm that day to leave. this puts us now delayed 75 hours and on top of that we have to get new connection flight from syd to dps putting us at the sydney airport for 12 more hours. i will never fly jetstar or qantas again. jetstar is owed by qantas and qantas had 30 open seats but they said we had to by a new ticket with them and did not offer a discount at all. no help what so ever. talking about horrible customer service.    i was flying melbourne to gold coast to join a friend so we can fly to thailand the day after and have flown by jetstar many times knowing that it is common practice to get some extra baggage and pay for it in advance and did so this time as you can see.. as i was dropped to airport early had to wait to check my small luggage 2 hours before no problem so far. i am walking up and down and up again where you check in and one lady there maybe security asked if i was ok i explained that i am waiting to check my bag in she convinced me that as i have paid for extra baggage i can do it immediately. so i did as to carry it on board which by the way was not my proffered choice carrying bag with me. so this is where the problem begins i was told that i had to pay extra 60 dollars  obviously i was not happy tried to explain the situation to no avail what really upset me here the two female staff were so rude never even wanting to listen. i wish someone in  jetstar will understand this and review your standards and procedures. i flew back to melbourne with another airline and may never return to jetstar the way i feel now.   so we had a death in the family recently and in the last 3 days have had to use jetstar 4 times for the newcastle  gold coast leg. 3 out of 4 ran late 2 of them significantly late. im on the 4pm flight right now its 6.40pm and we just had an announcement of a further 20 min delay. we might be taking off soon. tonight i must admit i was at the end of my tether and i took them to task during boarding. they threatened to remove me from the flight and the girl was very aggressive about it. i gather this is their system for controlling unhappy customers and it worked. i had to back down quickly or risk being stranded far from home with a child. disgusted and shaken. its the 235 if you want to see your employee in action jetstar. or is this your system    melbourne to sydney. my mum and i were booked on a 315 pm flight when we received notification that our flight was cancelled. after contacting jetstar  the cancellation was apparently due to bad weather. our travel agent booked us on a 615 flight in replacement. having already booked and paid for transport to the airport for a set time we went in and decided to just wait the additional time. not only were there several flights with other airlines virgin qantas & tiger all leaving at 3pm  going to sydney they didnt seem to be affected by this bad weather  the bad weather that was non existent  but they were all running on time and had no issues flying out. after checking out bags in  we were informed that the flight was delayed. after a day full of screw ups from jetstar arriving home at 10pm  with work the next day its safe to say we are both unimpressed.    gold coast to melbourne. this airline knows nothing about customer experience. they weight your luggage at the gate and with only being one kilo over i was made to pay an additional 60 to check my bag. considering my actual check luggage was 6kg under it would be best practice customer service to check in the system and include it in that. i will never be flying jetstar again.    will never fly jetstar again flights were changed werent notified we were flying from perth to thailand with a stop over in singapore on way. the flight time was changed we were not notified. our flight was changed till midnight next night from perth to sydney 4hr flight than had wait 8hrs in sydney than a 9 hr flight to thailand. absolute joke worst experience we have had.    paid for the package including hold baggage a meal on the flight and the preselected seats. we selected the meal online but on the flight we were given a different meal and told this is the meal you selected all passengers with that package get the same meal. i didnt even try the provided sandwich. i knew i wouldnt like it and it looked terrible. another in our party tried it and said it was awful. also tried to upgrade baggage beforehand but the site wouldnt accept either of my bank cards. i believe it was because i was on mobile but they told me their site works on mobile and it was a problem with my card. two cards failed to work and one notifies me if the payment is declined so i know there was no problem on my side. luckily i left the option on as unpaid so wasnt charged extra at the airport. they didnt tell me this was an option while i was on the live chat with them though. an on the subject of the live chat anything typed into the box even if you dont press send is sent to the agent. they only record messages which are sent which can mean accidental pastes are sent perhaps a password for example and they have no record that their employee received it. also if you want a copy of everything said in the chat you have to speak to a different team. this is basic functionality available in most live chat services. i contacted them with a complaint. the first response was just excuses and the offer of a voucher which can only be used by me and expires in 6 months. i live in the uk so completely useless. i contacted them again and they said they had forward some of my comments on to the development team around the live chat but nothing was said about the meal or voucher. the only positive things i can think of is the we made it to our destination and the ground staff at sydney were helpful.    i have flown jetstar domestically with usual delay issues but this was my first international flight with them. on may 31st usa time our flight from honolulusydney at 830am was cancelled. we have been at the airport since 530am at first they said theres technical issues & flight will be delayed by 1 hour then they turned around and said its cancelled next flight will be the next morning. after waiting several hrs we were given an 8 voucher for snacks at the airport 8 can barely buy you a snack but had to wait couple of hrs at baggage claim for our bags. then they announced our flight will be at 1145pm that day. there was no speaker system everyone had to ask others what they are announcing as we couldnt hear a thing. they told us they are organising us hotels & shuttle buses. there were hundreds of us waiting outside for the shuttle. i decided to uber it to the airport which was just down the road could have walked there only to arrive and be told we have to wait til 3pm for checkin. finally when we got our rooms could only have a few hrs rest before getting a shuttle to another hotel where we got a voucher or dinner. but on arrival there was a long queue of people waiting in line as if we are not exhausted & over waiting. i left and decided to make my own way to the airport. after checkin & waiting at the gate it was 1130pm and boarding hadnt commenced for a 1145pm flight. by 1230am we were ready and started leaving then the plane stopped for a while & they announced we have to return as there is another technical difficulty which was another 1 hr delay. youd expect after a cancelled flight& wasting our whole friday that jetstar would have had all day to do their checks & ensure there are no technical difficulties & plane is 100 safe and functional. terrible customer service & poor communication. not even a courtesy meal or drinks on flight to apologise.    my wife is going brisbane to melbourne for a funeral. gets to the boarding gate an hour early and jetstar staff are weighing everyones luggage. my wifes carry on was a kilo or two over limit because she didnt read the fine print and didnt realise that a handbag was included.  happy to pay a little extra for the couple of kilos overweight. however 60.00 or couldnt board flight. thats nearly the cost of an entire ticket come on jetstar im sure some of the people behind her in line would have weighed 30kg more than her. utter joke made a stressful time for her even more stressful not to mention embarrassing. will never fly with them again or recommend to anyone.    flew from kuala lumpur to taipei. arrived at the airport 2 hours before the flight and hard the announcement that we had to proceed to a checkin counter immediately. walked to the counter but no one was there and the closed sign was up. when the attendant finally appeared i asked what the urgency was or if the flight time had been changed. this was out of curiosity as both our flight to and from bali the previous week had been delayed. the attendant immediately gave a very curt reply your checkin time closes at 9.00 and if youre late we cannot be responsible. there was no need for such rudeness. i then pointed out that passengers should not be summoned to a counter simply to find it closed. her reply was well we cant satisfy everyone. ironically it was all for nothing as i am now sitting at the gate 40 minutes past the stated boarding time and there is no movement. undoubtedly it will be our third air asia flight in 10 days to be delayed. i should also add that even when some of the reviews mention the delightful array of food on offer there is almost certainly no chance that you will get your choice if you havent preorder.\\r\\r\\n   my mother and i were really excited to be flying with airasia x as it was considered the best low cost airline. however our flight from the beginning until the end was a disappointing experience. to begin with the ground staff didnt even greet us with a smile as if she was mad whilst doing her job. then we realised our seats werent together so we asked and she rudely told us that we had to pay extra to be seated next to each other we dont mind paying the extra fee by the way. but we wouldve appreciated it more if we were told about it nicely. then the whole entire flight not a single smile on the faces of the crews. one crew member whilst doing the safety procedures sighed and made an eye roll. thankfully the person sitting beside my mother was really nice and was helping her out throughout the flight but overall we were really disappointed with their service and we have experienced better service at other low cost airlines.    xian to kuala lumpur. it was an overnight 5 hr flight and we purchased premium flatbed class. the tickets included meals as a separate line item. we checked in online but were told to check in again in the airport. the checkin counter for premium class was very slow. once in the aircraft we had one bottle of water each next to our seats and nothing else was offered.  in flight service in general was nonexistent. flatbeds were great. it was first experience when the airline neglected to provide part of the service. most likely we would never fly airasia x again and wouldnt recommend it.    perth to siem reap return via kuala lumpur. i always fly with ear plugs in my ears and i recommend anyone who doesnt have hearing loss to consider purchase these before flying with them. there are nonprerecorded announcements occuring approximately every 45 minutes on a typical 5.5 hour flight. the volume of the announcements is set to a level that is painful and wakes you from your sleep even if you have hearing protection. the food is not bad and they run on time. but please just turn the volume down dim the lights more and prerecord your messages so we can actually enjoy travelling on you more often.    tokyo to denpasar bali. the worst flight weve ever had. we are on our honeymoon and had to pay the equivalent of 100 for each bag two 8kg backpacking bags. when we sat on the plane we were not together. the plane was almost empty  we asked to switch and they hesitated and then told us a specific area we could sit in. why wouldnt the check in counter seat us together we had prebooked our seats but that didnt matter. no water or tea service is served free. we bought one small meal and couldnt afford anything else. the toilet was out of soap and paper towel. honestly all of that would have been fine if it wasnt for the 200 charge for bags and not being able to get free water.   beijing to melbourne via kuala lumpur. will avoid this airline like a plague in the future. i lately thought it was ok to fly with airasia and quickly realised it was not the case. the phone customer service was friendly but the ground and inflight staff have horrible attitudes. just because you are budget airline you are not being paid to be rude and treat customers like low class citizens. my stupidity led me to fly long haul where i was assigned a seat right at the back of the plane. for 100200 i should have chosen another airlines. lesson learned the hard way.    osaka to honolulu. flight was so full some of the attendant is rushed impatient and surly while it was fun chatting beside galley while it last. the prebooked meal for bento was delicious but selection choice should be more varied. the cabin is hot mostly.    honolulu to osaka. when booking i paid for 2 checked bags at 30 dollars a piece not bad. when returning we had extra bags which needed to be checked but we had not prepaid for this. at the airport they demanded a counter fee for checking in at 123 dollars a piece this is extortion. 4 times the price because you did not check a box online it was not just me that dealt with this as no less than 10 passengers around us were irate with the same issue.     gold coast to kuala lumpur. no inflight entertainment. seats are rock hard and sit too upright. absolutely freezing so make sure you bring a coat as they charge you for a blanket. they entice you into a flight with great prices to realise they charge extra for everything a full service airline give you as standard. flew return perkul. terrible service dirty planes and smaller seats compared to other airlines using same a330. kul to per. staff as we were leaving to go up the steps to board the aircraft were all checking their phones staff just seem to be getting slacker and slacker. the flight was a shambles service was so slow getting the meals out that we were too tired and just wanted to sleep. cabin was boiling hot just absolutely stifling. everything about air asia is going downhill i have been flying with them for years with 10 flights a year and it is getting worse. now that malaysia airlines are dropping their prices i am switching to them. the worst flight experience i have encountered despite the fact that the staff and the planes were pristine. my family of 5 traveled from bangkok to christchurch nz. we changed flights at the kl lcct. only 1 xray machine so it took over 30 minutes queuing to get into the lcct. the whole place was grubby. it is essentially a cargo warehouse and passengers were treated like cargo. we had preordered meals hot seats blankets dvd players on each of the 4 legs of the trip. when my niece could not eat the food she asked for hot water to add to thai cup noodles she had bought along just in case. they refused to give her hot water because they had their own chinese style noodles even though she was prepared to pay for the water. i asked for the preordered dvd player there were none in the seats and was told i dont know if we have any and had to ask for it a third time before i got it. the return legs were equally appalling in terms of safety and the lcct was just as bad in the daytime 17 days later on our return. we didnt actually get hot seats until the last leg kl to bangkok and then a thai stewardess asked my daughter how old she was  15 years 11 months and said we would have to move as these were exit seats and we had to be at least 16 . ive outlined some highlights here but there were too many other niggling matters that made the flights really horrible. in case you wondered we otherwise had a fantastic holiday in new zealand. flight ak 1967 6th september 2013 seat 21d krabi to kuala lumpur. most unpleasant and unhappy flight attendants i have flown with. seat extremely cramped. movement between arrivaldeparture lounges and plane very poorly organised. my wife and i in separate rows despite checking in together i would be extremely reluctant to fly air asia again. airasia is a disgrace. flying from kuala lumpur we were not told that we could not take water on board after the normal security section so we had our water removed and as we had spent our last few ringits on it had no money to buy more on the plane. for a seven hour journey to perth the staff were rude when i asked for tiny sips of water  they would only give me water from the kettle and about only about an inch of it each time i wanted some. i get that it is a budget airline and that extras have to be paid for but to deny someone water when they have no money left and were not made aware that what they bought was not to be allowed this is a disgrace. we were delayed in denpasar and couldnt get out connecting flight to australia  air asia knew this but instead of organising it early they kept us waiting at the airport for 5 hours whilst they organised a bus and hotel. mcdonalds and a bottle of water was offered as dinner  bad luck if you are vegetarian or do not eat fast food the hotel was grotty and all 24 of the stranded air asia customers left and paid for a hotel for the next night will not take air asia again. after being hounded by optiontown i finally accepted the premium upgrade option. two days before departure i received an email notification that my upgrade had been approved and the booking had been changed in the air asia system and i should report to the premium check in counter at kullcct to check in. as requested in the email i took a copy of the notification of the upgrade as instructed in the email for the air asia staff to see. when i stepped up to the premium counter for recheck in the staff said that i had not been upgraded and refused to look at the written copy of the confirmation that i was carrying and made me stand in line and wait 3.5 hours to check in. they repeatedly said they had to wait until 90 minutes prior to boarding to get the confirmation from optiontown when the optiontown staff were sitting not more than 15 feet behind them at the adjacent counter. finally after refusing to go away the air asia girl conveniently found my upgrade in her system. i will never use this service again. trip satisfaction not satisfied at all. value for money not worth the money. seat comfort not comfortable at all as the seat was too small. staff service two of the staff were rude. food and beverages reasonable and affordable but didnt meet my expectation. inflight entertainment this is really bad as the staff requested to return the tablet to them an hour before landing. this review is for the flight taken from kuala lumpur to adelaide on 9th february 2014. 26 august. flight d7317 beijing to kuala lumpur then d7182 kuala lumpur to colombo. the counter staff were efficient and onboard staff spent most of their time sleeping or doing their own thing but the baggage staff were the worst i have experienced in 10 months travelling around asia. they do not explain anything and basically treat you with contempt if you have an issue. the food was mediocre at best and while a cheap flight it was outweighed by the expenses associated with their poor baggage handling and attitude towards explanations and customer service. next time i think i will pay the extra and fly with a better quality airline. budget doesnt mean rude and incompetent. will never fly air asia again. premium seats from australia to kl and kl to bangkok thailand were how can i say pathetic the 1st leg of the flight australia to kl was in the premium flatbed seats which were quite comfy but the service on board was woeful some of the attendants treated us as an annoyance or inconvenience rather than a customer we had to ask 3 times to get the entertainment tablets samsung they were not handed to us automatically even though we prebooked and we got a no answer as to if they were coming after asking for them hence asking 3 times. the flight attendants just left us alone the whole flight never checking if we needed anything or asking if we were ok or needed anything ie drink etc this was very poor customer service indeed. the food was rubbish the selection of movies and tv shows on the tablets was just dismal only a very small amount of movies or tv to choose from very disappointing indeed. now after paying 4000 premium seating to fly you would expect that the 2 hour kl to bangkok leg would be in a comfy seat as well well no is the short answer they use a jet that has no premium seating the seats are tiny i was in agony for 2 hours being crammed into the tiny space they call premium seating on the klbangkok leg just a complete waste of money. outward november 7 d7246 from kl to adelaide. return nov 17 d7247 from adelaide to kl. the difference between lowcost and fullservice airlines is in the was they handle failure. for aax the way they handle it is  badly. both our outward and return flights cancelled and rebooked  we were advised this my sms at 22.45 on a friday night it took 4 calls at my own expense to fix it. one of the premium flatbeds had no power to it so not even the 2 inches of recline you get in economy. staff said they would fix it  but didnt  nor did they have the courtesy to tell us it wasnt going to be fixed  they simply disappeared off and forgot about us. this was booked as premium flatbed it wasnt an optiontown upgrade. we were asked about this several times so i guess if it had been ot they would have cared even less. our optiontown for the return flight was not transferred to the rebooked flight. ot has confirmed the refund but it shows the lack of interest of aax in customer service  naturally when i mentioned this on checkin and asked about ot upgrades they told me the best they could do was to sell me a businessclass ticket at full cost. the 5 people i dealt with at klia2 their hub airport went out of their way to be difficult avoid giving answers avoid assisting arguing why things couldnt be done to avoid actually doing a d** thing and since they all gave conflicting statements i spent two hours arguing with people between flights and left none the wiser. i have to say the flights were on time and the premium seats that did work were very good but the hassle that accompanied the trip at all stages and the unprofessional and disinterested attitude of the staff in person on the phone and through their eforms makes me think it just isnt worth it. for the hnd to kul route in september 2014. weve also taken this exact flightroute before. good value i.e. it was cheap. otherwise counter service in japan was horrifically slow more than an hour resulting in a hurried rush through security and immigration to make the plan which is parked at the very most remote gate at the terminal. this was the case as well on the earlier flight. for a longhaul overnight economy seats are just not comfortable enough to sleep. fortunately in both flights we had an extra seat in our row. there seating is 333 for an a330 which is one extra seat more than other airlines. back is very noisy but they do have a quiet area up front of the cabin for a few extra rinngit. i was one of the unfortunate ones whose flights to and from adelaide were cancelled. had proper consideration and care been given to customers and appropriate alternate arrangements been made i would have had no cause for complaint. however this was not the case. the rerouting process was a nightmare. only my partner was rerouted to melbourne for our return flight while i had to resubmit the request after a few days. upon checking in at melbourne airport we were advised that our kl to penang sector was on different flights and were told to go to the transfer desk at klia2. first their customer service centre denied receiving my emails even though i was showing them to the lady at the transfer counter. then after a few enquiries they said they had not changed my kl penang flight because the earlier flight i had requested had only one remaining space left which my partner was transferred into. they apparently did not think it was important to notify us of this to allow sufficient time to make other arrangements. i was told that my flight was full too so he couldnt come on mine on boarding i noticed an empty spot right next to me and another one across the aisle. we arrived in penang 2.5 hours apart. not only did i have to pay an additional 300aud per person for my trip it took me more than twice the length of time it usually takes me on mas. flights were on time and thankfully we reached penang safely. but service was non existent. hoping the return journey will be less distressing. a very poor experience with airasia x as this airline is apparently severely let down by their ground operations. im 6 foot 7 and require extra leg room to safely make it to the other side. with airasia x this requires me to spend some money on an extra leg room seat such is their business model. i have no issues with this and thus spent an extra 100 or so in total but during check in my extra leg room seat was not available. turns out that you lose your seat preference when you reschedule your booking online which i did. the online system doesnt notify you of this. if you make a phone call and change your flight dates that way they will actually transfer the seat preference to the new booking but do it online and youll lose it. this seems like a flaw in their operations. ground staff offered me an emergency exit row to compensate but this was a middle seat and not in the quiet zone which i had booked. a little annoyed because i wasnt getting what i paid for but at least i had the required extra leg room. when entering the flight 8 hours kliamel i was astonished to find out that they had in actual fact given me a middle seat in a normal row and it came down to the cabin crew who were excellent to sort it out short notice. in the end i got the bulkhead seat in the quiet zone which i had selected. i think ground staff might have been looking at a different seat map altogether. all in all a poor experience. kixkulkix. booked in jan 2014. in dec 2014 airasia cancelled our return flight for commercial reasons strange jan 4th is possibly the busiest day of the year for travel in japan. we had to come back 2.5 days earlier losing our preferred seat in the process. both flights on time. boarding in kul chaotic  one man checking boarding passes manually at gate p5  causing queue of passengers in corridor just to get into the waiting area near the gate. food poor i think it has got worse announcements far too loud and frequent. immigration in kl klia2 pretty quick baggage claim a bit slow. i flew to melbourne from bali with air asia indonesia x on 21 march 2015. this price included 20 kg of checked in luggage a meal and a small bottle of water. aa ground staff and software need to be improved. when i boarded the plane i found a man sitting in my seat. i showed him my boarding pass and he showed me that he also had a boarding pass for the same seat i waved to the flight attendant and she came over and told me to wait. after five minutes she returned with a passenger list and sent the man to another seat. there is no entertainment available on an air asia indonesia x airbus a330 plane. seat width and legroom are also tight. as the flight was only one third full many passengers were able to sleep spread out over three seats. the air asia indonesia x plane left on time and arrived punctually in melbourne. overall i prefer to fly in a jetstar boeing dreamliner rather than an asia indonesia x airbus a330. flew airasia x in march from auckland via gold coast to kuala lumpur in economy with confirmed optiontown 3 seats. worth the extra nz65 to get a whole row to myself. also went with the flexible ticket which gave me premium check in at auckland. on the return i flew bali to sydney in premium flatbed which was not flat and i found myself slipping down so my feet supported my body. quite comfortable nevertheless. overall i got what i paid for although despite having a prebooked meal on the akl to ool sector it wasnt available and i had to have something else  not best pleased with the alternative offered. ground services in akl and in dps were both good with friendly check in.    i was on airasia x flight from seoul to kuala lumpur. the flight duration was 6 hours plus and the cabin was warm. i was seated at quiet zone window seat 8k and had to endure the warmth. informed the air stewardess to check the air conditioner and she replied would check with captain but she never returned nor the condition had improved.  the seat and leg room are narrow and designed not for comfort. food quality dropped too. the pak nasser nasi lemak is not fresh and tasted salty.  not happy with this flight. sydney to phnom penh via kuala lumpur. we had flown airasia x in the past with no issues but this time we had problems from day one. airasia x had changed our flight without communicating it to us. they had changed it as the second leg of the flight was cancelled. if they had spoken to us we would have taken the normal flight and the later flight out of kl the next day. we already had accommodation book. by airasia changing the flight we would had reached our destination a day late to meet our itinerary. it is now 40 days since we lodged a refund  complaint without any feedback. how can a business run like this.    vancouver to san francisco. several online reviews advised to avoid westjet if you ever want to see my bags again. i should have heeded the warning as i arrived in san francisco while my bags stayed in vancouver. the baggage attendant waited at the counter as passengers watched the empty belt go around even though he was fully aware they wouldnt appear. why not tell us then a lengthy process to complete paperwork yielded vague promises that wed get our bags on the next flight out. that turned out to be the next evening and when i called i was told i would get the bag between 5 pm and 11 pm or the next day. oh and the 100 dollar incidental expense they wrote on the paper they issue forget about ever seeing it as it only covers expenses documented by an itemized receipt of course they dont tell you this when they promise it. the entire westjet experience was horrible and ill never fly this airline again.    toronto to montreal. i almost always use air canada to fly montreal toronto round trip but occasionally i am forced to book on westjet if its a last minute booking. almost every time they cancel the flight at the last minute. this happened again today at 2pm they emailed me that my 5pm flight was cancelled and i would be changed to the 8pm. they say it is out of their control that air traffic control decided that there were too many flights for the number of runways suddenly and that they had to cancel the flight. the westjet gate for flights to montreal is literally as far as possible from the main terminal it is the last gate about 1 km from the terminal and once they cancel your flight you have to walk all the way back to the terminal to get customer service even if you use the internet to agree to the flight change. they cant email you the boarding pass nope. then another kilometre back to the gate. to pass the 3 hours in this hinterland at the end of the airport they have a few vending machines and a tiny tim hortons. forget getting a proper meal or a glass of wine. westjet is the worst. because being changed to the 8pm flight made it so that it would have been faster for me to drive from destination than to fly there was nothing good about it. re the food small made good balls of granola better than acs pretzels. i normally do not complain about airlines and their service however after flying westjet service vancouver to lihue return i feel compelled to express my opinion on the cabin crew of both legs. front end crew had poor attitudes on both flights. on the 1st leg the cabin steward was extremely grumpy with any guests that stood on his carpeted area at the front of the cabin while being next in line for the bathroom which would force these people into the other peoples sitting area. this happened numerous times throughout the flight. when the front end cabin crew exchanged areas with the rear crew briefly this was not an issue. although having paid extra money for 4 to be seated in the plus section both directions there was apparently only one blanket on the plane and it had just been handed out to row 8. im sure it wouldnt break the bank for westjet to ensure that there is always enough blankets on the plane for people seated in plus. when my husband asked for a glass of wine the 1st only 3 hours into the flight he was told that the alcohol cutoff time was 230 am. how convenient it was 230 am perhaps it was an inconvenience for us to interrupt her knitting. having flown many airlines internationally we have never heard of such an alcohol policy. please inform me if this does exist. will i fly westjet again  yes but only on regional flights. however never again on a flight over 2 hours and never will i pay for a plus seating again. its not worth  for bad attitudes poor service and amenities. westjet plus seating is not worth the price. we flew from calgary to abbotsford last week. my wifes first experience in plus seating. her points are very valid. seats too small not like air canada who have spacious seats. take out the ridiculous middle seat and put in wider seats where you can comfortably sit together. i have to agree the seat upgrade is not worth the price. the menu is. i had much higher expectations of this upgrade concept to compete with air canada. westjet doesnt get it yet as a business traveller flying once a week across canada and the usa i will choose air canada.  very disappointing flight. the crew was unprofessional failing to provide even one uninterrupted announcement due to constant giggling and side discussions during the announcements. flight arrived early in calgary but remained on the tarmac awaiting a clear airbridge. the plane is still waiting some 20 minutes later as i write this.  will be avoiding this airline in the future unless i see some kind of action to improve their service. the plane had no entertainment system. after a three day business trip to phoenix i flew roundtrip with westjest. i sat in the row 4 just behind premium economy class. i was not aware that little dogs with there owners could fly in the cabin. there were two dogs on the flight and one dog would not stop barking. not one of the staff would say anything to this lady whose dog would randomly bark every 45  90 seconds. i got up after 30 minutes to complain as if this was a human causing a disturbance on a plane the staff would have no problem telling them to be quiet. however i was told to make a complaint with westjet. nice work i will not fly with westjet again  they are always late or oversold. we were 1 hour late on the way there and 45 minutes late back. not one apology. complete lack of communication by westjet employees. calgary to las vegas via edmonton and the flight left yyc 2 hours late meaning it would be a tight squeeze for all 10 individuals getting on the plane from yeg to las. i asked the flight attendant on the yyc to yeg flight if they would be able to contact yeg and ask for the flight to vegas to be held 5 minutes so we could all get there. she told me it was out of her control and not possible. i was informed that the exact opposite was the truth upon arriving at the gate in where the vegas plane was to leave from. long story short we got burned and lost our money on hotel and show tickets as well as never getting to vegas. this flight attendant and the individuals in calgary who never bothered to phone and let the yeg staff know the plane was still on its way single handedly ruined 10 peoples vacations. i dont care how cheap their fares are i would rather pay double and fly with another airline who can manage to be on time and actually employs people who want to do their job properly. this review concerns westjets rather confusing awards program. when making the reservation for my wife i used my westjet id. unlike virtually all other airlines with westjet one does not points but rather westjet dollars. while this appears to be similar to the airmiles program it is not. therefore while i used my westjet id to make the booking online and pay for the airfare i was never aware of the nature of the program. i used my westjet id because my wife does not have one. it was only when i contacted westjet after this was not credited to my account that i found out about this. when i did the westjet representatives were not helpful at all. the various service ratings i have made are based on my wifes experience on her flight.    we flew westjet for a holiday to antigua from toronto at the end of february and returned yesterday. on the flight going down we were amazed and how rude and abrasive the supervising flight attendant was. she snapped at us if for example we were in her way on our way to the lavatory barking out commands with no finesse. when my husband stretched his feet out to rest against the partition as everybody does she barked get your feet down.  we were in plus seats so were offered the boxed lunch at no extra fee. however the food was inedible. the food and snacks on this flight offer little nutritional value as well as being devoid of taste. there are no glutenfree or vegan options. the seat comfort was at a minimum even in plus because the middle seat which could have offered a little more wiggle room is blocked off with a ridiculous hard table which cannot be removed. on our flight home we encountered unpleasant flight attendants who did not offer a good service. the entertainment is a joke compared with airlines offering seatback screens and features like the flight tracker feature. run of the mill experience code share with qantas  sydney  los angeles  calgary in economy with final leg with westjet. havent flown or heard of westjet previous to this trip. short international flight lacalgary on 737 aircraft not full with a number of vacant seats. slightly late departure at la  unsure of reason possibly just heavy traffic. uneventful smooth trip over 3 hours more like a domestic flight in australia with basic plane no on board entertainment very limited service  drinksjuice no food offered. considering this is an international flight ive had food service in europe for  1 12hr flights. crew were polite and friendly enough. overall  okay experience with not too many negatives  although would not like to travel much further with this aircraft. seatentertainment lacking. would use again for short haul flights. westjet are out of their depth on this route. this isnt flying a 737 from calgary to edmonton. this is a much bigger undertaking and they havent invested in the equipment or staff to be succesful. my flight to london was delayed 90 minutes and the return from london was delayed 3 hours. from what i understand they have not had a single flight on time since they started the service. essentially our flight was cancelled and we were placed on another aircraft omni international  which was a very old aircraft used primarily as a us troop carrier. there was no information from anyone about this prior to the event so we could make alternative arrangements. different seat numbers and no entertainment. absolutely no information from any of the staff. despite all this they still wanted 5.99 for a blanket and money for meals. what was particularly galling was to watch the westjet crew who were also going back on this flight get free meals and the pilots took all the extra leg room seats while families were split up across the aircraft. really absolutely no notion of customer care or concern. avoid using this flight at all costs. if you fly with westjet to london you are basically soft in the head. stick with airlines like air canada and ba who know what they are doing.     london to edmonton was delayed by 5 hours due to the flight had not arrived from edmonton. there was no one at the wetjet information center at gatwick airport for quite some time  finally a lady came for 10 min and disappeared agan. after a lot of calls she came out again for another 15 min to give out food coupons. edmonton to london flight was cancelled and they put us on another airline omni international  which was a very old flight with different seat numbers and no entertainment. i got assigned a seat in front of the toilet. avoid using this flight at all costs. pay a bit more and fly other airlines.  victoria to ottawa with westjet. baggage policies these days are bad but westjet has taken it to a new level. besides having to pay for my first checked bag i needed to pay an additional 100 2575 for a second oversized bag. taking into account this will also be required on the return flight westjet value is far below that of competitors. on top of the exorbitant price the baggage drop employee did not know the dimensions of an oversized bag or how to measure it. last time flying westjet.    a terrible experience all around with westjet to gatwick and will fly air canada next time as it provides more gratis services and more reliable entertainment that works for the whole flight. for our flight there we had no entertainment and the flight home it was off and on. as far as food goes we each paid 15 for a preorder meal and the portions in comparison the the free ones air canada or lufthansa serves. it also came to us 4 hrs into our overnight flight when at that point we just wanted to sleep. the overhead lights were off for maybe an hour so sleeping on the overnight flight was practically impossible anyway. flight attendants barely came around with water on the flight there and everybody was so parched people were asking for two glasses unsure of when the next time they would come by. you have to pay for your first checked bag even though it is an international flight which makes boarding a nightmare for all of the oversized carry ons. the booze is not free on this international flight so dont even think youll get relief from that.     gatwick to prince george via vancouver. i was excited about the new westjet gatwick service but this was such a disappointment. aside from being in an old airplane with poor legroom and no inflight entertainment this was the most disorganized flight i have been on. we were over an hour late leaving gatwick with no explanation. the holding area after our boarding passes got checked was too small for the amount of people waiting in there and the way they chose to board the plane was nonsensical as you couldnt get through all the people crammed into the tiny area. once we did get on the airplane it became even more disorganized. there wasnt a set meal time for our paid meals from a cart  no menus in the seat back pockets either so that was inconvenient and a waste of time as they had to hand each person a menu once the cart reached them and wait for them to make a selection people were reclined while others were eating taking up what little space you get and ive never seen more people stand up to use the washroom while the flight attendants were in the aisle. i recommend that you bring your own food on board they sell food on the flight but it was not good bring your own pillow  blanket not offered and charge your devices and make sure you have an additional power source. i dont know why they expect you to watch content on your own device yet fail to provide usb ports or charging outlets. download moviestv shows before the flight in case the westjet app fails and stops working for you like it did for me.  i had to run through the vancouver airport to make my connecting westjet flight. wen i expressed concern over my baggage making my connecting flight to the gate agent she spoke to me in the most condecending way. this airline is well liked in canada but i wont be using it again.     flew from winnipeg to london gatwick. very disappointed after a very good outbound flight albeit leaving gatwick 2 hours late to find out at the bag drop that our return flight was being operated by omni air international that westjet had chartered as the scheduled aircraft needed maintenance. this was not communicated to us in advance. although the cabin crew were friendly and the meal we had preordered arrived as planned it was a very old aircraft with limited inflight entertainment and slow service  im not sure everyone was offered a complimentary teacoffee or soft drink only those who had preordered or purchased food on board. even with the lowcost budget airline annoyance factor of having to pay extra for everything these new routes from gatwick could be a real winner for them but from reading other reviews it seems they really seem to be struggling to get flights away on time having to substitute aircraft after only a month of operation and its not taking much for the whole experience to fall apart. london gatwick to maui via vancouver  my first and last experience with westjet. delayed at gatwick for 2 hours and no reason given. then 2 hours sat on the tarmac while fixing a mechanical problem. you have to buy food on board. arrival into vancouver late due to delays bags missing and consequently missed our connecting flight. lack of information as what to do next. stranded in departures eventually located westjet agent and had to stay the night in vancouver then fly early morning to seattle to finally get a connecting flight to maui with alaska airlines. we have now missed the first day of holiday. bags found 2 days later thanks to alaska but we had to chase them by keeping going back to the airport. never were we contacted by westjet. flight home was also cancelled from vancouver  again no explanation from westjet. 5 hour delay before getting on a ba flight landing into heathrow when we had started our journey from gatwick. again no customer service. be warned do not fly with westjet unless you like to spend long hours in the airport and you are not that worried about getting to your destination. ground service appalling. flew on westjet flight 1508 calgary  san francisco on 872016. first the airline was delayed by 3 hours 30 minutes because the earlier victoriacalgary flight was delayed for an unknown reason. meanwhile the app claimed the flight was on time and the staff attempted to hide the delay for a while. things didnt get better when we boarded. i couldnt sit with my 4year old daughter son or wife as you have to pay to choose your seat. seat width was small and entertainment required you to download an app on your phone. however the wifi at the airport was barely working see my review of the airport. food didnt taste good and finally the flight attendants treated us as if we were stupid and gave my son an awkward feeling multiple times on the flight. never flying with westjet again.   westjet were terribly late both on the flight from toronto to new york  over 3 hrs late and coming back from new york to toronto over 1.5 hrs late and counting. lost me as a customer would rather pay extra  for a punctual flight. my time is worth more than westjet values it at.    westjet flights out of gatwick seem to be plagued by delays so expect an average of 45 minutes on to of your scheduled flight time. we arrived into vancouver two hours late which is pretty poor for a long haul route. once in the air dont expect decent service. expect two hours for drinks. strangely food is served before drinks. on our outbound flight the chief attendant seemed more interested in showing off his comedy than providing good service. otherwise the cabin crew are generally pleasant if not that experienced yet with long haul. the 767s are looking very tired. cabin staff are resorting to duct tape to apply on the fly fixes. the engines are loud and newer planes really put these old beasts to shame. maintenance was cited as the cause of our outbound delays. seats are reasonable in economy and legroom seems fairly standard. the inflight entertainment is okay so long as you prepare in advance by owning a pad and downloading the westjet app. reasonable selection of films. some problems with connectivity. best to also pack a good book or magazine. in terms of price these tickets are around 300 lower than ba in summer. add on the poorly advertised additional charges and this brings you to a 150200 saving. westjet is the ryanair of canada.\\r\\r\\n i just returned home from london gatwick airport to phoenix on westjet airlines.  this was by far the worst trip of my life. we purchased our tickets through expedia 1964.00 plus bag and seat fees and our original itinerary we were to leave phoenix on august 3 at 120pm for calgary. about a week ahead of our scheduled departure expedia called us and told us our flight had been canceled. they informed us we were on an earlier flight to toronto at 715 am. this meant we needed to leave our house at 4am in the morning to get to phx in order to check in on time. we asked what other options we had and they said we can give you a refund for that part of the ticket. we made the decision to take the 715am flight. we get to toronto and find out we have a 7 hour layover. what do you do in an airport on a seven hour layover westjet did not even offer us a meal voucher. not much better on the return flight. 5 hours on the return flight. i have read some of the reviews on line and have decided i had the wrong airline to travel to europe on. i know that this will fall on deaf ears and there is no recourse for me but i do have one thing that i can do.    worst airline i have ever flown.  where do i start first of all we receive a schedule change one week before we are due to fly saying that our flight has been pushed back a whole day. upon ringing up and explaining that we had to land in the uk on the exact date we specified for visa reasons westjet then magically appeared to find a place for us on our original connecting flight to winnepeg why did it change in the first place. then upon turning up to toronto airport nice and early we then discover after going through the security that our connecting flight to winnepeg had simply been cancelled. how can they just cancel a whole flight 2 hours before leaving i dont know. upon talking to the customer services team we were then placed on the next flight to winnepeg an hour later. this flight would still get us on time to our connecting london flight they assured us and our baggage had been transferred to the new flight. new flight is delayed for over an hour because they only have one pilot. we are now stressing out as it becomes clear that we may not catch our flight to london. throughout this process the staff were not very helpful and considerate. after running from the landing gate in winnepeg to the gate for our london flight we then discovered that this flight had been delayed for over an hour so we managed to catch the flight. no announcement was made in the airplane on the way to winnipeg of course so we were stressing out we were going to miss our flight. on the flight to london it was obvious that the flight attendants were not happy to be there. one of the female attendants seemed offended that i dare ask for a drink. and of course just to top it off after arriving in london our luggage is missing after being reassured that it is all done electronically these days sir so it will definitely arrive in london with you. 3 days later after a lot of phone calls we manage to get our bags back however i am still in the process of trying to claim for the incidental items we had to buy whilst waiting for our bags. i would not recommend anyone to fly with westjet as they seem to cancel flights on a whim and do not care at all about their customers. new york to ottawa via toronto with westjet. this airline inconveniences its customers by cancelling flights to benefit its operating costs. i have booked 4 flights within the last 2 months only to receive a cancellation notice within hours not days of the flight time. they claim that the cancellation is because of congested air traffic at laguardia airport but the delays at toronto pearson airport. if you book a flight and cancel they keep your money but the consumer is not entitled to the same treatment when they cancel  you get 6 westjet credit. i am thoroughly disgusted with this airline and encourage all travelers to schedule your flights with another airline of better repute. our flight from toronto to london gatwick was cancelled due to maintenance issues. now we will miss our connecting flight which happened to be through another airline and subsequently cant be altered by westjet. the next available flight is over 24 hours from our original departure. we got a 15 meal voucher. totally worth wasting the other 450 there seems to be no urgency in replacing our flight as we cant even call to check our replacement flight for another 12 hours. thanks a lot westjet.    flew westjet from london gatwick to winnipeg. flying often with real airlines like singapore korean qatar etc. really makes me appreciate how hard done by canadians are for travel choices not only is the cost unjustifiably high the service is laughable. my last trip was ok for what i paid but the whole experience was frustrating dealing with arrogant flight attendants whose sole purpose was to make you pay for everything endless announcements for petty issues such as a flight attendant telling us her life story during the announcements. instead of providing service there are pathetic jokes to ease frustrated passengers annoyed with the overall experience. every time there was a time change in the schedule as little as 15 mins i was made to call the call centre in canada from the uk. i have never heard of this they said they needed my confirmation for 15 mins schedule change really this happened 5 times. it was during one of these calls that i heard the news that i had to pay for a checked bag on an overseas flight. good for decent legroom if you get the better seats surprise to be paid for bring food as the paid for one looked disgusting and small portions. was nice to have a direct service to winnipeg and not have to go through the whole toronto or montreal connection procedure. if the price was right i would do it again otherwise go with a real airline. flew from toronto to st. johns. i just want to say that the entertainment system being restricted to people with special apps loaded to personal electronic devices is completely unfair to people who do not have electronic devices. i have a blackberry and travel with my laptop but i will not rake around in my carryon and pull these devices out to use for watching movies on westjets entertainment system. i find travelling awkward and uncomfortable enough. why does westjet think that offloading the entertainment function onto passengers wedged into cramped seats is a good idea i like to have something to drink on a flight theres no room on that little table for my laptop assuming i would be foolish enough to get it out of my carryon in the overhead storage bin and inconvenience everyone around me while i do it. i dont want to watch a movie on a blackberry. i want to watch a movie on a screen in the back of the seat in front of me. i protest this completely stupid new entertainment system of westjets on behalf of everyone who does not have an electronic device or who like me doesnt want to take up the slack for westjets cutbacks in services to passengers by being personally inconvenienced by it. im going to avoid westjet whenever possible in future. ive also been surprised by westjets unfriendly and unhelpful staff as well. there was a flight attendant on the ottawa to st. johns leg of my trip who was very charming and entertaining. but he was the only one.    victoria to toronto via calgary. a horrible trip. westjet requires passengers to provide their own tablets and devices so that they can connect to the new westjet inflight connect system. however on the calgary to toronto leg a 4 hour trip the aircraft was not fitted with the connect system and hence no inflight entertainment was available. westjet tried to make this up by charging passengers 7 to each passenger to rent tablets. if westjet is having problems with installing westjet connect to its passengers these tablets should be provided for free to passengers. no complimentary meals as to be expected on westjet flights  but there wasnt even meals available for purchase on the flights. seats were extremely tight and uncomfortable. i would avoid westjet if i could. toronto to calgary. i bought a plus fare seat. my flight was at 7pm. arrived at airport early and asked to change my flight to an early flight. no problem moved me to a plus seat on a flight 3 hours earlier. hooray even though they charged me another fifty bucks to change my flight i was happy. get to get gate and go to board  sorry miss you were given a seat that was already bought and paid for. you have to sit on economy and no you dont get refunded. westjet airlines ate 150 dollars of my hard earned money.    my flight from london gatwick to toronto was cancelled and it was not announced on the website. queued for two hours to find out what happened and only was told the next indirect flight to toronto was on the next day over 24 hours. managed to get a seat to take the flight to edmonton on the same day and then edmonton to toronto. when staff offered this alternative to me she had no idea how long each leg would take. the flight from london to edmonton was delayed from 11am to 2.30pm had to wait in the aircraft for 1.5 hours and was not told what was happening. due to delay i only had less than an hour to connect my flight to toronto and the staff were not helpful at all. asked for my compensation and was only given an email to contact. a completely frustrating experience. arrived at airport to find out flight cancelled until the next day at 9.45 am. woke up at 5.00 am to arrive at airport at 6.00 to be told the flight was delayed until 2.45 pm. westjet paid for hotel for the night plus provided vouchers for meals and future westjet flight however that does not make up for extended stay when we need to be returning home for responsibilities there. not to mention the anxiety produced by continuous reports of mechanical issues in these planes. this is apparently an ongoing issue and i can only imagine a very expensive one for westjet. it is unfortunate as ive always held the company in high esteem but this has completely soured my opinion. hoping our flight actually does leave today and we arrive in toronto without any incidents. toronto to london gatwick with westjet. another london gatwick victim here. booked on the promise of a low budget fare to london 249. to my disgust the flight was cancelled only 45 minutes before we were to board. they claimed maintenance issues but when i called westjet corporate the excuse given was storms over the atlantic i.e. we received conflicting stories. the gate crew was unbelievably rude  would not believe me that i flew in from atlanta and had to provide my atlyyz boarding pass to get a westjet voucher for a local roach motel that i did not even use. also was told incorrect carousel where to retrieve checked bags  told carousel 1 then carousel 3 then carousel 1 then 3 then 1. all in all this experience was a disaster. if its too good to be true then it is. currently in a yyz terminal waiting on a 1500 air canada flight i had to book for the day after the westjet disaster. i would never use this airline again under any circumstance. toronto to london gatwick. horrific experience sat writing this review in an airport hotel after westjet airlines decided to cancel our flight back home less than an hour before takeoff. absolutely no help from ground staff to arrange anything. had to organise a hotel ourselves and not told how to receive compensation for it. just called the helpline and was told there was a 40 minute waiting time to talk to someone. when finally got through we were told the flight had been rescheduled for sunday 48 hours after original departure time which means i miss work on monday. what the hell is going on westjet airlines     london gatwick to calgary via toronto pearson. left on the tarmac for 2 hours while they fixed a broken indicator and refuelled forcing people to miss connections. the flight attendants shows little regard for how this impacted passengers. they acted like this sort of thing happens all of the time. took us 10 hours to get to toronto and offered no food. i purchased the most terrible ravioli ive had. the westjet connect is a joke. it crashed constantly and the flight attendants had the nerve to blame the passengers for too many people using it at once. i couldnt believe i was flying westjet. the least they could have done was given us a free croissant sandwich so we didnt starve. we barely made the connection even though we were on the same plane but were again delayed leaving from toronto for 45 minutes due to a power surge. guess i dont have a choice in choosing a carrier. at least i know to avoid the westjet credit card at all costs.    an absolutely horrendous experience. we attempted to fly from montreal to london on 30th sept and arrived back in gatwick on 3rd october after a 47 hour delay in toronto. we flew from montreal to toronto without any issues. just as we were about to board the connection in toronto we noticed from the boards that the plane had been cancelled no announcement was made. the westjet staff told us there would be a flight the next day that we needed to call them at 8am the next morning to book onto it and that wed be in a hotel overnight. we called the next morning and were told the earliest flight back was at 8pm the following day and that we could stay in the hotel for another night. except westjet hadnt told the hotel and we were told by the hotel to check out before magically having the stay extended after wed packed our bags. we noticed there was as a departure leaving later in the day so asked to be booked onto it. we went to the airport the flight was delayed for 2 hours and then it was cancelled again. we queued for 2 hours to collect our bags and get a hotel voucher and were booked onto another flight leaving the next evening. we spent another night in another airport hotel and went back to the airport the next evening. we made it to gatwick two days late. upon return to the uk we contacted westjet support regarding a letter to our insurance company and were told we would have a 57 day wait for a letter. we also submitted a complaint with our meal receipts which westjet said they would reimburse and were told we would definitely receive a reply within 10 days. day 13 and still nothing. absolutely dreadful.   round trip from calgary to san francisco on westjet. first flight was delayed for an hour and second flight for 2.5 hours. seats are narrow but with good legroom. flight attendants were unprofessional seemed to be unprepared and made a lot of mistakes in pa. the airline changed the aircraft type on both trips that had no inflight entertainment. power outlets were not working and there were no cupholders for the seat. avoid flying westjet if able. nov. 20th kelowna calgary to cabo seat 19. meal service one attendant coming towards us one way the other attendant coming towards us the other way. 19c was served and then us who were in 19a and b were told the other attendant would get to us in a few minutes she still had two rows to complete before us. by the time we were served last on the flight there was no selection left only the croissant was available. this was the worst service that we have experienced with westjet. on the way home i booked plus seats at least you get served and are given a choice of food.    winnipeg to vancouver. my carryon luggage with the items i wanted to keep with me were forced into checkin because the flight was overbooked. both ways. the cabin staff were unapologetic about it and didnt ask if there was anything i needed in my carryon before taking it away. its extremely inconvenient to plan your luggage to have certain items with you on board e.g. laptop work other items to pass the time medication etc. only to have them taken away at the last minute. apparently this has become an issue since westjet started charging for all checked pieces  they havent properly planned how to handle the increase in unchecked baggage. generally just not a great service experience.    we flew with westjet from calgary to toronto and then toronto to london gatwick on separate days. weve regretted flying with westjet. we had to pay for almost everything internet inflight entertaintment and the food. the food was a simple snack toronto to gatwick and no main meal provided. if you wanted you could prepurchase these. weve bought food from the supermarkt or tim hortens for much less during both flights. we were glad the tickets prices were very low. seats are not comfortable for a flight of more than 6 hours. also no blanket or pillow provided.\\r\\r\\n    edmonton to orlando via toronto. eight of us were booked to fly on christmas day to orlando for a cruise departing on december 26. at 6am christmas day i received notice the flight was cancelled. we were later told it was due to insufficient numbers of staff. we immediately called westjet and went to the airport. we were on hold for over two hours and stood in line the same amount of time. while in line we were told we were scheduled to depart on the next available flight on december 27th thereby missing the cruise and there was nothing more they would do. when we said we intended to make it to toronto on our own dime to made the connection to orlando we were told that those seats were no longer available as they had already began reselling that leg of our trip. we did make the cruise but no thanks to westjet. in short we chartered a private plane from edmonton to calgary booked air canada tickets calgary to toronto and booked an expedia package from toronto to montreal via westjet to atlanta to orlando. we made the cruise at a cost of 25000 for the 8 of us. westjet gave me a travel credit for original 645 plane fare per person. so at least we are only out 20000 due to a cancelled flight for insufficient staff. never again.   westjet cancelled our flight from los angeles to toronto with no reason given while all other airlines depart. we had to wait for another 4 hours to reschedule our flight to another day plus another 2 hours for our luggage to be picked up. no voucher for lunch  dinner. no voucher for taxi fares. no accomodation facility. nothing except irresponsibility. never fly with westjet.    i booked the westjet airlines flight from yyc to yzn for my family of 5. the flight was at 9.55pm after we got on board i noticed the flight was half empty then after 20 minutes the captain announced that the flight is cancelled due to icy conditions at our destination of yellowknife. when we got to yellowknife the next day we asked the taxi driver they told us everything was normal and that there were plane landing up to 2 hours before our flights scheduled landing time. overall i feel that westjet was using the weather as excuse so they could save the flight cost for a half empty plane.    kelowna to brandon via calgary. i was flying home over the holidays. my connecting flight was cancelled due to a storm. i was aware of the storm and checked the website before leaving at 4 in the morning for the airport. both flights were still scheduled. after taking a 60 cab ride and passing through checkin and security i received an email via phone that my connecting flight was indeed cancelled. this was 10 min before boarding my first flight and 4 hours before the scheduled connecting flight. i was given the option of returning to my hotel or getting on the flight. this would mean another 120 in cab fare plus the hotel and i wasnt even sure there would be a room as this was over the christmas holidays. i chose to get on the flight which was boarding already and figure it out in calgary. i went directly to customer care upon arrival and my pleas for assistance were met with theres nothing we can do and thats not our policy.  i spoke with five different westjet customer service employees during my 28 hours in the airport and their response was virtually identical. there was nothing they could do. the employees of calgary airport were far more helpful despite the fact that they had nothing to do with my travels. the westjet employees were unhelpful and apparently powerless to actually offer any customer care. i realize the holidays are an extremely busy time for these employees and they face countless disgruntled travellers but a little would go a long way for this stranded traveller and i was offered no compensation or assistance. i strongly suggest to westjet they review their customer service policy and staff. the replacement flight was delayed twice more than an hour and a half. fortunately i didnt have any baggage to check as the lineup for checking it was halfway down the terminal. the flights were adequate. on the first flight the flight attendant walked right past me without asking if i would like anything when she was passing out the complimentary drinks.  the second flight had much friendlier attendants and i received a drink and pretzels. the seats on the second smaller plane were brutally uncomfortable. there was no inflight entertainment but as both flights were extremely short that was to be expected. the only sincere apology i received for the long delays and inconvenience were from the pilot of the second flight when he addressed the cabin as a whole. all in all i would have arrived faster if i had taken a bus. i was made to feel as if it were me inconveniencing the staff when i asked for assistance.    vancouver to edmonton with westjet airlines. dont fly with them anymore due to a series of staff miscommunication and scheduling errors. our entire flight has been cancelled after a 3 hour delay and because it is the holiday season they have already mentioned that hotels will likely not be an option even though the next flights arent for 8 hours. nowhere is open for food or beverages anymore near our gate. staff are not even close to sympathetic. on my way to check in originally i also was met with 5 agents standing around chatting while a bunch of us waited for a mere 2 staff to help us    i was flying out of halifax going to toronto and my flight was delayed 2 hours. because of this i missed my connecting flight to gatwick england. i had another flight from gatwick to valencia through easyjet and because of westjets screw up i missed that flight as well and i do not get my money back for that. westjet put me up in a hotel for a night and my next flight to england heathrow this time will be at 6.30pm tomorrow night. but the hotel westjet put me in informed me i need to check out by 12 otherwise ill need to pay a fee. i called customer service regarding this and they said i could pay the fee and then i may get reimbursed but nothing is guaranteed. i cant believe how they cant reimburse me through some sort of westjet credits for causing me to lose 400 on my separately booked flight to valencia. i am completely unimpressed. the customer service was not helpful in any way.    montreal to vancouver. very indifferent and passive flight attendants. i ask two times to bring water to take my pill without any attendance. she said that i will bring with service and it take 15 min to receive water. the weather in the airplane was cold and i asked for a blanket. the flight attendant asked for 4.  third world countries represent higher amenities and standards. i try not to use westjet again.    i had to fly to calgary last minute for business but i was unable to get on the morning air canada flight to calgary. check in at kamloops was smooth and efficient as always but calgary was a different story. ground issues in calgary made our flight delayed on getting to the gate by around 20 or so minutes without any of us onboard notified about what was happening. my return flight from calgary in the evening got delayed by more than 45 minutes due to ground issues with westjet staff at ycc. our gate had to be switched last minute which left those of us taking the flight walking to another side of the terminal. i understand that there will be delays with traveling but being left out of the loop is a complete joke. there is a reason why i have been using air canada for all business trips for the past few years. day trip from yka to ycc back to yka.    toronto to montreal. very bad experience. arrived with sata airlines on january 10th to toronto from sao miguel azores. sata unfortunately partners with westjet for montreal travellers going to and from the azores islands. when we arrived at 6 pm from azores tired and jet lagged we found out that westjet had cancelled all flights to montreal. not a word of excuse no help at all to contact a hotel we had to insist to get a boarding card for this morning and were given a small card flight interruption  with a phone num to call but of course the nun was always busy. there were just a handful of sta passengers going to montreal and westjet not transfer us to air canada nor hellp us in any way to find or pay for a hotel. air canada was still flying to montreal but westjet cancelled due to weather conditions and does not help a handful of stranded passengers the fact that the ground staff was of no help at all that the number to call was always busy is inexcusable. we had to walk a long time in the airport to find westjet counter but no help at all when we found them. they simply didnt care. my husband is an elderly man. no offer of complimentary meal hotel stay or ticket for any other trip  not that we ever want to fly with them again very rude airline. we had heard so . only reason we flew with westjet is that they partner with sata to fly to beautiful azores. first and last time with this airline. i am a frequent traveller and aéroplan member with ac. we finally stayed at the hotel in the airport from where i am writing this review before returning to airport this morning.    montreal to toronto. decided to give west jet a chance on a relatively low stakes flight from montreal to toronto pearson.  the first problem is that pearson was undergoing runway repairs so they were short of landing space. the second is that westjet may not have enough clout to get priority in terms of space compared with air canada. my flight from montreal was delayed twice to total 25 min in the same morning of my flight. my return flight had multiple time changes 5 times. and the worst is they dont publish those last minute changes on pearsons site. so theres no way to know. i checked air canadas flights for the same period and only one of their flights were affected whereas west jet had a handful of flights delayed and a few cancellations. unless you want to torture yourself with unforeseen delays and waiting at the airport please just dont fly west jet.    los angeles to edmonton. i was travelling from auckland and transiting in los angeles. when i got to los angeles i had to recheck in my bag before going to edmonton. when i got to edmonton my baggage did not arrive with me. i was told that my baggage will arrive around 6pm the following day after they have located it. the customer service representative i was talking to even told me that in your world it might not happen ever but in my world this happens all the time  also the same customer representative told me that they will deliver my baggage to the place i am staying at even if it is late as they deliver until 2am.  but when my luggage finally arrived in the country after 2 hours of being delayed and after another 2 hours of clearing customs. i was told that either i pick it up or wait for it to be delivered the next day between 9am to 4pm. again another fail in their part. why promise your customers to deliver something you cant the next customer service representative i spoke to said that the last delivery is only at 9pm. different people but one company saying two different things. no uniformity it means someone does not know their own guidelines. getting my hopes up and then crushing it. even writing a customer feedback on their webpage takes about a week for them to reply. and also i get 100 a day to buy all the things i need while my luggage havent arrive but to get reimburse i have to wait 14 days for them to reply after i have uploaded the receipt of the things i have bought.  by that time i could have gone home. yet the issue still not addressed. very poor customer service.   avoid westjet like the plague. on a trip coming back from vegas to ottawa the flight was delayed several times and in each instance this caused me to miss my connecting flight in toronto to ottawa. this resulting in me having to spend 48 extra hours in vegas on my own dime. finally i did get on a flight to toronto but it was also late. which again caused me to miss my connection to ottawa. here i am sitting in toronto airport and westjet staff want me to wait four additional hours to catch the next flight to ottawa. i told them that there is an air canada flight that takes off in about 90 minutes to ottawa but they said the only seats available are business class and they cant reserve these for me. they can make me wait 48 hours in an airport spend hundreds of additional  to stay alive in another city and again make me wait four more hours in toronto but they cant own up to their faults and spend a couple of extra hundred dollars to get me home to my family. i asked to speak to a manager 3 times and each time the westjet rep would speak to the manager by phone but the manager wouldnt talk to me. i have three more business trips in the next 3 months and i would rather go with an airline that owns up to its mistakes.   calgary to palm springs with westjet airlines. a cancelled flight at 8am for my family of 7 and gave no notice or email notification in advance and no alternate plans except the following day which does not work as it didnt get us back in time to leave for europe. all requests were addressed in a robotic fashion by westjet et team there is nothing we can do not even bothering towards checking other flights from nearby cities that i could drive to. they just stood there and said the same phrase over and over every once in a while saying i understand. all good though they were sure to tell us how amazing they were giving us 7 x 15 gift cards for airport food and telling us to come back tomorrow for the flight the next day. westjet was a solid airline 10 years ago today they rank worse than air canada by miles.    boston to toronto. i have flown with westjest within the last 6 months three times and all of my experience has been horrible. the first time was august 2016 to punta cana right away the lady when we checked in forgot to tell us that we were allowed one check in bag for free so we ended up paying. then we were told our flight was delayed due to technical issues once we got on the plan we were told that the in flight entertainment was not working. on our way back again the inflight entertainment system was not working. i decided to give them another chance and flew back to  punta cana this time with my family and again same issues. delayed flights and issues with their entertainment system. more recently i flew from boston to toronto and by far the worst experience. the plane was dirty the sink in the washroom was not working the toilet was dirty. they misplaced my luggage it has been 5 days and i have not received my luggage.  i fly often and this airline has been the worst.\\r\\r\\n    gatwick to toronto. very upset with my recent flight with westjet. this was an 8hour international flight with no food included at all. and the food for purchase is only purchasable by credit card which not everybody has  what about those who want to pay cash and dont have a credit card and are refused food despite the fact that they want to pay for it i dont understand how this is acceptable. and there is no blanket or pillow or provided either while they crank up the air conditioning so that we all shiver or have to buy a blanket again with credit card. i did buy the blanket and it was thin and ineffective  still froze in that plane. im perplexed that these expensive tickets we paid hundreds of dollars for dont even give us access to food or warmth.     i went to the airport in ottawa at about 5 mins to boarding time an announcement says that my flight is cancelled. i go to the desk and ask what is up but get no explanation. the desk staff say that i should just stick around the gate an they will announce what is happening soon. after about 5 minutes i notice a long line forming. i sit and wait patiently as the flight attendant stated. after 20 minutes i become curious and inquire someone in line says they are giving passengers alternate flights  where was the announcement i line up for 40 minutes before i get mine. i had paid extra to get a direct flight to winnipeg for a 5pm arrival. now i am flying to toronto and then to winnipeg with an arrival time of 1234am. they give me a 15.00 voucher for airport food. now i will waste nine hours that i didnt plan for. my flight agent sold me the more expensive ticket say that it was a direct flight rather then transferring in toronto or montreal. instead i pay extra and still get the milk run. a 15.00 voucher doesnt cut it then when i finally get on the toronto flight to wpg i am told while in my seat to download an app if i want to watch an inflight movie... but my tablet is unable as the airport wifi signal is not strong enough to download it from play store.     booked a vacation to las vegas with westjet vacations ottawa to toronto to vegas out bound and the reverse on the way home. flight from ottawa to toronto was delayed one hour a bad start but we were going to have to wait three hours for connection in toronto so not to bad. flight from toronto to vegas was one hour late initially. finally boarded one hour late taxied to runway and stopped. eventually we were told that there was a proble with the long range weather radar and we advto return to the terminal and deplane and change aircraft. eventually we reboarded and took off three hours late. so instead of arriving at 1030 pm we arrived at 130 am. five days later on the return home we were about one hour late departing vegas this then caused us to miss our connecting flight to ottawa. we were told before we deplaned that everyone connecting to ottawa were already booked onto the next flight out of toronto at 9 am. we now had to pick up our luggage which was supposed to be booked through to ottawa. when we picked up our luggage one piece was now torn and had a broken wheel. when we went to the westjet desk to get new boarding passes for the flight we were informed that we would now be on a flight departing toronto at 1200 pm instead of at 9 am a four hour delay from our original flight time. we are now waiting in toronto for our new flight to ottawa hopefully it will e on time but i am not very optimistic that this will happen. this was our first time flying westjet and it will definitely be our last. nothing but one big bad experience. let me start by saying that i have flown westjet for many years and it has always been my first choice in airline when planning our next vacation. this past experience was by far the worst i have ever had. we left edmonton late due to mechanical delays but they ensured us we would catch our connection in vancouver. we landed in vancouver to find out our connecting flight just pushed away from the gate but still on the ground. they rerouted us to toronto. we couldnt land in toronto due to weather so we flew to ottawa. they wouldnt let us pull up to the gate so the entire plane sat for 2 hours. we were not offered water or any form of refreshment. we then flew back to toronto and again just missed our connection... but the connecting plane was still on the ground. we were offered a hotel and told to pick up our luggage. we waited 2 hours for the customer service people to find our luggage... which was in vancouver. the flight the next morning was 30 minutes late and i have never had such rude crew staff. they were more interested in complaining to each other loudly than serve beverages. we waited 90 minutes for a glass of water. there was also no inflight entertainment on this flight. when we landed in cancun they said they would bring our bags to us... we had to continue to call them over the next 36 hours until our luggage finally arrived to us. the flight home was better in general... expect it was 3 hours delayed because of required crew rest. one of them yelled at me which i found very rude and uncalled for. i have been a loyal customer of westjet for years... this was a terrible experience. despite having seats in the emergency access the person sitting in the aisle seat had to awkwardly get out of his seat to let us out. the centre aisle was impossible to negotiate with other passengers and beverage carts. there was no entertainment and seat backs did not recline. there needs to be control of carry on baggage that people bring on board as we had trouble finding a little space for our small bag. the public announcement system was very difficult to understand. the person speaking spoke quickly and did not enunciate. the only benefit of the flight was that we got back to vancouver family of four  we got bumped off of a flight from toronto to winnipeg. staff made us walk back and forth through terminal for 4 hours directing us to the wrong counters and hotel shuttle pickup points. we have 2 small children and 4 large pieces of luggage  no offer to help. the lack of customer service was disgusting. staff have poor attitudes and no compassion for customers at all. never again vancouver to maui and was very disappointed with the service provided on the flight. no food no movies and the staff was not really friendly. nothing compared to my excellent experience with the same company 5 years. my wife and i had flown to las vegas for a wedding getaway and honeymoon. westjet boasts the largest seats and greatest legroom. im 57 and was extremely cramped. the fellow beside me was 64 and almost had his knees in his ears. the seats were very narrow very uncomfortable. there was almost no padding in the seats. they didnt recline more than a couple of inches and there wasnt even room for a laptop to be put on the fold down table. it was a 707700 so seats were 3 across. between my wife and the fellow on the other side we had no choice but to put the arm rests up so the 3 of us could sit quasicomfortably. the flight attendants were obvious unhappy with their jobs. out of the 4 3 of them were just blank faced and walked around like robots. the air circulation system wasnt working properly the forward toilet kept clogging up. so all in all this was an extremely unpleasant flight. several years a go i flew westjet and was pleased at the whole experience so when my son decided he was getting married in mexico we immediately choose westjet but the west jet of yesterday no longer exists. the seats are extremely cramped there was no movie on a 6 hour flight and if you wanted something to eat or drink you paid for it. i recently flew to cuba on sunwing and not only was it more comfortable but they offered us 2 meals 2 movies and two pieces of luggage for free all of this cost the same as westjet. i only hope west jet listens to their customers and returns some of the perks that came with flying on their airline. i will never fly westjet again. im a seasoned traveler and have never experienced this kind of incompetence. my 6am flight was cancelled we were unable to get another flight until 4.30pm. the food is awful and their tvs didnt work. what a horrible experience and a waste of a day. i am an experienced flyer but had never flown with westjet until a few days ago and i will never fly with them again. the service on the cancun to toronto flight was appalling. i was flying with my sister who has 2 young children. we were boarded first but only after approaching the attendants as there was no preboarding call. once on the plane my sister asked if she could go to the back to stand with her 5 month old child to put him to sleep while the plane was loading. the flight attendant said no there was no room so have a seat. after take off passengers were bombarded with merchandise play books as there was no inflight entertainment provided headsets food drinks duty free. you had brief mins. of opportunity to go to the washroom as the aisles were always blocked by carts and you were told to sit down and wait while they finished their task. the staff were very unprofessional and rude. at the end of the flight passengers were not even acknowledged as all the attendants were at the back of the plane talking amongst each other. march 1 yvrycc then on to zlo. while booking i was never aware there was a plane change in calgary until i was shown 2 separate flight numbers. flight was delayed and took off 30 min late  my 45 min window to change planes and find the right gate was narrowed to 15 min which is cut off for boarding planes. asking the flight attendant about my connecting flight she was unaware westjet flew to zlo and angrily put the blame on me for booking flights with too narrow of a window. i made my plane by seconds. return flight on april 4th. stewardess just before landing manhandled my carryon to fit in the containers from the kitchen and i was shouted at when after landing i checked to see if my personal items were damaged. as for baggage landing at 11.40pm i waited until 12.25 to see any baggage descend to the carousel and because of the delay had to pay 70 for a taxi as the rapid transit could no longer get me home. return flight from chicago to victoria bc via calgary was late leaving. we were very concerned about making our connection. when we asked the flight attendants for information we were told they had no idea turned out the flight from calgary was also late but no one bothered to tell us that. very poor communication. westjet has gone downhill. maybe they could all chip in and buy a clock so every now and then they could leave on time. i only fly with them if no other option or if its an amazing deal. yycyvryulyyz. exactly what i expected a low fare carrier charging legacy carrier prices the service is minimal staff almost have no interaction with passengers you do everything print your own boarding passes tag your bag yourself drop the bag yourself at the carousel i felt i was flying on a ghost airline no one to assist or to give information. sad to see everything more and more robotic. i booked westjet because i wanted to try something different will not be flying them again. my husband and i were supposed to depart for winnipeg at 9.05 pm however there was a half an hour delay. that was not an issue. we wanted to know when we should come back to the gate after grabbing a bite to eat. we waited at the counter for 10 minutes while we were being deliberately ignored by an entire west jet crew who were joking around and talking with each other behind the counter. finally a pilot approached us and did not have an answer for us. being further ignored i decided to ask someone else flight attendant. she was rude and short with me. i finally got to talk to the woman that the pilot suggested but she was even more rude. i could barely finish asking my one question because she was raising her voice over mine. i am not upset that no one had an answer for me i am upset with how we were treated and how we were spoken to. i cannot believe how difficult it was to ask 1 question and to receive a kind response. this will be the last time i fly with west jet. we were supposed to fly yyz to lga on dec 22 2013 ws 2010. we checked flight status before we left home  on time. when we got to the gate it said delayed by 45 min. then they said its now cancelled. called their 800 # and rebooked us on the 8.30pm flight  not too bad. we had to go down to arrivals to wait 40 minutes to retrieve the luggage we checked in. we went back up to departure went through immigration and security again but when we got to the gate for the 8.30pm flight it said cancelled again. fed up we asked for a refund so we can try another airline. air canada and american were flying to lga. but westjet would only offer credit for future bookings. i had a flight out of edmonton connecting in vancouver for an onward flight to mexico. my flight was to leave at 8.40am. i arrived at 7.55am. i proceeded to a self serve computer that wasnt working. i then went right up to the checkin counter i was told that she would not check me in because i had missed their cutoff time of 45 minutes. there was not queue at security and it would be no problem in getting to the gate. i could have got to the gate in less then 10 minutes. the csa was very rude and condescending she lectured me and did not provide any quality customer service. as a result i was not able to go to cabo and had to rebook for another day. this was all because wj would not step up and provide some great customer service. i could understand if it was a very busy time when the airport is packed and their is huge lineups everywhere. the airport was very slow. this was the worst customer service i have ever experienced from a major company. recently flew from saskatoon to cancun. departing saskatoon we were boarded on time and then proceeded to sit in the aircraft at the gate for at least 60 mins. this was apparently due to freezing rain which had been falling from the sky 2 hours before when i walked into the airport. why board us would be much more comfortable sitting in the airport. on the way home after boarding in cancun we once again sat in the aircraft on the ramp for 60 mins. we were told it was due to the mexican ramp hands having some confusion with the luggage. on arrival in saskatoon we were to find out that they had off loaded bags in cancun due to a weight and balance issue. why couldnt the captain have been honest rather than blaming the mexican ramp hands the person i was travelling with was unlucky enough to have his luggage not arrive. he was told it would arrive the next morning. he has yet to receive it and we have been home for almost 72 hours. when we were checking in at the airport in cancun a group of people approached the counter next to us asking to get on our direct flight rather than the one they were scheduled to be on. none of these people were standing at the baggage claim in saskatoon wondering where their luggage was. this does not make sense to me. their luggage should have been off loaded. i can only assume that the plane became overweight with the last minute passengers and their luggage. also have to say that the food available on board is appalling. i am a vegetarian and can choose from a variety of junk food options. there is no veggie sandwich available. i asked for crackers and hummus and was told it was not available so then asked for the cheese plate and received the same answer. we sat on that aircraft for seven hours on the way home how can you expect someone not to eat for seven hours i used to think that westjet was the only option when choosing an airline. not anymore. thankfully a person has options these days. flight from varadero to victoria on november 17th. i thought air canada was bad so i switched to westjet. as bad as air canada is it was a mistake going with westjet. guess i go back to air canada. we need some better choices here. westjet is probably the worst airline i have flown with. european south american and caribbean based airlines have provided much better service than these two canadian airlines. on the 6th of november i flew from vancouver to maui and i must say that westjet really lost their edge towards air canada in the past few years. considering the flight was for six hours and in the middle of the day 10.304 pacific time i was expecting some sort of meal and drinks. however the drink cart only came around once and there was no food served whatsoever excluding a single bag of pretzels. as well they had absolutely no inflight entertainment of which they are famous for. overall the only thing that was even decent was the low price i got for the flight but i see why it was so low now. this is my third time using westjet and it will be the last all three times have been a horrible experience but this last time has been an absolute disaster. our flight to new york was scheduled for 415 pm  while waiting it was announced that the flight will be 1015 minutes late on the plane the pilot announced that we will be another 15 minutes late and 20 minutes later he announces that we will be departing at 615. we were given permission to leave the plane but to be back by 530. at 530 we were told that the flight has been cancelled and to go to the desk at the gate to be put on another flight. at the gate we are told 30 minutes later that there are no flights to new york for the rest of the day. back through customs after an hour of waiting in a line that was hardly moving we are told to get out of the line and call westjet to rebook the flight for the next day. called westjet and told that there is a flight at 825 to new york after the manager says all flights are cancelled. the customer service rep on the phone says to me i can book you on the 825 flight but there is no guarantee that it wont be cancelled. we were expected to wait another 2 hours and to find out whether there is a flight or not which is the best they could offer. i asked for a refund so i can book with another airline and which is refused saying that it was not their fault it was la guardia airport that cancelled the flights. i rebooked my flight for the next morning at 700 which meant another 100.00 for cab fair 50.00 each way and waking up at 400 am to get to the airport by 600. a flight that takes one hour started with me leaving my home at 230 pm and reaching new york at 920 the next morning. westjet consistently provides poor service. they oversell leaving passengers stranded. their flights are often delayed because flight crew are over assigned. if the flight they are working inbound is delayed then the outbound flight is accordingly delayed. happens all the time. i am a regular delta long flight patron. deltas relationship on domestic with westjet has caused me to reassess that. i will redirect my long flight business away from delta going forward.  kelowna to edmonton ws224 december 27 2013. their customer service is matching that of their competition. arrived at kelowna airport 1 hour before flight. queue was not long but slow. a customer service rep asked everyone in line their destination. pretty much the 30 people in line said edmonton she proceeded to tell the personell on the desks that everyone in line was destined for edmonton. there was no effort made to rush people through to make flight. the attitude was oh well nothing we can do. at least 20 people missed their flight. cabin is ok flight crew were nice but definitely not professional. during the safety demo they flight attendants were joking around. i understand they want to make the flight enjoyable and stress free there is a time to be a clown. i am a frequent flyer thought i would give wj another chance but sadly this will be the last time. this airline is not made for the seasoned flyer but for someone who rarely flys. the announcements in the terminal for boarding are way to long and it feels like they are like to hear there own voice. paid extra for the plus seating. it was a bit worth it but you get what you pay for. the flight was excellent very smooth. also when doing the meal service please cut back on the jokes and stop trying to be buddy buddy with everyone. wj should talk to their employees about this toilet paper game they have going on. very unprofessional. would i recommend this airline to others yes for none seasoned travellers and no for people going on business travel it is just too rowdy at times. flight to toronto was delayed 4 hours for unknown reason and the two preceding flights on the same evening were cancelled entirely. on the return flight from toronto to new york the flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms. other flights to new york with other airlines were simply delayed. had to stay overnight in a hotel not paid for as the cancellation was attributed to weather. the 7 am flight was then also cancelled the following morning ostensibly due to issues with air traffic control. the next flight at noon left 1.5 hours late as the pilot was coming from another plane. at the desk westjet charged for our bags while telling us that they were saving us money. charging extra for bags meant that the overhead was stuffed by the carry on luggage weasels. the flight was delayed at the gate while this was sorted out. on the return same thing. when we got to yyz we were late and there was no one to operate the gate. so we waited quite a long time on the runway. some people find the corny jokes from the staff amusing. we prefer fewer maybe better jokes and better more efficient service. and when you add up all the extras charged westjet is on the expensive side.    i had the not so pleasurable experience of flying on westjet flight 722 on saturday july 29 from vancouver to toronto. there was a passenger who had clearly drank way too much during the flight.\\xa0 he and his friends were basically allowed to conduct a party at the front of the plane out of their seats and sitting on the floor of the plane. the crew had to ask him several times to keep it down but they did not stop serving them alcohol. the drama started once we landed and this passenger started yelling swearing and causing a major disturbance.\\xa0 we were then informed of all times that there was a gate issue and they could not get us off the plane.\\xa0for a good 30 mins this passenger continued to behave in a belligerent manor making other passengers irate\\xa0 the westjet crew and captain did nothing to deescalate the issue but let it continue the whole time we were stuck on the plane.\\xa0i was travelling with my 8 year old son who was terrified by the passengers irrational behaviour it was absolutely disgusting that there was nothing done no security or police called to escort the passenger off the plane.\\xa0 since there were many angry passengers at this point the situation could have easily gotten out of control on the plane ramp or baggage area. i am extremely disappointed by how this was handled or not handled by westjet employees.\\xa0 they are responsible for the safety of passengers and should not have had allowed people to be subject to this behavior.\\xa0 at the very least security should have been called to the plane. \\xa0    guadalajara to vancouver via mexico city. ive been flying with westjet for years and been satisfied with their service. recently however they have chosen to partner with aeromexico and promote their flights on their site. however aeromexicos standards and policies are nothing like westjets. my husband is mexican and they refused to accept the documentation we received from the embassy of canada and didnt allow my husband on the flight. they stranded us in mexico city – at 2 am with a baby. as a result what was supposed to be an overnight trip ended up being a threeday nightmare. we were forced to purchase last minute flights with a domestic airline to cancun to catch a flight from westjet that flew to canada. westjets policies are uptodate with canadas policies and we had no issues flying into vancouver or with immigration when we landed. after discussing this with westjets help desk and contacting them through email explaining the nightmare and asking for a refund for the aeromexico tickets they came back saying they do not have access to the funds so they cannot reimburse me and that my issue is with aeromexico alone. they said it does not involve them in the least. aeromexico refuses to resolve the issue. i passed that information along to westjet but they again said its no their issue. now this is a company westjet have chosen to partner with and promote these flights on westjet website. westjet customers trust you are going to partner with a company that will provide a service that is paid for and in the least have accurate understand of the policies of the country they fly into.  we have lost all respect for both companies and will avoid flying with either in the future.    booked a flight from tucson to calgary through american airlines turns out the connecting flight from phoenix to calgary is operated by westjet. not allowed to check in online. couldnt even check in at the airport ticket desk for the connecting flight arrive in phoenix and theres no gate posted on the departure board wandered through the terminal and no gate attendants could tell us the gate because westjet has their departure board located at the gate they have to be the least customer oriented airline ive ever flown   westjet treated my daughter and i very poorly. we were making a connecting flight and when we arrived we were assured by the staff that we would make our connection both when we got off the plane and when we rechecked our bags after customs. we still ran to make our flight just to be safe. we arrived and they told us we had missed it by seconds. they thought this was funny. they put us on another flight that arrives at 110 am so we wouldnt be able to get our rental car for a 3 hour drive. we asked them to look for another flight and they said there were no seats available on other flights. we called our travel agent and he got us on another flight so we could get our rental car in time. when i told them there were seats on an earlier flight and asked for them to rebook us they refused and said it was our problem. we were we were told that we were not their responsibility any more because they booked us on the flight that got in a 1 am the next day. we were also told it costs them too much money to hold the flight for another minute eventhough we were present and the plane just stood on the runway with the stairway attached while we sorted out what to do next. they treated us very rudely and with no respect. our trip started out very poorly because they treat people like numbers and not human beings.    \\r\\r\\nthis is the third time i have had my flight cancelled and bumped to a later flight. i fly to meetings in quebec and i kept telling myself that its just a glitch stuff happens. but when i ran into my meeting 1.5 hours late because of a westjet cancellation for the third time i felt really foolish for using this airline when they are consistently unreliable. it has to be any other airline going forward. there is no choice.    québec to toronto. this flight was my first with westjet. technicaly it was a good flight with the exception of the lack of seating comfort like be seating on a school bus bench and the unpleasant mood of the two flight attendants. they get very impatient with our two years girls since she didnt want to seat during the landing and she was crying. few minutes before the landing one of them told me that if my daughter dont sit the pilots will have to divert the flight to an other airport . very very unpleasant service.    vancouver to gatwick. the flight itself was nice i got a seat on economy plus and the 9 hours from vancouver to gatwick went by quickly. but once i got out of the plane it was completely chaos. i had a layover in london before going to my final destination in copenhagen and i was told in vancouver that my baggage would be sent all the way to copenhagen however i had to verify with a westjet agent in london. arriving in london i looked and asked for my baggage but it didnt arrive and i was told that it should have arrived because it only said gatwick and not copenhagen on the baggage strip thus i hadnt been told the truth in vancouver. i went to denmark without my luggage which didnt arrive in copenhagen either. then a long struggle to get in contact with westjet started  i wasnt provided with the right number to track my bag from the beginning so i had to contact westjet by facebook because i didnt get a reply via email. when i finally got the right tracking number they hadnt written my email and phone number properly and didnt seem to care to check the first days i wasnt contacted at all and didnt know what to do. the correspondance on westjets website was quite random and insuficient. i asked several questions i never received any answers to furthermore i wrote emails directly to westjet that were never replied. i was suddenly told that my baggage had arrived in an airport in denmark even though i wasnt provided with any information of the flight number date or the new tracking number to my luggage. i rushed to the airport where i was told that my bag hadnt arrived and furthermore that i didnt have the right numbers to collect it. several days went by where i still didnt get any proper answers to my questions on my lost bag when it finally came and i was contacted directly from an agent from the danish airport who had been obliged to look up my phone number because westjet had given the wrong number. the whole situation was very frustrating and confusing and it seemed like nobody within westjet wanted to take any responsability  i was in contact with 89 different agents during the whole period. i got tons of insufficient information single phrases and random info that didnt match. furthermore from the beginning i got 56 different numbers and had no idea which ones to use. again the trip from vancouver to gatwick was nice  but make sure you never lose your luggage with westjet because ive never experienced such an unorganized mess with any airline before in my life and its not the first time my baggage is delayed...    montreal to toronto. westjet cancelled my flight to toronto because of lack of staff. the problem is i was supposed to go to korea from toronto but since westjet cancelled theirs my flight to korea was also interrupted and i ended up going to china through air china. westjet only offered me 100 for cancellation. this is absurd and i would never take westjet again.     orlando to gatwick via toronto. you pick the cheapest flight and you get the cheapest customer service. you get what you pay for. i was told on the plane before landing in toronto to collect my bag and go back through customs to get to my connecting flight to gatwick. after waiting an hour in toronto for my bag to show up i finally asked a westjet employee about my bag. he stated all flights from florida will have their bags forwarded to their next flight. it wasnt. i arrived in london without my bag. the following day with up to 8 agents standing around in gatwicks westjet check in area i had to wait for the 1 person that was at lunch to get my bag. this caused me to miss my flight to ireland. westjet is taking no responsibility for having ill informed employees. they want to give me a voucher for a future flight as if i would ever fly with them again. i understand mistakes happen but you own them and you fix them. they ruined my first trip to europe because i had to spend double what i expected to. customer service is not their priority. they only get a 1 because the flight crew was decent.   first off they rescheduled my flight twice. there was no room for a seat upgrade and the seats themselves were small. our tv screens were smaller than my cell phone iphone 6s and you had to swipe a credit card to even use them. it was very warm despite having both overhead fans on full blast you couldnt even feel the air unless you put your hand up to it. they ran out of storage space and we had people from the 7th row looking for space in the 20th. will not fly with westjet ever again.    toronto to vancouver return. both flights with westjet were delayed numerous times and on my return flight from vancouver had delays and numerous gate changes. i had booked an aisle seat and with a change in aircraft no effort was made to accommodate an aisle again. it was a difficult trip on both ends and i found the airline to be extremely disorganized. i used to enjoy flying westjet but will avoid this airline when possible in future.    vancouver to gatwick via toronto. we were surprised to find out that there was no in flight access to any entertainment like movies tv or music  nothing the only thing available was a tablet that you of course have to pay for. even if you bring your own tablet you cannot access any programs. another dissapointment was the non alcoholic beverage service on board. we asked for a glass of milk and were offered 2 coffee creamers. when i asked for ginger ale i was offered 34 of a small plastic cup not even a can. i am assuming that they serve one can to 3 customers when you pay for a domestic flight almost as much as one would pay to fly to europe where they offer 3 meals and free entertainment  youd expect better service. when we landed in toronto and checked the board for our connecting flight to gatwick we found out that our flight was being delayed by 43 minutes and ended up to be 2 hours after midnight.    full plane on a friday night returning to edmonton to las vegas. wife and i seated near the back. wife takes window seat leaving me in middle with a very large woman who arrived ahead of us. to not be rude i tried to squeeze in and had 12 a seat. she struggled to do up seatbelt with extender attached. i was pushed to front of seat for the 3 hour flight. i tried to make the best of it and be polite but when i tried to ask westjet for some kind of help or partial refund since i was only able to use part of the seat they wrote back and said that they would never try and intervene to help a passenger since we may have been together and it would be rude. she was on the plane when my wife and i arrived we never shared a single word i couldnt even see her since i was forced to sit forward and sideways to accommodate her. but we were forced to sweat on each other from shoulder to ankle for the entire flight. i know it was full flight but all i wanted was some kind of acknowledgement from westjet and they basically said its not their problem. so next time i am forced to fly with them and have such a large seat mate i will take their advice and deal with it on my own.  so disappointed.    ft lauderdale to toronto. first time flying westjet and likely the last. flight has been delayed twice now at 8 hours due to mechanical issues with the flight coming out of toronto. now seeing a flight after us boarding on a westjet flight scheduled later than us. not impressed.    edmonton to kelowna. i remember why i dont fly westjet. we got to the deicing station fully deiced then got told we needed to go back to the gate because of a latch that was left opened. another westjet incompetence. 1hr late departing still stuck on the tarmac waiting. i have upcoming flights with westjet that im changing i just dont feel safe with this airline. westjets motto were not happy until youre not happy.    edmonton to calgary. we got into the plane for our departure in edmonton at 715am but didnt take off until 830am. we like most of the passengers onboard had connecting flights that were within a short time frame from our landing time. once we landed at 905am we were stuck in the plane for 30 extra minutes as they couldnt get the plane door open. the flight attendants first told us that we would all make our flights as the planes will be held for us. false promises. our connecting flights last boarding call was at 905am. after racing to terminal a22 we were refused entry on the plane and the vessel remained there. after 30 more minutes of rearranging flights and mass confusion the flight we missed was still sitting there.    my husband & i flew from calgary to ottawa flight #610 ottawa to st. johns nfld flight # 24 on sept 27th st. johns to halifax on oct 3rd flight # 3423 and halifax to calgary on oct 18th on westjet flight # 229 in the plus section of the aircraft. we had friends who flew calgary to toronto toronto to st johns on sept 27th the other 2 flights were on the same aircraft the we flew on but they flew in economy all the way. my husband & i paid 3847.12 for that privilege and our friends paid just over &1700.00 for the both of them. i knew that we would be paying substantially more for the plus seats and therefore i expected to receive a bit more than the economy ticket allows. what we received was the exact same food in the exact same boxes that the they did only they had to pay 7.50 for their sandwich and we didnt. we were offered a cheese tray on one leg of the flight the cost would have been 6.99 in economy but in fact we didnt get the cheese tray we got the litebite and that was 6.49 in economy. i am not sure why you would charge your valued customers 2100.00 more and then offer no perks to go with it. i was disgusted with the service and the exorbitant price that we paid for it. i do hope that westjet learns a little bit about first class business class priority or whatever you want to call it because right now the only thing first class about it is the price. a very upset valued customer.   my connecting flight from toronto to st johns nl was delayed by over 4 hours delayed 8 times by 30 minutes each time. then went back the next day and flight was delayed again by over 2 hours. they did not apologize  they are a joke  never trust this airline.    saskatoon to edmonton. turned back to saskatoon due to technical difficulties with the plane. following a business call with employer i was incredibly asked while inquiring about status of the delay if i had been drinking. what is this the problem is not customer service its the choice of aircraft. ill never intentionally fly westjet again.    yellowknife to nanaimo via calgary. yellowknife boarded the flight on time and pushed back. pilot made decision we needed to be deiced which was a good one except no one there qualified to operate the deice machine. sit on the apron for 35 minutes until they find someone who can operate it. aircraft boeing 737 from yzf to yyc seat leg room ok but i am only 5ft 10. i am not large but the seats felt quite narrow and not very comfortable. no entertainment centre although my experience with westjet is their idea of entertainment is watching advertising about things not available on this flight. yycycd aircraft q400 seats incredibly uncomfortable with virtually no padding and very narrow. if you are a guy with over size 12 shoes make sure and go to the washroom before you board as your shoes might not fit in the washroom. the washroom is the smallest i have ever encountered and there is no sink to wash your hands after. i am serious. person seated behind us had a small dog that barked most of the way. the highlight  they did offer those incredibly tasty pretzels not all 11000 of one oz. our departure for this flight was from gate a5 which is 300 yards guesstimate from the real terminal through what is best described as a dungeon. the seating in this area is very poor and often non existent as there are often triple the number of passengers for the limited seating available. concrete floor one small kiosk about half way there. this is the worst. my suggestion is if the price is anywhere near try air canada.    seattle to quebec via vancouver  toronto. terrible. would be well into the negative if this was possible. the problems started when i booked through them to get from seattle to quebec in 3 jumps. the seattle vancouver leg was with delta. this was not made clear anywhere. it wasnt until i was trying to check in online to pay their exorbitant checked luggage fees that i deduced myself with no assistance or prompting by the site that i would have to check in via delta. after landing in vancouver taking 45 minutes for people in line to be processed by 3 customs officers. barely made boarding only for the most inefficient boarding i have ever experienced. would have taken 50 minutes to board a max 8 3x3. took equally as long to offload. no problem though because our 3rd leg was delayed 45 minutes. then 65 minutes. then we boarded and sat on the tarmac without taking off nor explanation for over an hour. it was 2hrs 15 minutes late by the time we took off and we were meant to have landed in quebec at midnight. we landed at 155am. with kids. with no sleep on what was now a 17 hour travel day to fly about the same distance as brisbane to perth. then we sat on the tarmac for 10 minutes. no explanation. it then took them 45 minutes to get the disembark gate sorted out. we left the plane at all 245am. then they lost the bag. unbelievable and then because of all their endless stuff ups there were no cabs or uber at that ridiculous time of morning. none. because their incompetence with the bags we were at the back of the cab line. did not get out of the airport until 4am. communication was appalling at all times. these guys are low cost but they are worse than rubbish. do not do it    gatwick to phoenix via calgary on december 4th flight ws 1494. a male attendant was extremely rude to me. i was shocked by his behavior. i was asked about tea or coffee by flight attendant. i asked for a cup of tea once tea was served i asked for creamer and sugar. this attendant replied with a rude tone and told me you asked for tea not creamer or sugar. i was shocked by his behavior.    los angeles to toronto via calgary. i asked for an earlier flight to get back to toronto as i had a family emergency. i was told by staff that i should be able to switch to the flight next to my gate that would be leaving an hour earlier to the same destination. when i arrived i asked them at the desk. the male was somewhat co operative and considered helping me. the female was rude told me no she will not help me and then proceeded to let 4 other passengers on the flight   original trip was supposed to be deer lake to halifax then to toronto then to edmonton. after multiple delays my girlfriend and i were given brand new itineraries in halifax after 3 hrs of delay ended up not being able to sit even close to each other even though we originally booked and chose seating together. no westjet member seemed to care at all. our flights were changed to incorporate a stop in calgary then to edmonton anyone who lives in central alberta knows this is ridiculous especially to have a 1 hour layover in after requesting our bags be dropped in calgary and being put off numerous times not only in halifax but toronto and calgary with no action we wait and wait. we could have easily obtained our bags and made it home 2 hours earlier. westjet turned our 11 hr flight from newfoundland into 21 hours total travelling and not one member seemed to care whatsoever. to add to all of this not only did my girlfriend and i get separated we got the worst seats on the plane where you cant recline every single new departure time we were given was also exceeded by at least 45mins.    los angeles to vancouver. airline is delayed by hours. after getting off a previous 16 hour flight to find my flight delayed by 4 hours and counting i am not impressed by the service and lack of information given when inquiring into why there is a delay. this is also the only lax  flight to vancouver with no option of a switch. horrible.    punta cana to toronto. for our flight back from punta cana they had us sit on the runway for over 3 hours. no food no water and very limited instructions. the flight attendants were terrible and did nothing to alleviate the situation. theyd just stand around and play on their phones. most airlines offer extended bar service and snacks when delayed on the runway and are informative. worse yet we finally get to the bag carousel and it has been well over an hour for us with no signs of our luggage. there were flights that arrived well after ours and got their bags well before us. our projected arrival was 759pm. we were hoping to get back around 910 pm. as we speak it is past midnight and we will be lucky to get home by 2am. do not fly this airline unless you like long waits poor customer service and cramped seats. never flying this airline again.   my flight to montreal from calgary was delayed and i missed my connecting flight to boston as a result. i went through us preclearance in montreal in an attempt to get to the gate to speak to a westjet representative. imagine my surprise when there were no westjet representatives at the gate or in us departures section of montreal airport. instead another customer and i attempted to call westjet to attempt to enquire about our bags and alternatives but were put on hold for upwards of 15 minutes and it was only after a united airlines representative helped us out that we were able to enter canada again in order get to the arrivals baggage carousel in montreal. we then went to the westjet counter at arrivals again the counter was empty and another united representative had to call a westjet representative in montreal. it took another 20 minutes for one to amble over to the abandoned westjet counter at arrivals. it took over one and a half hours to talk to someone in person by which time it was too late to even consider other westjet flights to boston. of the four customers who were let down by your service two are driving back to the united states and the other bought a last minute ticket with air canada. i am now stranded in toronto until 15 where i was rerouted to. the process of ensuring i had a place to sleep and food to eat tonight was also ridiculous i was only able to secure meal vouchers  despite asking specifically about them at montreal and the westjet rep there assuring me that they would be provided  after haggling with westjet representatives at gate b26 in toronto. again another example of a failure at communication within westjet. it is disgraceful that i was only able to access the right people via united representatives who were infinitely more helpful than any of the nonexistent reps at us departures in montreal. tight connections seem to be a recurring issue with westjet. it is irresponsible of the airline to sell connecting flights when the second flight departs less than an hour from the landing time of the previous one. this would be an issue even without any delays but seeing as i have been delayed multiple times with westjet my previous flight from boston  toronto  calgary being another example it is frankly dumbfounding that the airline still has the gall to sell these flights. i do not plan on flying with westjet again and will be encouraging my friends and family in the united states and canada to similarly take their business elsewhere.    puerto plata to halifax via toronto. three out of four connections on this trip were significantly delayed with pathetic excuses. no snow storms or any legitimate reasons. on one of the connection toronto to halifax the total delay was 3 hours. the plane was delayed arriving at the airport then 2 flight attendants arrived at 1022 pm for a flight that was supposed to take off at 945 and took about 30 minutes after that to clear customs. eventually we departed 45 minutes late from the twice delayed schedule. a truly pathetic airline.   on 123017 our westjet flight 1564 from calgary to san diego was to leave at 9.55. by 4.00 pm the flight was cancelled due to alleged weather conditions. however we could see other flights departing. we waited until 7.00 pm to be given a voucher and no flight information as to when to return to san diego. the female clerks were polite but the male clerks were extremely rude and unprofessional towards the female passengers. one of them told me if you dont like me i can escort you to the door because he was the supervisor. they have no knowledge of customer service.   i have been waiting to cool off and even debating about writing this review but on flight 426 on 126 the flight attendants were incredibly rude disrespectful and offensive. during the safety briefing i was told to remove my hearing aids. when i advised the male flight attendant that i was able to hear he rudely said i dont care take them out. then the female flight attendant proceeded to lecture and berate me. i think that it is unbelievable in this day and age that a flight attendant would disrespect a customer for having a disability but to berate them about language and then turn around with real profanities is the greatest insult. this behavior is shockingly disrespectable and unacceptable.    fort myers to toronto. please read earlier reveiw it gets worse. we were prompted at the fort myers airport to call immediately to rebook our flight that had unexpectedly been cancelled. because westjet could not get us a hotel room and never did we were in the airport. they assured us it was toll free. we got our phone bill and it there was a charge for 127. clearly not toll free only when calling from canada. this could have been smaller but westjet had over a 40 minute wait and the call back option was not available. when contacting them about this they refused to even acknowledge anything they are advising customers to call only to wait total time on phone was 85 minutes and be charged. i called them to ask about this and was hung up on by customer service clearly they dont know how to deal with their customers. cant blame the customer service lady though another 40 minutes wait to talk to them only to be hung up on. our toll in extra costs is over 300 from just actual costs phone taxi accommodations and parking but also extra day off work and missing appointment with renters. not only does it seem that the cancellation could have been avoided all other toronto flights running but it is absolutely unacceptable to treat customers like this. once westjet has your money you are forgotten and it can get expensive. save yourself the headache and literally fly with anyone else.    quebec to minneapolis via toronto. got to the airport at 9 am for a 12pm flight. once there was notified our flight was canceled due to operational problem they kept saying. after some time they said it was due to poor weather in halifax. they said wed be flying out at 6.40pm that night. staying in a complementary hotel getting taxi and food vouchers. westjet does not work with several airlines and wouldnt even attempt to get us on any earlier flights. we knew air canada had one. so were in the quebec airport for 8 hours there are two stores and a really terrible bar with awful overpriced deli croissant sandwiches and little else. no other food options. while waiting for our flight we saw a flight leaving to halifax which is so crazy cause the weather there was the reason our flight was canceled. we get to the gate to check in at boarding time having been there 8 hours and the lady offers us food voucher for the bar restaurant why wouldnt you give those to us 8 hours ago before we paid for our own food at the restaurant. arrive in toronto for the night and had to argue with guest services to be provided dinner vouchers that were promised to us. they gave is 30 for 2 people. next morning trying to get our tickets was a nightmare. almost didnt make the flight because westjet failed to reserve us tickets.    gatwick to toronto. an 8hour flight and have only food for purchase. other than pop or juice everything was supposed to be paid for. i asked the flight attendant for a juice and she told me that they will start serving drinks to everyone soon. one hour later i finally got my juice. the approach of the flight attendant is its like they are giving you a favor instead of serving you. mind that it is their job and profession choice. i flew to uk with air canada where food and alcohol were free. i find that any other airlines i flew had a very attentive service where you feel like you are been treated like a customer. in here is pay for everything and whatever is free you might get it at some point when they serve everyone  which is twice in 8hour flight. greatly disappointed. canadian airlines in general dont stand close in my opinion and on top of that are very expansive. pay a lot and get a little is an overall experience   toronto to nassau. we booked our flight and hotel through the atlantis website for jan. 711. our westjet flight was delayed 3x and then cancelled  with the only availability opportunity to fly out 2 days later. the first flight was delayed from ottawa sat for 2hrs then they said it wasnt mechanically safe to fly. we were rerouted from another flight from winnipeg  then that crew had exceeded their legal flight time. we dont know why the original crew was not available anymore. after 4hrs they cancelled the flight said to get our bags and call them in 2hrs. the next available flight was 2 entire days later. when we called atlantis we were transferred 7x  then they presented no reasonable options to reschedule even though they acted as our travel agent. the only option was to pay 500900 in a downgraded room or obtain a resort credit for 300 less than we had paid for the trip. i also lost the cost of my scuba trip i had prepaid. i am in complete shock about how poorly this was planned. i will never again book a trip to atlantis or westjet. worst customer service ever.   flew westjet airlines from quebec city to toronto. one of the worst airlines in terms of service and punctuality. first time for me and definitely the last. cramped spaces and unfriendly staff. they should change their name to delayjet. our flight is delayed currently waiting to board and they have no clue when the plane will arrive. dont fly them unless you have no schedule to adhere too.    la guardia to calgary via toronto. flights were cancelled and delayed westjet employees in new york were not helpful. once on our flight to toronto the stewards i ask for help said there would be staff that would assist us once we landed so we could catch a quick turnover to calgary. nobody there to help no assistance given until after we got through customs then we were told the flight was waiting and still no help just told to hurry. security walk through was slow with our bags being flagged for additional screening. we miss the flight by 2 min. told we werent on the manifest by one person then told we were by another as we had to take a later flight. we complained about the service a laguardia and was told those were not actual westjet employees and sorry for their behavior. are any employees responsible for customer service or are they just passing the buck come on westjet not the type of service you advertise.   montreal to toronto. i flew around 200 flights in last 3 years with westjet on diffrent routes. their service is getting poor to worst. westjet flights never leave on time and famous for endless delays. if you have a connection flight or looking for timely flight. please do not use westjet.    abbotsford to calgary. i am livid right now with this airline. i have been flying exclusively with westjet over the last year back to calgary to visit my elderly parents and help them out during my fathers chemotherapy. every time i have flown with westjet over the last 6 months my flight has been delayed at least half an hour to two hours. they always brush it off with their annoying brand of westjet humor on the plane which used to be kind of cute back in the day when it only happened here and there but has been an epidemic of late. i normally do not check a bag as i dont bring much with me. this trip i did check a bag because i had some things i couldnt check on the plane with me as gifts for a friend and some necessities my parents cant get in calgary. i left for the airport with plenty of time and arrived almost an hour early to find the check in kiosks either busy or broken. i had already checked in online and paid for my checked bag i just needed to print my bag tags and drop my bag. once i got to the kiosk i inserted my card to get the tag and was refused check in because it was too close to my flight. confused i went to the customer service kiosk where i was directed by one of westjets employees she would have been better helping at an actual kiosk instead of wandering around. there were two people at the kiosk plus another couple passengers who were refused check in as well. there was only one westjet agent working. she was on the phone dealing with an issue with the two people at the kiosk who i found out were actually travelling on another airline but because they didnt speak english well she was helping them out . because of the line up forming i guess westjet decided to bring in another agent to another kiosk. she proceeded to help the couple in front of me and when i got to the kiosk she said i was no longer allowed to take my scheduled flight because it was too late to check the bag. she said they need 45 minutes ahead and i was too late 6 minutes. i was at the airport on time albeit right on time due to some traffic issues and the bs i incurred at their kiosks. i asked if there was any way i could get on the plane because of my fathers medical appointment and she said the only way was to bring my bag on the plane. i told her about what was in my bag and she said to check with security. i ran to security and was told i would have had to throw away over 100 worth of stuff plus there was no offer by the westjet agent to refund my checked bag fee so they would have taken my money for even though i wouldnt have checked it anyway. even the security agent thought it was ridiculous. i made alternate arrangements for my father and went back to the kiosk to get on a later flight. i was greeted with attitude and indifference to my issues. i now get to wait for over three hours for a later flight. westjet has gone from a customer friendly airline with no frills to keep costs down to a noservice airline with exorbitant costs and poor employee attitude. they have no qualms about delaying your flight on their end however when it comes to the customer they dont care. if they had enough employees working at their kiosks and were organized to deal with the immediate flights i would be on my plane right now. i will be looking elsewhere for my flying needs in the future and if i have to send anything to my parents i wont be bringing it with me if i ever fly westjet again i will give my business to canada post.    boston to toronto. flight scheduled for 6.20pm and they announced at 5.30pm that t would be delayed for 2 hours then the 2 hours became 3. i was coming after a 13.5 hr flight from dubai to boston connection time supposedly 4 hours all in one ticket. westjet refused to give accomodations and kept people in the gate most of the day without any inadvance notices. terrible experience absolutely terrible and unreliable and unprofessional. very disappointed in the service and lack of care toward its passengers. second time trial with west jet first was from orlando to toronto in july 2017 and the flight was delayed 6 hours and there were zero accomodations.   montréal to boston. the flight westjet 3652 was delayed 4 hours because the crew flight time was expired. that caused everybody on that flight to miss their connection in boston. small low cost airline dont plan for additional flight crew on backup. thats a liability for the customer. dont bet your trip on westjet. my ticket was delta. delta should not partner with westjet they are not reliable.    tampa to toronto. i am a prisoner on this flight. not allowed to deplane for 9 hours  failed to land in toronto and diverted to windsor airport. not allowed to deplane in windsor. forced to fly back to toronto where no gate is available and therefore kept in plane on tarmac now approaching 1.5 hour with no release in sight.    toronto to new york. absolutely useless westjet canceled flight after several delays and just dumps you. join the queue of people and no customer support whatsoever. you find your own way. accommodation  find it yourself. rebooking  join the queue  we dont care. never got such a treatment anywhere else.    my flight was from edmonton to laguardia via toronto. i was to land at 440. my connection to laguardia was cancelled. they rerouted me a whole crazy way and i was to land at 1215. when i arrived at the airport i explained that i wished to be refunded where the lady fought with me saying she cant help me or do anything for me. she said these words to me if theres bad weather westjet doesnt help you because we cant help this. i asked again to be refunded and she continued to say no. i went to american airlines and purchased a ticket to get home. i later called westjet and explain that i needed to be into new york before 12. the guy finally agreed that since i did not check into my rerouted flights he would refund me. i was just really taken aback by how rude the people who worked at the airport were.    calgary to toronto.  it was a horrible experience. due to weather conditions the flight got cancelled multiple times and the customer service and call center staff was not helpful. i understand that weather conditions are beyond airlines control but what about the behavior of the crew. the crew both ways from toronto to calgary and back was rude. their overall demeanor tonality and hand gestures were as if we are prisoners and they are jail guards. unfortunately after landing the gate was not available to disembark and we all stuck in the aeroplane 1 hour after landing and during that duration the staff was rude to the passengers and ordered them remain in seats no going to bathroom or ask for water or anything. i wonder if courtesy hospitality and customer service are no longer a part of airline services or its just a westjet style.    miami to toronto. i paid for my seats when i booked and the front desk check in rep tried to charge me again for choosing my seats at the airport. when i showed her my confirmation with my seat choices through email she made it seem like she was doing me a favor by waiving the fee i already paid for. booked in february with westjet again to fly to new york on may 29th ... and theres a possible pilot strike. really not impressed with how they are handling this.    i am furious with west jet and will never fly with them again. i flew 9 hours from calgary to gatwick on a plane that was meant for 2hour flights at a stretch. not only did i have to pay for basic items blankets so i dont freeze to death i also had to pay for food and drinks. i didnt eat before getting on the plane and will be damned if i spend 10 on a pizza onboard.  i had to pay for my entertainment. the couple next to me had spent 30 dollars on food and had to eat it without a drink because the drinks cart was on the other side of the plane. 40 minutes later the cart arrived and all their food had been eaten and still they had to purchase two cokes for another 10. the seats didnt recline properly. i asked for water about 67 times because i had no money to get anything else and they looked at me as if i was greedy or something.    westjet what is going on on my last two flights i have never been so disappointed in about two decades of dedicated flying with your company i as are many are aware that serious things are going on with the company however this shouldnt be impacting customer experience  especially on our own dime. we witnessed pilots caring less about their jobs lack of service in the cabin questionable delays causing missed flights and work inadequate response to the missed flights and issues surrounding accommodation etc. this is shocking we have never seen this before. for what was such a great company i can see many people rethinking how they now fly domestic and international. how is the company going to rectify the current state hope a resolution happens soon    boston to paris cdg via halifax. this was not a good experience. they were unable to get the boston to halifax flight to leave close to its original departure time. this led to my missing the halifax to paris flight. the delays were iterative so it was at first possible to take the halifax flight to paris but then not. i called westjet. the call dropped. after 100 minutes on the phone on a second call during which the westjet agent became increasingly frustrated and started yelling i finally got a new ticket route on british airways. by the time i got this it was very late to get to the airport. they had no new ticket number itinerary terminal or other details. i had to show up at british airways and explain my situation. i was the last person on the british airways plane because by the time westjet rerouted me it was already too late to check in at british airways. i missed my next flight out of paris. this cost me several hundred dollars. i thought i would save a bit for the sponsoring company of the trip when i booked this flight compared to a standard airline but i lost more by taking westjet in the end didnt get to my destination on time dealt with frustrated employees on the phone. westjet doesnt have good partnerships with other airlines so if they are late etc. you are basically out of luck. its a waste of money and time.    edmonton to abbotsford via calgary. i was on time for checkin and stood in line. an employee pulled me off the line to check in at kiosk. i was first one when she pulled me. i told her i am on the 145 flight and i have to get boarding pass. she took me to kiosk and asked me flight details. and said oh its time stand in line. so i dont understand what was the point to take me to kiosk. she could have rushed me to front of line so i can make it to flight. in simple terms its called customer service. but i guess westjet charges the passengers enough to not care what is customer service. i was in line again but still had 45 min on hand. the person to help took another 5 min to help me. again no communication by the lady who pulled me initially. many attendants were sitting on their desks they could pushed this through. he then argued with me for another 57 min. i told him that i can make it through security it is not busy. and all said was no. it was not my fault. and things can be moved around to help passengers realize that when everything else goes wrong customer service comes through.  i kept requesting and insisting as i had a really important event to attend and  was escalated to a manager. she kept me in talk for another 57 min. until she said oh you are not on 115 flight but on 145pm flight. okay. well i said that to everyone.  by the time i was put on next flight which will get me to abbotsford 2.5 hours late than my initial flight. she gave me the next flight boarding pass around 125 pm and i went for security. it took me literally 34 min at security. and i still tried but was refused saying departure is refused due to less than 10 min.     toronto to boston. do not volunteer to temporarily move to rear of plane for takeoff if asked. you will have to do same for descent & are then stuck back there after the plane lands. stewardess made no attempt to get us back to our seats & luggage after landing. if my husband had not reminded other passengers that we moved so plane could takeoff & land safely we would have missed our train home. attendant should have asked other passengers to say seated until we got back to our seats in front. completely unimpressed with lack of professionalism.    flew dublin to toronto. the plane was sort of clean and the seats offered a decent amount of comfort. the main complaint about westjet airlines is that there was a delay of about two hours but the airline employees never offered an explanation for the reason. the flight attendants were rude and very arrogant. the higher up employees of the company need to address this. you could train them better on how to be at least somewhat decent.    received the worst customer service. after a delay by the flight we missed our connecting flight. all they was to rebook us for the following morning. my daughter was on medication which we couldnt access. with no shared responsibility for it was not our fault the airline could try at least give us a warm tea or a cheap water bottle. no hotel assistance no food not even an apology.   dehradun to pune via delhi. most disorganized and inefficient airline i have ever travelled with. multiple delays standing in line for over 8 hours and talking with customer service on the phone for 5 hours with no help at all. do not fly with this airline. 26 may 2013 jaipur to chennai. i saw some dirty used cups and wet tissues in the seat pocket in front of me. i highlighted this immediately to the cabin crew whilst boarding was going on. told it would be cleaned in the next clearance and nothing could be done at that time. i was shocked and surprised with this answer. the cleaning was done in ahmedabad by ground staff and then the flight took off for my destination chennai. on time performance took higher importance over cleanliness and hygiene. the attitude of cabin crew was horrible. i will never fly indigo again. i recently travelled on an indigo flight from delhi to mumbai. my printed ticket stated that i was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 kgs one cabin bag of 7 kgs and in addition a laptop bag. however during check in i was asked to weigh all three pieces suitcase cabin bag and laptop and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. so please note that if you decide to travel with indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15kgs and all your cabin bags laptop shopping bags and cabin bag should not exceed 7 kgs. moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them. flight 6e 284 from chennai to delhi on 6th feb 2014. i took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that i did not have my breakfast before the flight. the flight duration to delhi is 150 minutes. i wanted to have my breakfast on the flight i was waiting with my purse in my hand. the air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. they just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. they simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. i gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated. i flew from pune to bangalore on 30th december 2013 on flt 6e 407. i bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful i usually fly indigo airline because of its assurance of timely arrivals and departures. ive never had a reason to complain until my last experience. the flight was delayed. but the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didnt even attempt to sell any meals on board. they just served passengers who had prebooked their meals. when i asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like id asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. this is the first time ive been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from indigo staff. pune to delhi. i had booked my meals under corporate plan. i was served food only 15 minutes before the flight was to land i.e 1.5 hrs after the flight took off. the service started late and then the crew were servingselling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. on other airlines food is first served to those who prebook. after selling to all they dont have many items left for serving. suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first. kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. i am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on goa  ahmedabad flight on 27th february. it was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. the onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. the passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. i was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. there was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. when we landed at ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. we were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. it was first time i had travelled indigo who boast of their punctuality. never again. flight 6e 473 from mumbai to bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 hrs due to weather conditions enroute to bangalore. however it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage  first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs bangalore airport is very efficient and i have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years  both domestic and international flights. this delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad coordination amongst the ground staff. today indigo airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive  they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. no supervisory staff were available to address the issue. rain had stopped when this flight landed. since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight  walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. none of us were wet  but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute indigo flight 6e 412 from kochi to bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. but the last bag for this indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. if the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the mumbaibangalore flight how can they blame the weather system i dont see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad coordination for this delay. poor ground service they asked me to check in my hand baggage for excess weight which i understand is the rule. but when i was boarding the aircraft i was amazed to find that loads of passengers had huge hand bags and in some cases multiple bags which possibly were more than the weight limit. the ground staff told me that they check the weight again at the boarding gate to ensure that there is no overweight baggage but i did not see any other bag being weighed other than mine we have taken the flight from indore and we are regular flyers with indigo. the seats were most uncomfortable. there was hardly any cushioning on the seat. experience of seat was more or less similar to as if we were seating on wooden bench. you have already curtailed seat pitch and now the uncushioned seats. you are requested to have some feeling for passengers minimum level of actual comfort also. looking forward for better and more comfortable seats. 6e 062. service has deteriorated. ontime urgency once seen is no longer seen. online seat booking charges for all aisle and window seats. you can only get middle seats for free. too money minded. 6e189 6th june. low budget airline  their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. on time is a good thing  their flights are often now delayed or run late. checkin process  everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. two days back on 4th june i did web check in for my 6th june flight using my smartphone. while i was successful in doing web checkin in spite of me giving the email address and phone no i did not get a copy of the boarding pass  beating the while process of doing web checkin. at delhi t1 terminal when i tried to print my boarding pass at the check in kiosk while it displayed the boarding pass i did not get my print out on taking it up with the ground staff i got a casual reply  please stand in the queue even though i mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. as a result i reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented sir you are very late please be on time next time i have booked 3 tickets for my family through online booking system. after i had filled in all the passenger details i was asked whether i would like to take the preassigned seats facility and i declined and continued with my booking. but to my surprise and disappointment i found seats were allotted together that included an aisle and window seat along with the middle seat. when i tried to change the seats it did not allow me and charged me rs 400 extra rs 200 each for window and aisle premium seats over and above the fare and there was no way i could change it. bombay to ahmedabad return i have long admired indigo for its focus on providing ontime service at a decent price with seats which are reasonably comfortable. i never minded paying the fee for better seats in the first row or exit row or for food which is against decent and i recommended it to many. however after a gap of over a year i flew indigo again and found the seats so thin and the fares were not that decent compared to some carriers.  delpnqpunedel. december 2014. worst possible time of the year to fly out of delhi. had horrible experiences due to the fog. the outgoing flight was 4hrs late. you might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. that being said i agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. complimentary snack box and teacoffee was provided. on the return flight night time flight we were diverted to ahmedabad due to fog. this was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt indigos reputation. we were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. when we approached the assistants at ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. no food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. we were boarded onto a new flight the following day. though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into. was travelling from dubai to mumbai. i was fond of indigo before this trip. checkin was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. however got some shopping from the duty free. as far as i know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. shopping at duty free is not considered as hand baggage weight. wait this is indigo. you would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. and charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at duty free. what more the person carries only manual slip. no credit cards accepted not even usd or inr globally accepted currency  home currency. had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. this was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks 40 aed  kg. plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. asked the cabin crew if i can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer i got was that i would have to pay extra if i want to sit. they would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. very disappointed with the approach. yet another bad experience with indigo from udaipur to mumbai. we arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure. we were told that seats were all web checked in so we were forced to take paid seats or sit in different rows. concept of unregulated extra charges within economy class is wrong. moreover these are not declared at the time of booking tickets.    kochi to hyderabad via mumbai. i earlier travelled to cochin it was delayed by 1.3 hours. this time they directly rescheduled my travel. i was supposed to travel from cochin to hyderabad via chennai. but they had rerouted me to mumbai then to hyderabad. before rescheduling directly they should have given me options of cancellation or showing next available flight options. i got delayed by more than 5 hours. who would want to suffer without sleep for purely airlines mistake  when i ask for compensation they  say you should have called before starting your travel.  bangalore to nagpur with indigo. on this trip to india i was fortunate enough to try 3 different airlines  air india jet airways and indigo. indigo definitely scored best in terms of its modern fleet however not recommended for international passengers due to its baggage restrictions. the fares arent that cheap compared to other airlines however air india allows the most baggage weight. the staff are young and attractive but truly inexperienced to handle situations. personally didnt have a choice since indigo had so many direct flights to remote cities.   indigo mumbai to delhi return. the outward journey started with a smooth and easy check in at mumbai. flight on time. the aircraft was clean and as per indigo standards. what was very poor on this flight was the crew. the leading stewardess in particular seemed to sit and do not much while the other crew worked. shame to see indigo crew standards falling. it was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available  ramen noodles were my best option. return flight had a great crew but the delhi airport check in was a nightmare. long lines people cutting lines. no indigo crew to help. quite a disappointing and sad experience. the days of looking for indigo flights to book may be over.    indore to delhi. staff at airport are pretty rude i had 1 checkin luggage and no hand luggage. my checkin luggage weight was 16.7kg. that lady was asking me to pay and when i said that i am not carrying any hand luggage still they said you can take out stuff and carry on hand luggage. i have been traveling with indigo for 7 years they are getting worse and not value for money.    bagdogra to delhi. checkin slightly chaotic at ixb. flight full to the last seat. service on board consisted of one cup of water. seats narrow with not much legroom which guaranteed very close contact to the neighbors. arrival in del on time but we had to wait for some 40 min for the checked baggage to appear. we had flown the same route with jet airways before who provided a much better experience than indigo.    we were traveling back from hyderabad to bangalore with our 85 year old mother and young children. the flight was delayed by 90 minutes in total and instead of arriving at 10.30pm we arrived at 12.05am. we had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate we were advised to go back and sit. as the passengers were coming through the passage we couldnt make our way back to the seats. the air hostesses were extremely rude repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. they were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. they asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. in summary an extremely annoying experience air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude intolerant and unwilling to listen.    bangalore to mumbai. indigos late night flights are always late. this is my third experience with same flight  flight is delayed by 1hr 10mins last time when i travelled a month before then it was delayed by 2 hours this is really horrible. generally this flight is taken by one who attends office whole day and then come for flight and you face this issue again and again. indigo will lose its reputation if they continue to do so.   the flight from delhi to ahmedabad was delayed by 2.30 hours in the night. scheduled departure was at 10.40 pm and actual departure is 12.50 pm. this was my second worst experience within a fortnight period with indigo. they just give the reason of technical glitch and no alternate arrangements are there.    kolkata to mumbai. i had a wheelchair passenger. indigo provided no help getting onto the flight to mumbai on nov 15. she had to walk to the gate. they issued the boarding pass but didnt wait for us and closed the gate 35 minutes before departure. they then charged me extra rs.6500 to get us on to another flight. i have noticed the exact same happening to another senior citizen couple at the mumbai airport on nov 28th. when i objected they issued two tickets to the couple for free. indigo seems to be cheating elderly people using this technique.   hyderabad to bengaluru. travel time check in procedure check out procedure and baggage collection are smooth and good. inside flight service is not good. our company has booked the ticket along with meals as well. i am not aware of it. i didnt check my boarding pass properly for special service. crew members did not inform me about my meals while going to bangalore. in return journey to hyderabad they provided 1 cookies box rs.50. 1coke rs.100. we pay more money for meals at the time of booking while not receiving the service we paid for.   had one of the worst experiences with indigo during a very critical moment. we had booked our flight 3 months ago. our flight was from trivandrum to patna via bengaluru. while we wer in thiruvananthapuram we got a phone call from indigo 2 days prior to our departure saying that one my flights has been canceled and other one rescheduled. i was suppose to leave trivandrum at 800 am and reach patna by 300pm afternoon and we had to travel all the way to nepal in order to attend a meeting on the very next day. indigo screwed us very bad and said they will provide us with a different flight but both on separate days. now i am here in trivandrum airport one day earlier to my actual departure and waiting for my flight which has been delayed once again. now i will reach bengaluru at midnight where i have to stay for 12 hours waiting for my next flight. now my time and money are completely wasted. staying over night in bengaluru costs minimum ₹5000 and on top im stuck here wasting my time when i had to attend a party. this will be last and final flight that i will book with indigo.    goa to mumbai. it was a worst experience we had at goa airport while travelling back to bombay. we got to indigo counter at 43mins prior. however we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500rs for next flight. we tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didnt show any respect or courtesy. it seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to bombay. as it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with air india and got back home. it was most inferior action by the indigo staff which could have been avoided.    journey from kochi to dubai seats were pretty cramped we asked for an aisle seat and the adjacent seat to that middle seat in this case as it was 3x3 but they gave us both an aisle seat that was still ok the passage area was not wide enough as you have to adjust yourself when an air hostess passes through. the seat was well cramped the storage area was good its a budget airlines with the cost of ticket of a normal airlines only benefit was that we have 30 kgs each. the storage area on above the seats was pretty wide. staff and service was pretty average  average experience.    dallas to philadelphia. horrible we had a direct flight they cancelled our flight last minute gave us a connecting flight this is the fourth time they did this to us. seems to me and other passengers they sell on a direct flight and cancel the last minute. other people we knew traveled on other airlines with direct flights they had no problems. so southwest can not use the weather as their typical excuse    i have been a loyal sw air passenger for years. i fly once a month at least. for a while the service has been subpar. flights are late like tonight with my connecting flight or earlier in july on my last flight. on my last flight i noticed a crack near my window. i told one of the attendants and she seemed annoyed. tonight i was checked in 40 minutes before the flight and was told my bag probably wouldnt make it. at the gate in san antonio i asked one of the attendants if my bag had made it. she said she had no way to check. really this decline started a few years ago when their gift cards for a free drink came with an expiration date. what kind of gift is that    on december 16 2016 i had a flight scheduled from denver to las vegas at 905 pm. southwest airlines knew of the impending snow storm yet they boarded the plane at 945 pm and made all the passengers sit on the tarmac for over 3.5 hours before diverting the plane back to the gate. southwest offered no direction except to stand in that line and rebook. the line wrapped around the terminal. i went home and never got to my destination. i will never fly southwest again. \\r\\r\\n the first only and last time we will be traveling with southwest. they say open seating makes the boarding faster. it doesnt. it makes it easier on their end because they do not have to spend the labor on seat selections etc. it is more like being treated like cattle in a chute. when you get to the plane you are still waiting to get seated just like every other airline out there. if you are lucky you might get to sit with your other family members. our family was not the only one that had to sit scattered throughout the plane. the attempts at humor by the flight staff did not help much either. the seats were cramped to point my shoulders hust from being so scrunched up and i am not that big of a person 510 220lbs. the beverage service gets you about 4 sips of your drink unless you order coffee or adult beverage. one of our pieces of luggage was severely damaged so we got a 50 coupon to be used on southwest airlines and only on southwest airlines. i think we are throwing it away. they found more ways to nickel and dime more money out of passenger fares. oakland to las vegas. i have not yet taken this flight yet but i was rescheduled to take this march 8 flight after my march 7 flight was canceled 2 months in advance with out any reason. we cannot take a later flight as i purchased these tickets to match up with a wedding trip in hawaii. when a customer is put at a disadvantage the company usually does something to accommodate the disadvantage they put the customer in. southwest only offered to refund my flight. but there is no other airline that is flying to our home that late. the only offer that would be accommodating is to refund atleast partial points or the money i had to spend to buy the points. now my husband and i have to spend 100 on a hotel room to stay the night in oakland. i am a southwest cardholder. two other family members are they only use southwest and that will change now. poor customer service and an unwillingness to refund me in points even    louisville to dallas via tampa. there wasnt enough room for all carryon bags. people forced to check personal bags including purses. seating was first come first serve but we werent told about that. i wasnt able to sit with my husband even after spending a good chunk of money for the tickets. squished between two strangers for a three hour flight. disappointed in the service. on a completely full flight from baltimore to chicago crew failed to tell passengers not to put coats and jackets in overhead so that our luggage could fit as is the custom. people do not want to check luggage when free carry on is the reason folks deal with the cut rate service of southwest. will be planning ahead next year to avoid the cattle call. this airline is like the now defunct peoples express a cattle call for real.    im normally a big fan of southwest but after my last few flights im left disappointed. flew from san jose to los angeles. the flight attendants have been passive aggressive and the captain virtually not understandable when heshe decides to speak. this particular flight was the worst. we were already delayed and then sat on the tarmac for almost 30 mins. i dont know what happened to southwest but please go back to the way it was.    \\r\\r\\nthis is the first and last time i fly southwest. im very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. i flew in from dallas lovefield to phoenix arizona for a business meeting. on my way out of dallas i found no line. but i did find two female southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. they were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in as well as print my boarding pass for me. when it came time to board i was in the b group. that was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. great since im 28going on 29 weeks pregnant and i may need to get up to use the rest room. ive only flown american and delta with assigned seats. i hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. i had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to san diego i believe. no big deal until the plan begins to get refueled the fumes were so strong and awful. fast forward a day im pleased to go home to dallas hoping for better luck with my seat this time. unfortunately my pass says im in group c. even further out from boarding than on my flight in. at our boarding time of 5.15pm we were told that the flight crew for our flight will not even land until 5.45pm that we may begin boarding at 6.10pm to leave at 6.30pm. this is all a maybe. you would think a company would have better logistics to get their staff here earlier or on time.     austin to denver. there was a checkin problem and they were no help. my wife and i could not even sit together. their pre boarding check in failed and screwed us. this is the last time i will ever use southwest airlines. the level of disrespect we received from their support people was beyond stupid. we paid extra for this too    newark to orlando. open seating policy. ive never flown southwest airlines before today. in fact were still taxiing as i write this. i was told the night before that there is an open seating policy with southwest but until boarding i didnt quite understand what that meant. for those of you who do not know when you checkin you are assigned a zone and a number. this is the order by which you board and from there its general admission. maybe that sounds fine until you travel with your wife and kid and realize that you will be forced to rely on the general good will of the 160 people who have boarded the plane ahead of you in order to sit with your family. we were not so fortunate. even when the entire plane of passengers was bribed with free drinks for the flight there were still no takers. i boarded the plane only to find 14 or so empty middle seats. this is my first and last flight on southwest airlines. the stupidest airline in the sky.    chicago to ft lauderdale. what the heck happened to southwest customer service is awful.  no customer support anymore. been having issues with them lately. today was the last straw. overbooked my flight wouldnt let me or my husband on. no seats available although the desk agent said we made the cut and would get on the plane. this was after a 2 hour delay. couldnt get us to our destination until a day and a half. for a 3 day getaway nope. vacation was cancelled. and when dealing with them after they dont care one bit. just want your money. what a shame of a company southwest has turned into. take note southwest or you are going to be losing customers. youve lost us. im not the only one noticing this decline as of late.    portland to austin. my complaint is the decline in southwest airlines customer service. id been a raving fan for decades about sw now im done. the straw that broke the camels back was me booking travel for my wife to meet me in dc for spring break. i booked the ticket in january for travel march 28th. when i left four days earlier for dc neither my wife or i received her confirmation so saturday i call southwest. the ticketing agent was great about helping us find my wifes confirmation she informed me i accidently made it for the 21st not the 28th and that they recorded it as a noshow. she said usually you forfeit the funds but in this case purchase a replacement short notice replacement for the date you wanted the 28th then mf call our customer relations team and they will allow you to use the prior dollars spent as a credit for 12 months against future travel. well today the 28th from my tradeshow i waited over 20 minutes until the agent answered the phone at 915am. she was very terse with me and said it didnt matter what the ticketing agent told me saturday that i did have to forfeit the few hundred dollars i spent on the prior ticket i did not use. i said even though i was instructed differently by a colleague of hers she said yes and that i cannot be connected to a supervisor as she is the only supervisor.    detroit to atlanta. the entire trip was terrible. the check in people were mean and not understanding in anyway. the airplane system was terribly unorganized and everyone we had to talk to was horrible besides one lady. we missed our first flight because the check in kiosk wasted our time. we eventually made it to atlanta. the flight back was mainly the same story except i ran ahead of my mother and made it to the gate. i told them we were here and that my mother was on her way. the man hadnt closed the door and started telling me he didnt want to and he had paperwork to finish before they could fly. my mother came not a minute later and the door was shut after she arrived. the entire experience has made me hate this airline and air travel in general. i would never recomend it to anyone else looking to fly.    i got to my gate my flight departure was at 845 and we didnt board until 10 min prior. the whole thing was disorganized and you couldnt hear a thing over the speakers. im in the military so im accustomed to getting called for priority boarding. i went up to the lady when we started boarding and asked her if they called military personnel up yet and she said only if i was in uniform. ive always just shown my id and then she said ok ill get to you in a second. she proceeded to let everyone in the first line pass by me while i stood there with my ticket while she just kept looking up at me seeing how embarrassed i was until the last person in the first line went by and then just took my ticket without a single word.  i wont be flying with southwest again.    midwaychicago to tampa  with southwest airlines. my husband and i havent flown in years. staff were friendly but not so helpful. the boarding process was fine until we actually got to the plane. we were unaware that there is not assigned seating. we had to separate him in front me in back. i was very upset about this as i was already nervous about the flight to begin with. now i had to sit with strangers. we were one of the last to board and it was obvious we were together tickets purchased together. not one staff member tried to help and see if they could get us seats together. the icing on the cake was the horrible uncomfortable flight between two larger men. at this point i had fully decided we would not fly southwest again. fortunately this flight was only 2.5hrs. their flights are cheap but i will pay the extra to a different airline to be comfortable and to sit with the people i am flying with. i did notice that they let families flying with children board first which is great i have two children that i would want with me too had they been traveling with us. one suggestion though maybe couples be allowed to board after that then singles could fill in the empty seats. or just have assigned seating.    orange county to louisville. when boarding my plane southwest airlines requested volunteers for being bumped onto another flight i was second in line to offer up my seat for 300. halfway getting onto the plane i was in the b boarding group they called me off of the plane. ten people had to climb over my suitcase while i got off the airplane and i was told after getting off that they didnt need me to volunteer anymore. angrily i reboarded the plane and was the last person to get on and had to sit in the only seat available in the very back of the plane. when i got to my connecting flight i was supposed to stay on the airplane and go to the next city. upon landing i was told to get off the airplane and would be moved to another plane at a different gate. this gate and plane change was not the only inconvenience the plane would now be delayed by 2.5 hours this would put me in at 0140am my husband has to work in the morning and we live nearly an hour away from the airport so he has to come get me in the middle of the night. my original arrival time would have been at 22.50 or 10.50 pm. the ticket lady told me that the pilot forgot his passport in cancun im not sure what that has to do with why the plane was over two hours late. this infuriated me. i am a frequent customer with this airline because of their cheap fares. i get you get what you pay for. i cant say i will be flying with them again unless im desperate for a cheap flight.   indianapolis to las vegas with southwest airlines. worst flying experience ive had. got a later flight nonstop booked to take off at 845 but my flight was delayed 3 times and by the 3rd time it was because the pilot had too many flying hours. they didnt have a back up pilot until roughly 20min after the plane has landed that backup pilot was in st. louis. so on my nonstop flight we had to make a stop. i bought the internet and it kept going on and off on and off. why offer internet if you cant have a stable connection better yet why do you charge for it if the internet is poor ridiculous honestly im very disappointed with southwest.    hartford to orlando. i will never fly southwest again they do not care at all about customers. my flight was cancelled only 4 hours before it was scheduled leave. when i called to see why it was cancelled they said they had no idea. i was flying down to visit family for only 3 days and i took off work.  they changed my flight to a 5am trip so now i had to wake up at 2am to get to the airport. when i called southwest they said that they couldnt do anything for me that it was not their fault or their responsibility. i wasnt asking for my money back i just wanted some type of compensation for my inconvenience.   this was the worst experience with southwest airlines yet. my plan was due to leave at 115pm from atlanta to orlando but was delayed until 6pm due to maintenance. the 6pm flight was then delayed until 745 making miss an important conference that i was booked for. i will never fly with southwest again    it was the worst flight ive ever taken. flew from fort lauderdale fl to islip ny. they delayed us an hour due to weather 2 hours due to air traffic control and then 5 hours because the pilots hours to fly had expired and they needed to find another crew. found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. they then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. i was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. they refused a hotel transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. they expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. i get on the flight for 24 hours later a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm. i had to reschedule my flight for the following day yet again and they werent willing to provide hotel transportation or food once again. so my flight was initially 6.30pm from fort lauderdale and we were supposed to land at 9.20pm in islip. we were given an hour delay due to weather 7.30pm10.30pm. after the delay we boarded the plane 7.00pm. they then proceeded to keep us on the plane for over an hour as directed by federal air traffic control 8.00pm. then they made us sit another hour on the plane demanding that we all stay in our seats and stay buckled because they expected to depart soon 9pm. after this hour the pilot comes on the pa system and told us that hes reached the maximum number of consecutive hours that the pilot policies allow 9.30. they took us back to the gate where we were given no updates or information for at least 2 hours 11.30. after this they told us that they were trying to find a pilot and crew to fly the plane. they then told us that our flight would board at 12.50am. they delayed us twice more until they cancelled my flight at approximately 2am. they automatically rebooked me for a flight that would board at 8.30am in fort lauderdale and would bring me to tampa. they would then give me a 10 hour layover in tampa. i would board the 10.30pm flight to islip and get back at approximately 1.30am. i waited in a line 3 hours to get this changed and also demanded a hotel transportation and food 5am. they hadnt fed us anything but a mini sized bag of mini pretzels and 6oz of water in 13 hours. they refused a hotel. they refused transportation. they refused food. they also told me that they could not change this horrible flight. i went back to them twice and harassed them before they finally put me on a flight that boarded exactly 24 hours from the one i originally had. the woman was extremely snotty and rude to me the entire time. i had to call my friend at 5 in the morning after she her parents and my parents stayed up the entire night. my friend picked me up at 5.45am because southwest wouldnt even provide me with a taxi.     i have flown southwest airlines through houston and dallas over 15 times in last year and there has been delay after delay after delay. most recent day was due to not having enough flight attendants  staff. southwest is an extremely unreliable airline. i fly out of new orleans twice per month and will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.    northwest florida beaches to nashville. im delayed at pcb airport with a baby and have made multiple attempts to get released from this flight and rebooked so i can get my daughter to a hotel and in the bed. we left the upstairs area where we were boarding without knowing we couldnt get back through and although ive spoken to several people here who work for swa everyone here is telling me they cant help me and ill have to keep waiting. ive also called the customer service number to attempt to make the changes that way and they to arent assisting me. all i need to do is rebook a flight for tomorrow and no one has shown any interest in helping me despite the fact that i have a very exhausted and upset child who needs to be in the bed. this has been by far the worst customer service experience ive ever had with an airline and will definitely cause me to reconsider ever booking another swa flight. this is truly a nightmare and the swa staff here should be better equipped to serve its customers.    chicago midway to phoenix. i set up a vacation for my wife to go see her best friend in arizona this is her first time flying. her flight was scheduled to leave from midway airport in chicago at 1115am. we got there a couple hours early got through checkout and thought we were good to go 40 minutes before shes supposed to board the flight got delayed and was now scheduled to leave at 135pm. we left to get some food and was back at the gate by 1245. they then delay the flight to 235. then  just minutes later they cancel the flight went to the counter to ask what to do. they told us as long as the ticket had todays date we can go to terminal b17 and catch that flight. so we go to b17 and they informed us that was wrong and that they were probably just trying to get us through the line. we then had to go stand in a different line which we waited in that line for an hour and a half and in that time only went half way. i finally go up to the terminal attendant to ask him what we can do. he again said we need to wait in that line in hopes of being put on standby. luckily a pilot overheard him and asked me what was going on. so i explained the story and he kindly went behind the desk and told them to change her over to that flight i thought we were home free but i was mistaken. he told her that instead of being a direct flight like the original flight i booked her there would be a layover in oakland. he said she wouldnt have to leave the plane when they go there. she called me in oakland saying they forced her off the plane and since the pilot had the ticket she didnt have a ticket to show the attendant who was rude. so she got off the plane and tried explaining to the attendant what happened. the attendant told her to bad cause you dont have a ticket. my wife went up to the counter panicking. the woman made a few calls and almost an hour later was able to get her on the flight to phoenix. in phoenix she was supposed to be picking up a rental car from advantage i purchased everything through southwest.com and when i called to verify the car they said there wasnt a reservation. when i called to ask southwest they said they dont rent through advantage. i asked to speak to a supervisor and they confirmed they do in fact rent through advantage. something apparently happened in processing the rental car so now her friend has to drive to phoenix to pick her up. this was the absolute worst experience with southwest.    chicago to las vegas. our row was completely missed to get drink order. when the flight attendant came around to drop drinkssnacks off to other rows we asked for a drink. we got an eye roll from the flight attendant after our entire row was completely awake yet again missed in the drink order. the gentleman aside from myself and my boy friend as rudely spoken to accusing him of being asleep which he was not. my boy friend also got a drink and while the attendant did seem preoccupied with attending to other guests on the flight my boy friend gently reminded him we ordered drinks which was followed by a rude comment and loud embarrassing response from the attendant on just how may people were on the flight and we had to wait. we would have not had said anything if he didnt seem completely dismissive with our request. i understand they are busy but the attendants responsive was just rude. this was my first trip with southwestern and the flight started off fantastic with the attendant making jokes and my previous flight before the lay over was seamless and fantastic. this absolutely ruined my experience with southwestern on how rude the attendant was.    due to fly san jose to santa ana. southwest sent me an email very late last night stating that they have changed my upcoming flight by 2.5 hours. no reason was given. they also did not call me to discuss the consequences of this to me. i wrote to their customer service and they replied that previously they would call the affected customer to discuss alternatives. now they only state that i can cancel and get a refund if i do not like their change. i asked for early boarding on the affected flight and their reply to that was absolutely no.    san diego to el paso. southwest has officially lost all business and thousands of dollars a year from someone who used to be a loyal customer. my mother has been very sick and i had to fly back home to el paso tx to be by her side. ive also had to push my flight back more than a few times cause i just cant leave her in this state. the last change somehow changed my flight to the same day same time. instead of the next day. they were able to look it up but still unwilling to do anything about it. they said their no show policy states there has to be an attempt to cancel the flight. why would someone first their flight to the same exact date and time. next if you were sure that it was for the next day why would you attempt to cancel it. i am so dissatisfied with their customer service     cancun to baltimore. on a way home our flight was #1612 and i agree with customers who had not pleasant experience with flight attentents. we had a few coupons for free drinks and decided to use it on a way home because it was my husband birthday. i ordered bloody mary. my drink was amazing. i received a can of mix packet of species and a bottle of vodka. i had over ice and had to add it to my plastic cup again to finish all liquid. my husband called a few times our flight attended to order more drinks for him. then we heard unnecessary comment  dont you think its too much of jack daniels maybe it was a joke but we paid for our drinks and it doesnt say how many drinks you can have. we are over 50 years old and i dont think those comments were appropriate. ourneighbor heard about celebrating birthday and decided to join us with her friend. she also ordered bloody mary. for our surprise light attendant brought her plastic cup with ice and already premixed drink. we were schocked. this lady saw me having like total of 2 cups versus one that she got. what happened to other part of vodka and mix of bloody mary are you guys trying to get 5drink and split it for 2 people not cool at all. very cheap move. i like southwest never had problems but this incident ruined my opinion about that. unfortunately its only airline we have to use to get to cancun and its very fast. ill try to order my drink in a future just to check if you will improve but how unsanitary is to biting unopened drinks.    st louis to atlanta. i have been flying southwest because theyre cheap. the thing they upsell you on is boarding order. for my flight on 926 i purchased business select and paid more for it for flight 426 so i could get priority boarding. when it came time to board the gate agent allowed everyone to board in whatever order they wanted regardless of their boarding number. i had a1 but because the gate agent said people could board in whatever order people pushed past me to board first. i asked the gate agent what was going on and why were not boarding in order. he said to just get on the plane. once on the plane i asked the lead flight attendant what was going on and she said the flight was light so just take a seat. i contacted southwests customer service web page and filled out a complaint. i got a response from a noreply email saying sorry but that they would do anything including not refunding the cost for the business select boarding they didnt deliver. my opinion of southwest airlines is theyre unethical to charge you for something and not deliver and then not even care. southwest is not just a shabby airline they are in my opinion scam artists.    denver to houston. absolutely awful experience on southwest. flew 1223 and massive snowstorm hits denver. roads getting to airport blocked hundreds of people unable to reach airport late at night so i called southwest enroute to state i would not be able to make flight and to rebook for next day. no one picked up on hold for 20 minutes so purchased a separate one way ticket for next morning so i could spend christmas with family. sent an email requesting them not to cancel return ticket since i would definitely still use it. on arrival the next morning was told my return ticket was cancelled since i was a no show for my original flight. argued and pleaded with agents on phone and at airport to reinstate reservation and told basically no way and it was my fault for not cancelling the outbound flight. explained again that i tried to call and sent an email and was told to not be argumentative but the very rude representative on phone. have 1k on united and travel southwest when schedule suits it but never again they just dont care.    flew atlanta to fort lauderdale. it was the worst flight experience i have ever been through. the staff especially the person boarding passengers was very disrespectful. i had a handicap father i was boarding with and the man did not let me go in with him when i was seated for group b they did not let me get seated until group c. i will never fly with this southwest airlines again and i dont recommend it for those who will fly with family.    philadelphia to orange county. southwest used to be good. i would have given them 5 stars back in the days. now they suck and are plain rude. i just had a call with customer service and the customer service guy literally said ok that is all and did not even say thank you for using southwest or any of their usual end call thank yous. i was the one that actually said ok have a good night. i at least have basic manners yet im not the one working the customer service job. hello if youre working customer service shouldnt you at least read the end call thank yous isnt it your job and basic manners to say at least a thank you for choosing southwest. im definitely never taking southwest again. just plain rude.    las vegas to washington. tiffany is my daughter and the cabin crew did not assist her with her guitar and where to place this. this is my daughters first time flying and we had informed the lady at the check in and she assured me that she will be assisted. as she can tell that i was really concerned. when my daughter landed in washington she was practically in tears because no one helped her with the guitar. she was embarrassed because a lot of people were looking at her and even the cabin crew. i am so upset that southwest cabin crew didnt care and just stood there and looked at her.    las vegas to orlando. this was my first time flying with southwest and my last my flight was delayed by an hour and the service was awful. i did not understand the cattle call for seating and counter person didnt explain the process well enough. on my departing flight from las vegas the agent at the gate was so very rude he appeared to be upset and snapped at several people. im so disappointed in my flight experience with southwest   flew southwest airlines from tampa florida to philadelphia. what a serious disappointment first my flight was canceled not once but three times. then i paid for early boarding and when they cancelled my flight that got cancelled. i specifically asked for it back the lady told me i did not need it because i qualified for family boarding. i told her to make sure she assured us that i would not be placed in the back. that was a lie. i spent the whole day at the airport with my 6 year old with no accommodation then to find out after i finally reached my destination that my bags did not arrive and i received them the following day with some of my items missing and luggage ripped bad first time flying with southwest never again   i am currently on flight #5823 from birmingham to san diego via las vegas. the date is january 8 2018. the flight departed at 11.10 am. the only female attendant on the plane is very rude. my 11 month old son was overheating and needed a diaper change. i was at the back of the plane and had to navigate my way to the front of the plane where for some reason the only changing table is located. the bathroom was occupied. so i was perfectly ok with waiting the few seconds it would take for the bathroom to open up. the woman turned saw me and without even asking if i needed anything or was ok snapped you know you cant wait here. youve got to go back to your seat. i told her we had just gotten up there and that this bathroom was the only one with a changing table. she didnt care so i had to go all the way to the back of the plane and change my son on the pull down tray which is disgusting for me and the other passengers. as if that wasnt humiliating enough the woman proceeds to get on the intercom as im walking back to my seat to announce apparently for the millionth time. her attitude knows no bounds that no one is allowed to wait at the bathrooms. i have flown southwest many times and enjoyed it. lines have formed many times and it wasnt an issue. but this womans behavior is unacceptable. my son was overheating and needed a change yet i basically was not allowed to use the only lavatory on the plane that had a changing table. i have flown many other airlines and none of them were as good as southwest but due to this experience i dont think i will ever fly again. id rather drive than put up with this kind of treatment.    milwaukee to nashville. i travel with my emotional support dog for anxiety  other mental health issues. i have flown with him through southwest before & had absolutely no issue. i have an id card for him that shows hes registered and that im his owner. i was supposed to fly out at 6pm today with my dog but the supervisor and staff at the mke airport wouldnt allow me to check my baggage or fly because i had my dog without proper documentation. i showed them on southwest.com it says employees may not ask for proof of disability then in a later paragraph claims the customer needs a doctors note. when i registered my dog as a service animal i was told that all you need is the id card. i missed my flight and  will now be paying a pet fee and flying at 4am instead of 6pm.    phoenix to las vegas. southwest has always done an impeccable job and tonight they let me down. there were 60 max people on our flight and then back 2 bathrooms were frozen. i sat in the back and had to use the restroom but they kept telling me it was closed. finally i used it. the flight attendants understood and i apologized but they werent having it. this was the first time i felt like southwest wasnt for the customer. which i know its stupid but i had to use the bathroom and they told me i couldnt.    new orleans to dallas. just found out today its okay to save seats on southwest airlines. no worries about your low boarding pass just get one person to check in and get an a pass and then go save seats for everyone save an entire row or more its okay just know the flight attendant will back you up. no worries about others even if they paid for early bird checkin you can now save seats on southwest.    orlando to puerto rico. traveling with my family wife son 9 daughter 13 went to sit in the exit row because my kids wanted to sit back themselves in the row behind us not an exit row and my kids fly several time a year by themselves. we paid for early bird check in so we could choose our seat and we done this several times before never being questioned. we were not allowed this because the flight attendant made a judgement call that in an emergency my wife and i would be conflicted and help our kids before performing our duty of opening the exit door. even after explaining what the situation was she refused and was extremely rude. definitely not what i have come to expect from southwest. i love having my judgement questioned by a complete stranger. we also checked their exit row policy and no where does it say anything about this.   i had a flight with southwest airlines from chicago to orlando. the flight was cancelled at the last moment by southwest. it was december 29th 2017. being peak season and no other available flight me and my family were left stranded. i was somehow able to reach orlando by taking another airlines and flew back from orlando to chicago with southwest. i requested for a refund of the amount for the cancelled flight from chicago to orlando. after 5 calls and 2 months southwest only provided me a partial refund and fails to give me an explanation for the partial refund. the customer care representatives are very nice and keep on apologizing to me for not providing me with the right refund amount but fail to provide the complete refund. every time i call i am put on hold for at least 1 hour for them to look in the matter and talk to the refund department. it has been a horrifying experience. i just hope they do not treat other passengers in the same way.    nashville to milwaukee. this last trip was just another reason why i should not deviate from my current provider. stewardess was not forthcoming about how many seat were available staying they were booked full and grab the first seat available. so i did big mistake as plenty of seats were still open in the back. i get to nashville and had to then ask at our scheduled time of departure what was going on. they said we are going to announce a delay. obviously when i asked what was t he cause of the delay no answer was given. i asked again and made it a little more clear. is the delay caused by weather or mechanical. reluctantly she said mechanical. typically this is where the professional representative at the counter offers to make amends for the company causing the 1.5hr delay making my arrival after midnight. not only was i not offered any miles or meal ticket i was give a get away from my desk look.     las vegas to phoenix. the worst flying experience ever. 3 hr late in 45 min fly. disrespectful employees. when i asked the counter person how come 3hr late the answer was do you want to go to phoenix or not after three hr late and sending me from one gate to another. i was frustrated and i complained the answer was the same do you want to go to phoenix or not this time from different person.    minneapolis to phoenix. terrible awful not enough words to describe the ridiculous boarding process. do not fly this airline if you want to sit next to your travel mate because you will end up in a middle seat every single time. extremely rude staff at every turn  in the terminal was the worst.even the flight crew was rude. i fly alaska airlines regularly and love it avoid southwest at all costs.    detroit to atlanta. absolutely horrible. flight was cancelled for a reason that has yet to be determined with no notice or knowledge of flight being cancelled until i got to the terminal no accommodations were made to get me to my destination. i was stuck on their airplane for 12 hours to get to my destination. flight attendants were snobby. friend also flew southwest and met me at our destination and on his return home his flight was delayed. save yourself a headache and fly anywhere but southwest.    houston to midland via dallas. our flight was delayed over an hour last night which i have no issue with because things happen. however the doors to the plane were still open and after repeated requests from most of the passengers the staff would tell us nothing of why exactly we were stalled so badly that a lot of us feared something was fishy sketchy etc. babies were screaming because they hadnt eaten in hours but moms were not allowed to go and get them food even though we sat there for a very long time. they wouldnt allow passengers to get up and use the restroom until we pretty much said we were going to just go everywhere. the staff was extremely rude and didnt communicate to anyone why we were being delayed again which is their job.  i overheard multiple families saying aloud this is why you dont fly southwest. nor i or any member of my family will fly southwest again    new orleans to san antonio via houston. flight was a few minutes late leaving new orleans. touched down in houston at 2.20pm. connect flight scheduled to leave houston at 2.30pm. would not let me board because we were too late getting in even though the connecting flight was delayed until 2.55pm. so now they have me sitting in the airport for another 5 hours for a 1 hour flight. i asked if i could catch something earlier. i was nice about it. staff was rude.    flew southwest airlines from las vegas to dallas. not the customer service of the past. i was at the gate with no announcements. they sold my ticket as i went to board and said i was too late. i was put on standby rotation out of vegas and no seats were available because all flights were supposedly sold out for the day. this was the reoccurring message until i purchased another 1000s in tickets for the next day. then and only then did they find openings to multiple direct flights out the same day. what a racket. no seats. sell my seat. buy another ticket. then oh look there are seats.   southwest airlines lied for reasons im sure are related to not compensating individuals. they use the excuse of weather related issues. i know for a fact that march 20th 9.20 am flight was canceled while the rest of the day flights left denver bound for bwi and bwi to denver went on until 10.20pm. they then canceled my next flight at the same time 9.20am the next day 1 hour later. needless to say i spent two days in a hotel next to denver airport. i spent over 700 for hotel food rental parking they hide behind the fact that they can say it was weather related so they do not have to compensate anyone. i do not like liars i will never use this airline again.  avoid if you are travelling with children over 4 years of age. my wife 5 year old son and i were unable to obtain a boarding pass prior to our arrival at the airport and as a result under southwests openseat policy we boarded when only single seats were available. my wife politely asked if any passenger would be willing to move so our son could sit with her and no one responded. the flight attendant did not attempt to assist us despite witnessing our dilemma. fortunately a sympathetic passenger finally offered to move to allow my wife to sit with our son. it appears southwest has decided that 5 year old children are sufficiently mature to sit apart from their parents on 3 hour flights. i recommend that you avoid southwest if you are flying with children over the age of 4 or your family may be placed in the same position as mine. when my flight was changed i thought my seat was guaranteed  after waiting 6 hours at the airport and finally on the plane i got called to the front just to get pulled for another passenger and then was told i need to pay extra to guarantee a seat on the next flight that was another 4 hours away. the worst 11 hours of my life. southwest are a cheap and cheerful airline and you get what you pay for. the cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircrafts clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline. over the past couple of years i have flown 7 sectors with them and my only complaint is with the ground checkin staff. they are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. the checkin system is different to what i am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when i was not sure how things worked. would i fly with them again probably not there are a lot of other airlines competing for the same business. after a five hour delay understandable because it was weather related we finally boarded our plane to san francisco via chicago. it wasnt until chicago that they told us that our leg to san francisco was canceled and the plane was now traveling to los angeles. being stranded in chicago with a five month old is not my idea of a vacation. on the return trip we got routed to minneapolis again weather. however when we did get to chicago we were told we now had to switch planes for the final leg back to ct. we specifically booked flights with no plane change because that is a hassle with an infant. my family will never fly southwest again. i flew from san antonio to san diego flight #2523 on 62912. i was not familiar with their boarding system. i did not know what the number pole at the boarding area was for. i wish they had informed passengers that we need to stay in number order. the guy doing the boarding stopped me and made me wait while everyone in my group boarded. i thought that was very rude. i also did not know they put the menu in the back of the seat. when i ask the attendant what they have to drink she was very rude and told me to look at the menu. their fare is cheap. the seats and aisle are very cramped. my flight was 30 minutes late. they take you from a to b  that is about it. my experience left a sour taste in my mouth. i always thought highly of southwest but not anymore. slcdenmdw  flying with my 3 kids and 2 nephews to visit grandpa in chicago. on our denver layover after waiting for 5 hours our flight was canceled due to electrical problems at mdw. we were directed to the sw ticket gate into a line with hundreds of people. after waiting in the line for an hour with 5 kids and hearing other passengers leave the line being told they would not get a flight for 2 days i found a hotel and rented a car for the night. in the morning i called sw to ask about rebooking our canceled flight. the agent told me i had to go to the airport to get someone to do it for me. she confirmed that my only option to get on a sw flight would be to drag 5 kids to the airport to wait for the next available flight in 40 hours and hope we got on that one. that is not a reasonable option so we rented a minivan in denver and drove to chicago. sw also lost our luggage. multiple attempts to call resulted in no one helping us. when we arrived in chicago went to midway and the bag was sitting there. i am so frustrated with an industry that is all take no give. you make them all these guarantees jump through their hoops and they give you nothing in return not even a refund when their product fails. flew from vegas to chicago. once we got the vegas airport we noticed a very disgruntled vibe. the usually happy southwest employees were very grouchy and seemed bothered to be there. we boarded the plane actually got the very first seat with tons of leg room and finally had the opportunity to stretch out for the long ride home. from the moment the plane was to take off the complaining started. i guess there was some sort of issue with the transair merger and the flight attendant union because that is all i heard about for the entire flight. they just went on and on as if they were out for coffee at some cafe. i dont even think they realized how inappropriate it was to complain while they were on the job and within earshot of customers. it made us very uncomfortable and annoyed. once we landed and all of bags didnt make it that kind of sealed the deal for us. no more southwest. beware when you check your bags you may not see them again. we did get our bag back at midnight so we were the lucky ones. i guess the we dont really care attitude of southwest is my major complaint. my family and i were given apparent seat numbers on our tickets which actually just mean the order in which you line up at the gate and the seating was actually open and poorly organized i might add. i did not purchase the tickets personally and did not know about the open seating policy so i thought someone was in my seat and told a flight attendant about it. she stared at me like i was crazy. it took me quite a while to find a seat on the plane and neither my wife nor myself could sit with our very young daughter in the end. before the return flight my wife had to get something out of her luggage so we asked an employee if she could get it for her. the woman rolled her eyes at us and scoffed before calling someone to get our luggage. the problem with this airline didnt end there. we waited an hour at baggage claim before they finally started loading bags onto the carousels. fly with southwest if you like inefficiency. poor customer service. daughters first solo flight a disaster. san diego to denver to pittsburgh no plane change just a stop in denver. got to denver early then delays left hour and 20 minutes late. get to pittsburgh not only did her luggage not make it but neither did some other passengers. filed report. they said theyd call when luggage found no phone call from them. went to san diego airport 40 minute trip one way plus parking for a second time to see if luggage here. no luck. concerns my wife who flew from minneapolis with a connecting flight in st. louis. final destination kansas city. plane left mpls on time arrived in st. louis 30 minutes late but were assured connecting flights would hold. upon arrival the flight left for st. louis about 10 minutes before the arrival of my wifes flight. there were 18 people on the mpls flight headed for kc. so presumably the flight to kc had 18 empty seats. next flight left approximately two hours later. upon arrival in st. louis there was no one at the desk they had to hunt down an sw employee to find out what was going on. columbus ticket counter was rude and condescending. flight was delayed getting to chicago. on leg from chicago to pdx our previous flight delay made us the last to enter the plane. we were traveling with a 6 week old baby and a 4 year old. the flight crew did not try to help us by asking people to move seats so we were separated for the flight. it was a terrible experience. it has been a while since we flew sw but i can say that we will avoid this airline as much as possible. horrible experience we sat in the plane for an hour only to realize that the flight was cancelled because a small plastic emergency sign would not illuminate i suspect there was more to it than that because the plane was empty on around 20 people on board. everyone on board suspected that they cancelled this flight because it was empty. there were no more flights out that night and we had to be in phoenix by 730 am for a competition. so after getting the cold shoulder from the front desk and a voucher that she was to lazy to put in my name and she couldnt refund our flight we had to do that the next day. we drove all night to make the competition the next morning. the prices are great and the staff on the airplane are always friendly. the staff on the groundat the gate are always less than desirable. my husband and i have flown southwest 3 times in the last year from baltimore and all 3 times i have a seat but he is on standby. they overbook flights all the time and then act like theyre doing me a favor by finding someone else to take a later flight. i paid for my tickets at least 23 months in advance. the customer service is absolutely awful at bwi. never again. lassea first time flying southwest my whole experience should be described as a visit to the zoo you line to the check in kiosks at airport where you print your boarding pass and insert the bags into the system then line again to see the agent with your tags the funny part is yet to come boarding process as someone here said is a cattle car thing they board by groups and family traveling together in different groups start scenes on the gate it delays everything. onboard crew not well groomed i had the impression they hated being there. the more i fly american legacy carriers the more i stop complaining about brazilian airlines. southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience i ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering i am on a flight 34 days a week. this was on flight 110 from fll to bna on may 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. however 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. i have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 6090 mins. this speaks about southwests abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. the flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 510 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. there hasnt been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or eta is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery. southwest is not the on time airline it used to be. i was on a flight from salt lake city to phoenix in march and it was delayed 5 hours. then my children were flying from phoenix to providence as unaccompanied minors in june and they were on the plane and it had an issue so they had to deplane and find another airplane. they arrived 3 hours late and one hour before my husband who was also flying into providence whose plane was delayed coming from tampa. so the grandfather had to drive to the airport at 12.30 am to get the kids as they were unaccompanied minors. now i am on a plane headed to boston and it is delayed by two hours taking away they night i had planned in the city. i have been a loyal swa customer but no more. this is one of the worst customer care i have seen i booked my a flight for my children 12 and 9 as junior travelers because swa had told me they would allow my sister to pick them up at the gate and they do not need someone there through out the flight. flight delayed an hour and did not allow my sister to the gate. swa personnel told her they would bring back the kids. however when my sister saw the woman without the kids her answer was they did not pay the fee. swa left them to sort it out on their own at 2am at boston airport i am from tucson and live in san diego. i make about 3 trips per year back to tucson and usually drive every time. i decided to try flying to save time. the car picked me up at 6.55pm on 612 for flight 499 from san to tus 9.05 flight time. i waited in the airport for 2 hours until we finally boarded at 9.15pm sat on runway for 20 minutes and finally took off at 9.42pm. again the flight was supposed to take off at 9.05pm. crew were unapologetic and slow moving. we didnt land until 10.50pm. on the way back to san diego on flight 1858 we were supposed to leave at 9.30am. it is 9.39am now and the estimated departure is now 10.15am. i have heard no updates from staff. no announcements. i will never fly southwest again. definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. the initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier checkin times so you get a chance to sit together. i checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. to my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats this airline is a nightmare however if you are traveling alone and can check in at least a week early and are comfortable with pushing shoving and being rude then maybe this airline is for you. they did not hold my plane for my connecting flight. i asked the flight attendant to whisk me to the front of the plane so i could make a run for it and he said theyll hold the plane for you. ive worked here for 25 years and weve never just left someone behind. well after waiting for 100 people to deplane i made a run for it and got to the gate just as the plane was pulling away. had a flight from md to fl the most unorganized flight i have ever been on. it is as if they have never had a flight before yes it was that bad i have been using this company for years and after this experience i will never use them again it was simply chaos. avoid at all cost houlgahou on 737300 both ways. boarding was chaotic cattle herding people onto the plane was very unusual and not efficient. seats and aircraft were outdated. seats were very uncomfortable and gave me little legroom. i found myself having to move around in my seat every 30 seconds. flight attendants were slow to respond. inflight entertainment was a skymall magazine free viewing of the news networks fox abc etc. free flight tracking software and slow overpriced wifi for 8 usd. turbulence was awful coming into lga. only good thing about was that you get 2 bags free. july 23 flight 2528. very poor customer service from flight attendant. i realize its been a long day for them but when customer service is 90 of your job the expectation is that you bite your younger when passengers are upset about unexpected plane changes. her condescending hun is unacceptable. my plane landed at 6pm today. i wasnt even suppose to leave the plane just board more passengers then off to flint. well we all had to unload and wait for them to find another pilot. for an hour were held due to weather issues. then they decided the pilot would be with us at 9pm this was delayed until 945. so we load get ready to leave at 10.15 and then there was a mechanical issue that had to be checked. 30 mins later we finally got ready to take off. then the pilot comes over the pa to tell us we were going back to the gate. so 11.00 at night and were waiting for them to find another pilot. moral of the story. save yourself time and money and dont fly southwest. i recently flew to new york city and my airport was laguardia. the flight to new york was fine and went without a problem. however my return flight home where i was on a time crunch was quite different. i recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of sw and for safety considerations all flights in and out of laguardia were delayed. the terminal at laguardia is far too small to accommodate the business for southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. sw had one customer care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. finally another representative showed up. then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be i have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. it was unbearable in that worn out terminal  nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. i stood in line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisormanager that there would no problem. after 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal i went out of security back down to the checkin counter where i found a representative who was helpful. i dont think i will take sw to new york especially via laguardia ever again. from vegas back to san francisco. in group b i was one of the first people to board the plane. when i heard my group being called i stood in line in the right number section that was written on my boarding pass. following the people in line in front of me i presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way i never want to fly southwest again. as i presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. she instead grumbled this isnt your group. please wait to board when i call your group. confused i replied is this group b she stared at the pass for a while and responded oh i thought i called the wrong group and finally let me board. this frustrated me as the attendant didnt make eye contact with me the whole time we were talking. the captain and crew members were unprofessional and laughed many times over the main speaker when making announcements. my flight was on sunday around 10.30am departing from vegas. not such a great way to end my vacation. had the displeasure of flying flight 2878 922013 last night from dallas to st. louis. flight was supposed to depart at 7.05pm but we were in the plane on the ground at 7.25pm when i got a voice mail message from southwest airlines to tell me that the flight would leave at 7.25pm. flight taxied out at 7.35pm and got in position to take off when the flight crew declared a medical emergency and returned to the terminal where we sat until 8.05pm. finally took off and landed in st. louis at 9.30pm  50 minutes late. sunday night flights to st. louis are repeatedly late. flight 3246 from chicago midway to columbus ohio on 11413. they used to be the cheapest no longer. they used to have the best service now they are going to start charging for bags. they used to be on time im sitting 3 hours late in an airport for the 6th time in 4 months i am so disappointed. i used to rave about southwest but things have taken a turn for the worse first flight out at 7am and the plane had mechanical issues so we were delayed. we missed our connecting flight. as we were deplaning the flight staff informed us that they held the southwest connection for those 31 passengers going to las vegas however since there were only 19 of us headed to lax we had to be rebooked. they proceeded to take us to fort lauderdale with an ensuing 7 hour layover and then a delay on the tarmac for another hour i think the worst part was not once did any southwest employee acknowledge our inconvenience. yesterday 1062013 my husband and i traveled on flight #320 from phoenix to sf and although the trip was smooth and uneventful we were disappointed that throughout the entire flight except the last few minutes for landing the lights in the cabin were dimmed a bit but were never turned completely off. i can only speak for the two of us but i found it very annoying and not relaxing at all. it turned our two hour flight that i was looking forward to closing my eyes and relaxing to one in which i was looking at my watch frequently anxious for the flight to end. disappointing for sure flew from detroit on jan 4 2013 flight 2112 to las vegas with my 10 year old son who is autistic and has glaucoma. flight was delayed 2 hours while we waited for a 3rd flight attendant. the gentleman taking tickets was making jokes and doing a comedy routine once we finally got on board his parting shot was sorry for the delay hope you had as much fun as we did. when we landed the flight attendants got on the pa and said finally like the passengers were responsible for the delay. missed our connection to burbank that flight was delayed as well but they apparently could not wait another 20 minutes or so to get the rest of the passengers on. i told the agent im flexible and can fly into any airport in southern california. she seemed to be put out at having to help any of us. their solution was to basically throw their hands in the air and put us all on standby. the did offer lodging though. thankfully i spoke with a different agent and she was able to get us to orange county. have never seen a more unprofessional airline. delayed 4 hours each way from philadelphia to california. no explanation whatsoever. they put me on a different flight and my luggage on the original flight and then lost my luggage i would rather walk than take southwest. we signed up for flight notifications with an email address. we were told at the airport that we had been notified at 11.45 that our flight was cancelled. we had not been notified and neither had anyone else in line around us. had we been notified we would have known not to leave for our 3 pm flight and not to waste 3 hours going to the airport and standing in line to change our flight. why were there only 3 customer service people handling the hundreds of people standing in line southwest used to be the go to airline. no longer. what a disappointment. the customer service rep was polite but really could not have cared less. admittedly there was a storm two days before we wanted to arrive in our destination of indianapolis. they repeatedly lied to us and told us that the indianapolis airport was closed when there were other airlines flying into indianapolis from the same airport. they changed our flight 10 times. after they cancelled our flight to indy they put us on another flight to louisville airport after we received this confirmation the flight was reinstated but we lost our spot. they never gave us meal vouchers or paid for a hotel. they refused to get us a ticket with any other airline actually flying into indianapolis too. all in all the worst experience i have eve had with any company. i was horrified by the policy of changing flights at southwest. i had a round trip ticket and was able to return home earlier so arrived at nashville airport 11.30 looking to get on the almost empty 1.20 pm flight. i was informed that i would have to pay 250 to purchase a new one way ticket home. i paid less than that for the roundtrip flight. i did not expect this since i was told that sw was customer friendly and did not charge change fees. no they just charge you for a whole new ticket instead. i am trapped in nashville for the next 8.5 hours thanks to their policy. 15 minutes before scheduled takeoff gate announces delay. 45 minutes later gate announces mechanical problems and further delays. all passenger were being rerouted. 3 hours later flight is canceled and they offer to get me home tomorrow with no compensation for delay. its as if they said if our planes fly we will take you if not too bad there are no guarantees. finally when i asked to be booked on tomorrows flight until i could see if i could buy a ticket on another airline i was told if we do we can not refund any of your money because we will have solved your problem. i had my two minor sons fly from my moms in oak to lax. when they arrived at the airport my mother went about getting them checked in. they were treated as if they were 18 and 25 they were not boarded separately note were they seated by flight attendants. the attendants only offered he usual snack and drink and when they deplaned they were sent off of the plane into lax terminal unaccompanied when i asked about the policy we were told that since our 13 year old was over the age of 11 he was responsible for our six year old traveling with him. this is a cash cow low class airline which i will never allow my kids to travel on again southwest flight 950 from oakland to los angeles on friday april 18 2014. return trip from denver change in baltimore than land in islip ny landing at 8.45pm. i did not know that the first leg of the trip was stopping in louisville but i learned that a direct flight does not mean nonstop. louisville to baltimore was canceled and i was the only passenger that they let on all others were stopped and told about the situation. there was no announcement about the cancellation so when we landed in louisville i asked the flight attendant and she sent me to the gate attendant who put me on a flight to chicago then to laguardia airport landing at 12.00am. told my luggage was left on the plane that was going to orlando. turns out my luggage didnt go to orlando and was taken off in louisville. it eventually made its way to islip the next day. because of the late arrival and distance from home i was forced to get a car service at a cost of 120. had the worst flight ever from south west. we were stuck on the plane from 9am  7pm pst with no food. my husband 18 month old baby and i were supposed to fly from raleigh to portland oregon. we noted our layovers in houston and kansas city and planned on getting food during the stops. when our first flight landed in houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight. same thing happened in kansas city. there was no optional food we could purchase. we were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl. we had also planned on purchasing wifi to have our daughter watch netflix which was also unavailable. insult to injury the last leg of the flight when i went to change my daughters diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing. i have tried to email southwest airlines in hopes to know my complaints were heard and no response. i have also tried twitter on multiple occasions. this is the first and last time i will fly southwest. our flight was delayed from l.a. to chicago and our connecting flight was also delayed. the connection left an hour earlier than the listed time on the website. the next available flight was 17hrs later. the customer service agents were rude condescending and were of no help at all. we rented a car to drive 12 hours home but not before waiting 4 hours for our luggage. this service is shameful. i will never fly southwest again and i would never recommend this airline. i will never fly this airline again. flight 37 was to take off at 4.50pm from houston to atlanta and due to weather conditions it was delayed which was understandable. however we were never updated on the flight we kept being told that the flight was in route when it apparently wasnt and finally after 5 hours the plane arrived from dallas  a 1 hour flight. then we were told after it arrived that the pilot had timed out and couldnt fly anymore. just lies and more lies and finally a supervisor informed us that another flight was supposed to arrive at 12.10 am and at this point we are still waiting. there was no accurate information disseminated at no time i understand that things happen but accurate communication is essential but this was totally ridiculous and unacceptable this was the first and last time i plan to fly with southwesttransair. the plane was dirty and noisy. the staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. the internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. it was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. i am only 5 feet 2 but i could not even get my legs comfortable. there was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. when we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. i said goodbye and she barely looked up. the pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. the only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but i can find that with any airline. i will definitely be going back to the airline i have been using for decades. that way i know what i will be getting for my money. sorry but this one bad flight put a sour taste in my mouth and wallet. not very impressed. its been my third time the flight has been delayed and i got a 15 minute heads up of course that update was completely useless as i was already being reassigned planes. taking into consideration that nothing can be done about poor weather the boarding process is awful and the representatives at the fort lauderdale front desk seemed very inconvenienced that they had to rebook us. it would really have made a difference if some genuine expression was portrayed. march 30th 2014. hartford ct. to las vegas. while waiting to board the flight i noticed a very angry looking male flight attendant wandering around the gate area he was on our flight and his mood didnt improve for the entire 5.5 hour flight. during a short period of relatively smooth air the crew started taking drink orders. fortunately on the way home the crew were very pleasant with passengers. the plane was a 737700 fairly comfortable and the free snacks were a nice surprise. i received an early notice that the flight was going to be delayed one hour. okay that is not a problem. when i got on the flight one hour later i sat for another additional hour my flight was delayed over two hours one hour was just spent sitting on the plane. turns out southwest overbooked the flight. the flight attendants also had no idea what was going on. while on the plane they made an announcement that if anyone would volunteer to go on a later flight they would get reimbursed and have a free round trip flight. very disorganized. i had a rehearsal dinner to attend that i made only the last few minutes of. i doubt i will fly southwest anymore. after being delayed 4 hours in raleigh durham i caught a flight to baltimore and on to kansas city. i sat in an aisle seat next to a large 300 pound man. obviously i leaned out into the aisle to accommodate for the gentleman. my feet never were in the aisle but my shoulder was. throughout the 2.5 hour flight i was bumped progressively harder in my shoulder 8 times by the only female flight attendant on staff. never once when she was walking towards me from the front. always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. never once an excuse me or a turn around to see what shed just hit. seemed pretty intentional after the last one before landing in kc. maybe she would be of more use loading bags somewhere away from others southwest airlines has joined the ranks of all other airlines poor and unsupporting. stuck my two sons in st. louis for 24 hours due to a mechanical in denver. routing to grand rapids was via orlando. watch out for the fact they cannotdo not interline. united and delta had flights open but the loaner swa wont play with the others. ended up buying them tickets on american for less money to get them home. i wont fly southwest anymore. i was a loyal customer for 13 years. i feel this company has lost sight of there core value customer service. the idea of adding 6 extra seats to there boeing 737 configuration is a travesty. the loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. my luggage was lost on my last trip from smfpdx i was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag golf clubs could would not be delivered to bend or where i was staying. the new policy of swa does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. so i can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it fed ex 23 business days. thats not going to work when i am only staying for 3 days. the new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. i thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. so now swa will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight. but if you dont show up for the flight they have no problem taking your money with no refund or accommodation. sjc to pdx. i have never experienced such poor customer service in the 13 years i have been traveling with this airline. i have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. i stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. despite having a huge incentive voucher from alaska airlines i will say that after this experience i have completely given up on southwest airlines as a competitor. i was greeted by a customer service representative with a mouthful of french fry after being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. i asked why i was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport the representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. after waiting four hours with no communication form southwest employees an announcement was made. my flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. the chaos that ensued was unreal. before i knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers. i opted to leave the airport and fly alaska airlines the next day. my daughters were competing in orlando florida. my wife scheduled an 8.30 am flight 3 months ago to make sure to be there. right after the passengers boarded the flight the pilot announced to passengers that there was a problem with the plane. the passengers deplaned and were told that sw was working on getting another plane a direct flight. there was no direct flight offered and after being told they would be leaving at 5 different times sw finally decided to bump the 3pm flight for the 8.30 am passengers. for all my wifes troubles she was given a measly 200 voucher. she could have driven from dallas to orlando faster than sw got her there. today when i showed at the airport i was informed that my flight would be late and that i had to be rerouted. this change puts me at my destination airport approximately 3 hours later than my original ticket. my wife and children now have to pick me up well past their normal bed time our children are young. additionally my boarding number is well past what i had checked in with for my original flight instead of early b im now late c. i now have to wait at my departure airport 4.5 hours instead of my planned 1.5 hours. this type of customer handling is unacceptable. southwest airlines is supposed to be one of the top tier airlines in regards to customer satisfaction however my treatment today was truly unexpected. i should have been upgraded to business class seating a1a15 at least at a discounted price. instead i was offered nothing for my inconveniences as well as my familys. i truly understand that things happen outside of southwests control but i think some concession should have been offered. this would have made me feel better. instead i feel like southwests attitude towards its passengerscustomers is deal with it with a smile and a nod and a next customer please attitude. got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. this happens of course but a few major issues. first they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. it was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. all the announcement said was if you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. there is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is. something along those lines. so all you know is that there is a problem with the plane we all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. next if you do have delays or cancellations in your flight southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. other airlines have done this for me in the past. this is obviously a huge issue. you may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another southwest flight that isnt booked and is flying where you are going. and you cant even really fly to a nearby airport because southwest doesnt service many cities. other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay. southwest cannot and will not do the same. i was scheduled to leave for minneapolis at 7.55 last night. yes there was a heavy rainstorm and yes flights were delayed. but southwest seems completely incapable of telling passengers whats going on or correcting a problem. i was then told the plane would leave at 11.15 then its leaving at 12.15 am. then its leaving at 1.30 am. 2 am they let us on the plane and we wait for an hour. pilot time has been used up so we have to wait for another pilot. we wait an hour. no pilot. flight is canceled. i make reservations for a flight out that morning at 5.30. get my ticket go to the gate. cancelled. so wheres the bag that i checked on the flight. they cant provide any answers. all they seem capable of telling me is that was an act of god and therefore they are not responsible for anything that happened. yes its cheap but thats no excuse for treating everyone like cattle. i will never travel on it again. today was my second time taking southwest. the 7am flight from lax to sfo was cancelled for maintenance issues. they did not have a backup plane at lax to accommodate their passengers. the solution that they came up with was to book all of the passengers on standby to sfo and oak. i am now waiting to find out even if we can fly at 9.20am or not. which cant be answered until 8.50am. this is an unacceptable way to treat customers and i am sure is ruining more than the start of my vacation. this is the time that people book to have a get away for the weekend. i booked a trip to fly from houston to lubbock with a stop in austin. the flight went smoothly from houston to austin in austin i had a 2 hour stopover until my flight to lubbock i fell asleep and missed my flight and when i went to the gate agent saying that i missed my flight she just shrugged and showed me two boarding passes and said i could get on a flight to lubbock via dallas i accepted and she gave me the boarding pass. the flight to dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in dallas. i finally got to lubbock at 10.50. the next morning i went on southwest.com and went to see if my points had posted i found out they didnt so i called southwest and they told me that i didnt receive my points because i missed my original flight. i will never fly southwest again because they have terrible service. due to a family emergency i was forced to fly sw again on sunday august 3rd even after i promised myself never again after 3 other bad experiences in sw. my first flight went out okay but the connection in baltimore was awful. first they asked for 3 volunteers to trade their seats for 300 vouchers due to sw oversold the flight. after we finally boarded the plane the captain announces a mechanical malfunction so we all had to deplaned. they began lying to people in order to keep them calmed. after they decided that each flight should go in 2 different groups orlando and raleigh another hour passed and we were still dont know the real reason we couldnt board a 2nd plane .two hrs later they decided to switch gates again and telling us that because plane #2 also had a mechanical problem we have to now board plane #3 all of the sudden they announced that the two initial flights became one again what a mess i finally arrived to my emergency 3 hrs later. flight 4111 on 726 and 3371 on 731. this airline not only messed up my flight down to florida but also messed up my flight back home this is the worst airline choice you can possibly have if you decide to book a flight make sure you book it for the earliest possible time because you wont end up on a plane until the middle of the night anyways. this is such a terrible airline. fll to msp and return. staff mustve taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took there were 4 total for the round trip all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. they looked like they had to be there. an elderly woman who couldnt sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that because of their no assigned seats policy was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then i saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it. the seats are comfortable enough but there is no perks to paying the extra 12 a ticket for the early bird check in unless you are just partial to a window seat. i got a3036 boarding most times which is after the first a group picks all the leg room seats. the only thing i like is that you can control whether or not you sit in front of kids if you dont want to you find a seat in front of adults already sitting. my husband took a flight to go to a funeral in charlotte nc this past month. the flight down was fine the flight back however was a nightmare they canceled the flight with no prior warning and did nothing to help their passengers from being stranded in the airport. in fact the customer service representative was horrendous. when i called to try to fix the problem she not only had no sympathy for the stress they were causing their customers but she also laughed at me when i was voicing my concerns about the fact that the only flight she was offering us was for wednesday and his original flight was for monday. the only solution she had was either take the wednesday flight and figure out a place to stay for 2 nights or they will refund our ticket price not the fees included with the ticket and we were tasked with finding another flight with a different airline to get home. southwest has no issue with leaving their customers stranded in an airport with no alternative plan than to find your own way home. i would never recommend them as they dont care about their customer experience at all and refuse to respond to complaints. went on vacation july 918. flight out to denver was ok  nothing special. seats were very cramped. flight 2068 back from denver to boston was horrible to start flight was delayed twice. we were a party of 4 sitting all the way in the back. from the time we got in the air until about three quarters of the way through the flight the two female flight attendants and one male flight attendant were just horrible. when one of the females came around asking for beverage requests i asked for a coffee. everyone in my party received their drink except me no coffee. but it got worse after drinks were served these three attendants proceeded to stand in the back by the bathroom and galley and talk and laugh extremely loudly with no regard whatsoever for all of us in the back of the plane including two toddlers who were trying to sleep. they kept up their loud talking and shrieking laughter for over an hour. it was absolutely horrible and disrespectful. i will never fly southwest again. august 16 flight 74 indianapolis to orlando. in great contrast to our august 11 trip from orlando to indianapolis flt 4453 that provided the usual friendly service from southwest attendants our experience today was the exact opposite. upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carryons. we never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane. the attendants in the front of the plane a male and female did their job and that was about it  bare minimum. from the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy. i noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that i overheard. i flew on flight 3276 from atl to tpa on august 9. this was my very first flight on southwest and hopefully my last as they kept on delaying the flight to avoid paying for hotel rooms for passengers who were late coming from a connecting flight. i will say that i have never experienced this flying with multiple other airlines and i will do everything i can from here on to avoid flying with southwest airlines. we recently travelled from burbank to denver. this is the worst airline i have travelled with. the flight attendants were rude too with bad attitudes. this airline also allow full size cases on board instead of the usual hand luggage resulting in those with genuine hand luggage to force under a seat which resulted in cramped seating and no leg room. thank goodness the flight was only 2 hours 20 minutes which was long enough in those conditions. they also dont allocate seating resulting in a free for all. i recently flew with southwest. i was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. although i was aware that the southwest boarding system was different i had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. long story short whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. i needed to travel within the last few weeks from st louis international airport to washington dulles international airport. i would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. in order to get a better seat on the airplane i paid the extra money for a business select ticket. this puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. southwest seating is first come first serve. on my way to d.c. the system worked well enough although on my first flight i did not get a great seat as i was boarding in position a15. that didnt bother me much the system had worked as designed. my second flight i was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. however on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. the problem started when it was time to board after a layover at midway airport in chicago. now i first want to say that i support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to preboard. but i do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. my ticket from midway to st louis had me boarding in position a1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for preboarding. there were four preboard passengers ahead of me. when the gate agent called for preboarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. not acceptable. by the time i got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. the four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. why cant southwest declare the front row an exit row it is an exit row that would prevent preboarders from sitting there. what did i pay extra for to get priority seating if southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people in the end i paid and they did not deliver. i recommend that if you choose to fly southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. i personally will not be flying southwest again under any circumstances. plane was supposed to depart at 10.25am it is 11.20am now and we are still waiting to leave. no beverages have been offered and everyone on the flight is becoming frustrated. they made an announcement while i am writing this review. they said we are still repairing the aircraft and we will update in 15 minutes or so. this is absolutely ridiculous. a full flight sitting in a hot plane for an hour now and we are about to take off in a plane that has just been repaired. my multiple time flying with southwest and this will be my last. we are flying from birmingham to albany. before deplaning we learned there is an hour delay for our 2 hour layover in baltimore. we are not surprised as my husband had a 2 hr delay from albany to jackson a few days ago my sister in law had a 2 hr delay flying from dc to panama city and we were delayed 3 hrs flying from laguardia in our layover in nashville. if you want to get anywhere on time i would suggest a different airline. we have almost a full day of list time in delays and have been offered no apologies and no compensation. this is our vacation time and we work hard all year for it it is valuable family time and weve paid richly to be robbed of it. i will never fly southwest again. i paid for the early bird check in as i do on most of my flights. i checked in online the day before at 3.30pm which is 5 hours after i needed to if i didnt pay for the earlybird check in. when i checkin i was given a31 and a32 but didnt print my boarding pass as i didnt have access to a printer. the next morning before my flight i printed my boarding pass and was given b32 and b33. when i got to the gate i asked the front desk women at the gate what was going on. she said we dont guarantee what number you get. i told her that i checked in and received a3132 and she told me again. we dont guarantee the numbers. i told her that this was a ripoff and that if i wasnt traveling with another family i probably wouldnt have made a big deal but since they also checked the same time i did and they received b282930 and didnt pay for the earlybird that something was wrong. she told me that there is nothing she can do and id have to write southwest for a reply. she looked things up on her computer and said that the earlybird for this flight never went through on my flight back. i will be looking for other airlines for my flights for now on. live near bwi one of sw biggest hubs. use sw for short nonstops but even those are becoming intolerable. flight attendants show up after boarding time. apparently unconcerned that delay 150 or so people so they can have 10 more minutes to do whatever. rude instructions when boarding. told to put my bag in bin down the aisle despite having space above my seat to save room for other bags unbelievably stupid as i have to go against traffic to retrieve bag now. theyve gone from a cattle car based on their southwest origins to a chicken coop. they advertise heavily bags fly free  didnt know they meant they would treat live human customers as baggage. my wife and i experienced southwest at its worst on a flight from montego bay jamaica  you just cant make this up. flight delay in mbj  3pm flight left mbj at 930pm told that the plane was originally diverted due to southwest forgetting to renew its license to fly over cuba. complete lack of communication by southwest staff during 6 hour delay. once on the plane at mbj the cabin crew promptly told us that the delay was not their fault so dont take it out on us. no apology  just that statement. deplaning delayed 15 minutes at mco due to incorrect gate height. 1 hour wait after customs at southwest counter for new flight and hotelflight voucher  there were only 2 agents. couldnt get a flight voucher as southwest took all computers down for their own overnight daily maintenance. had to go back and stand in line again in the morning to receive flight vouchers. rebooked flight of course had c boarding group  had to beg for the heart stamp by agents to allow us to board as b1. flight to mht on the 14th was delayed 30 minutes making us have to run to make our connection in bwi. my family my husband and i and our two children ages 11 and 14 are well seasoned travelers. we live in the ny area and fly out of laguardia several times a year. we know laguardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. this weekend was the first time weve ever flown southwest. southwest is the worst airline we have been on. who came up with no assigned seating we were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in line b while we were in line a. we had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isnt strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. there were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over 1000 for our flights in total were even going to be seated together. our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. i never book a flight unless i can see the seating chart and pick our seats before i pay for the flight. this wasnt even an option for us. so i was anxious because i was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. i had to set my alarm on my phone so i remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. our flight out of laguardia was a nightmare theres nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. so my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. there were no tv monitors on telling us when we were going to board. we had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasnt even a plane at the gate. and they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. they never announced when we were going to start boarding. and once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be. i do know that i will never fly southwest again. on november 6 2014 flew from west palm beach to las vegas via atlanta in business select. had not flow sw in years but it is apparent the service has deteriorated. the open seating is a joke and as well as the business select status. pre boards get the best seats which are clearly exit rows and the first row. i was traveling with someone who is 63 and 275lbs. and it was torture for them to sit in a very small seat with no leg room to elbow room and hard seats. staff are rude and have poor attitudes. friday 13th 2015 flight 2745 from san diego to phoenix. i will never fly southwest again gate agent was so rude bossing people around and just the worst customer service ever. and of course the seating is a total nightmare not sure how this airline is still in business. tampa fl to phoenix az on 25. dont waste your money on the extra 25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have early bird check in. it is a total waste of money. for our first flight from tampa fl to phoenix on 2515 i paid the extra 25 for each ticket and our position in line was a59 and a60. that is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra 25 to have expedited boarding. on the return southwest flight from phoenix to tampa on 210 our positions in line were b26 and b27. when i asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back i was told that it has to do with 1 the number of people on the flight there were 175 people on the flight so i was told that at least half of them selected the early bird check in option. 2 when i got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was i purchased our tickets on 121514 with the wanna get away fare. 3 when i got online to preboard i did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time. so to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the early bird fee no i asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra 25 per ticket per flight. i also asked some of the people in the a line and they had not purchased the early bird option. evaluation do not spend the extra 25  it is a total waste of money. i flew from richmond to fort myers by way of atlanta. i was boarded and the problems began. plane was supposed to leave at 4.25. after 30 minutes of waiting they told the passengers that an outside compartment was stuck open. had to call maintenance in. over an hour delay we took off. i asked flight attendant about my transfer in atlanta she snipped back check at the gate. got to the gate to find out my connecting plane was already boarding. went to board and was told my ticket was not good. got out of line and went to try to resolve this issue. they had changed my flight to the next day. finally got it straight. asked about luggage they said no problem it would be on the plane with me. i was the last to board and a day later still no luggage. very disappointed. i have had the worst experience with southwest airlines. my plane was initially supposed to board at 7.15 pm and departure at 7.45 however we did not start boarding until 7.50. once on the plane we waited 20 minutes to depart but then the captain spoke informed us that the plane had been fuelled with too much fuel so we were going to have to wait 15 minutes for the defuelling process. after 25 minutes a southwest airlines representative came on the loud speaker apologized and informed us that the defuelling process would take about 7090 minutes  not 15. i am very irritated by this southwest experience and i know my fellow passengers were too. horrible customer service representatives that are inefficient and inconsiderate. they diverted our flight and repeatedly made empty promises about time constraints which made it impossible to make other flight plans. the crew while nice gave no sympathetic apologies and just plainly didnt seem to care about situations aside from their own. saying were in the same boat as you are. i thought that was rude considering they arent in the same boat theyre getting paid for this and should be apologizing profusely for the circumstances and lack of information communication to the passengers. this was without a doubt the worst experience i have had with an airline and i would not recommend using it for future trips. on top of all of this their boarding process is idiotic and if you have later back than a30 you better be ready to ride in the middle seat. the worst airline i have flown. san diego to vegas friday 13th feb. at checkin told there is no allocated seating. nowhere to sit in departure lounge hardly anywhere to stand. we were in one of the last groups to board as we moved into the line the girl handling boarding called us to the front to tell my daughter who is pregnant that she was allowed priority boarding as she is classed as disabled being pregnant. we accepted it and boarded sat at the rear of the cabin but luckily sitting together no room in overhead lockers so glad we had checked bag in. never come across such an untidy cabin crew. turned down the offer of a drink and was shocked they serve peanuts must be one of the few airlines that still do. return flight on the 15th played the pregnant card for all it was worth boarded first row one seat locker for baggage no improvement in cabin crew. it was a once only flight with them we are spoiled in australia with our airlines who get it right most of the time. flight 448 june 8th. southwest has the most asinine check in process ever. i tried to check in online but they refused to give me a boarding pass. then i tried to check in at the curb and they gave me a boarding pass but wouldnt give one to my wife because she wasnt checking a bag. so we had to check in three times before we knew if we had a seat on the plane or not. may 16 2015. what a disappointment. i have flown sw before and have been very satisfied until yesterday. i flew with my wife son his wife and two grandchildren ages 1 and 3. you could tell right off a couple of stewardesss were not happy we had kids. one was very rude acting as though it was her company. yes inflight they started crying what are we to do not fly we did all we could to calm the children down. it lasted about 12 an hr in all believe me it was worse on us as we tried to keep them quiet. the people behind us were making comments out loud and then when we got off the plane we find out from friends of ours in the back of the plane said how the stewards were rudely commenting about our kids. i will say that there was one stewardess older that was compassionate. rude staff disorganized boarding misinformation about boarding procedures packed in like rats in the smallest seat space ive seen. my friend 79 and i 70 flew to st louis at the last minute on southwest because of the price. i had called southwest in advance to ask about their boarding process. oh dont worry i was told youll get boarding numbers together and will be able to choose seats that are together. nothing was said about their early bird boarding. we boarded in the ignominious c group which means that there were only scattered middle seats left. i wound up in the middle. he wound up in the front. his carryon suitcase was somewhere in the back. when i explained to an attendant that we were concerned about that baggage she said that there was nothing she could do to help me. southwest lets oversized carryons aboard which fills up the overheads quickly. i would suggest that if you are over 60 years of age that you avoid southwest airlines. traveling with a family through southwest airlines was terrible because we did not know of the free seating rule even though our tickets said we had assigned seats. when i asked the attendant about this issue she was rude to me and my family. on our way back we flew through southwest airlines as well and were delayed without explination we had to spend the night in chicago paid for out of pocket they tried to help us get a hotel but they booked us one in the wrong airport and almost made us pay for two hotel rooms. when we returned back to the midway airport our next flight was also delayed making us late for work the next day. well generally southwest is great with its customers. however today i have just experienced awful customer service. there were two people transferring from my connecting flight from baltimore to columbus. two would you think that they would have the luggage at an easy to reach area. now cant always blame the airlines for this. lost luggage happens. however the reason behind my lost luggage was outrageous. after landing 15 minutes early of the scheduled landing time my flight waited for an hour on the runway. almost missed the last connecting flight to columbus. when announced the terminals they also noted that southwest is not responsible for your missed flight if you do miss it. my flight left at 10.10 i boarded at 10. i enjoy southwest but unfortunately my last couple of times flying with them have been miserable. the other time i was at the airport for 10 hours waiting on their planes because they were delayed in the schedule. again sometimes you cant do much about it but figure it out on a recent flight originating from fort lauderdale fl to richmond connecting in atlanta the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. after the incoming passengers exited the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. after a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. in a confusing and poor miscommunication between the gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. i checked the arrivalsdepartures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing southwest flights were being delayed by hours. another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled flight 1505 would not be departing at all. a different plane would be assigned to fort lauderdale once it landed from atlanta. this would be around 10.20 pm. we were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever southwest could come up with. my best option was to wait until monday to get back to richmond. i tactfully informed the gate agent that that was not an option as i had a job to return to. i asked about a flight closer to richmond ready to be boarded. i was told that option wasnt available and there was nothing left. finally i asked if another flight could get us closer to richmond and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. again nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. then a option to book a flight to bwi was available arriving at 2.00 am. no hotels were available. i again asked about car rental. i was informed southwest didnt offer or would pay for a rental. no other airline was available either seems sw doesnt work with anyone else either. we took the flight to bwi and had to get a rental at 2.00 am.  arriving home at 5.00 am and with a extreme distaste for the way southwest treats their paying customers we decided never to use this carrier again.  i was traveling alone with two children and was told i would board with the a group. every plane was delayed. then my returning flights home were delayed. no one could tell me why there were all these delays. southwest is terrible all around. then i get on my flight to rochester only for the flight attendant to say there is no wifi onboard. my flight was supposed to leave at 10.20pm than changed to 11.35 and im still sitting here after midnight. the flight from charlotte was ok except the staff had no wings for my two daughters who were flying for the first time and the multiple delays. there were so many problems with the return flight we had to cancel and fly back with delta air lines. southwest airlines ground staff were not empathetic at all to the situation of our flight being canceled twice. i have been flying with southwest airlines for the past 3 months between las to bur this is the first time my flight got delayed because of weather conditions in las vegas on aug 13 the 5.05 flight. staff have been friendly and communicating well on delays after we boarded the flight it was delayed again for 1 hour. while we were waiting on a part i requested a glass of water the flight attendant refused to give water even though i mentioned i needed to take my medication. sorry southwest this will be my last flight. i flew southwest 5 times in the month of july and was delayed at least 2 hours for every flight. my parents are flying home on southwest as we speak and are delayed 3 hours. their plane made it to the runway and now is receiving maintenance while passengers remain on the plane with no ac. add at least 2 hours to any trip you book with southwest. unacceptable service. we arrived at ontario airport approximately 1 hour before the southwest airlines flight was due to depart. our flight was supposed to depart at 1020 hours with a layover in sacramento and then landing in portland oregon at 1345 hours. at 0950 hours there was an announcement that the flight would be delayed until 1130 hours. this meant that we would not make it to sacramento on time for our layover in portland. we went to the southwest counter and we were told that the only flight we could get on would mean we would have a four hour layover in san jose and we wouldnt land in portland until 1915 hours. i explained to the lady that we needed an earlier flight because we were flying to portland for a family event that started at 1900 hours. she then told me that there was a flight that landed in portland at 1805 hours but that was the earliest. so we reluctantly took that flight. my fiancee asked about our luggage. she said that our luggage would be on a direct flight and would land in portland at 1400 hours. i asked her since the luggage was getting there before us where we would pick it up. she said baggage claim. i understand where baggage is picked up im not an idiot. i just thought since luggage was getting there sooner we would pick it up in a specific area at baggage claim. she handed me the tickets and told me that was it. i had overheard another customer received vouchers so i asked her if we would receive any vouchers for our trouble. she explained that we did not qualify for any vouchers because our flight landed before 1900 hours. we walked away from that counter upset and promising we would never fly southwest airlines again. deciding that we needed to do something about the lack of customer service we got back in line to talk to someone else. when we eventually got to the front of the line we spoke to an agent. he explained to us that the flight we had was the earliest he could find for us. my fiancée then explained that we had not received a voucher or anything for our inconvenience. he then gave us two 200 vouchers for future use. we were still upset but felt a little better about receiving the vouchers. while we were standing near the counter deciding where to go sit down we overheard another gentleman being very loud and rude to one of the ladies behind the counter. he was on the same flight as us and was upset about not landing in portland until late at night. not only did he get on the same flight as we did but he also received two 200 vouchers and face value for his ticket. i am sure that delays happen often do to inclement weather or maintenance problems and i understand that those problems are out of southwest airlines control. it is just very upsetting that someone that was rude and loud received more for his inconvenience than we did. did we receive less because we were nice getting something for a flight being delayed shouldnt depend on the volume of our voice or the rudeness in our tone. this should be about what southwest airlines can do to keep customers and what they can do to apologize for missed family events. i am not only upset at the way we were treated but also the fact that we received almost nothing for the extra seven hours we had to spend at the airport. will never fly this airline again. first of all their scheduling is poor. i got a text every 3 to five minutes with multiple changes in departure time. times moving forward and back ranging 2 hrs back to 30 min delay. the plane boarded 3 times before they actually departed. the flight itself was 20 min longer than it was supposed to be. the connecting flight departed 10 min before we landed. they tell me that this is common and they dont compensate for this situation. i will pay for extra bags and assigned seating because i will fly with an airline that care about their customers instead of putting on a front with fancy advertising. completely unprofessional. what a rotten standby policy. if southwest has openings on flights and you want to go earlier than your scheduled flight they make you pay extra to reschedule your flight because technically standby is only available to those who have missed a flight the seat is empty youve paid for a ticket for a seat on a later flight but southwest is unwilling to accommodate you.  well after spending 5 hours in line and there was no end in sight  with swollen legs i could not stand any longer. southwest airlines treated those who missed their early flight with no regard. they started taking people who had later flights and processing them thru and kept us waiting and waiting and waiting. after 5 hours one southwest airlines gentlemen walking thru told us we would be on standby with little chance of getting a flight. we we told to come back on tursday southwest airlines gave little regard and no information to its passengers during this entire process. i am shocked that they did not have management walking and checking with people and seeing to their needs. such a horrible experience. we are at dallas love field right now waiting on a flight that southwest airlines delayed because it was not full and thus not profitable enough for management flight 29. so we will miss our connecting flight to harlingen from houston. swa says they have protected us by putting us on the 600pm flight instead. then the gate agent said that they tried to put us an an earlier flight but we must have not checked in early enough. not true. we were here before the recommended check in time. they are dishonest. never fly swa.  not only did i have to pay over 150 dollars to reschedule my southwest airlines flight for 4 hours later which was the flight i originally wanted. i was told that if i had just shown up late to the airport they could have changed my flight for free. apparently being nice and calling doesnt pay off. i ended up having to pay almost the original price of the round trip ticket again to get home. they informed me there was nothing they could do even though the whole thing was their fault. once on the flight my row was skipped over for drinks and snacks. that is understandable it happens. however i paid for wifi that never worked.  i traveled on october 29th evening the flight was changed frequently i remember its 5 times and from 600 pm to 1000 pm before i noticed the flight change i already traveled to airport and waited for 5 hours in the airport. i seriously dont understand why southwest airlines will always delay the flights. i dont understand i waited for 5 hours and even my return flight from atlanta to austin was delayed for 3 hours. everytime when i traveled it will delay for sure. i wont go for southwest airlines from next time.  i was forced to check my bag leaving california even though i took it on my southwest airlines flight to california they tell me to put it outside the door someone will check it. so thats what i do the flight attendant informed me someone has taken my bag down below. when i land in columbus it is lost in vegas. they tell me it is on a certain flight but when that flight landed nowhere to be found again and the baggage claim said that there is no way for whoever informed me of which flight it was on or to know it was actually on that flight. my bag is currently in limbo and not a single person knows where it is at and all they can tell me is sorry nothing we can do about it. what a joke this airline is. this was the worst experience i had with southwest airlines. i booked a 2 way trip for a family trip austin to atlanta. the flight was delayed several times i had booked my hotel and tickets for other shows because of the delay of the flight i couldnt go to any place on time. my plan was completely spoiled my vacation was terrible because of southwest. during the return also i had the same issue the flight was delayed again. i generally use southwest for all my travels and this was not the first time i have faced this issue every time the flight gets delayed. i am very upset and disappointed. los angeles to baltimore washington. be warned about southwest airlines early bird check in feature. it has failed to work for me several times now. your are required to pay an advance fee which is supposed to get you a check in spot prior to the 24 hour advance check in. instead when checking in after the 24 hour time frame you are assigned the next boarding place which by then is far back in line. better to just skip the fee and log in exactly 24 hours ahead which we all know is a real pain. and if you try to get customer service to respond be prepared for a 20 min hold on the phone followed by a representative who could not care less. southwest is fast succumbing to the feeforeverything model which in addition to their escalating prices makes them just another airline with lousy service. ive been planning a switch for a time now feels right. arrived at airport in a timely manner and was told that we were moved up on standby by list. got told i was number one for 945 flight didnt make the flight however my better half did. was put on the 1030 standby list still number 1 on list and the agent sends three people ahead of me that were on vacation and worked for southwest. unbelievable is all i can say. 1230 flight she puts a guy ahead of me that said he would pay extra.  southwest airlines is the worst airline ive ever seen. you dont have a seat assignment and are herded in like cattle. forget it if youre traveling with someone as there is no chance youll get to sit by them and no chance anyone will try and accommodate two people together. southwest airlines is up there with spirit airlines as the worst company ive ever flown and i will never book a ticket with them again i was able to pre board onto my southwest airlines plane. im a tall guy so i headed for the emergency row. i get seated and the flight attendant angrily asks me to move as a pre boarder im not allowed to sit in the emergency row. confused i obliged. calm until the guy who walked in directly after me claims the extra leg room for himself. why me specifically am i not allowed to sit there offended as all hell ill be avoiding southwest for future flights. no seat assignment did not work leaving punta cana. passengers ignored the number calls for the seat assignments and basically rushed the plane. i thought a riot was about to start. i paid for the early seating and i was the last person on the plane because i would not push with the crowd. as i entered the plane last i told the flight attendant i was to be the 76th passenger to board and instead i was the last which separated me and my husband on our anniversary and her only comment was i wonder how that happened i showed up 3 hours in advance to the airport and 6 other people showed up after we started boarding the bus ride to the tarmac and somehow they ended up ahead of me and seated together this was my first southwest airlines flight and my last as they are instigating riots with this type of boarding.  pittsburgh to jacksonville. southwest airlines is the least empathetic airline on which i ever flown. they will tell you that your flight is cancelled and not offer any accommodation. i have spent over 400 in the past 6 months in rental car fees due to having to drive to my destination due to flight cancellations. they will not reimburse you for time and money spent trying to get to your destination rental cars hotels etc if weather related. you better think twice if you want to be at your destination on the daystimes you have chose to fly outarrive. i was a huge supporter of southwest but now i can say i will never fly with them again. i am stranded in tampa going on six hours unable to get to atlanta on this horrible airline. every half hour southwest airlines change the estimate on when we can go without telling the truth about whats wrong stringing passengers along until the inevitable cancellation and overnight stay on the airport floor. i keep making the same mistake in booking flights with this airlineevery trip this year has been delayed without cause to the point where it isnt safe to travel with southwest if you need to arrive on time. their planes are dirty particularly the restrooms. i have learned to make sure i wont have to use them and after todays disgusting service i will now avoid the whole airline. dont book unless you dont mind being hours late each time. our southwest airlines flight from chicago midway to jacksonville fl on 28 december was cancelled due to weather and we couldnt be rebooked until 1 january. so we were stuck in chicago for 4 days and no luggage. southwest refused to take our luggage off the plane and instead flew it to jacksonville. no explanation for this and calls to baggage management at midway and jacksonville were never answered or returned. no reimbursement. absolutely terrible customer service. this flight was set to depart about 920pm on dec 28 from orlando to birmingham the first delay was to 1015 pm and came out about 605pm. so they knew they had a problem at 6pm. it appears the problem originated due to the st louis flight not being able to come into chicago due to sleet and severe weather hence the chicago to nashville leg of the flight was also delayed. the flight we were scheduled for was to come in from nashville. southwest is a point to point airline as i was told by customer service today after holding for 90 minutes which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. so know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. we were told another plane was being routed from dallas to nashville to pick up passengers and come to orlando to be our plane from orlando to birmingham. the delay was again changed from 1015 to 1155 then to 1255 am. a plane did arrive at 1220 and we were told it was our flight. only to be told at 1250 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to birmingham after all so we are now at 1250 am going to officially cancel the 920 pm flight and we cant get you on another flight till 920 pm the next day. my concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 1255 am and yet no one in command for southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving orlando. the customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but i did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. i just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. if you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes also i would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened. does not make me want to continue my long tenure with southwest.  st louis to chicago. the customer service continues to decline every time i fly in the plast year i have flown at least 15 times and i get more frustrated and disappointed each time. they cant even get their automated phone service for checking flight status right or update their website in a timely manner. when a flight is cancelled it shouldnt take over 30 minutes for this stuff to be updated customers are trying to double check before they leave for the airport. then when talking to a customer service representative they are rude and tell you its out of their control when things are updated. so what your telling your customers is please pay to fly with us blindly and good luck southwest has become a joke arrived at mcaron airport on day of flight. flight was boarded then cancelled. was put on next available flight which also was cancelled. ended up being routed to sacramento. then it cost me more money to get from sacramento to reno than the original ticket cost. cost me 40.00 roundtrip just to pick up my bag at reno airport. total cost between airport food gas mileage etc around 380.00 original ticket 222.98 . im a disabled veteran on a fixed income. i asked for a refund of the original ticket cost. southwest took five business days to approve the refund no thanks to there customer service center. after five days i had to call the corporate office in dallas and was lucky enough to get someone on the phone who could at the least push my claim through to approval status. i got every every excuse imaginable from there customer service reps but the one constant was that this was there policy on refunds and i would just have to wait. they took my money immediately out of my account when i bought the ticket so why is so hard for them to put it back. seriously the irs processes tax returns faster than southwest will process a customer refund. as of this posting i still have not received my refund and with a holiday weekend here i guess ill be lucky to see it by next week. shame on you southwest airlines. i trusted you would have better business sense than to hold peoples money hostage. your customer service reps are under trained and give different answers.  indianapolis to las vegas and flying with southwest airlines was one of the worst flying experiences i have had.  i paid 8 to have wifi throughout the flight but any simple google search takes about a minute to load. netflix does not work on the wifi. after realizing this i then spent another 5 on a movie to watch. in order to watch the movie in flight you have to install an app to view it. i installed the app about 13 times on both internet explorer and google chrome however i was still not able to watch the movie that i bought. overall i wasted 13 on wifi services that are expected to work. very disappointed.  las vegas to dallas with southwest airlines. the most frustrating and annoying feature about their flight is the first come first serve seating so if we are traveling as a couple or group we are able to sit together after the first half is seated. the seats are small and cramped and to have to be squeeze in between two strangers is a pain. we are never flying southwest again until they get rid of this policy our flights from houston to orlando were both delayed. we have 2 younger children ages 10 and 11. it was incredibly difficult to get seats with them even though our boarding group is group b. because southwest airlines does not have preassigned seatings it takes so much longer for everyone to board. most people leave the middle seats unoccupied as the plane gets filled. so if you have small children and in our case 2 small children we have to ask 23 people to switch seats so that in case of emergency we can assist them. i will not fly with southwest airlines in the future. the one time i chose to fly with southwest instead of delta like i usually do i had the worst traveling experience ever. i thought my one hour flight from utah to las vegas would be easy enough and i would have no problem getting there efficiently. boy was i wrong not only did they delay the flight 7 hours but when i finally received my luggage it was soaked from rain as if they had dumped it into a river and it ruined all my belongings. i will never fly with them again. i paid 460 for a seat on a late night flight. the overhead light was broken leaving me in pitch black darkness. for 460 i expect an overhead light. i hate the boarding scheme it takes time and attention on the day prior to travel to deal with the check in in a way that doesnt leave me the worst seat on the plane. i hate the competition in boarding. i am heavily pressured by staff to find a seat but i cant even see what seats are available in order to make an informed choice. i hardly call that a choice. i hate how people hold seats besides their own for their own purposes so if you want that seat you have fight for it and sit next to a hostile person. please southwest airlines let me pick my seat ahead of time.\\r\\r\\n i recently traveled with southwest airlines from hartford to orlando as part of my spring break trip. this was the worst experience i have had with southwest as i have traveled with them multiple times with no problems. our first flight out of hartford was delayed not once but twice. after that we had circled in the air for 2 hours because of weather which i understand cant be controlled but once we finally landed we sat on the tarmac for around an hour waiting for a gate to open. my returning flight was also delayed. a vacation that was supposed to be stress free turned into the most stressful travel time ive had. unfortunately due to this experience i am unsure if ill be comfortable making travel plans with southwest again. san jose ca to tulsa. avoiding southwest airlines in the future. my husband is an a list member. he flies this route a dozen times a year. we thought  we liked southwest until we had a major problem over easter weekend. i ended up having to make a 9 hour trip by car to pick him up due 100 to southwest and their flight crews ineptness. i figured come monday i would be calling and getting a full refund. not even close. southwest customer service is the worst. they are rude and lack any empathy or responsibility. took me 3 days of holding and calling and almost outright abuse before i got a partial refund. you sure do you find out what a company is really like when you have a problem. and this company is the lowest in customer service that i have ever seen. so much for being an a list member. we are finished with southwest. i started my travel today with a 7.25am southwest airlines flight from ny with orlando being my final destination on a 9.45am. as of now it is 1pm and i am still in the connecting airport set to depart at 5pm. a 7 hour delay you ask what possibly could have happened all we are told is that there is an equipment issue and we are to wait. there have been 4 flights from bwi to mco set to depart after mine that have already left as we wait 7 hours for a flight. severely disappointed. i will not be flying sw again. orlando to hartford. my sister and i got split up while boarding this flight. we were on extreme opposite sides of the plane. we hadnt flown in a long time so it was uncomfortable to begin with. of course i was not okay with this and began to complain. the flight attendant said that i needed to take a seat. so i did and i told him how unsatisfied i was with the airline. he was like well youre still going to need to take a seat. i sat down and said that im going to write a complaint about the airline.  what if i had children someone who had extreme anxiety or another issue. luckily that was not the case but they should do something about the seating process. when we purchased the tickets it said entertainment such as tv movies and wifi would be included. there was not one tv and the wifi did not work. denver to cancun with southwest airlines. we were a group travelling for a wedding on 1 flight. no one was able to sit together. the boarding process is ridiculous you have the first people boarding sitting in the aisle or window seats leaving the middle seats for the tailend of boarding. out of 20 people in our group we were able to sit together here and there. additionally why allow large carry on luggage it would make more sense to limit the carry on because that is what slows down the boarding process not assigned seating. this is most likely the last time i will fly southwest  there is no care or concern for families traveling together even if i have to pay more it will be worth it to have the ability to travel with my family and friends. orlando to las vegas  with southwest. all the services were ok but i was traveling with my wife who is almost deaf or hearing impaired and i always travel with her and i sit close to her to assist her with anything. the way southwest do seating we did not find seat together and we were far awy from each other and it was only after i claimed loudly the inconvenience that a kind passenger moved from their seat and allowed us to seat together. but the flight crew never have the courtesy to make that kind of acomodation. i felt helpless and uncomfortable with that.    flew baltimore to louisville. this was the 2nd time i flew with southwest and i experienced 2 rude flight attendants. i was the last to board because my 2.5 year old had to go to the bathroom as people were getting in line to start boarding. thank goodness we did not miss the flight. when we boarded last there were no two seats left together and an older male attendant muttered thats what happens when you board last when you have a child with you as he passed us by. i was greatly offended as i could not control the circumstances. two kind gentlemen gave up their seats for us. my son fell asleep soon after take off and the window blind was jammedbroken in a half closed position with the sunlight in my sons face. there was a ripped page of one of their brochures so i tucked it under the window blind. as we were about to land another attendant annoyingly asked did you rip that give it to me and took it. how rude. albuquerque nm to san antonio tx via dallas love field tx. i have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. my family lives in ri and i live in nm. so i travel cross country once or twice a year plus vacation and work trips to the bahamas florida quebec mexico and last winter cambodia. i have always attempted to fly southwest airlines in the past whenever traveling domestic to a location that they have service to and i generally try to avoid american airlines. over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip due to lengthy waits in security and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. in the last couple of years i have come to expect that unless i am flying on the very first flight of the day i will be delayed. i have mentally added that time to overall travel time when planning a trip. southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay and i now expect it. today southwest outdid themselves. i think i may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. maybe i would rather stay home. there have been several moments today when i wished that i could leave the airport and just go home. why am i so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway i can go swimming in albuquerque. the first such moment was when i got to the airport at 700 am for my 855 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. it was posted as delayed now its just gone. i have to wait until i am called to be told how i will be rerouted.  so now i am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later to make a dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. so i can still pick up my rental car during daylight. i make it to dallas i get on the plane we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to san antonio.  no we are now waiting an additional hour and 45 due to bad weather. well ok i can still do my drive before it gets dark ive never driven in san antonio. i can even get off the plane if i want i will just have to reboard because that is so much fun. so it is really pretty hot in here but it is too late to go home. we can leave now so they say. we just have to wait for the passengers to get back on the plane. did southwest get new management is this a new marketing scheme writing this review not as a passenger but as the uncle of my nephew who attempted to fly from chicago midway to albuquerque on wn 563 on july 21st. yes  southwest had a computer meltdown and their flights were all messed up. this has happened before to them and other airlines. but alas it always comes down to how an airline handles things like this that differentiates them from others. my nephew is italian and doesnt speak english fluently and is 14 so i needed to get the escort pass from the ticket counter. the line was over 1000 people long if not more stretching into back halls. i told the sw agents at the line entrances i just needed to get the escort pass as he cant go thru alone. no  no help. rude people who just say  get in line. there was no one at the business fare line  literally no one  and she wouldnt just let me go up there to get the pass. i had used a skycap to check his bag in as that line was only 50 people long so literally just needed the agent to give me the pass. not a single sw person helped me  but going back to the skycap  he did he stopped what he was doing and walked me back to the counter and had an agent quickly issue me the pass. so simple  didnt really stop the process of handling other passengers. just for this i wouldnt fly sw again  there was no reason the biz counter couldnt have helped me and 2 other passengers needing just a quick minute with an agent. so we go thru security  eat and go to the gate where it says on time. some flights delayed some cancelled some on time. they board other flights at our boarding time they have people line up flight attendants already on board. then an announcement flight 536 is cancelled we have no pilots please get in line for rebooking. no apology  in fact the 4 hours at midway not a single swa agent said im sorry for what was happening  just deal with it. so i get on the swa app and the only flight i can get for my nephew is on the 23rd of june. ok  so now ask an agent how i can get his bag. no  no way we are not pulling bags from flights. i said he is 14 and has no clothes here as he is visiting. sorry  we are not pulling bags. i said some choice words to her and then she says to speak to a supervisor. wait 45 min in line  the supervisor says no  with a smile  and i can try to go to baggage claim and see if someone there would help. so i go to baggage claim  and the agent there is friendly  but she is just guiding people as that line is 20 people long. she said the bag will go to abq and just let it go. if i wait in the line they may not pull it or if they do it could be hours. at least she was friendly. so for 2 days my nephew will not have any of his things  not a dire situation  he can wear my clothes. but again  it was just the sheer nature of the swa agents. no compassion not friendly not helpful. i will never spend a single penny at southwest again. swa has gotten too big for its britches  they used to be good in the 80s and 90s now just one of the big 4 and treating passengers like cattle. lets see if the flight tomorrow goes out on time or at all i have my fingers crossed. the customers of flight #1647 from hartford to orlando were mislead and given empty hopes. we were told at about 12.15 pm that our flight was an hour delayed. then soon after canceled. next we were told please sit calmly southwest will figure this out. finally no other flights available this flight is canceled all together. all other bookings were available until sunday july 24th. useless for us since we were coming back on sunday. i shifted gears quicker than southwest and booked a flight with jetblue for an additional 1000 to fly out the next day. i have been trying to contact southwest online or via telephone call with no success. this is an awful way of doing business.    \\r\\r\\nwe have always had a great experience when flying with southwest and with their customer service. for this reason we have always been willing to pay the extra dollars to book our flights through them as opposed to booking with one of the cheaper airlines. however the last 3 times we have flown southwest have been just awful. they lost our car seat the first time our luggage the second time and then the third time we experienced a 3.5 hour delay followed by a cancelled flight at 9.30pm. on top of this we have encountered terrible customer service every step of the way in dealing with these stressful circumstances. each time we traveled the personnel working at the ticket counter have been unbelievably rude. great way to start the trip. when items were lost instead of being helpful and accommodating the customer service agent working in lost baggage was very brusque and actually yelled at us and then refused to do something as simple as validate a 7 parking ticket for my husband who had to park and come in to help me with the situation since i was traveling alone with our 6 month old. finally when we were flying home to denver our flight was delayed 3.5 hours and then cancelled. the entire time the woman working the gates to the flight was yelling at people and being extremely rude. we all had to wait 12 hours in line to rebook our flights and then we found out the next day when we called in that they never even rebooked a flight for us. we will be leaving 2 days after our expected and paid for departure date. on top of all of this we have not been compensated for any of these inconveniences. \\r\\r\\n    reno to los angeles return. southwest airlines is spiraling into a bad dark place. seems it has now become swa company policy to have even the most pedestrian 70 minute flight delayed by more than 2 hours. there is no reason for this. there was no weather. there was no equipment failure. there were no technical glitches. and to boot the phone agent kept trying to get me to take a standby flight to las vegas instead of getting me home to lax where my car family life and all that matters to me are. not only can this airline not handle the simple logistics of shuttling equipment back and forth between two cities that take 70 minutes to fly between their incompetent phone staff cannot understand the difference between los angeles ca and las vegas nv. las vegas to raleigh durham with southwest airlines. i dont travel often however the few times in the year when i do our flights with southwest are always delayed. not for 30 minutes or an hour. delays that are two thirds of the actual flight. one of our recent flights from san francisco to orange county was delayed longer than if we driven. southwest being cheap and squeezing all their margins. this will be the last time we are fly southwest. that rewards card is going straight to the shredder when we get back.   newark to houston via st louis with southwest airlines. horrible customer service and staff seem clueless. this is my third experience where the plane is late stuck on tarmac or refueling. not once an acknowledgement that inconvenience has happened on their end. i would think twice before recommending southwest to friends and family. tampa to st. louis with southwest airlines. no assigned seats are a problem. if you are lucky you are in the a group to board ahead of b and c group but people who paid an extra fee to board first save seats for their party who have not paid the fee and you can end up sitting further back. i paid the fee last time and another passengers was saving a seat across the aisle with their purse. another was saving 2seats for companions in the c boarding group. the flight attendants see this all the time and do nothing about it and let it happen. i no longer want to fly southwest  it is too frustrating.    \\r\\r\\nflew austin to phoenix. southwest airlines used to be my favorite airline to fly particularly because of how easy it was to cancel and change flights their rewards program and especially how helpful their attendants were. over time some of their best value points have changed. their reward system has made it more difficult to receive reward flights. there was a time that you could show up to the airport early and if their was a seat available on an earlier flight they would accommodate you but they no longer do this without charging you the fare difference which is really expensive on a day of flight. i must say worst of all is their service and customer service. each southwest airlines personnel that you deal with from the time you check in until exiting the plane is rude or in a bad mood unwilling to help or accommodate your needs. i have a service animal and three times at three different points within one round trip experience i was harassed after being cleared twice. i was humiliated and embarrassed. i will no longer fly with swa unfortunately. i truly used to enjoy the experience but their service has gone too far downhill.    my go to airline is always southwest because of the great prices and friendly customer service. unfortunately this time around was far from a pleasant experience. flew from dallas to kansas city. it was my first time checking a car seat and stroller at the gate so i wasnt quite sure of the process. the woman helping was rude and even made a snide comment in regards to me not understanding where to sign the liability tags. we my 2 young daughters 1 & 11 and myself loaded the plane last. i was concerned about having 2 seats together and the stewardess was less than accommodating. she did say she would find 2 middle seats close together but that was the best she could do. fortunately an older gentleman gave his seat up for us to sit next to each other. i graciously thanked the man and then thanked the stewardess whom then told me not to thank her and that i needed to thank him. thankfully the gentleman who was collecting boarding passes was the only pleasant encounter i had. he insisted on taking the stroller and car seat for us because our hands were full and made sure to go ahead of us and tell the flight crew that we would need 2 seats together so they could begin working on it. clearly the accommodation wasnt taken into consideration but i appreciate this man for being the only thing positive thing i can say about southwest during this trip. phoenix to seattle. my flight from seattle to phoenix i would rate that trip an 89 score flight attendants were very friendly and helpful from the time i checked in until my exit from the plane. their concern was that i was comfortable and in the least amount of pain throughout the flying experience with them. return flight was a whole different type of experience. my flight returning from phoenix to seattle flight 2193 was horrific. i have disabilities that require a cane and a wheel chair at times. during the pre board the wheel chair assisted individuals were squeezed in between other passengers loading very chaotic we were barely noticed that we needed to board before the crowds pushed in. the employee that seemed to be in charge at the time taking the tickets grabbed my wheel chair and quicklyaggressively pushed my wheel chair so fasthard over the turns and bumps in the ramp that i told him twice to stop and slow down. he was rude to customers loading the plane. he left me and walked away at the entrance of the plane did not secure the wheel chair lift the foot pads or help get the luggage off of my lap or give me my cane. i was then met by another rude southwest flight attendant that just watched me struggle to get out of the wheelchair and try to set my luggage down. she did not once offer to help in anyway. i told her i need to get the luggage in the overhead bin and she just stared at me with an attitude on her facebody language. i finally said that my luggage would just sit there because i couldnt put it in the overhead bin. she finally grabbed the bag and put it up.  i asked for my cane that was put in the overhead area so i could use the rest room and again with the attitude when assistance was needed.  when it was time to exit the plane not one southwest employee helped any or the 8 disabled customers with luggage or anything. the customers on the flight are the ones that assisted the disabled customers.    horrible experience with southwest airlines we were rerouted to a different flight and as we were getting on we were told the overhead bins were full so they made us check our carry on. so i checked before sitting down and there was room in multiple overhead bins. laziness on the crew members part and a total inconvenience for us as passengers. if you have a choice i would use a different airline. i was not impressed to say the least.    i had booked this trip from denver to las vegas five months ago. i had booked this as a surprise for my best friend as a bachelorettebirthday party. this was a 700.00 surprise. we were on flight 799 from denver to vegas at 525am. landed in vegas at about 6am vegas time. we go to get our baggage and only one bag arrived. we submitted a report at 640am for the lost bag. throughout the morning as we waited for a 15 minute  call back no one called us no one updated me and no one can tell me where the bag is we are now sitting in vegas and the personreason for being here has none of her things not only does she not have her thingsher fiancé hid a surprise card with money in it.  it is now 930am the next day and they still cant find my friends bag nor did they call me. i called them again to get no new information.  this has been the absolute worst experience. when we were getting on the plane to come home they offered someone a 600 travel voucher for their next flight if they changed flights because they oversold it. we are now back from our trip and they still cant find the bag. we are not even allowed to start the process of reimbursement until after 5 days.    las vegas to burlington. i finished up with a convention much earlier than anticipated and decided to head to the airport to try and get my ticket changed to an earlier flight. there are flights going from las vegas nv to burbank ca about every hour. i find out there are open seats on every flight throughout the day and southwest refused to help me. they only wanted to sell me another ticket. i declined that option as i already purchased one. of course this is the case with all airlines now   no one wants to help you because of the corporate greed. well ill do my part by not flying with an airline that clearly doesnt care about anything other than money.     newark to orlando. flight attendant was late every 20 min they said another 20 min been standing in line for an hour and a half because they kept saying another 20 min now they said 30 min longer. the crew could care less worse airline i do not recomend it.     salt lake city to portland. arrived within the rescheduled time frame. seat was already given away. extremely disappointed. will not recommend for future flights. southwest personnel were not willing to recognize mistakes within notification system. conscience of southwest not worth the unconvincing of flight reschedule.    boston to salt lake city. i used to love southwest airlines until now. boarded a plane in boston then sat there for 90 minutes for mechanical problem. missed connection so i was deplaned. sat in line for 2.5 hours while missing all flights out of boston. they literally took 45 min to rebook each customer  finally my turn and they say i wont get home till 230 tomorrow and i get a 200 voucher and hotel voucher in a roach motel 20 miles and 89 each way in cabs from the airport. oh and my bags are on the way to chicago. i have no clothes toiletries etc. and btw im on my own for food. awesome southwest bos    i wanted to reach out regarding the unprofessional service i received from southwest employees. travel was from st. louis mo  dallas tx and dallas tx  birmingham al. my flight was delayed last night then cancelled. i called the customer service number to inquiry about other flights. the agent booked my 3rd option as the first two were taken. i asked for my seat position to be upgraded to a because of the inconvenience of staying another night in st. louis. i also asked for a flight voucher for a complimentary flight which is normal practice on other airlines. the customer service agent declined both request however informed me that at the airport the customer service department will accommodate in person with no problem. i spoke to the supervisor who was very rude to me. i was only asking to be accommodated for my inconvenience. professionalism goes a long way and this did not happen today. i am currently in seat position c. my main request was to be upgraded to a or my previous position of b. the supervisor did express that i can pay for it. she said she will not upgrade me because she doesnt want to not because she cant.     houston hobby to midland. i just spent half an hour waiting at the desk because they said i could upgrade my boarding priority. they finally get to me and its oh never mind there arent any left. love standing there for 30 minutes for no reason. i usually take united out intercontinental airport. now i remember why. you get an assigned seat and you dont stand there like an idiot waiting for nothing. southwest is a very similar experience to spirit airlines. save yourself the grief. take a real airline.    orlando to chicago. i am incredibly disappointed and disheartened by my most recent experience with southwest airlines. let me preface this by saying that i have been flying southwest for years am an active rewards member and currently have three upcoming trips already booked booked before this experience. i flew out of orlando fl on thursday night 524 at 915 on flight 1388 with my husband and 9 pound dog. we have flown multiple times with our dog in the past. i have always given our dog melatonin to help her sleep while we fly to avoid her ears poppinghurting. she was given melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. we sat in our chosen aisle me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and i juggled two drinks. a flight attendant decided to approach us and say whats in the bag to which my husband answered a dog. terry then said okay it needs to go under the seat. no problem we know that already so we said okay were just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under. he then came back i kid you not within one minute to proceed saying the dog needs to go under the seat. at this point we were getting a little upset. once again my husband said we know. he then stayed right behind our seat while i gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. i looked at my husband and mumbled gosh can we put our seatbelts on at that time the fa very abrasively turned around stepped into our aisle and proceeded to yell at me saying yeah you can put your seatbelt on i looked at him like a deer in headlights and said okay i think you need to take it down. he then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying take what donw tell me what i need to take down by this point my husband and i were visibly upset. i again said take it down. but again he continued to yell at me and say i did nothing wrong my husband said actually youre yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong.  he was the most ill behaved employee i have ever encountered in customer service. not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. there were people recording this. finally he stormed off. i began crying. the entire ordeal was disrespectful disgusting and completely unacceptable. i pay 95 dollars each way just like every other person who flies with their pup so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. in addition we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience. i called southwest to make a complaint and was able to speak to a very nice woman who unfortunately informed me that not much would be done. this complaint would get added to his file and the incident would be used as a coaching lesson. basically this individuals egregious conduct was endorsed by lack of follow through. i am beyond let down. i am in no way looking for this man to be terminated at all but he does 100 owe both me and my husband a formal apology for his flagrant behavior and nothing is being done to rectify the situation appropriately.    newark to st. louis. southwest abandoned us in newark. they cancelled out 7 pm flight at 1030am and gave no reason. she said well that happens sometimes sir. i should contact southwest to reschedule. i did no available flights out to st. louis for the next 4 days. they said they could do nothing about it. on my own i booked a sw flight to chicago and then to st. louis. now they tell me they cant help out at all because it wasnt booked thru them  truly horrible customer service my son just experienced a similar situation flying out of charlotte. are they going down the tubes this fast    san antonio to denver. horrible customer service how this company gets high customer service marks are beyond me. staff at the front desk apparently dont like customers or arent well trained. im super excited to be flying an airline where the planes break down and the staff is lazy. i wont be flying again and will suggest everyone i know including my company avoid this airline. this system doesnt allow a zero rating so they get a 1.    san francisco to raleigh durham. this is the third vacation in 9 months where i have used southwest and this will surely be my last. each flight was either delayed or diverted. the first vacation flight added a stop after i had already booked my flight. the second vacation flight was diverted to oakland instead of san francisco. it was left to me to find a way to san francisco for me and my family and at my expense. the third flight from san francisco was diverted to pueblo colorado to gas up when it encountered bad weather over denver. this resulted in us missing our 530 p.m. connection to raleigh durham. we were rebooked onto a flight departing denver at 1100 a.m. the next morning. southwest offered no accomodations to my son and me. food hotel accomodations and transportation to and from the hotel was left for me to figure out and to exspense. southwest has mastered the art of telling customers that they are sorry and there is nothing they can do and that they do not accommodate customers for bad weather because they cannot control the weather. furthermore trying to get any help from customer relations and airport supervisors has proven to be useless. finally there should always be someone higher up to call even on holidays and weekends. passengers should never be stranded at an airport and met with no solution or assistance from airline staff. very unhappy customer. i would never recommend this airline to anyone and have them treated so poorly.    san francisco to las vegas. southwest plays a role of a different airline as they like to pose as a company offering benefits that others dont. its partially true they offer 2 complimentary bags to be checked and really cool prices. but hand in hand they also tend to plan their flights on a lowcost schedule though they staff is far from the lowcost effectiveness. that is why their 40minutelong stops in every destination fail to be fulfilled and major delays occur frequently. at the day of our flight at least 50 of southwest flights was delayed one two three hours pretty common thing apparently. the plane is a standard b737 with nothing special to tell about. the service consists of a free nonalcoholic beverage rather small portion with a lot of ice and a mini bag of pretzels or peanuts. the staff was ok. plus their open seating policy seat wherever you want is really a terrible thing to offer if you are not a solo traveler. the reason is because the frequent flyers always benefit from priority boarding and a lot of sw passengers do and you are entitled to be in the second half of the boarded passengers. if you are not a solo passenger you would probably end up split to multiple rows because all the already boarded passengers with frequent flyer accounts are usually travelling alone and all of them like to seat on a c d and f seats meaning when you enter the plane and you see almost empty seats b and e but almost all acdf full its really pitiful view  again this applies if you are a couple family or a group of friends.    phoenix to chicago. my brand new bag was ruined. i literally opened the box brand new the morning before my flight. it was a birthday gift and after my flight that evening it looked like it had been dragged behind a luggage truck for a mile across the pavement. since my flight arrived at 1am i was tired and figured no customer service would be open and would deal with it in the morning. upon calling i was told by the women on the phone that you must bring the bag to the bag to be inspected within 4 hours of your flight to receive any sort of compensation for the damaged bag. i asked to talk with her manager. she told me she was the manager and would not let me speak with anyone else. this policy is ridiculous especially for flights arriving in the middle of the night and i am incredibly dissatisfied with the customer service i received with this airline. will not be flying with them again. ive attached photos of my two brand new bags next to each other the smaller one i used as the carryon rips that are all over the bag and  wheels that are about ready to fall off at this point    atlanta to detroit. this is my husband and i first time flying with southwest.  flying home internationally from punta cana layover in atlanta on 520 plane unable to land due to weather related issues. we were due to land at 655 pm and board a connecting flight at 1005 to detroit. at 708 pm i got a text from sw that we were being rebooked to leave monday at 400 pm. the plane i was on had to go to orlando to refuel and then back to atlanta. we were on the plane from 230pm to 1030pm with no additional food water or drinks offered. once in atlanta the customer service rep reiterated what i already knew that we could not leave until monday and gave us a voucher for a discount rate for a hotel. we booked the hotel holiday express in college park ga they dont take vouchers from southwest only delta and told us to go back to sw for a discount reimbursement. i just finished talking to a customer rep in tx who advises me that he could not help me with that issue and tells me how the airline is not responsible for acts of god  i knew that but my issue is with the hotel and the voucher. no further offerings of any kind or telephone numbers that i could take this issue further.     san jose to el paso via las vegas. i was boarding with my 13yearold minor i asked him if we could sit together we were the last ones called they had my minor sitting in a spot where it says do not seat a minor under the state of california  yet she sat there from san jose airport to el paso airport. on our way home i asked in the flight we could sit together again yet we were the last ones boarded and i did not get to sit with my minor again.    there are plenty of airline choices out there but the past few times we have chosen southwest because of the hospitality great rates and fabulous customer service. that was until today. we purchased 2 round trip tickets to go to a wedding. a couple days after booking our trip we decided we wanted to stay a day longer and that we would update our reservation. the website clearly stated that changing our flight would make the reservation nonrefundable. it instructed that we should instead cancel our reservation then make a new reservation in case anything happened and we needed to make another change. so we cancelled the initial reservation and booked a new one. after a couple weeks we hadnt seen the refund for our initial purchase. i called customer service and they informed me that apparently i had purchased a nonrefundable ticket initially and wouldnt be refunded the 650 i paid. i advised them of what the website said they acknowledged that my understanding of the instructions ws correct but only for refundable tickets. nowhere did it prompt me that i was cancelling a nonrefundable ticket and it wasnt clearly stated during my purchase that these were nonrefundable. the only place it was made known to me was in the confirmation email and even then it was in black font it was in a pale gray font at the very bottom. the customer service agent advised it wasnt refundable and couldnt help me. she transferred me to her supervisor who again stuck by the nonrefundable label. it wasnt as if i cancelled altogether. i bought another reservation for 50 more but they felt the need to hide behind their policy and not take care of a customer who in good faith and by instruction of the website did what they understood they were supposed to do. instead of help me the agent continued to reiterate that southwest doesnt have many policies but this was one and i was out of luck. i told her this was unacceptable and that the right thing to do would be to honor a refund as i was still purchasing a product and got caught up in a technicality. she apologized that i felt that way and offered me a customer service number to call instead. southwest advertises and prides themselves on their excellent customer service but this is a pure exploitation of a technicality and not at all the way a customer should be treated. even after admitting that the website tole me to cancel they refused to be of any real assistance and expect me to pay 650 for absolutely nothing. if this is how they keep their low fares by exploiting fine print and taking advantage of customers i want no part of them. this may be the last time i fly southwest. damn shame because they used to be the premier customer service experience but true colors are showing. you may pay more at other airlines but at least they might treat you like a customer and not just a paycheck    salt lake city to houston via oakland. all three flight attendants were rude and cranky. they didnt smile were annoyed when you asked a question. made the flight more uncomfortable than it already was.    sacramento to los angeles. the worst experience ever with this airline other than being delayed they change the time of flight when delayed but they dont care that people change plans based on that. they end up flying whenever works for them without re updating i have had a name change and had to update my account but not possible to do on the site or app. i called the customer service and was told i had to call headquarters. i called and left voicemail but they call back when its convenient for them and if youre in the middle of work thats it youve lost your chance i went to the agent at airport and she said she couldnt change the account and that i have to email the headquarters. i emailed the headquarters a week ago and nothing got done about it. i ended up having to be patted down every time at the airport and due to that i get late. i fly laxsacramento every week and today as i was running after having been patted down to make it to my gate they called my name for the first time i heard my name being announced and while the guy was seeing me run he gave order to close doors. couldnt change the account and that i have to email the headquarters. i emailed the headquarters a week ago and nothing was done about it. today as i was running after being patted down to make it to my gate they called my name for the first time i heard my name being announced and while i was looking at guy at gate in disbelief and begging him to let me go in but of course he refused. stay away from this airline if possible.  they try to make up for their deficiencies by telling their stupid jokes. in reality rude and robotic service.    cleveland to tampa via dallas ft worth.  we were supposed to leave cleveland at 535 we didnt leave until 705. we had a connecting flight in atlanta to go to tampa. we were assured several times that we would make our connecting fights. when we were about halfway to atlanta we were told we would be arriving at 830 and that flights were being held due to the fact that our flight was a connection for the majority of the passengers. when we landed we discovered that none of the flights were held. we went to customer service and they booked us on the first flight the next morning. they didnt offer any apologies were very unsympathetic and rude. they refused to comp a hotel so i ended up staying at the airport with my 2 year old daughter her first flight. her car seat was checked as baggage so i couldnt leave the airport if i wanted too. this is the worst airline ive ever flown. i will never fly this airline again i dont recommend them for anyone else either.   i fly to and from chicago and phoenix az a lot since we purchased a retirement home in az. my mother is 85 years old and i go back and forth every month to help her with doc appts etc as she does not drive. i had book a roundtrip ticket to fly to chicago for may 23 2018 and a return flight back to phoenix on june 16 2018. as the time got closer my husband decided to drive to chicago so we could stay for the summer. we have two dogs so that is why he wanted to drive. we left phoenix on may 19th its a 3 day drive. while on our drive i didnt want to forget to cancel the flight so i decided to do it on my cell phone. well anyone who has a cell phone knows that when you are traveling signal is not the greatest and in some areas not at all. i tried multiple to cancel my flight on my phone but i guess due to the signal it didnt go thru. i decided to screen shot my attempt at cancelling and would try again once i was at my destination on a landline. well i forgot. i made a mistake. while here in illinois on the 23rd of may i received an email from southwest stating i was a no show for my flight. i immediately got on the phone trying to explain my situation to no avail. i was told because i didnt cancel my flight it cancelled the entire reservation which is totally not fair. i agree that they didnt have to refund my flight to chicago but i also lost money for the flight for june. i am a regular customer i fly southwest a lot since 2015. i only use southwest i sit there and read in the magazine all these great stories this time my story is not so great. i have tried everything possible to get this rectified and nothing. i am totally disappointed in this airline. if i could tell the world my story i would but my advice is never book a roundtrip ticket and never try to do anything on a cell phone while traveling thru the mountains. as for forgetting to do it later it was a mistake on my part i am human. sorry southwest you dont get a kudos from me    oklahoma city to orlando. never again will i waste my time or money with this joke of a business. it has now taken me 2 days to go on my vacation in orlando. yesterday my flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight. so sw put me on a 6am flight to dallas then to kc only for the plane to break and now im stuck in kc. im farther away from fl than i originally started im over this vacation. i fly back on sat and i wont get there until thursday now  poor business. theyll never get another dime from me.    pittsburgh to chicago. second time flying with southwest and my second bad experience. was separated from my new wife while boarding. booked the flights 8 months ago and checked in on the same confirmation and she was sat 43 seats behind me and the attendants would not do anything about it. thank you for the terrible experience.   southwest airlines has terrible customer service for the longest time i thought otherwise until my recent problem. i received an email in may notifying me my points were expiring july 1st. i called for details and was told i needed to book a flight with points by the 1st but could fly after that date. after finding flights i tried booking. i was told the prior information was incorrect and i had to fly before july 1st. it was june 21st. i called customer relations as i was making my decisions based on their employees statements and already booked the other leg of my flight and my companions flight. i was told the only way i could extend points is by spending money with their company or a partner company. forgive me if i have no desire to spend money with a company that tells me incorrect information then punishes me for believing it. i requested they pull the phone call and was told the records were too old and had been erased. after 2 hours on the phone i had no choice and had to pay to transfer points which i didnt need from my fathers account in order to extend my expiration date. i have now been punished for a southwest airlines employees error. doesnt seem quite right if you ask me but southwest refuses to do anything.    the first flight was ok nothing extraordinary. the trouble started when i landed in chicago and found my connecting flight to pittsburgh is cancelled. southwest says it is due to weather but other airline flights are still taking off. i do not see any thunderstorm or storm or anything. i would still have been ok if southwest had offered me overnight accommodation because of their cancellation. right now am stranded at the airport with no flights until 830 am tomorrow morning which will make me miss the 1st half of the workshop i am supposed to attend. this is pure carelessness of the southwest airlines not to consider the reasons someone might be traveling. they did not offer to check for tickets with another airlines no accommodation and no earlier flights. from now on i will avoid southwest as much as possible.    we left austin at 5.30 am on thursday 71218 got to baltimore approx. 9.50 am. flight got canceled and we spent the rest of our day tracking down our luggage. our final destination was portland me but we ended up in manchester nh. had to pay for a hotel room and pay for a rental car to get to portland the next day. the vacation was going fine until we got to the airport today. its happening all over again. flight was delayed over 3hours and we are missing our a joining flight. paying for a hotel room again missing work tomorrow. southwest doesnt seem to care. what money we thought we were saving with southwest has ended up costing us almost twice as much. will never fly southwest again. its not because of the mishaps its because of the lack of caring. i do have a choice when i fly and i will exercise that choice the next time i fly. one unhappy customer.    baltimore to panama city beach. this has been the worst flight experience with southwest and will not book again. first after 2 months of having a flight booked they changed the schedule which had an arrival difference of 6 hrs and took over 2 hrs on the phone to have something done. next we arrive on time for our flight and are told the flight is delayed because there are no flight attendants available for our flight. this airline is a joke. obviously customer service is there last priority and they act like they are doing you a favor. thanks for the wasted vacation day southwest. you sure know how to waste someones time at our own expense.   denver to las vegas. this is the absolute worst airline ive ever given business to. open seating is a joke unless youre traveling alone their app is completely worthless since you still have to go to a desktop site or kiosk at the airport and if you are more than a 30 waist size you will be touching the other people in your row who thanks to open seating are not your spousechildren if you arent in boarding group a. i understand now why the tickets were cheaper than the other airlines it seems likely they are starving for business since i cant imagine ever booking with southwest again.    reno to philadelphia via chicago. our flight was delayed in reno by nearly 2 hours because of weather. yes you cannot help that but southwest employees ensured us that our connecting flight in chicago would hold for us and the rest of the people making this connection. once we arrived in chicago we found out the flight did not wait and the next flight was in the morning and were told our checked baggage would be there in the morning as well. after roaming the airport all night because we werent provided a hotel because it was weather related the time came to finally board our plane. once i arrived in philly i found out my baggage is missing. rude customer service at the baggage claim by southwest. i also called southwest baggage claims to see if they were able to track my bags. i was told that was coming in the future   why are there bar codes on our luggage if they do not track it why do we put our email and phone number on our bags if they dont call you to tell you where your things are located straight trash. i will never fly southwest airlines again nor will i recommend them to anyone. rude customer service that lies to you and doesnt care about your stuff.    you know this by far is the worst airline yes you get 2 bags free but you have to wait for all the people that take advantage of the preboarding with 1 white pass who bring an additional 10 people. you pay extra for early bird check in still have to wait  whats the point. my flight had a 1025 pm take off we didnt leave till midnight. i will never book another sw flight. no sorry for the inconvenience. just sad    providence to orlando. waited hour and a half before finally taxiing to take off. then only after we were in the air for 30 mind they announced they forgot to mention earlier that the wifi wasnt working. the seats are ridiculously close to one another so much so that the tray pressed against the average adults stomach when in the lowered position. the aisle is so narrow even our skinny six year old daughter has difficulty walking down it facing forward. you have to shuffle sideways the entire length of the aisle. between the aisle size and lack of space between seats they really manage to cream as many people onboard as possible. in the bathroom you have to hold the toilet seat in the up position otherwise it falls down. which makes it difficult to use the bathroom steady yourself and hold the seat up. the faucet of the sink sprays out so hard it splashes onto you. overall it was the second worst flight ive ever been on and i can say with confidence that ive flown at least a hundred times on my lifetime. the only worse flight ive been on was also a southwest flight. between their standard policies of poor service unassigned seats and parts flying off their aircraft and all of the aforementioned problems i cant discourage using southwest strongly enough.   flight from stuttgart to london heathrow was delayed three times. eventually we departed 2h35 late. zero communication from staff as to what was going on. zero apology from crew. zero drinkvoucher offered. will not be flying with eurowings again.    second time i have flown eurowings  never again. it is a truly miserable airline. the first time i flew kolnzurich my first flight was delayed 2.5 hours and my return flight was delayed 1.5 hours. however that is pleasant compared to my most recent experience a friday night flight scheduled from kolnbudapest. after waiting more than three hours after hour initial 610 departure time we boarded the plane. it was at that point that the pilot came on the intercom and informed us that the flight had exceeded the maximum time a flight crew is allowed to be on and thus the crew could not fly us. this was intentional  the delay was publicized fairly early and avoiding the regulation would have literally been as simple as looking at ones watch. additionally there were only two staff working the customer service line for several hundred passengers. took roughly an hour and a half to move thirty people through before me  cant imagine the people in the back of the line. once i got to the desk my questions were ignored and i was handed a customer relations card with a phone number that rang for over an hour with no response. flight was delayed until the next morning at 1010 am which means that everything i booked in budapest a little under 200 euros went by the wayside without being used. absolutely pathetic airline. your flight will not take off on time. the staff will try to scam you and deny the eu regulations regarding passenger rights that are a easily available online b on a card in the airport. you would be better off walking.    flight from dublin to düsseldorf was last minute delayedat first 20 mins which turned into an hour and a half. finally arrived in düsseldorf now to find the next flight from düsseldorf to berlin has also been delayed by an hour although it could be more. several other of their flights displayed on the airport screens are also delayed. not going to make public now resulting in an expensive taxi fare. poor conduct and frustrating travel. shouldve spent the extra to fly with somebody more reliable   the flights were late we were dumped at the wrong airport and are hundreds pounds out of pockets. staff on the ground didnt give a toss about this and just dismissed our worries. we voiced our concerns and the issues but all that happen we were downgraded to basis flights. i called customer services and after 45 mins i was cut off. it took the airlines 3 days yes 3 days to get to our resort and still waiting for contact from them to see what they are going to go about it. it ruined our holiday completing and then on the way back we got sent to another airport but not the one we expected to be at. had to pay for another set of coach tickets home another 101 and rebook the taxi. never in my life time will i use this airline again. staff were rude and just brush us off. i booked this flight from str to rlg with eurowings to avoid being effected by the lufthansa strike. check in was efficient staff were nice. lufthansa lounge experience was rather sad due to the poor selection of food. the buffet really needed restocking. no bathroom in the lounge. there was no priority boarding at the gate which surprised me but i didnt mind. the service onboard was ok though its nothing like lufthansa business class. seats are the same as lh and ok for such a short flight. i wouldnt want to sit on them for more then 3h. food quality was awful. i opted for a cheese sandwich with the weirdest texture i have ever tasted. it felt more like chewing gum than a sandwich. in comparison sas does a much better job its economy plus fare where one gets better quality food. flight was on time. sadly no priority luggage. would i book eurowingsgermanwings again only if i have to. vienna to barcelona on eurowings. internet check in was a challange. os ticket allows not check in at os home page. trial on germanwingseurowings works only with the additional eurowing booking code. baggade drop off at os counter lufthansa group is disarranged with eurowings. the miles&more booking was not possible despite booking information on os ticket purchase new a320 with winglets. slightly delayed. seat comfort acceptable cabin looks clean. staff was okay but no highlight. the snack on smart seat was the worst tasting sandwich in the last 5 years of my flights. germanwings flight number but eurowings plane. almost one hour delay because of late incoming plane. appologies but i think airlines should offer water tea or coffee free on board in case of a delay. plane was only one third full which added to comfort. normally the a320s from eurogermanwing dont have comfortable seats and legroom. with 49 chf a good price. this was supposed to be a flight on germanwings from hamburg to oslo. i had booked 2 flights on germanwings. the first was from budapest to hamburg the second from hamburg to oslo after a hotel stay overnight in hamburg. i booked and paid for one suitcase to be checked in on both flights. i did retrieve my suitcase after the budham flight as i needed it in the hotel. it was 2 separate flights on germanwings. i did not know anything about eurowings. when the bus that took us from the gate at hamburg to the plane i saw it was marked eurowings. of course i asked if i was on the correct plane and was assured it was. after we were in the air a short time i was asked if i wanted anything by a member of the crew i only asked for a glass of water and was told it would be 3 euro. not a bottle of water a glass poured out of a large bottle. i guess this is the new craze of overcharging for everything on lccs. but i really knew i had been traveling on a inferior airline when my luggage did not show up in oslo. it had been left behind in hamburg. even eurowings did not handle the missing bag. it was done by sas ground handlers in oslo and done very well. thanks to sas i did get my suitcase back all the way to my florida home. tried to fly hamburg to colgone on june 6. the 7.00 flight was boarding at 10.00 when i arrived at departure area for flight at 10.25 while 9.00 flight was cancelled altogether. a few moments later departure time delayed from 10.25 to 13.00. rude male gate agent told people to move to ticket counter for changes. so went back to the office. next try june 8. outbound flight fortunately uneventful. return boarding pass showed 14.45 boarding time for 15.45 flight internet said an a330 was going to be used explaining the early boarding time. showed up at gate at 14.45 but no aircraft no gate agent no info on screens. recognisably indifferent gate agent later reissued boarding pass twice. finally boarded an a319 at 16.00 found seat in extranarrow back of cabin and took off 40 minutes late. this operation seems to regularly fall below quite low expectations and should be avoided which is easier said than done though as on some domestic routes the only other option is taking the train which does not work if you have an early appointment.   dusseldorf to london heathrow with eurowings. my seat was booked twice. i took it first and for an undisclosed reason a flight attendant rudely asked me to leave the booked seat and go search myself for available one. i did not hear a single sorry for the error the airline made. flight attendant was not friendly or helpful at all.    berlin to phuket via cologne with eurowings  the flight to phuket operated by sunexpress. one of the worst companies ive traveled. you have to pay for everything so that makes your flight no cheaper than other better companies. i paid for a service that i didnt get and when i ask about this service they didnt know anything about it. i paid also for 2 meals  the first one was ok but the second one was just a half sandwich and bottle of water.     paris cdg to berlin tegal and one of the worst experiences i have had with an airline for a short distance trip. i flew with eurowings three times within 4 days. each of the three times the flight was delayed and arrived from 30 min to 1h late. i found the crew disorganized and we way too much time in boarding. in general we got very few information about the delay as it seemed to be quite normal for the staff. our eurowings flight from vienna to stansted was cancelled after a 6 hour wait. we were rebooked onto a flight 24 hours later and our luggage was kept by the airline. we includes my 2 year old and 6 month old sons. when we arrived the next day at the airport after another 2.5 hour delay we flew our suitcases did not. it took 2 days for us to get our suitcases delivered and that was this evening. only one of the suitcases was ours. eurowings continue to refuse to help in any way and say they will only get involved 5 days after the suitcases go missing. our holiday is only 6 days long and it was for my mums 60th. we didnt have her presents for the day i dont have my babies eczema cream or any of the home comforts that my children need.  bangkok to cologne with eurowings and only find out that you wont get food until you check in for the flight. this is a 13 hour flight. at check in they tell you you can buy a meal on the flight. when you are in the flight you may be told there is no meal available. great no food for 13 hours. to get a blanket you have to pay 6 euros. entertainment system is very limited. cup of tea costs 250 euros. not possible to pay in another currency. stewards speak german but werent friendly nor helpful. will not use again.     there is almost no customer service. my young children and i intended to fly from london heathrow to mallorca via duesseldorf at the end of may. when it was clear that the delay to the first flight would mean we would miss our connecting one i got fobbed off 3 times at heathrow when asked to book another connecting flight. we didnt get coupons for a meal while waiting for the first flight. i couldnt rebook another flight on my own initiative as i had checked luggage. dont worry i was told they will take care of you in germany in any case. well there had been some weather issue and a security issue at a close by airport there were at least 500 people in a queue for 2 customer service people. back to front of hall and around food courts. people said they had been waiting for 5 hours and more. some of them said i had to go back in to retrieve my luggage. airport security and baggage then told us our bags were on their way out. wait by gate 1. we followed up regularly with the baggage person but by 10 pm 5 hours later no luggage. i took my kids to a hotel and by early the next morning flights i had booked myself as there was no one on phone or in person. my luggage was lost for nearly a week and each contact with the airline was time consuming one agent was outright rude. now 2 months later i have spent days trying to get the simple answer from the airline i need for travel insurance reason for the delay. i have to put one star but i would rather give none. it is still beyond my imagination how a german airline gets away with this.\\r\\r\\n    eurowings is habitually late. i arrived at man for the last flight to find the flight cancelled and  surprise  the next morning also cancelled. so that says they used the planes on busy holiday routes the eurowings desk is called agenny so you have to find that and the girl who is usually on doing gate could not book me onto lh as well that cost them more. so it was next day and that took 24 hours on my schedule. i applied for compensation and the response time to the enquiry is 5 weeks the is a bad off shoot of lufthansa. its not easyjet and its not lufthansa so its lies in the middle with mediocre service – they have served the same sandwich offering since they launched. i am a frequent flyer but i have never experienced such a chaotic airline. flight was from cologne to stockholm. we were waiting at the gate for boarding nothing was indicating that the flight would be delayed except for the missing aircraft in front of the window. ten minutes after scheduled boarding time an airline employee showed up to inform us that the flight would be delayed for about two hours and that the gate had changed. then the employee rushed away without answering questions or explaining the delay. the monitors at the airport did not indicate anything the flight just disappeared from all screens. other staff that we asked did not have any clue when or where the flight would depart. two hours and two gate changes later we finally departed but our parking position in stockholm was occupied because of the delay and we waited another 45 minutes on the tarmac at the destination until we were able to deplane. never again.    dusseldorf to moscow via berlin. i just went through the worst logistical nightmare while checking in for my eurowings flight from düsseldorf to moscow on eurowings. july 27 2016. i live in usa and was visiting my husband in germany and then flying to russia to visit my mom for two weeks. i was 26 weeks pregnant and my doctor had no issues with me traveling. i did not cover my pregnant belly huge mistake and was asked for a mothers pass. i explained to them that my doctor in texas approved my travel and that we do not have special mothers passes. the lady at check in called her boss who came to talk to me and proceeded to explain that all pregnant women in europe are supposed to have a mothers pass from their doctor. its the law. i pulled up my online medical records and sonogram to prove how many weeks i was but it was not enough. he insisted on mothers pass. of course i tried to argue with him and he told my husband that i was slow in the head and he preferred to talk to him instead that comment annoyed even more. they denied me getting on the plane and sent me to a different section of the airport to rebook the flight. turns out all flight were booked for the next three days and my ticket was non refundable. and my mom was already on her way to moscow to meet me she lives 6 hours away from moscow by train. i was devastated but refused to take no for an answer. it was 30 minutes before departure and i thought what do i have to lose so i put on a very loose cardigan that completely covers the belly and decided to go through the same check in just go to a different desk. the most important thing was not to run into the manager who called me stupid and not be noticed by the lady who checked me in originally. i was lucky and it worked this time they did not ask me for mothers pass since i covered myself. i went through security got on the last shuttle to the plane and just as i was taking a deep sigh of relief an airport official walked in right before the shuttle left and asked me if i was the one pregnant.  so i had to get off the shuttle and be interrogated again at the gate this time by three people. after pleading with them and shedding a few tears one of them asked about my due date. i told her november three months away and she laughed and said i was good to go to make things worse they lost my baggage and it has been 4 days now and no bag yet. i will never fly this airline again.  eurowings flight from newcastle to düsseldorf. was delayed 2 hours so i missed my connection with lh. the main problem i had was no information on the ground at ncl and ground staff very rude. i have to say the same about the cabin crew on this flight. also stuck on the tarmac for 45 mins due to the fact that we missed our slot. at least lh helped me they where excellent.    dubai to kolnbonn with eurowings. poor service and communication. 19 hrs delay at dubai airport for no apparent reason not the delay was the worst problem but the lack of communication. nobody is available for comment or help. staff is nowhere to find at the airport. i flew with a eurowings flight from milan to stuttgart operated by a319. the seat was typical lufthansa with an ok legroom for a 190cm man the food was okay  they give you a sandwich a 0.2 litre bottle of water and a cranberry biscuit. the cabin crew wasnt the friendliest but still ok    bangkok to cologne. very disappointed with eurowings. they have changed our schedule 3 times without providing us any information. communication was very poor. you have no right to reclaim if the flights delay doesnt exceed 4 hours but the time that you waste and the new arrangements you have to do due to their inefficient management are not enough to compensate us.    cologne to rome. they provide you with fancy packaging that contains an extremely poor sandwich. legroom is fine but i always pick the seats with more legroom. friendliness of the cabin crew was poor. i was sleeping when they came with the beverages cart when i woke up i was thirsty so i walked to the cabin crew and asked for some water. i got told i could only buy some but i didnt have enough coins no euro bills in my pocket and you cannot pay with credit card for less than 5 eur.    dusseldorf to london heathrow. flown as part of a trip to san francisco. i asked the customer service on facebook if we could use the late night checkin in dusseldorf and i got two wrong answers. first of all they said there was no late night checkin which was false and then they said i could use it for a flight to the usa. wrong usauthorities dont allow this we were told in dusseldorf. thank you eurowings for not knowing the rules inflight experience was typical eurowings  rather cold crew and a snack. on the inbound flight one of the stewardesses corrected a passenger in front of other passengers for changing a seat in an unpleasant way. not necessary since it wasnt a problem and unacceptable behaviour from a crew member towards a customer in my opinion. inbound last flight was delayed which seems to become common practice with eurowings. great legroom in the smart section though. all in all i would still recommend because of earlier experiences but it certainly isnt lufthansa anymore.    manchester to valencia via dusseldorf. outward flight no problems however the return flight and the resulting complaints and lack of action descended into almost farce. on check in at valencia we were informed of industrial action by french air traffic controillers and there would be a delay and a 10 euro food voucher was issued. we eventually boarded a flight to dusseldorf unaware that we would be one of the last aircraft to land before the airport closed for their nightly curfew. on arrival at dusselldorf we were treated well by the airport staff who made arrangements to leave on a 7am flight the following morning to manchester and also found us a hotel for the night top marks for airport staff no help offered by eurowings. on arrival at check in we were told we were not on the system but eventually it appeared we would be boarded and our bags were accepted again airport staff gave us every assistance. the flight left on time but when the stewardess started distributiong the in flight snacks to the eurowings smart passengers which we were we were told our status had been downgraded but could not tell us why. due to my condition i badly needed something to drink and it ended up with my wife having to plead with the stewardess for something a bottle of water was grudgingly giiven. because of our delay i had to make alternative arrangements to get hom from manchestr. shortly after outr arrival home i emailed eurowings with receipts for my expenses etc. but apart from emailed promises and promises made by telephone no action appeared to be being taken 7 weeks after our disastrous return flight i finally received almost all my expenses including the difference between the basic fare and the smart fare we had paid for as a gesture of goodwill . there was no explanation of how this debale ocurred just a promise that the various departments had been informed. it would appear that eurowing are only interested in taking you money and if anything untoward happens you are on your own and complaints are treated with contempt. needless to say i never intend flying with them again.   vienna to amsterdam via hamburg with eurowings. the plane was full when i got on board and all baggage cabinets were full. i was unable to find a spot for my standardsized carryon luggage anywhere and asked the flight attendants what to do. they told me to place the carryon luggage underneath my seat which was located on the window side. it is a small carryon bag with wheels which is no larger than any other but it was preposterous even to attempt it because the aisle seat and middle seat were already occupied by people and it was clear that the luggage would not fit underneath my seat. being stuck between people waiting from behind to get on the airplane and unable to find a spot for my luggage i asked the flight attendants if i can place the luggage temporarily and find a spot somewhere in the front one of the flight attendants frowned and snapped at me saying there is no space for them to save the luggage for me. the flight attendants simply stood there at the entrance without offering any help or solution to the problem while observing the difficulties that i was going through. i unanimously decided to leave my bag with the attendant as the only other choice was to either get off the plane with it or abandon my luggage i chose the latter. the flight attendant later grudingly took my bag and handed it to another flight attendant in the front asking him to find a spot. to be fair the price is cheaper than most airlines and perhaps that is why the quality of the service is so cheap too. next time i rather pay a few more bucks and receive quality services entitled as a passenger who purchases services in exchange. return heathrowbonn with eurowings. both flights on time. the basic seats have minimum space which is acceptable for a short flight and the price. the cabin crew were efficient but never smiled when greeting or serving food to passengers. the size and number of cases allowed as carryon luggage was not checked so the overhead lockers were very full and could not easily cope with the numbers. self check in did not work in bonn but there were check in desks available. online check in is only available 72 hours before departure and not for return flights at the same time which is not user friendly.   barcelona to vienna and first time with eurowings. never again unless there is no other option. delayed and i lost all my city train conections. they do not give you even a glass of water inflight. i flew to barcelona for the same price with niki who offered nonstop beverages and even some snacks. second rate terminals and airports. although only 8kg baggage is allowed most passengers had huge enormous bags  which led to poor space within cabin luggage compartments. if you have a choice to fly by other companies  avoid eurowings.    zurich to hamburg. heavy delay. unfriendly staff poor cabin layout at high costs. unfortunately it is impossible to avoid eurowings from and to hamburg. it is only the lanes and counting legs for miles&more which keep this airline in business. even if i try i cannot find anything positive. the best experience is usually the bus ride from the far away tarmac to the arrival hall.    milan malpensa to cologne. the crew was very unhelpful during onboard procedure just dictating rules without proposing solution or helping to stow luggage. i asked for a sandwich and coke but ive been told to wait until the dinner was served to passengers that had ordered it. i already had the exact change in my hand and the trolley was in front of me. i waited for them to get back but no one showed up again.     zurich to düsseldorf via london. i arrived at the airport in zurich to be told nothing of my delay. i was suppose to take a flight from zurich to düsseldorf to heathrow. my first flight was delayed for weather i was told by a random passenger. apparently i heard later employees went on strike. the delay lasted 4 hours then i arrived in düsseldorf where are next flight was canceled and i waited in line to speak to a representative. there were about 100 of us in line. they decided to just shut down for the night and not help anyone. a representative said i could book a new flight or hotel and they would pay for it. he gave me a card to call or email for help. after calling the number i realized it didnt exist. then i wrote an email and never heard back. i had to book a hotel and buy a very expensive ticket out the next day. in terms of travel this was the worst experience i have ever had. attached is the photo of a useless number and email that i wasted my time trying to contact. this is the absolute worst airline on the planet.    hamburg to amsterdam. i was very dissapointed with the way i was treated by the crew specially by a lady from the cabin crew. the flight was delayed which can happen. but how hard is it to give the people waiting in line a heads up then by entering the plane it was hard for the crew to great their customers. i greeted them in their language and asked if there maybe was any room for my suitcase which was the size it was allowed to be. the answer was no. i asked what i was supposed to do. she said in a very unpolite way that it could be packed downstairs. i was a little bit shocked by the impoliteness of the crew. if you become a cabin crew i think one of the first things you learn is to be polite it was not my fault that the flight was delayed.     we flew from bangkok to cologne on the 16th of january 2017 with eurowings. never again we will choose this airline even though it is cheap. we understand why. there was enough legspace for me but my partner close to 2 meters was struggling. nowadays they ask 20 or so extra for extra legspace. secondly dear eurowings we are on an international flight everything was in german. did it ever occur to you that are multiple languages in the world i dont speak nor write german perhaps your staff could learn some english and manners never have we experienced such arrogant and impolite flight attendants. water was included in our basic fare but we never got it we had to ask for it and the flight attendant told me that on your next flight you have to make a squeeky noise. right there wont be a next flight with eurowings with us. furthermore the staff addressed other passangers quite rudely by ask the blond one. another thing that really annoyed me was the fact that everything had to be paid for food drinks and even the entertainment system was paid. we didnt buy anything as the movies were in german. do you really expect this on an international flight in any case we would not recommend this airline to anyone.\\r\\r\\n   bangkok to vienna via cologne. ive taken numerous long haul flights to europe as my husband is european but eurowings is definitely the worst airline ive tried. first i didnt know that there are a few categories to the fare type. luckily i checked a week before my flight and only then i know my fare is the basic with no luggage and meal on board. luckily i found out in time to save me from paying a lot in the airport. then come the ground staff. they are super rude i was asked to either pay excess fees for another luggage or throw it away as they claimed my hand carry is too big. i travelled with airasia with the same amount of luggage. eurowings a nice airline name but poor airline in so many ways. meals on board were bad and no inflight entertainment. everything has to be paid for. the seats are so small with super narrow legroom and theres no blanket and pillow for you unless again you pay. i took their short haul from cologne to vienna and it was bad as well. the cabin was cramped and the crew just dont care.    i flew eurowings from düsseldorf to zürich after arriving with ana from narita. what a shock from ana service and hospitality to eurowings. compared to ana the cabin crew was just plain rude and annoyed. i got a booking class including a meal and drink. but the sandwich they hand out was terrible. it seemd other passengers had to pay even for water. thats a bit cheap feels like easyjet. cabin was dirty and trash from the previous flight laying around. the window was dirty. thankfully the flight was nearly empty so there was enough space.    düsseldorf to rome. i arrived 2 hours early for my international flight to find a baggage line that took 1.5 hours to get through. i was reassure but three airline attendants i would have time to make my flight and check my bag. while in line many other customers were experiencing the same frustration about missing their flights. i made it to the front of the line with 40 minutes to make my flight and the woman at the baggage counter assured me the bag would make it on the plane and i would make it through security no problem. i did make it to the flight to find a completely irate attendant who told me i couldnt get on board that she had cancelled my seat.  the flight ended up being delayed 15 minutes so i made it on but my bag did not. waiting in the baggage line now.    on 2nd march 2017 i booked eurowings return flights from düsseldorf to birmingham uk for myself and my 12 year old daughter. the flights were booked online using my miles & more lufthansa account. as usual i printed out my travel itinerary documents at home and everything seemed to be correct and as normal. on arrival at düsseldorf airport on sunday 9th april we were faced with one of the longest queues for a eurowings checkin that i think i have ever seen. after queuing for ages we finally arrived at the checkin desk only to be turned away by the check in assistant because the name on my travel itinerary document did not match the name on my passport. on close inspection my short firstgiven name was indeed printed instead of my full name. i explained to the checkin assistant that i booked online via the lufthansa website with my miles & more account and even presented my miles & more membership card which shows my normal full name. this form of identification was not accepted at the eurowings checkin with the assistant stating that the names differed by more than 3 characters so she could not check me into the flight. i asked if they could simply update the travel documents based on my miles & more card plus passport. she could not. if i wanted the documents changed i would have to contact lufthansa. i was sent from the eurowings checkin desk to the lufthansa service desk but the woman at the lufthansa service desk just said sorry we are only a service desk we cant help. i was redirected to the lufthansa telephone helpline which also was unable to help. i tried to rebook the flights at the lufthansa service desk with a similar reply sorry we cant help we are only a service desk we cant book flights. eventually i found ltur at düsseldorf airport and rebooked the whole journey with the same start and destination airports on the same day but later flights with the same carrier eurowings this time with the correct full names on the documents for an additional price of €688. when my daughter and i were finally onboard we were looking forward to a little something to eat and drink but the steward bypassed us both i.e. no drinks and nothing to eat. apparently our tickets were smart somethingorother which means no onboard service. i had hoped the treatment on the return journey would be better. we received nothing to eat or drink. an altogether disappointing treatment for tickets costing over €1000. i had resigned myself to this being one of those bitter life learning experiences next time check that all the details on the documents match up 100 until i started checking some older travel documents at home. to my surprise i discovered that i have travelled with my daughter with the same carrier and same type of document errors several times before but without all of this hassle and extra cost. it seems obvious to me that the flight that we were booked onto was overbooked and the checkin staff were looking for an excuse to bump passengers off the flight. i contacted lufthansa customer services the parent company who passed the buck to eurowings who have never replied.    glasgow to dresden via düsseldorf. after being en route for 7.5 hours our flight was delayed over and over again. flight time is less than 2.5 hours total but our travel time is now at 10 hours. this kills connections too. everything costs extra too.     dublin to hamburg via dusseldorf. dublin had with catastrophic boarding. the gate we were waiting at wasnt even equipped with seats. consequently we missed our takeoff slot which meant missing our flight connection at dus. it was clear when we took off that we would require assistance in dus. when we arrived late in dus we were told by the crew to contact the eurowings staff on the ground. there was none. we passed the passport inspection. after that we found a eurowings desk with a eurowings employee who watched an employee of the airport who was explaining that he wasnt in charge of anything. he told us to find the ticketing desk of eurowings. the eurowings woman smiled and looked friendly but she said nothing. so we found the eurowings ticketing desk in the terminal. there we met the first helpful eurowings employee. he made a booking for us on the evening flight to ham and he asked us why we had no luggage with us. before we could get our new boarding passes we should go and find it. he literally said that eurowings doesnt care about luggage which is rejected due to missing flights. we were told to find a door with a bell. of course we didnt find it. finally the police and the customs authority and the airport authority assisted us in finding the door an in reentering the arrival hall eurowings did nothing. we found our bags just standing somewhere. eurowings calls this place the mobile baggagedesk. there was no staff. ther was no desk not even a sign there was luggage all over the place. eurowings will fly you to your destination. they dont care about service except you pay €3 for a coffee. when eurowings offers flight connections they should assist their passengers when something goes wrong and not leaving all problems to the airport und the customer.    hamburg to zurich. worst travel experience ever. flight was delayed and then cancelled after 6 hours wait going out. got a late flight missing all connections. going home now and flight is again delayed 3 hours without any information. all other eurowings flights are also delayed. never flying this airline again.   horrible airline. sitting in the airport and started receiving delay notifications. half hour each  not bad after the first two times but then we suddenly received a notification saying that our flight was delayed til the next day at 3pm with no explanation or apologies. after an hour and a half on the phone to customer service was told that we can book a hotel or taxi etc and we will be compensated. submitted compensation and still waiting for a reply from a human being have only received automated responses. their customer service line is a joke as they keep telling you to send an email. rotten customer service  avoid at all costs.    istanbul to london via cologne. i have never experienced flight which was so cold. despite telling the crew nothing was done about it. the unfriendliness of the cabin crew was standard throughout the both flights.  the food was basic and over priced for what it is. i will not be planning to travel with them again.    seattle to cologne returning berlin to seattle. if you can avoid flying eurowings do so  they have the most archaic checkin procedure. rather than allow online check in you must check in at the counter which guarantees a 3045 minute line. even on long haul flights everything is charged as far as food or drink goes. any more entertainment than the flight tracker is going to set you back. dont even try to use their phone customer service. the personnel are rude and extremely unhelpful.    jerez to dusseldorf. departure and arrival on time understandable loudspeakers hilarious nice tone used by purser and captain. clean seats board menu not used embarking under rain therefore access should have been organized. there were no screens showing the flight progress    dusseldorf to newcastle. i paid 350 for a return ticket to be treated like cattle. no smiles or manners from the staff or crew. both ways delayed with no explanation and they left us sat on the bus on the runway for 30 minutes next to the plane whilst it was refuelled not great at anytime let alone when pregnant. again no apologies. i asked to buy a packet of m&ms on board when the trolley got to us and you would think i had asked him to give up a kidney i would expect a lower standard of customer care if i had paid peanuts for the journey. i will never use this awful excuse for an airline again.    brussels to stuttgart. once again i had to fly with eurowings the so called low cost airline lh established it proved that what had changed is only service level worse but not price. the basictarif doesnt even allow a gold member of star alliance to enter the lounge anymore plane is at outside position and you even need to pay for a beer.     \\r\\r\\nso i flew yesterday 8 november 2017. venice to cologne. went to the airport at 19.30 as the flight was scheduled at 21.30. after spending 2 hours to check my luggage in confusion all around as no one was saying anything and we were all just standing. the staff notifies us that there was a problem with computers from the german side and hence the delay. no apologies given. so after another hour finally checked my luggage in had some extra weight went and paid 50 euro for extra 4 kgs and that is fine but the staff member was a really a bad host. not a smile not an apology more interested in making you pay. good thing i booked extra leg room drinks and snacks included guess what a cup of lukewarm coffee was all i got. the flight crew never apologized for the delay no one from eurowings did. never again with this company.     dusseldorf to paris cdg. they lost our 3 bags on this very short flight. they found 2 of them following day one bag is still missing whats even upsetting is that they are not doing anything about it. they do not have a phone number to call for this. their customer service simply tells me to email their claim email address which i did multiple times i get an automated reply and nothing else. very frustrating stay away if you can. you will get no help if you have issues they will defer you to an email address or will ask you to call later but you will get no result    prague to dusseldorf was really good didnt expect that much from this company. delayed a little bit but still manageable and we arrived only 15 minutes late. even on such a short flight we get a free drink and a small snack. aircraft was pretty clean. on the way back though total disaster. delay 1 hour aircraft 19 years old dirty seats tattered unorganized boarding. only left half of the plane got meal and drink i dont even know why. staff unfriendly and obviously bored. mixed feelings from this company.    london to berlin. extremely bad customer service. flight was booked from london to berlin on the 10th  december 2017. however the flight was cancelled and they offered a free replacement flight on the 11th december. when i accepted the flight they charged me 143 pounds extra. called them to solve the issue and they claim that theyd send the refund back. this was on the 19th of december. till date no refund has been made. called the company many times they claim that we have to email the accounting department who refuses to reply emails. asked them to provide the paypal transaction id for the refund they claimed theyve made and theyve refused to do so. beware youll never get your money back and their poor attitude just highlights their companys values.    london to cape town via cologne. they got the name wrong on the tickets tried for days to rectify the name change and was finally successful on the day before travelling i thought. only to check in at the airport and discovered that nothing was changed and then still to be told by the checkin person that its okay as eurowings allows 3 mistakes. all that trouble in the first place. we were delayed without prior notification and feared that wed missed our connecting flight. fortunately there were quite a few passengers on the flight who had to get the same connecting flight and it was announced that the connecting flight would wait for us in cologne. as a flight of 9 hours we thought well be given a meal not a chance. a bottle of water and that was it. had to pay for meals. on arriving in cape town our luggage was nowhere to be found and no one could help us. it appeared connecting passengers from london did not have their luggage transferred onto the connecting flight. we landed at about 1220 pm and we were reunited with our luggage at 730 the following evening. we had no change of clothing toiletries and had celebrations to go to on day one and two.     stansted to vienna. i only use them because i have no alternative not the price the route and endure the experience. i have got senator status for many many years and have spend a lot of money with lufthansa and the lufthansa group. this seems to be irrelevant if you fly eurowings. no priority boarding you get one glass of water and even if you dont want a meal it does not deserve the term meal you have to get and pay for it if you want a reserved seat. moody staff and many times delayed.    flew eurowings from zagreb to vienna via stuttgart. terrible experience right from the start. the plane was late enough taking off from zagreb that we missed our connecting flight in stuttgart. the customer service window had approximately 75 people waiting for help with missed or canceled flights. we did manage to get a flight 6 hours after our initially scheduled flight but that was also 1 12 hours late. at one point they decided to board the plane and loaded all the passengers onto 2 shuttle buses. for whatever reason the very crowded sweltering buses were left on the tarmac for 30 minutes before the drivers opened the doors and there was a mad trampling rush to get off the buses and board the plane it was total chaos. the crew on the plane were the rudest i have ever encountered and i fly a lot. they bypassed myself and my daughter with the service cart and then acted very put out when i asked for a beverage. i was told that everything on the cart needed to be paid for because of the class of my ticket. i have no issues with paying for service but i refused to give them any more money for incredibly poor service.    london to stuttgart. when lufthansa switched all flights not going tofrom frankfurt or munich to eurowings they stated it will not mean lower service etc in fact the prices stayed high even higher on routes where lh group has taken over parts of airberlin no priority boarding for star alliance gold members poor mealsdrinks no newspapers few miles.    phuket to cologne. the flight has been informed to be delayed in less than 24 hours before departure. we were supposed to fly at 830am local thai time and land in germany at around 1515pm. flight has been first informed to be delayed till 2100 than to 2300 and eventually till 0030 next morning. we are still waiting in hotel that we have arranged by ourselves. we have tried twitter facebook instagram and called numerous time and have not heard anything except standard please raise a claim and we will review it for reimbursement within 4 weeks. we called to the desk in airport in philet and they were unable to tell us is they will cover hotel expenses or food expenses. its incredibly disrespectful to treat almost 300 passengers like this we have paid more than 600 euro per person for flight cologne to phuket return and its not a so low or budget price i will make sure to never fly this airline again that ruined our holiday return home and all the following commitments   after having reached the gate the flight from lyon to duesseldorf by eurowings was delayed by more than two hours. not a single announcement was made to inform the passengers waiting at the gate as to why for how long when delayed boarding will take place etc.. on the contrary at the gate the original departure time has been kept until the final delayed departure and on the departure time information boards one could read go to the gate. after we finally had taken off neither the pilot nor the crew did bother to apologize nor provided any reason for the delay. after many delays in the past caused by striking personnel of eurowings and that additional bad experience i have decided to avoid any booking with eurowings in the future. i never have made any comparable bad experiences with any other airline.   this is the worst airline in my history of flying. i was supposed to fly from miami to cologne germany and when i arrived st the airport in miami i received an email two hours before my international flight that it was canceled. there was no information given on what to do where to go why it was canceled etc. i called the eurowings help number who told me to go to lufthansa and they would help me. when i arrived at the lufthansa desk the employees there asked why an unoffiliated airline would send them to their airline to fix the problem. at this stage i called eurowings help desk back and stuck them on the phone with the lufthansa employee. after the eurowings employee was slightly understanding of why lufthansa couldnt fix their problem i was sent to eurowings counter where everyone was camped out on the floor with no answers. once a representative came out they informed up they would do their best to get us somewhere near our destination the following day and they did not know where to put everyone for hotels so to stick around until they could figure that out. i flew with another airline with no help from eurowings. now  im trying to fly home from cologne to miami and the flight is delayed an hour and a half at the moment with absolutely no information as to why or whats happening. never fly this airline. its horrendous and the staff are rude and unhelpful. i wonder if we will ever take off.   avoid this airline at all costs i thought ryanair was one of the worst budget airlines i had ever had the misfortune to travel with but no eurowings have fought hard for their title of worst airline ever and they deserve it. myself and my 15 year old daughter were due to fly out of düsseldorf back home to london on the 10th december it started to snow slightly and then i received an email notification to say my flight had been cancelled. but at this point it was showing still ‘on time on the departure boards in the airport feeling a tad confused i joined an extremely long line to the eurowings customer service and after two hours reached the front and rebooked on to a later flight that evening. when we went over to the ticket desk to receive our new tickets and to check in for the later flight the male eurowings check in clerk smirked and said you wont be getting on that flight which made me think about maybe booking a hotel nearby just in case which i did. after more hours of hanging around the airport the later flight was indeed cancelled and we queued up again at the customer desk but this time i was in a 4 hour queue when i eventually got to the front of the queue we werent offered an apology an offer of somewhere to stay or even a glass of water but were stuck on the next day morning flight at 6.55am. we got to our hotel which was now fully booked and set the alarm for 4am. on waking at 4am i saw that there was an email informing me that our flight had been cancelled again. so back to the airport to join a 6 hour queue and noticed the airport was full of sleeping passengers who hadnt managed to book a hotel. while in the queue i once again provisionally booked another night in the same hotel as it was offering free cancellation if we didnt need it. once i reached the front of the queue we were told all flights that day were now full and we had to stay another night again not any apology or offer of food and drink despite it now being 24 hours since we had been stranded. we were put on the 11.00 flight for the next day. we spent another night in a hotel another day of food and drink that i hadnt budgeted for and still not one offer of anything from eurowings for me or my daughter. we finally made it home in the afternoon of the 12th december and as advised on twitter sent off all my receipts for hotels food drink etc and received an email back to say they would process this within 5 weeks. five weeks have now passed and after phoning the customer services of eurowings ive been informed that it could take 7 weeks oh no wait maybe 8 weeks and the 5 weeks was just a figure they tell their customers. i would think carefully if you are thinking of flying with these jokes. i wouldnt fly with them again even if i were offered free flights for 20 years. they are cheap for a reason.     lisbon to dusseldorf. i have been constantly getting flights with eurowings from germany to venice and sometimes also to other destinations and i cant remember i single time a flight was on time. i had flights canceled without reason constant delays of hours and a complete lack of support in any of these situations.     london to hamburg via dusseldorf. absolute appalling and ridiculous airline i recommend to never use them wherever possible i had a total of 4 flights booked with them on 1st may and only 1 made it on time. worst was when in lhr told me that i will get grounded overnight in duesseldorf on my trip home to ham due to delays and there was actually an alternative direct flight lhrham with available seats but they could not be bothered to put me on that flight. so eurowings rather flies an empty seat and grounds a passenger halfway due to delays than moving a finger for bringing a passenger where he booked to go. so i rebooked myself on the alternative lhrham not to get stuck the way eurowings had planned it for me. and than that 4th flight again got delayed by about 3 hours. considering only 25 of my 4 eurowings flights made it actually even remotely on time i question their capability and competence    stuttgart to hannover. since a couple of months they changed their policy so that you now have to pay for an extra legroom seat where you can put your knees in a normal position. instead they place now an advertisement in front of you.    cologne to hamburg. booked smart ticket which includes a tiny snack box with 02l water and tiny cake as well as an other drink of your choice. but on both flights they distributed only the snack box and offered no other drink. the crew told us since the flight is fully booked they would not offer that additional drink service because there is not enough time with a crew of 3. i call that a rip off if you pay for a drink you should get it. it is not my problem it the crew is on minimum. that is the reason why i book smart tarif because i want a coffee on an early morning flight. this is not the first time that this happened with this airline. they sure need some competition in the german market. if i can avoid eurowings i will try but out of cologne they have a monopoly. baggage took over 30 minutes even there where not a lot of passengers at the belt   the customer service for eurowings is horrible. they canceled our flight from düsseldorf to zürich at 5 am and it took them until after 11.00 to let us know what was going on. we stood waiting for 4 hours for them to communicate to us. they told us that they could not do any bookings at the desk and had to email our request to portugal for rebooking. this took 4 hours and there was no communication. we asked them to call the main office and they told us they did not have the phone number so they couldnt call if they wanted to.. there were 200 very angry people by the time this was over. i have been flying for more than 20 years and i have not experienced anything this unprofessional in my whole career.    cologne to edinburgh. one of the worst if not the worst airline i have ever flown with. i fly a lot with eurowings and every time without fail there is a delay or cancellation at the airport in cologne. it is never announced on the board or from the staff either. there is always a problem with having too much hand luggage on the flight and instead of sorting it earlier the airline always leaves it to the last minute to arrange for baggage to be stored in the hold. once on the plane there have only been a few occasions where staff have helped passengers store their hand luggage. the majority of the time they just stand back and let the passengers sort it resulting in further delays. the service of this airline at the airport should be a lot better.    phuket to hamburg via cologne. horrible flight. online checkin was for unknown reason not available. flight was delayed 3 hours and we were announced only the evening before flight. original departure time 0640 new departure time 0930. we got bit stressed but all was ok at the end. we booked hotel next to airport in advance so slept and were fresh but we saw plenty of people not taking hotel and waiting at the airport whole night. they looked destroyed in the aircraft. secondly food was really poor. piece of bread or cake at beginning of the flight and after 11 hours first and last warm meal. last 2 hours before reaching destination staff decided to serve warm meal. they did not announce what took them so long. warm meal meat or pasta was not tasty and too small portion. full grain bread and 30 percent butter pretended to be healthy but tasted really bad. you can order anything additionally and pay for it if you catch some of staff of course. entertainment package was a joke anything you want to do  listen music watch a movie you must pay 10 eur per flight. this could be included in ticket of such price category or at least offer could be improved. i saw 80 of the movies already and i am not a big movie fan there were just so few movies. btw if you decide to watch a movie then earphonesheadphones must be purchased if you do not bring them with you.  beverages were average. for alcohol or something special you need to pay. seats were ok average. staff could come around to collect trash during flight more often. staff as such was not enough for such flight not enough in amount could be more polite could be even more trained. i must admit there was no problem with my luggage and we arrived safe home catching second connecting flight. second flight colognehamburg was short and pleasant even staff seemed much better. in my opinion airlines must get better prepared to handle long flights such colognephuket. they cannot operate them in this way. i would not buy this ticket again in whichever price category.    our flight arrival flight was cancelled and the departure flight was postponed by over 3 days from munich to faro and we followed the exact steps outlined by eurowings to rebook our flight. it has now been well over two months that we are waiting for our compensation for the cancelled flights. speaking to customer service which charges for every single phone call is no help at all because no one there is actually able to provide concrete answers. emailing the email address they provide with result in no response at all and basically we have been hitting our head against the eurowings wall for weeks now. its simply impossible to receive any kind of answer from their customer service department.    munich to las vegas. summary 10 hour flight delay. compensation a refreshment coupon. no other options available. for some customers this type of consumer service might seem adequate or not be an issue at all. for me i have learned my lesson and will pay up to 25 premium and choose another airline.    london to cancun via dusseldorf. outbound flight the reclining mechanism on my seat for my 12 hour flight was faulty. at take off i was flung backwards. you could not lean back on the seat without it moving into its fully reclined position. the air hostesses did nothing and would not move me. return flight two flight delays. lost my luggage  still has not been found after 5 days. worst airline i have flown with. never again.    tunis to stansted via cologne bonn. just a generally very negative experience. the outbound flight was late. we were flying via france and so had to rush for the connecting flight. we neednt have bothered as that flight was delayed also. the problem was we were running around trying to find the gate but there was noone there to tell us that the reason we could not access the gate was because the flight was delayed which was not what the board said. the return flight was also delayed. we had a connecting flight in germany and a bus was supplied to take us from the plane to the terminal. whilst myself and a friend were carrying hand luggage and assisting two 5 year olds down the steps the bus driver decided to close the doors and leave. in the cold and the rain with two 5 year olds and a connecting flight which we were late for we were told to wait and the bus would return. after waiting a while we decided to walk at which time the staff started shouting at us and threatened to arrest us. now scaring my children i got very upset trying to explain that we had a connecting flight and needed to get to the terminal. the plane staff were very unhelpful as were the assisting staff. again neednt have been worried about the connecting flight as it was you guessed it late.    my flight from cologne to zurich was delayed 1 hour and i had to miss my connecting train from zurich. eurowings did not help at all with any reimbursement or apology and told me that they are not responsible for the delay as there was a strike i will never fly with them again. i chose them because it was the cheapest option. now i know they may seem cheap at first but they will cost you much more.    budapest to mauritius via munich. i booked a return ticket from budapest to mauritius. both of way needed transfer once. the way i went there and the first flight when i return were totally normal. you know in such long flight you could have some basic entertainment and food.  this flight is the only one that you need to pay every single thing extra for example the earphone. i didnt start my movie at the beginning but i felt its odd when the crew was selling this. they gave you access to a movie without earphones. moreover when cabin crew started to serve the food they ignored me i thought she may did not see me. so i asked one staff in the end and she said the ticket i booked is just seat without service. i said how come i book a seat to spend 12h without food. she said i could buy it with cash but euro only. i just have dollar left but they did not accept it so i left with empty handed and during these 12h i have nothing to eat.  whats more ironic when i decided to start a movie to transfer my attention i noticed even i have no right watch anything they request me to pay again i was  extremely angry.  i started to worry about my luggage if they transfer it or not. because in that situation i didnt book any service except a seat. i landed all the info i received there is single word mentioned that i dont have extra service. last but not least this young teams attitude and service is horrible. i strongly felt that they dont care the nongerman speaking guest. everytime when they come to me they will tell me i need to pay to get what i need. the lady who distribute food she just skipped me i was trying to ask her and she pretended as if i am a troublemaker or food beggar another lady who told me i didnt book food she knew my situation and i couldnt purchase even i have money until the end she never came back to me with anything solution  the worst flight ever.    gothenburg to zurich via dusseldorf. eurowings customer service is the worst there is plus they do everything they can to save money and not action as promised. ive received an advance email informing me that my flight will change to one day later than was scheduled. before acknowledging that email i contacted their customer service minimum time of waiting was 35 min and they said to book a hotel for the extra night and they would reimbursed the fees. i asked to have that in writing and they refused saying that i need to send the receipt from the hotel to a specific email address which i did but i had no response until now more than 2 months. upon my return from my trip i contacted the customer service again and ask to see what happens with my reimbursement. they said that since i send that email there is nothing they could do even if its been so long and i was clearly didnt get any response. when i asked them to contact their colleagues or transfer me to the people dealing with such a cases they said they cant connect me with that department and its only via email which again they dont respond. so basically they say various nonsense trying to frustrate you and give up the case so they dont have to reimburse anything.    vienna to birmingham. we checked in and got all the way to the gate before we were told out flight was cancelled. the only reason we found out was i was with my grandmother in a wheelchair who had assistance from the airport staff. we ended up running around the airport going back through security picking up my grandmothers bag at the bag drop then begging the vienna ground crew for a different flight. they eventually rebooked me on a flight through munich which caused me to miss my train at my destination. they were unable to put my family and i together so my grandma went via frankfurt and would be picked up by other family in birmingham. i ended up getting my.passport stamped three times for vienna in the debockle. all in all a horrible and stressful experience.    bangkok to bonn. i was sat next to a child that was climbing all over the seats and constantly getting kicked by it the staff did nothing to help. i asked to be changed seats and got ignored would not recommend this airline to anyone. also you have to pay €10 to watch tv which is ridiculous when you just paid 300 for your flight.    edinburgh to munich via dusseldorf. the aircraft were fine on these two sectors and the cabin service was up to standard on the first sector. however the second sector did not meet our expectations. we paid extra for a snack but the flight attendants failed to deliver said snack. we showed our boarding passes which confirmed our eligibility and a flight attendant even promised to deliver it. it never arrived. three emails to eurowings conatct address have been ignored. i recommend ignoring eurowings.    munich to thessaloniki. it was the first time i have booked with eurowings so i checked their website in case a prior online check in was necessary. as i was informed that i had the opportunity to check in at the airport i went to munich airport without an online check in. first of all the flightwhich in the end i didnt take was delayed twice. that was not the problem though. as i reach the counter for the check in i was told by the the clerk that my flight has been overbooked and i had to rebook with an other airline or for a different day. the result was to beg several assistants of the family company of lufthansa to overbook my flight to thessaloniki for about 3 hours until they finally found a way to overbook my flight as well as for other 10 people in the same flight. as overbooking is a usual tactic for eurowings they definitely should mention that in their website .my experience was really horrible and i would never book with this airline again although my flight was rebooked without any cost in the end.    stansted to puerta plata via cologne. worst airline in the world. flight was late leaving from london could have offloaded us but kept us on the flight knowing we would miss our connection in cologne. flew us to the wrong airport and then left us stranded to try and find our own transport 6 hours drive to our original destination of puerta plata. no onboard entertainment staff in airports are just reps and not eurowings staff and they could not have been more unhelpful. it was the most horrendous journey of my life and i would never wish flying with eurowings on my worst enemy.    vienna to rome. at first i was notified that the flight was delayed. then after dropping the luggage while searching for the gate the flight was cancelled. apparently the company independently rebooked my flight and had to wait there for 5 hours. in addition nobody gave the passengers notice about the food & drink coupon that apparently we could use. while rebooking the flight and taking the new boarding pass i emphasized several times to readdress the luggage as i needed to have it with me today. we landed and there was no my luggage. other passengers were in the same condition too. the luggage was delivered after 3 days. the airline didnt respond to my emails not speaking about the compensation. dont recommend the airlines at all 0 customer service    bali to singapore. after take off i laid back my seat right away a girl behind me starting kicking my seat and after a while i asked her if she had a problem with it she said she didnt have space for her legs. i said it was not my problem and told her to stop and call crew. i turn around and she pushes again. i called the crew member and explained the situation he said he couldnt do anything so he just told her to stop. she stopped for about 20 min and kept going she pushed so strong that she even made the seat go back to the normal way only by kicking it. i called again and the lady said im sorry theres nothing i can do and i didnt see her the girl was admitting what she had done and then told the girl i understand you dont have space im so sorry im gonna see if we have a bigger seat for you. she didnt want to change so the lady just told me im sorry its only 40 min left please just try to hold on. the lady just said she couldnt do anything while the girl kept laughing with their friends. at the end a cabin crew guy understood me said it was my right to have the seat how i wanted to and offered to change me and my friend. the girl just got away with it and nothing was said to her. also no food or drinks were offered free in a 2.5 hr flight.    singapore to bangkok. uob singapore had a krisflyer promo where they could waive they credit card booking fee but upon payment the scoot website will prompt that you must log into your scoot insider account. when you do that they will revoke all uob krisflyer benefits charge you a credit card fee and pretend to give you a 15 off welcome voucher that after applying the voucher the amount will the same as before the voucher with additional of credit card booking fees and extra 5kg baggage fees. i tried calling the call center 6 times each lasted around 1 hour as all the let me put you on hold and final saying we will escalate it and we will get back to you then you will never hear from them again. when you call back stating the person you spoke to the person will always be busy and the whole process repeats itself. dont fly scoot because once they get your money you will only get ignored.    athens to melbourne via singapore. scoot brought forward our flights by 5 days this cut our holiday short and we lost money on our accommodation and holiday i heard that this was a problem with scoot so i had left a few days buffer. not 5 days they could not book us a new flight until 5 days after the original flight. customer service over the phone was robotic with long periods of please hold.    singapore to manila. first time and last time flying with this aircraft. value of money not worth it yes its cheaper compared to other budget airline but end up spending more because of the delayed flight and the reason is their is a technical issue on the plane that can not resolved. flight delayed from 1255 am to 330 am. with those people who have connecting flight not advisable to take this aircraft. the worst customer service. flight delayed and nobody offered us a drink ground staff at singapore said those with connecting flight someone will assist us delay team upon arrival to philippines flight stewardess said we can approach the ground staff at the counter for assistance ground staff not helpful as no instruction from them from singapore and staff told me to call their office. no feedback form no apologies even after i told one of the staff i missed my connecting flight although i paid 2x more for the rebooking of the ticket what makes me upset is i need to wait it the next day for the next flight. travelled from sinool 2 days ago on a 777 and were not impressed. the seats were very hard and had no head rest the cabin service was almost non existent and the food was inedible. the water is 4 for a 330ml bottle which is outrageous. the call buttons kept going off all night. however planes are new and clean. flew sintpe on 21st december the plane cabin actually looked rather old and dated. a panel at the ceiling of the cabin seemed to be loose too. seats were hard and uncomfortable this was made worse by the lack of a headrest. however the recline of the seat was outstanding. throughout the 4 hour flight the call buttons were ringing nonstop making any sleep impossible. the call button is placed right beside the armrest so almost everyone accidentally pressed it. cabin was also rather cold. toilets are clean and there are drinking fountains outside toilets too. as for service the service crew was very unprofessional they did their work without any smiles and all seemed very cold. badly organised boarding. despite having on board water fountains the staff refused to supply a plastic cup without buying outrageously expensive water. most customers around me were expecting to have to pay for toilet paper. no inflight entertainment available unless booked with purchase of ticket. staff are friendly but either overworked or under trained. overall ill stay away from budget airlines in the future. scoot business really means premium economy with one spicy asian meal and one drink included no bread roll salt or pepper etc  very basic food indeed. after that there is a charge for everything. try to carry your own water as its not provided  especially on longer flights. the seats are ok but difficult for sleeping. our singapore to gold coast flight was delayed an hour before any explanation was given to passengers. the flight eventually departed 1.5 hrs late. booked a return flight from bkk to sg. preselected window seat in the red seating of the aircraft. the seats were very thin  ok for a short haul 2 hour flight. the person in front reclined their seat which literally meant i had a headrest in my face. flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. cabin attendants were far from fun vibrant crew members mentioned in all the airline pr. more like exhaustedfrustrated with their job. one snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the preordered sandwich she had just been given. all in all an ok flight. decided to upgrade to biz scootz for the return leg just. very easy to upgrade in sg  99 sd plus 20sd administration fee. seats on aircraft cannot and should never be compared to a normal business class product on every other airline. meal was good. flight was on time. booked flight singaporesydney with seat reservation turned up over 2 hours before departure but flight was overbooked. about 30 people couldnt get on the plane even though most had paid for their seat reservation. compensation nothing. nobody from scoot turned up to announce it or help out staff of changi airport were helpful though. on the way back the flight was delayed by over 5 hours. both flights were unacceptable flight from changi to sydney now 5 hours late and keeps being shifted backwards. staff smug and disinterested. will never fly scoot again. our initial flight from bangkok to singapore was delayed 4 hours. this of course is fine and expected with budget airlines. however we had a connecting flight from singapore. the staff at bangkok airport told us that it was ok because the connecting flight would wait for us hence we didnt make any arrangements eg book a hotel or another flight. however when arriving at singapore at 2am we were told the flight had left and that we would have to wait until 2am the next morning. we were also told that we had to check in 10 hours before our next flight to guarantee a seat. ground staff explained if we wanted to we could book another flight and receive a full refund for our singapore to sydney leg. many passengers did and did not receive the refund. we flew from tokyo to taipei taipei to singapore and finally singapore to sydney. each flight was terrible with each at least 20mins late. the old rebranded 777 planes are falling apart. the staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. after flying multiple airlines scoot was by far the worst never again. 787 or no 787s the new planes wont fix your poor timing and service. recently my wife and seven other members of my family flew from surfers paradise to singapore. the plane was late leaving australia and on arrival we were to get a connecting flight to thailand. on arrival and with great difficulty we found out that along 45 other passengers were left stranded in singapore. we found out this happens quite often. the staff did not want to help us or even discuss the matter. the extra expense burdened on us. never again will my family travel budget airlines. bkksin. service staff very slow in handling check in. no premium lane for immigration and no lounge for biz class. my luggage tag was lost by scoot and needed replacement. onboard head crew asked what meal i would like told her i had preordered my meals but that menu had changed. however i had paid for the premium meal. i requested for the code for inflight entertainment i tried to press the call button but no crew responded the lights were on for an hour. the food was similar to economy class. seat was slightly bigger. my luggage came out last as there is no priority for biz class passenger. booked to fly from gold coast back to singapore turned up at the airport to be told that flight was delayed. original flight time was 9.15am and new time was now 6pm in the evening  told that i had received an email which i hadnt neither had the other 20 people who were also there to check in  no apology no vouchers only told to return to the airport at 4pm. i had a connecting flight from singapore to frankfurt at 12pm that night and told scoot staff that i would miss my connecting flight they werent bothered when i pushed about returning at 4pm the staff member finally admitted that they didnt even know if they flight would go at the proposed time that evening as the plane had to come from china and hadnt left there due to a snowstorm had to go to air asia and pay for a flight to kuala lumpur and then another flight with tiger to singapore to get back in time. not worth the cheap fare wont be flying with them again. flight from sydney to singapore on feb 21 2013 was 10 hours delayed no text message nor email prior to this and no offer of apology or any meal vouchers. upon boarding passengers notice a lot of empty yellow seats in the middle whilst everyone was cramped seated right at the back then asked the crew to transfer to which they replied you have to pay extra a68. after all the taxes and their add ons fees this airline is not cheap. we missed our connecting flights hotel pick up and a night accommodation with no apology. never again. travel from sinqingdao on a boeing 777. booked scootbiz seat and it was more like economy plus. ground crew was slow in checkingin it was a near full flight of over 300 passengers and took almost an hour to clear everyone. allowing 15kgs cabin baggage is a grave mistake as most passengers on this flight brought in at least 2 pieces of baggage each making the clearance extra slow at the screening area. those who board plane later had no space left for their baggage. aircrew was not well trained the worst ive encountered in a budget airline. i could hardly understand the announcement in english with a heavy japanese accent. announcement in mandarin was also below standard. 5 hours delay due to unknown engineering problem no notification in advance and during the whole 5 hours scoot representatives repeat helplessly we do not know when and if the flight will resume well notify you when we know. no vouchers or any compensation was offered. terrible service even for a budget flight. it was first and last time for me to travel with budget airline. their customer service is appalling staff are the rudest airline staff ive come across. i flew business class from sydney to singapore and i hated the experience. checkin was chaotic with the supposedly dedicated business class line checking in a large group of economy class passengers. when i approached i was told to wait at the end of that line even though i was a business class passenger. no lounge access at sydney airport. the main problem was onboard. their business class seats were inferior to several major carriers economy seats. hardly enough legroom and the person behind was constantly bumping the back of my seat. recline on the seats was minimal as to be unnoticeable. no inflight entertainment and all that was on offer was a miserable tablet preloaded with 3 movies which was not free not even for business class passengers. the food was horrible and simply consisted of a bottle of water and a container with brown heated goo in it. no way is it comparable to other low cost airlines operating in australia. flew with them sydsin one year ago the legroom for economy was very good the best within the lccs however i just recently flew with them again and it is a recently configured plane from an old used sq plane and i realize that the seat pitch is about 12 to 1 inch smaller. with more planes their departure and arrival times have improved a lot. service is average they tried the no outside food rule on me just ignore them and have your own food. note their arrival time to sin is about 8pm at night so you probably need a night in sin if you book onward flights consider that cost when compared to flying direct with full service airline. i rebooked my flight because of family bereavement. my original booking was upgraded to business class from yellow coloured seat i booked earlier. i paid the penalty for my flight gold coast to singapore. less than 12 hours before my flight i realized that my seat allocation had gone. not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. if i want to return to my original seat i have to pay again 14 singapore dollars which i am not happy to do but no choice. what surprises me is that scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. it just does not make sense to me. first i lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now scoot asked me for sgd 14 at the last minute. i wont be flying scoot again. it is useless to be a loyal scoot flyer. nov 8 2013 bkksinsyd on scootthru biz fare carryon only. originally advised of 1 hour delay which blew out to 2 hours with airbridge problem at bkk and change of gate  not scoots fault. departed at 10pm instead of 8.05pm. biz section half full bulk head seats offer less leg room so moved to aisle seat further back. seat not very comfortable less so then premium economy on fullservice airlines. couldnt sleep much. service friendly but minimal. had to queue in sin for syd boarding pass. why cant they supply both passes at origin just a money earner i think though no charge on the biz fare. offered water on boarding in sin and asked if id like a drink. opted for a beer which never appeared until breakfast time drinks on scoot are apparently served with meals only. flew emirates bus class 2 weeks prior  from the sublime to the ridiculous airasia premium a much better product though considerably more expensive. first time i have flown scoot. i have never experienced such nonsense all at once from one airline. first they changed my flight and then refused to let me change it to a suitable date. then they changed my meal from a hot meal to sandwiches which i already paid for as an option. then they lost my baggage even though i paid extra so that they would specifically look after my baggage. also the seats are a nightmare with no headrest and are very cramped. i had to pay extra to change back the date so this was no cheap trip. thought we would give them a try as fares were reasonable but its nowhere near business class good legroom on seats but more like a bad premium economy. crew werent really interested in customers. 3040 minutes for them to answer a call for a drink on tz1 sydney to singapore on the way back they were quicker. in scoot biz you can bring your own device for entertainment and not be charged everyone who i saw couldnt get it to work. crew were more interested in chatting in the galley than helping. try another airline. flew sydney to singapore scootbiz. seats hard no recline and 100mls of tepid water free save your money food was disgraceful had to purchase everything and took 50mins to claim our luggage from the carrousel. jetstar is first class compared to scoot so stick to aussie budget airlines. gold coast  ool late nov. if you like eating poor quality food pitiful ground staff and substandard customer service then scoot is for you offered scootbiz upgrade which supposedly included unlimited drinks during meal service and a blanket. this was not the case and we got nothing but a better seat for our 169 customer service has done nothing. boarding took forever as ground staff were incompetent with only one staff member. i understand you get what you pay for but this airline doesnt even offer that a very low cost airline. 610th jan. persinper. service in the cabin was nonexistent i couldnt get anyone to come to my seat with my service light on for hours i gave up. both flights there and back were cold particularly the outbound flight. the aircon was broken it was freezing and we werent offered different seats even though there were many available that were much warmer. eventually given a free blanket hours later. the sorting out of prebooked meals is stupid. it takes hours to get all the prebooked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 23 hours into the flight. for these reasons i would only choose to fly scoot again if the fare is very cheap. flew scootbiz singaporetokyosingapore via taipei. the seats we booked miraculously disappeared on checkin and we had to sit separately on the return journey. the free inflight entertainment in scootbiz was nonexistent and cabin crew said the cabin wifi system wasnt working properly. we wont fly scoot again and we wouldnt dream of recommending it to anyone. i was scheduled to travel on a nonstop scoot flight from singapore to sydney by business class a few days ago. the flight was scheduled to take off from singapore at 1.45am and arrive into sydney at 12.40pm. the flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. then for some unknown reason it stopped in perth before continuing to sydney. finally it landed in sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. i missed my onward connections to canberra. so moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by scoot as they are usually late. the aircraft was ok and service was almost the same as other budget airlines. however it was delayed 3 hours and 2 hours respectively for my 2 flights. i felt uncomfortable that the cabin crew moved my luggage without asking for my consent. the cabin crew are rude they dont give way to passengers when they are selling food and beverages. i stood in the aisle and waited for 10 mins until one moved his cart back a little and i could go back to my seat. although it is a budget airline they should know we are the customers and they should provide quality service not a budget. i booked scoot for my sister and son syd to sin return. whilst the outgoing flight was smooth and they were allowed to take their snacks on board on the return flight they were not even allowed to bring foodwater onboard and being strict vegetarians it was tough as scoot does not servesell anything that is purely vegetarian. the crew were rude and did not pay attention to anyone trying to call them. the tiny bottle of water sold on the plane  4. a ripoff since they do not allow you to take water on board. nanjing  singapore. the crew on board were rude  they were not polite and asked you not to eat anything you brought onboard. the price is not as low as its service definitely not worth it. some seats were not able to recline and my cup holder was broken. very uncomfortable flight. id rather go to shanghai next time. avoid scoot if you can tz 2 19 june sinsyd in scootbiz. rubbish the cabin crew disappear they muddle the food and they lack the basic standards. not impressed at all checkin was good meals were atrocious and not what we ordered. after an argument with cabin steward that i certainly did not order beef stew for 6am she got me what i originally ordered croissants. the meals were awful very oily etc but the toblerone and soft drinks was good. take your own snacks and drinks they dont care. i got a free gift of an hours free wifi on board but could not use after 4 attempts to get someone to help me and 3 different cabin crew members telling me they were busy and would come back to me soon i gave up. staff were useless and unfriendly. shame because the price is good and seats were fine etc. we also left on time and no delays. would i fly with them again the price would have to be amazing and i would be better prepared. singapore to perth. no major problems with the plane as it was new. seats ok but they have design problem with the button for service which is located on the arm rest. seats are quite narrow and result is that me and other larger people were always accidentally hitting the button which annoyed the flight attendants and passengers no end. catering was very disappointing. we preordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. we did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre ordered meals. we then thought we would buy something alcoholic  beer was warm so we decided on the wine. decided on a white and then discovered that this was also warm. these are small things that could easily be handled with a bit more attention to detail and some flexibility by staff to keep passengers happy. would i fly again probably because of the price but would not bother preordering food and would check what i was getting before ordering anything on board. flew from taipei to singapore on scootbiz class with my 15 month old son and family. entire experience was ruined by a rude female attendant who went out of her way to make the flight as unpleasant as possible. my son needed to change his diaper mid flight i didnt expect the stewardess to be helpful but she went out of her way to be as difficult as possible. she refused to let me and my husband enter the toilet together with my son. she insisted that i stand outside the toilet as it was against airline regulations to have more than 3 people in the toilet i have flown on many airlines non budget and budget with my son and this is the first airline that has made a fuss and been so unhelpful. do not fly scoot if you have a young child. i will never fly scoot again. my second time flying with scoot from perth to singapore return. once again flew scootbiz class. my trip back in january was on the whole quite satisfactory this time i felt a little disappointed. staff on the outward flight were very slow and lacked any real interest in the job at hand. flight left on time and landed early. return trip departed on time but we were held up by 30 minutes landing at perth. food was horrible compared to my previous trip inflight entertainment not working even with the app downloaded on my ipad. still fairly good value for the money and scootbiz seats quite comfortable for a 5 hour flight. staff clearly need a lot more training on how to manage a large flight. sydney to singapore flight departed on time the food and refreshments could only be described as poor especially for an eight hour flight. the streaming entertainment system was intermittent but content was ok. public address announcements were inaudible most of the time and the staff service level was poor and they seemed to be good at hiding in the galley. not what we expect from an airline associated with sq not a patch on jetstar busstar class. travelled from singapore to gold coast in scootbiz and was disappointed that the inflight entertainment was down. cabin crew said since we have paid for it we can call scoot when back home and asked for refund. the food was horrible i ordered chicken in dark sauce with rice but the rice was so soft like glutinous rice and was very salty. on the flight back from gold coast to singapore yesterday there was inflight entertainment but was after several attempts to log in and with friendly cabin crews help. i thought it was free for scootbiz passengers but i was actually charged sgd16 for it the cabin crews on board were very unprofessional. when we landed at singapore changi airport when waiting for baggage claims the group of scoot cabin crews and captains were making lots of noise standing together with the passengers a rather unprofessional sight. this is my first time on scoot perhaps the last time. flight good however the delivery of food service was very poor. running back and forth with individual food and drink for passengers is such a waste of time. this cannot be difficult to achieve as other budget airlines seem to have a smooth flow of service even at a basic level. also the quality of product available should be reviewed. happy to pay a little more. however i will travel scoot again. with these adjustments more profit and potentially a good product in a competitive market. taking this budget airline was not easy especially when you are seated right at the back of boeing 777. the cabin crew were quite friendly but the fact that many of them were new they could only answer questions and complaints with im not very sure ill check for you and sorry. and it took them to serve food 2 hours after takeoff in which case many passengers at the back were starving. then it took another 1 hour to serve the drinks and expect the leftovers of what the passengers in the front seats to be served to you. and it was difficult to hear what the stewardesses were announcing to us. i was surprisingly pleased with my oolsin flight. i had spent the extra a24 on a super seat and was very pleased with the legroom and recline angle as well as the comfort of the seat padding etc. the lack of headrests still baffles me though and i would hope they do something about this in the future. the crew seem quite inexperienced and do not show the calm and assertive behaviour that i am used to from most airlines yet they are friendly and polite. the scripted announcements with things such as scooting off instead of taking off add to this feeling friendly attempting to be fun yet not assertive or what i would consider professional air crew behaviour. the flight was delayed by some 30 minutes. all in all i would not hesitate to fly with scoot again. scoot seems cheaper but with all the inconveniences and add ons it is actually close to the price of a full service airline. if you pay for a meal it is atrocious even by airline standards. basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in sin are not included  there is a fee marketed as scootthru if you do not want to go through customs. i took two trips with them one business – read premium economy and one economy and have had surprises on both. the latest was not being able to check in online from hong kong. atrociously inconvenient and indicative of shoddy service. definitely an airline to be avoided. having flown business class on international routes with other airlines we thought that scoot biz may be good value for money. bear in mind we assumed biz was short for business. instead of business class it was business farce. we had to pay extra to use the lounge and were told at the checkin desk to go to singapore airlines business lounge  not so singapore airlines wouldnt even admit scoot biz passengers but instead referred us to another lower market lounge. the seats only reclined 8 inches and the leg support did nothing. i asked for 2 pillows to support my back and was told i had to pay for them. that was when the staff told me that it was not business class but premium economy. the meal supplied was the same as you get on any economy class flight with other airlines. only one drink supplied for the 7 hour flight.  the old adage you get what you pay for rings true with scoot airlines. i was on the very first flight out of the gold coast to singapore and felt compelled to write this review. originally it was a great service with great customer service but all seems to have changed. the seats are uncomfortable the staff are unhelpful and the overhead light and crew call button is on the seat arm and keeps coming on due to just resting your arm on the arm rest. it is cold on all flights i have been on probably to get the passengers to buy scoot blankets. my daughter recently flew to singapore and her credit card didnt work for some strange reason. she only had a travelex card and no cash which meant she was unable to purchase any food or drink. this is not a major problem but just inconvenient. what was deeply concerning was that the crew refused to let her have a glass of water for the whole 7 hours i have found the food to be unhealthy and average considering they are not charging insignificant amounts for any of it. another word of advice is never change your flight unless you have to they basically charge you almost the same again to change dates. it feels very much as though they have come up with a great concept and then decided to take advantage of any need such as food water warmth and entertainment and charge for it whilst providing the bare minimum of comfort. like most airlines they even charge you a processing fee for the convenience of paying them. there is no other way to pay so they are guaranteed income from this. then they have the add ons such as car hotel insurance and so it goes on overall an airline that has a great route from the gold coast to singapore seems to have unfortunately turned into an uncomfortable and unreasonable airline. i will use the service in future due to convenience but not look forward to it as i have in the past incidentally i would have given them high scores on all aspect in the beginning except for perhaps the food. it may be better to just get the train to brisbane and fly out from there in future. it was the our first time travelling on scoot from perth to singapore and return. i had paid extra to select our seats. it was at the boarding gate just before i went to board that i noticed that our boarding tickets had a different seat number to that which i had selected on my original booking. at no time did anyone from scoot inform me that my original seat selection had been changed. i have personal reasons for wanting to select the seats that i selected close to the front of the plane but given seats at the rear of the plane so was happy to pay extra for this otherwise i would have not bothered to select the seat option for the booking. also the flight was delayed by 2 hours. return fight no better. boarded plane and was seated only to be told to get off due to plane mechanical issue and wait more than 3 hours for a replacement plane. we have flown with many other budget airlines and never had problems. based on our experience i cannot recommend scoot airlines. i was flying to singapore from the gold coast. my friend and i had some food with us. my friend is vegan and there was nothing for her on their menu.  a stewardess came up to us after boarding and said that we were not allowed to consume our own food on board we needed to buy food from them. after a 10minute discussion she said she would make an exception for us and allow us to eat our food. she also said that it was her job to make us follow such rules. if you want to watch a movie they bring you something like an ipad. they do not have usb sockets to recharge your phone either. what they do have are the staff call buttons and light buttons located where you put your arms so that you cannot prevent from hitting these buttons unintentionally while sleeping or sitting. as for the food i had to order some food on the way back. i ordered beef casserole for 11. the taste and quality was mediocre.  dmksin was flown using an old b777 aircraft even though scoot website listed it as a b787 flight at time of ticket purchase. while the b787 would have been a newer and more comfortable aircraft i did not mind the equipment change for this short sector. however the aircraft airconditioning malfunctioned just before pushback making the cabin hot and stuffy. despite this passengers were not allowed to disembark the aircraft while the fault was being fixed. cabin crew seemed disinterested and appeared disgruntled. it was only after several complaints from passengers did the cabin crew allow passengers onto the jetway. for this no announcements were made for obvious reasons  the jetway soon became crowded. 6 airport security personnel were brought in. cups of water were handed out to make the delay more bearable. the aircraft departed about 90 mins late. to add insult to injury baggage was delayed in singapore by 2 hours due to lightning risk. no representative from scoot was present to provide assistance or updates. passengers had to wait clueless of how long the delay was going to last. this despite scoot extremely steep baggage fees. scoots basement fares translate into rockbottom service which can make the experience extremely painful if things dont go as planned. give scoot the boot  travelled on flight tz2  singapore to sydney night flight. the seating layout is not business class  more like a bad premium economy on any other airline. no leg room when seat in front is pushed back. no blanket no pillow this was a night flight. flight crew had no smiles or personality and barely spoke english. it was a quick flight due to the new boeing 787  just 7 hours all up  thank goodness as we could not wait to get off the plane and stretch our legs. even though the food was preordered on booking nothing was served until 3 hours out of sydney. if you wanted food before then you had to pay extra for it  drinks too. when food did appear it was terrible quality. the coffee was instant with powered milk in a polystyrene cup and last but not least  no inflight entertainment or wifi connectivity  yes  scoot is the budget arm of singapore airlines but how budget does budget scoot business class have to get. 2 hours before the flight from kaohsiung to singapore scoot sent an email saying the flight was delayed until at least the next day and the plane was grounded. they gave no compensation for overnight stay and would only refund the amount of the flight as a scoot voucher and also would not refund the extras purchased such as business upgrade and checked in baggage. seoul incheon to singapore via taipei. scoot flight was fairly uncomfortable for me both to and fro. the seats were stiff and uncomfortable there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights they had to be purchased separately. the flight back from korea was delayed for 2 hours everyone who had to detour in taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 13am. i felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. both times i boarded the flight both arrived late. no compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to taipeis runway being closed. personally i did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic it seemed more like an excuse to me. afterall the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. a more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with scoot. it was booked by my company therefore i was not given the choice to pick. when i checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg checkin baggage. my boss secretary booked it and when i asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. therefore we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than vietnam airlines which already included the baggage fees i did a price comparison on my own. i was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. another problem cropped up when i was supposed to ship the parcel back. i was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. she informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. firstly like all the other normal regular people i do not read all the airline regulations although i have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isnt. this knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board  if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the checkin of my bag not when i am about to board a plane. the staff then told me i have to leave the equipment behind. she was pretty rude trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. i am not korean and the manufacturers description were in korean. i told her to open it and read it herself and i have no problem with that. she told me they already did and i just cannot check this in. she did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. what i got from her was basically miss the airline does not allow us to take this on board so please just dump it here and get on your flight. i was obviously very annoyed by this as i had paid for the excess baggage. so i told her if the baggage is now left behind i should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. she gave me a downright no. there was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. she didnt even offer to ask. all in all no more scoot for me. i have flown scoot 20 times initially because of price but then because of aircraft. however the more you fly them the more reasons you have to avoid them. its not the little things like the cabin call buttons positioned so you cannot avoid pressing them by mistake. its not the inedible food. no its the staff. i flew scoot within a month of their first flight and they were genuinely trying. now they have all become sia wannabes following the rules with slavish zeal. i dont mind when there is at least the intention to improve my safety. i got used to being told to put my seat upright when still at 40000ft etc. and it is just amusing that none of the staff can pronounce lets get outta here without it sounding like customers go away. but yesterday i arrived at dmk airport in bangkok 56 mins before the departure time to be told along with a bunch of other disappointed customers that the check in desk was already closed. no amount of pleading would get the man with the walkie talkie to waver from the script despite there being plenty of time to clear through. with bangkoks traffic i can imagine this is going to happen quite often. this cost me two additional airport taxis a night in a hotel and a new oneway ticket with another airline. if i or my luggage dont make a plane that is my fault but this case is pure pointless pedantry. im sorry scoot after using you since the beginning you have gone too far. i will not be using you again.  melbourne to singapore. we booked the seats with extra leg space and even then the seats were very narrow and the arm rest could not be lifted so the hip space was very small. the service of the air steward and stewardesses was awful as well. my parents are indians and thus when they speak english they have a thick indian accent and they tend to speak slowly. however instead of listening to what they were saying patiently a stewardess just rolled her eyes which was rude. my family and i are vegetarians so we had bought some food in the airport to eat in the plane. we have done this before during traveling. however the steward told us outside food was not allowed and so we told them this time we had already brought the food and we wouldnt do it next time while traveling. however a steward kept glaring at us each time he walked past. i have never seen service where the flight attendants are so rude. i bought a scootbiz ticket curious to see exactly what you get and if it was worthwhile. starting with the booking process you get the promise of a big seat not a layflat such as airasia free seat allocation 20 or 30kg of luggage and a premium meal. the meal was terrible  probably the worst airline food ive had. starting a bit early at changi airport  we were told bluntly that early checkin would be additional cost  even for scoot biz.  neither is internet and depending on what you read  even the streaming entertainment. once onboard i found the extralarge seat to be hard as a rock and only reclined a bit  not enough for a comfortable sleep. yes it was better than economy seating but not much. and after 5 hours of flying a request for a 100ml cup of water was denied  the scootie insisting that i had to pay for drinks. the staff seem inexperienced but even worse not having a very good time. it feels like you pay for virtually everything even in scootbiz. every year my daughter and i would travel during school holidays this year we chose to travel to singapore. after checking i noticed scoot was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper compared to another major airline. so i booked scoot and booked only 1 luggage for me and my daughter. a day before our flight my daughter said she might need an extra luggage so i went to the scoot website manage my booking section to purchase an extra luggage allowance. it took me half an hour to get to my booking details because the website could not find my booking reference. finally after getting to my flight details i added an extra 10kg on top of my luggage allowance of 20kg and paid 34. i also paid 24 to book our seat numbers. i tried to add meals in our booking but the website said meal booking was not available at that moment. finally on the day of our departure 15th january 2016 we went to sydney airport and the check in guy said our luggage was over the 20kg allowance and i said i booked an extra 10kg the night before. they said there was no extra 10kg booked in our flight and that i have to pay 140 extra for the excess weight. i asked them to double check because i know i paid for it the night before. the woman said they see an extra 10kg booking for our return flight. i asked there was a mistake and if they could fix that problem and apply the extra 10kg allowance for this flight. the woman said in a firm tone theres nothing they can do i have to pay the extra 140.  before boarding  we bought a couple of bottled water and after take off i pulled a bottle water out of our carry bag but the flight attendant told us we are not allowed to consume any food or drinks we have with us. i said my daughter is thirsty and the flight attendant told us we have to buy water from them which cost 4 for a very small bottle of water and we waited for at least 15 mins for the bottled water to be given us. an hour after later the flight attendants started serving meals to those who were successful in booking their meals. i asked one of the flight attendants if i could buy food and she said we have to wait. we waited for more than half an hour before she came to take our order. i ordered a wrap and she asked me if i wanted it warmed up. i said yes and after paying it took another 30 mins for the food to be served to us. i was observing the staff on board and i noticed they keep on asking each other and they all looked confused. i think scoots service quality has declined significantly these days. yesterday jan 23 2015 i was flying with my friend from sydney to singapore. our flight was delayed. however neither the checkin desk staff nor the digital displays said anything about the delay. we realized about the delay only when we reached the boarding gate at 115pm and found no plane there. the flight took off at 551pm sydney time 4 hours after the original departure time. however instead of scoots promised 50 dollar voucher for 4 hour delay the crews shook off their responsibility for the delay by offering the passengers a bottle of water and a packet of chips. even in that case they could not provide chips and water bottle for every passenger. in addition  i and my friend requested the checkin staff to give us seats in the middle of the plane if possible. the checkin desk staff told us that she is giving us seats 44df my friend on 44d me on 44e and 44f is empty and we two can use these three seats. however when we went in we found that another passenger is assigned to seat 44f. i really dont understand why it was necessary to lie to us. she was not obliged to give us seats according to our request.  our scoot flight from perth to singapore was passable but the return pretty horrendous and one of the worst flights ive ever been on ground staff in singapore were great and check in very smooth but it was all downhill from there. boeing 787s are considered to be fairly new but this fleet is looking very worn and the plane was not terribly clean either. legroom is good by budget standards but armrests are tiny and we were repeatedly clicking the overhead light on by accident. could not decipher many of the announcements due to the poor english and very heavy accents of the attendants. flight was very turbulent for most of the journey too which didnt help.  if you must travel scoot get a seat in the quiet zone or towards the front of the aircraft  even if you have to pay extra. also you can bid on business seats and win an upgrade for as little as 100 from what i have heard.    our experience flying scoot from melbourne to taipei via singapore was a miserable one. the cabin was hot as there are no overhead airvents it just got worse as the flight went on. what makes this issue worse is they charge you a lot for water when they are running a very hot cabin. i wrote to scoot feedback about this issue and they confirmed they run the cabin at 24c degrees. once the sun streams in through the windows and theres no cool air in the cabin it feels a lot hotter. from this flight my mother got sick and she was unwell for the rest of our trip. i read all the negative reviews of scoot but went into flying with them with an open mind but i couldnt ignore how uncomfortable flying with them is. next the seats after a few hours it feels like a metal bar is pushing into your lower back i found them unbearable the food wasnt much better. because of this we changed carriers when we flew back and went emirates which after you add all the add ons on scoot really wasnt much more expensive. it was like night and day  we had ventilation the food was decent and the seats comfortable . why do scoot run the cabins so hot and why no ventilation. these are basic needs of human comfort. the cabin attendants were rude  one had a fair old go at my mum for eating a sandwich she bought at the airport.  once we landed in singapore they parked at a stand and bussed us to the terminal considering the amount of clear gates is this really necessary  overall a very poor experience with scoot when compared with other budget airlines. it was our first time so we did not realise the biz class seats did not recline much and the leg rest also did not come up. we bought biz cos we thought we would get a better rest on the redeye but instead passengers in economy were able to take 23 seats and lie down while there is a nonmovable handrest between the biz seats and my toddler couldnt lie on my lap so ended up being even more uncomfortable. i brought packet oats for my toddler and wanted just a bowl of hot water but even that could not be accommodated. i guess this is budget but i dont know what biz class i was paying for. on the return flight we missed the cutoff for the checkin counter by 5 min that is clearly our bad as we didnt know it was 1 hour cutoff in singapore mostly 40 min but what annoyed was the scoot counter staff attitude. its tough for anyone to miss their flights but they were really mean and rude about it. i then realised the economy class passengers for this flight were still being checked in and asked why we couldnt then get on but she said its because we were not already in the queue by the 1 hour mark. so it wasnt like the counter had closed which i would fully understand but just for the principle of it. this inflexibility really put me off. next she tells me too bad the tickets are nonrefundable we paid 2700 for the 3 tickets  not exactly cheap cos i wrongly thought biz class was worth it. they had no scoot counter at the airport and there is no wifi at the airport. so i had to make multiple longdistance calls to find out tomorrows flight would cost be another 2k. at this point i gave up and opted to buy 3 new fullfare ticket on sia from brisbane airport. it was a mistake to fly scoot. should have just flown a return flight on sia from the getgo. somehow i bought being a sia subsidiary meant i was getting a similar customer service which was not the case. melbourne to singapore return. 5 for early checkin changing date of flying without even proper explanation simply an ordinary email barely any service and delays up to 1 hour  not really for people who dislike delays primitive service awful communication and ridiculous extra costs. not to mention the insincere attitude of the crew. nevertheless their boeing 787 seats have very good seat pitch. for small extra cost one can sit in the scoot in silence section which has better seats and proximity to business class a few passengers simply went and sat there  crew didnt care. the more humid flight helped and atmospheric lighting of 787 made flying more interesting. currently theres not many from australia flying on scoot so i had 3 seats all to myself. this really enabled sleep.   singapore to sydney with scoot. flight delayed by 6 hours. no notification from scoot. given a 10 food voucher as compensation not even entry to the lounge as a business class passenger. no ground staff from scoot itself in singapore airport. offered to be put in economy on flight to melbourne and then no compensation for finding my way to sydney. the incoming flight was supposed to leave qingdao at 3.10pm and arrive at changi at 850pm. they had stupid amounts of time to call or email to notify us of the delay. no reason given as to why they did not email or phone to notify. food on the way to singapore was terrible and service is quite average. they give you your meal in the first hour so for the next 7 to 8 hours you have to pay for everything else. beware.    bangkok don muang to singapore evening flight. before boarding the aircraft we had still some time left to do shopping and a quick bite at the airport. we decided to buy a meal at the airport and took it to the plane to eat. when seated in the plane fa came to us and told us you are not allowed to bring outside food in the aircraft. you are required to stop eating until disembarkation. please refer to the terms and conditions when you booked this flight. i though the fa was making a joke but she was serious and stood next to us until we put our food in our bag. then she informed her colleague who said we were not allowed to eat. if we are hungry we could buy their meal on board. nasi lemak 15s chicken rice 15s prices are not acceptable for airplane food. fa did not provide us singapore arrival form. you should go ask them. during the flight the fa were only busy with selling drinks snacks and onboard shopping. no attention were paid to passengers.\\r\\r\\n    flew scoot from singapore to melbourne. purchased a more expensive ticket for their scoot in silence seats which promises an adultonly zone which is silent so you can sleep. however my and my wifes seat was directly next to the toilet and consequently the queue the flush and the banging door. it was actually the noisiest flight ive ever had. i complained and was told there was nothing they could do. ive also added up the money i save by the cheaper ticket and with all the other hidden charges it would have been cheaper to fly with a better airline. yes they are a budget airline but there are some things which shouldnt cost money such as good service. when our plane was boarding the staff were just talking to each other and a huge amount of people were confused and not even sure what was happening. the food is also terrible  we paid for two teas yes you have to pay even for tea and they bought two foam cups and handed us two tea bags. we asked for milk and got a strange look and eventually someone came back with powdered milk sachets.     singapore to perth. the flight was delayed repeatedly and we were informed after we arrived at the airport. the baggage dropoff queue was about 100 persons long since there was only 1 staffperson attending that took 45 minutes of waiting which makes a mockery of doing online checkin. the cabin crew spoke poor and heavily accented english even for crucial announcements and seemed flustered all the time  as when asked any question. they did nothing to stop a parent allowing a child to play with balloons which burst periodically sounding like a gunshot. nor did they stop another woman watching a kungfu movie on her tablet computer without headphones. by the time one adds the checkin luggage meals and seat selection the ticket costs as much as an sia flight if booked a little earlier. since they do not have the same facility to check luggage through to a connecting flight one has to have the expense and inconvenience of entering a transit country immigrationwise just to collect luggage and check it in again when the other airline commenced checkin many hours later. so the parent company gets almost the same fare for an airline operating much cheaper and so makes a greater profit seems like the reason for having scoot is to run it so poorly is to make sia look better by contrast and convince passengers pay the slightly higher fare. in compensation for the flight delay scoot offered a trifling voucher to use on another flight in the near future  a highly unlikely scenario for most.    gold coast to bangkok via singapore with scoot. in march 2016 i booked a return fare to bangkok for myself and my wife for a scoot flight in october 2016. i received an email from scoot around september changing the return date from 301016 to 11116. unfortunately as a result i was unable to take the booking. the email from scoot advised that they would refund the return trip cost. i have called them twice for the refund each time taking at least 1520 minutes to get through to their philippine call centre. but still no refund. i am a frequent flyer member with singapore airlines and have flown with them often found them so efficient. how can you associate themselves with scoot it brings them down.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n    flew back from amritsar to singapore on 19th september. scoot system was down at the airport and they said they had no proof to verify if we had prebooked luggage. we have stopped printing our tickets and our phone was dead. check in staff then said to pay for the 30 kilos as excess luggage and claim refund in singapore which did not make sense. as system was down we waited 2 hours in the line while they manually wrote boarding passes. when we finally boarded my sister felt sick and wanted to use to toilet. the staff said she was not allowed to as they were doing a physical headcount. i then asked them if i could purchase water for my sister and they said they will not begin selling till the plane took off.  i wrote to scoot and all i got was the usual apologise for the inconvenience caused answer with no reason why passengers were treated so inhumanely.     taipei to singapore with scoot. i paid extra for 50 more leg room with my wife but was allocated 2 seats 6jk with faulty meal trays. mine was labeled with a sticker that sealed the cover of the tray while my wifes seat had a slanting tray. i alerted the stewardess about the problem before the plane took off but no action was taken. when the meals were served the stewardess didnt know what to do. after a few mins she came back and asked me to have my meal at the biz class seat while my wife was unattended. she was holding on to the food all the time until i finished eating. she was then asked to go over to biz class to have her meal. my wife was very furious with such arrangement and refused to eat and requested for a refund for the service paid but not delivered. 2 more stewardess came and said there is no refund policy. this is the worse experience i have with any airline. if the seats are faulty scoot should not charge extra for the 2 seats. my journey was ruined by the poor service.     i flew from singapore to melbourne return flight with scoot. on both journeys there was a delay with no explanations or any compensation. from sin to mel the flight departed with a 2 hour delay around 2am. families with babies were extremely tired at this point and not even a cup of water was offered by scoot staff. from mel to sin so far its 3 hours of delay and counting. i will definitely avoid this company in the future and will not recommend it to anyone especially not families unless the one and only consideration is money. im used to flying low cost companies but this one is really the worst.    perth to hong kong via singapore. i made a online booking for my son and myself. although i was on the scoot website i booked scoot on the perth  singapore sectors but the singapore  hong kong sectors were with tiger airlines. i paid for food on the perth to singapore sector and the singapore to perth sector. as well as seat allocation so i could sit next to my son. i also paid for extra legroom it was 79 aud for each seat allocation with legroom on the perth  singapore return sectors. when we boarded in perth we were allocated our seats but advised that we didnt order any food. as i didnt print out a hard copy of my reservation i had no leg to stand on and as had no wifi could not retrieve my booking. when i got to singapore they advised that i had cancelled the meals even thought i had been charged for them. i ended up paying again for meals on board with cash. was annoyed when i got to singapore that we were flying tiger i thought we were flying scoot. before we returned i rang scoot was on hold and on the telephone call for just shy of 2 hours to try and reinstate my meals. scoot advised that i could not get a refund for the food not used on the first sector and now they could not guarantee any food on the return sector as was inside 72 hours. i thought issue was resolved in singapore on the way up i was actually ringing to see why a seat hadnt been allocated out of hong kong for me as i had paid for it. i was advised that i had not paid for a seat. when we got to singapore and was issued with boarding cards for the singapore  perth sector our seats were not where we had paid to sit. when i queried this i was advised that we are just ground staff we cannot do anything and you will need to put it in writing. i did this when i returned to perth. only to be advised by scoot by email 2 weeks later that they were sorry for the inconvenience would give me a voucher for the value of 50 singapore dollars even thought on face value i paid 82 singapore dollars for each seat and nothing was mention of the food that was not provided 36.00. in total i spend 192.00 australian dollars for services i didnt receive. i will not be travelling on scoot again.    athens to sydney via singapore. decent flights and seats but a few issues that left us all a bit disappointed. their policy of charging over s10l for drinking water and refusing to provide any for free even on an 11 hour flight means their staff are constantly dealing with upset customers and are frequently grumpy as a result. as others have pointed out the call buttons are poorly places and set off constantly by people leaning on their armrests  the cabin staff mostly just ignore them. the menu was unimpressive especially for an airline based out of sin and the hot meals s12 were tiny. the seat belt signs were on for more than half of our first two flights with no turbulence and with most passengers and the just ignoring them. on the whole feels even more budget than airasia  airasiax or jetstar but a decent choice for the money if theyre flying where youre going.    flew from melbourne to singapore. scoot are the budget of the budget. the staff are unfriendly and incompetent. the plane we took had the least legroom of a plane ive ever been on and being 187cm i was in serious discomfortpain the whole flight. they do not have drinking water available except to buy at extortionate prices and even told us no outside food can be eaten on the plane. this isnt written down anywhere and im not sure thats even legal avoid.   firstly just as any budget airline scoot charges high fees for necessities such as bag fee of 40 usd and seat selection fee 14 usd. once on my 6hour flight from bangkok to tokyo  they wouldnt even provide water to passengers without a fee. it was 4 usd for a bottle of water  something that should be provided for free as a human right on any flight. thus i find it highly inhumane that the airline will try to make profit on such simple things. i asked for a blanket as it was an overnight flight and was told id have to pay for that as well  although most longdistance flights will provide them for free. secondly i asked the staff if i could move to an empty row in front of my empty row seat for more leg room  only to be informed that i would need to pay more. later i witnessed a few of scoot flight attendants take up the whole row that i asked to moved to in order to take naps as it was an overnight flight. i disembarked this flight with a very poor impression of scoot airline and will never use them again. i recommend using proper not budget airlines as the cost comes at to be the same.    took a business class from singapore to athens return. we booked our flights pretty early couple of months ago prior to the flight and booked our seats for the flight. paid about sgd 2.2k per person. from singapore to athens the quality of service and the standard of the service was way below par. the air stewardesses do not know what they were doing some told us that we could have free flow water some then told us that actually they do not serve water unless we purchase. thereafter when it came to meal time the stewardesses were clearly unsure of what was on the menu i.e. we were offered the choices of pumpkin or turkey wrap but actually it was a pumpkin and turkey wrap. as it was an overnight flight we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. from athens to singapore during check in we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. it was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance paid much more for our business class seats and the walkin customers whom came by the counters decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. and we can all foresee the counter staff ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. we sent in a feedback to scoot and as we can all expect it there wasnt any response from them. we met another passenger who also told us that scoot just cancelled his flight. word of advice if you really have to travel via business class seats choose the first row as the rows 2 and 3 are not worth the heavy price tag. there wasnt any certainty and your seats can be given away to others.    penang to singapore. i was literally screamed at by a cabin attendant when i wanted to take a general cabin view picture during boarding i grudgingly complied. with other airlines its an ok thing so long as you dont take pictures of cabin crew which is the regulation in europe. but why do they have to be so rude towards someone who just wants to document his flight experience my flight departed penang late which resulted in a late arrival in singapore. no scoot wifi on these planes. probably the only plus point was the ground staff in penang who were polite. so although the seat pitch and comfort was acceptable on this flight and the price was amazing the service was under par.     singapore to bangalore. worst experience flying with scoot. was not allowed to put my cabin luggage in the compartment above the seats and the air hostess was rude. i had to fly with my legs folded throughout the journey. never flying again with scoot.     singapore to kalibo via cebu. we are utterly disappointed with the service and food options on our flight from singapore to kalibo and kalibo back to singapore while we were flying to kalibo we have ordered some food on scoots menu but we were informed rudely by the cabin crew that it was out of stock. and when we return back to singapore after four nights the same food choice was out of stock again. when we asked the crew why is that so and he said that it was due to the food choice being only available on flights from singapore to kalibo  which is blatant lie  because we flew the exact said route four nights ago and were told that it was out of stock. disappointed you guys at scoot need to renew the onflight menu and educate your crew members    singapore to melbourne. absolutely disgusted to find that our seats 1a and 1c that were booked in february had been changed to 3a and 3c. complained at the desk in singapore who just stalled for time until our flight was called. advised that at boarding gate they will assist us of course they cant help as seats were already taken. on our return to melbourne i complained and was advised that i was sent an email in july regarding a merge with tiger. although our flight date and time did not change apparently our seats did which we werent aware of. they mentioned something about an upgrade at singapore and after reading the review of 12 august it appears our seats we booked were sold to a higher bidder. my advice fly scoot but dont expect seats you book and pay for. scoot are unapologetic and ground staff either ignore you or use other time wasting tactics until flight is called.    bangkok to kansai. due to the fact that i was in a tour group i couldnt choose the airline i was flying. i wanted to fly thai airways however that wasnt possible. on a timeline scale i reserved an extra ticket for my mum in business as it was on sale at the time. it was only 200 on the first sector so we brought it. it would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. initially i asked for an exit row and got the best seat 4j and 4h. however the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. once i got on board the flight attendant at the door greets you  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. i call the purser and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. they then say that this was a double seat assignment and that i had to sit in row 15. the seat itself isnt appealing and some short haul aircraft have better seats. i couldve paid extra for seats with extra legroom but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. luckily the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. but the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse the most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call buttonlight switch awkwardly placed on the armrest. i understand the 787 doesnt have call buttons on the ceiling but cant you find a better place for it after takeoff i order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. the lasagne tasted unappetising while the pasta tasted really bland. a little bit later in the flight i had ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. all this food set me back 50 singaporean dollars. the equivalent amount of food on airasia would only cost me a third as much and also tastes better.  on the flight from tokyo to bangkok the staff at the check in were friendly like japanese people are and i requested an extra legroom seat and found out i wouldnt be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. however my brother wasnt allowed to sit there so we asked if he was allowed to sit in the scootinsilence zone which he wasnt allowed to even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. there was a lady and her daughter talking in japanese in the counter next to us and later in the flight i saw her and her daughter who looked like she was 10 sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if i had a language barrier even though the guy at the counter wasnt japanese. the crew on this flight were much more friendly but still considerably cold. i went to have some conversation in the galley and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me. scoot is a horrible choice and i would pay much more in order to be able to avoid it. not worth the 500 i paid round trip.    singapore to melbourne return. i took scoot on a return flight from sin to mel and back the departure time was 115am and at 630am mel time or 430am sg time i was awaken because they were serving the premium meal that i ordered.  my premium meal breakfast came with haagen dazs icecream. at 630am while serving me premium meal the stewardess was stacking more than 1 meal on the tray and knocked a container of salad from the tray. it fell in between passengers seat. luckily my meal was served.  the stewardess while still holding a tray of meal  minus the salad was on her knees trying to locate the dropped salad. she then get another stewardess to help while still holding the tray of food. and when it was time to serve food to the rest of the passengers the cart carrying food was being emptied and so a stewardess asked another stewardess to bring extra food to refill the card. the air steward bought 3 trays of food and simply just place it on the floor on the aisle. the tray of food was on the floor for a full 5min before it was placed into the cart. seriously  food is terrible. why cant i order more than 1 meal per flight this is an 8hour flight please learn from airasia x to see how this can be done. cabin temperature is too hot. i was sweating on both flights    singapore to perth. first time trying on scoot. the seat space for scoot is small and there does not provide any inflight entertainment. i understand that as it is singapore budget air. however in this 5 hours flight the temperature in flight is about 2830 as it gets a bit suffocate thus create a great discomfort. other than that this is what expected for a budget air.    jakarta to singapore. a scoot stewardess acted so condescending. flight departed a bit delayed i had an urgent appointment right after the flight hence when my carryon baggage was placed in a row behind me i wasnt happy because if my baggage was behind me then when disembarking i had to wait for all other passengers to go before me. if my baggage is located at any row in front of me during disembarking i could follow the flow of movement of other passengers. i explained this to her asking either one of these i to move to any seat behind the row where my luggage was located or my baggage to be moved to any free space in the compartment at any row in front of me. she said theres nothing i can do and she pointed out that its not her job to move my bag. what kind of attitude she had. to me fly scoot last.    our first sector was sydneysingapore to meet up with our cruise. the supposedly new aircraft looked like a tired old wreck. the carpet was so badly worn. the cabin crew were aloof and not that approachable. they have a no you cannot eat drink any foodla but ours policy. one lady next to me opened a small bag of chips when one female attendant came and told her no eating own food not allowed so put away. the food we had paid for was bad. i understand about keeping prices down but what we got served up was so bad. no coffeetea for that sector but you could buy soft drinks. you were charged for everything  blankets food water. the flight home was even worse. an after midnight take off freezing cabin if your cold you buy blanket  only 10. passengers complained about cabin temperature no can fixla and off they would walk.    cebu to melbourne via singapore. the good thing about this flight is that you fly the boeing 787 which is a comfortable plane. there are however lots of downsides flying scoot  no in seat power despite this being common on the b787  seats are extremely narrow especially the window seat. scoot charges a ridiculous booking fee per person per flight which they hide during the booking process  airport tax in cebu php 750 is not included in your ticket and has to be paid separately i find this extremely deceiving  if you add everything up they are not cheap at all.    bali to chennai via singapore. on check in i was informed that i have to pay 320000 rupees more. no explanation as per why and when i insisted that i have paid everything needed to my travel agent when i booked the flight i was simply told that if i dont pay this extra money i wont be allowed to go on the flight. so i did pay it and asked for the iata reclamation form. the person in charge didnt know what a reclamation form is let alone have it. on the first flight i think i understood what has happened. a very impolite flight attendant served a meal saying that i have ordered a meal. i havent actually and if i had decided to buy it on the plane 2 meals for 2 flights would have cost 100000 and not 320000 rupees. what must have happened is that my travel agent wrote on all the tickets i have reserved that i am vegetarian and scoot interpreted it as if i have ordered a meal.     singapore to langkawi. scoot is one of the worst airline i have travelled in. the staff is highly unprofessional and at checkin the way staff talk to customers is derogatory. you get a feeling like as if you are flying for free and scoot is doing you a favour to you by letting you fly with them. even after complaining to manager about the unprofessional staff there was not a single word of apology or regret from them. this airline spoiled my mood during my holiday. also at the cost of this airline you can get air asia or even better airline.    sydney to singapore. planned flight 14th december 2017 at 10 pm. actual take off 15 december at 2 pm the worst budget airline. the flight got cancelled. it was announced at the gate few minutes before the boarding time. we had another connecting flight from singapore to sri lanka. however we were informed that we would be given another flight next day early morning. so we were forced to collect our luggage and return home.since we had a connecting flight wehad to pay another 900 aud to reschedule the flight to sri lanka. when we returned  next morning to sydney airport we were informed the scoot flight got delayed by 2 hours. ok fine still we had a hope that we could catch the rescheduled flight to sri lanka. however finally the scoot flight got further delayed and it left sydney at 2 pm on 15 december. when we arrived singapore our rescheduled srilankan airline flight has left and we had to book another flight to sri lanka by paying another 500 aud which leaves next day morning. finally we arrived sri lanka exactly one day later the scheduled arrival and paying more than 1500 aud extra for tickets and taxi. it was a horrible experience and like a nightmare to us. the ground staff at sydney airport do not even know how to handle such issues. they were unprofessional and appalling. one staff member laughed at us when we asked for compensation for the connecting flight rescheduling cost and the manager even threatened my husband saying she would not board us if we do not stop complaining. overall experience was unspeakably awful.   i have flown quite a number of budget airlines in asia and scoot is by far the worst and most unprofessional one. our flight from singapore to kochi was delayed for 1 hour and the pilot neither acknowledged the delay nor offered an apology. crew members were untrained rude and had extremely poor language skills. the return journey from kochi to singapore only upon asking at check in desk we were told that the plane was delayed for an hour. but we were puzzled to see that the original departure time was printed on the boarding pass. nowhere else in the airport or at the departure gate was there an indication or announcement of the delay. upon tracking the flight status of the incoming plane we realized that the flight was delayed for at least 2 hours and passengers were not promptly updated. at the end of the flight again there was no acknowledgement of the 2 hr delay nor an apology. when we feedback to the crew member she just drew a blank poker face and did not bother to respond. it was appaling to see a budget carrier associated with singapore airlines go so low in service standards. definitely never flying scoot again.    perth to singapore. extremely bad service regarding infants onboard even for a low budget airline. not only was there no priority boarding which is common for most airlines in the world but we werent even allowed to stand by boarding desk. had to take all our things and stand by another gate    melbourne to amritsar via singapore booked for january 2018. worst airline ever if there were negative points i could give them i would. appalling customer service incompetent staff on ground and in the cabin. they lost my luggage to being with and ruined the first week of my holiday. despite booking scootbiz and having flexibility in my ticket when i enquired to change my flight to leave early they quoted me usd 550 to change my ticket. this is after i paid usd 799 for my ticket. when i go to book a fresh ticket with the same extras etc the new ticket is usd 794. how does this work how are they even allowed to operate in the australian market    gold coast to jaipur via singapore. i am writing this review on the bad experience i had while travelling with my kids and old aged parents. we checked in from gold coast and got our boarding passes for our next flight to jaipur in gold coast itself. upon entering our flight to jaipur only them we realised that our seats were the last row which does not recline at all. we checked 14 hrs before the flight yet we got the last row. the staff were were not helpful when we asked for help to change our seats saying the flight was full. to add to our misery our hand luggage had to be kept in between our legs as the overhead compartment was full. the hot meal pack food is pathetic. other then that no much choice and very expensive. they dont even give water for free which is the basics. absolutely pathetic experience  with the extras cost it comes as expensive as any other airline.    sydney to bangalore via singapore. i picked this flight solely because departure from sydney was at 1.30 pm layover at singapore was 2.50 hrs then arrival at bangalore would be 10.55pm the same night  they delayed my flight at last moment and mailed that information to me at about 11.30 pm the night before departure so late i couldnt make any alternate arrangements. the delay was 2.0 hrs long  if it was 3 hrs or more the airline would have to issue every passenger a 50 voucher  however flight landed at singapore 2 hrs later than scheduled. before boarding the staff at sydney airport promised me that my connecting flight and stay arrangements would be sorted once i met the staff at singapore  my connecting flight had left 2 hrs before i landed staff was overtly rude. they patched me up with a much cheaper flight which would leave 8 hrs later overnight stay  upon asking about the accommodation  they asked me to lay around at the airport. biggest lesson of my life  never ignore the reviews about airlines before booking flights.    singapore to perth. what a disgrace. we rock up to the airport for the 14th and last flight of a round the world trip. we booked lounge access and scoot in silence as a treat to cap off our 5 week holiday. we find that our flight was not on the screen so go to the service desk. the lady says that the flight is still on and to head to the appropriate gate. as we were walking away we are called back to be told that the scoot flight has been cancelled and scoot has tendered a singapore airlines plane but there would be no refreshments or entertainment offered. on top of that we lost our lounge access and scoot in silence. about a week after we got home i find out that there has been fraudulent activity carried out with my credit card in india one of our stops around the world. i had to get a new card. i then started the process to get my money refunded from scoot and that has continued to this day 5 months later. they will not accept my new card details which has been provided in the form of an official letter from my bank. they are thieves and will not accept that they have stuffed us around no end. i will never fly with them again.    sydney to singapore. utterly appalling i know it is a budget airline but theres no excuse for getting the basics wrong. flying out of sydney to singapore on dec 29th the checkin queue was the longest i have seen one in my life  it went past the barriers and all the way down the public area to almost the next main exit. apparently they had delayed a flight the night before and it was now leaving about the same time as ours 1.30pm  3pm no problem that happens. but in this case they know exactly how many people are going to be arriving and when and there were so few staff checking people in it was ridiculous. i barely moved for 30 mins in the queue where the checkin counters were so far away i couldnt even see them and was now less than hr from take off. the let me skip the q but they should have had people separating the queue into the 1.30 and 3pm flights from the outset. a text message to flyers saying to expect delays at check in and arrive earlier would have also been a nobrainer. on the flight itself it took nearly 2 hours for the drink carton to come around by which stage a man at the back was dehydrated and distressed. the menu in the pocket related also to a different flight. i travel by budget airlines frequently but will never fly scoot again.    singapore to sydney. i am a regular scoot customer but unfortunately i had on numerous occasions been tricked by the scoot website unaware of the not very clear and not very straight forward system into paying extras. on my last oct flight while i unticked the box of not buying insurance it somehow was ticked at the final page and i had to pay the extra for the travel insurance which i had already taken up with another company. i just let this pass because it was not a lot of money. on my recent trip in jan 2018 i booked my ticket to taipei on 22 dec and decided to add a checkin luggage on 24 dec. i had went on the site to manage booking and add luggage and thought it went through and while it was christmas eve i had little time to follow up with email. on the 9 jan 2017 i arrived at tao yuen airport and put my checkin luggage and was told i did not buy any and was to pay ntw3660 for a 17kg luggage. i wish to advise those who are not very computer savvy to be very careful when booking online with scoot you need to double check very careful each step you tick or enter they will suck your money and no reasoning. i had many other occasions paid for chosen seat but being allocated another at the airport. you need to take screen shots on every step or they will trick your money. at the end of the day the fare will come to about the same as a full fare airline so why chose scoot.   i wish i had seen the reviews on this awful company. i have booked a flight to fly from perth to singapore this august with a connecting flight to uk a couple of hours later. scoot decided to cancel the original flight completely. they offered me a later flight but i told them it would not be any good as i would arrive in singapore after my connecting flight back to uk. customer service was absolutely no help. they would not give a refund or an earlier flight. please be very cautious when booking with scoot. they make the rules purely for their own gain. i will never use these again.    i want to leave my feedback on the poor service we got from scoot on our return flight amritsar  singapore on 6 feb. we experienced a delay of more than 3 hours. our flight was supposed to leave amritsar at 6h40am and left after 9h30. no explanation is given but the staff were very thorough in checking all the luggage with a couple of kgs above the limit so they could charge the overweight excess to the passengers. scoot kept 200 passengers waiting for more than 3 hours without proper explanation or apology. after a 5h30 long flight we arrive at changi airport singapore and are told to wait because the aircraft doesnt have a place to taxi. we wait 45 min inside the aircraft again with no proper apology or any kind of proper compensation. on a full flight with plenty of families with small kids they dont even have the courtesy to give out some water for the children. to top it off we reach the belts area to collect our luggage and our flight is not even announced on any screen. the passengers have to go around and guess which belt is our luggage being dumped on. for a flight that costs 400sgd return the service offered is shamefully poor. it shows lack of professionalism and respect for customers. it shows that the airline is more interested in making a profit on overweight charges than on the comfort and wellbeing of your passengers. dont recommend.    singapore to jakarta. this plane looks outside and feel very old inside. overhead compartments in our row are being filled up by passengers sitting in the far back thats 4 of us seated in 1 row with just 1 carryon and yet no space in both side of our overhead compartments  the staff requested we checked in our hand carry which inconvenient us since we put our important items in there. we have to take almost everything out and put them in a plastic bag so we can put them in the pouch in front of our seat while the carryon bag was checkedin.    taipei to tokyo. scoot nickles and dimes you constantly makes you painfully aware you chose economy. they charge you 4 for a bottle of water taipei does not have free water and an hour long securityout immigration before which you have to empty bottles. they will separate families in different rows. they wont let me use last two seats in aft of the plane saying there is a s20 fee each for them. the checkin staff took 15 minutes reading every page of my canadian passport like a magazine where people behind me got seats at other counters. the final verdict  flight is full sorry for bad seats.  no wifi food is expensive no customs forms for tokyo sorry. ceo says bad days of discount air travel are over i think he meant its going to be worse they have deep pockets owned by singapore airlines but they are miserly staff is polite and courteous but machine like lack empathy  thats culture of scoot superficial.    singapore to krabi and return on scoot. despite being lowcost ticket price similar to fullservice affiliates silk and singapore airlines on comparablelength routes. a320 was an old extiger aircraft with extremely limited seat pitch im only 178cm and my knees dug into seat in front of me. on both legs the aged leather seats had an omnipresent unpleasant and distinct smell. onboard entertainment nonexistent. onboard food laughably expensive 1520 for just a standard economy class size economy maindish without any accompaniments. hand luggage policies strictly enforced on kbvsin sector but boarding efficient. crew a far cry from competitors and were practically invisible. both flights departed on time though return was still a bit late. punctuality is all you can reasonably hope for when flying lowcost airlines but given the high cost of the ticket i still didnt feel i get what i paid for. you cant expect much when flying a lowcost carrier but scoot falls far below even its lowcost competition  and it has plenty in the region. its striking that the same group that does fullservice so right at singapore airlines can do it so wrong at its lowcost subsidiary scoot.    bangkok to tokyo. most horrible airline worst customer service. tried to pay my baggage online and the web page wasnt working properly. they charge me almost 80 when i checked in none of the people working in the counter were able to facilitate the way of payment. flying with this airline is as nasty as flying with spirit ryanair etc. they will have you pay in any way they will find. will never fly with this company again.   sydney to athens via singapore. its just a shame. the first flight was delayed 30 mins before boarding because they were cleaning the plane and then once we all had boarded around 50 more minutes without any explanation. on the second flight we landed more than one hour later. i think its crazy that they dont provide you even a bottle of water. you are stuck there easily for 12 hours and you dont get anything. even if its a low cost company you are still paying i tried to buy some food and they dont accept debit cards so i didnt drink or eat from singapore to athens. of course they dont have screens for entertainment. the air conditioning was crazy freezing. many people complained an old guy had a huge argument with one member of the crew. conclusion pay a bit more and be treated as a human.   i flew from singapore changi to sydney on 12218. what a mistake. the queue at changi was horrendous  we waited 23 hours with minimal desks open and like a cattle market. the plane was basic no screens no ability to purchase wifi on computer  but youd forgive this as its budget. but stocking enough food for the flight is basic and did not happen. landed at sydney and my luggage did not come. 5 other people were affected. its a direct flight how do you lose luggage they made me a property irregularity sheet with no reference number and simply said wait till we contact you. i had no clothes no belongings for 3 days. you ring the customer services and you cant get through if you do they cut you off happened twice because they cant be bothered or may be they are trained to do it. they eventually returned me my luggage but no offer of compensation nothing.    flew scoot from nanjing to singapore. it is important that anyone planning to fly with scoot has to take note that you dont need to purchase premium seats because they can be changed without your knowledge. assigned other premium seat as a result. scoot uses its condition of carriage as an agreement that they can change your seat without prior notice. if you want premium seat you can always do an upgrade onboard the aircraft. there have been many cases against scoot and majority lost their fight therefore their condition of carriage can be use as a mean to exploit customer expectation.    phuket to perth via singapore. this was my first and last flight with scoot. i was ill in thailand and needed to return home early. i tried to change my flights at phuket airport but scoot staff were not interested and there was no manager available . they gave me a phone number to ring  no answer. they gave me another 2 numbers to ring  again no answer. the email address for scoot did not work either  takes up to 10 days to answer. the next day scoot charged me 3 times the amount i paid for the flight home . so in addition to the flight which i did not use 7880 bahts  i was charged 23700 bahts for the early flight home. this amounted to 31500 bahts or aus1278 for a one way flight to perth from phuket. do not use this airline if you need to change flights. avoid at all costs. i regret ever using them and never will again.   scoot cancelling or changing planes without letting their customers know. we booked 4 tickets in december for a flight from singapore to perth on 30 april. unknown to me scoots booking system was apparently still in summer mode and scoot changed to winter mode which mean that our flight was cancelled. scoot claims that they have let me know via email that our flights changed but i never received the email. the sms they apparently sent to my work mobile did not even came up in a search of my phone records. i had to purchase a last minute very expensive flight on qantas because scoot messed up however when i asked them to refund my expense they claim that they have a no refund policy. be careful to book with scoot this flight cost us 8x more than planned and our complaints were met with a no responsibility and no care attitude.    manila to singapore. i had the worst experience from an airline in my life. it was unbelievably disrespectful and i was unfairly treated in manila airport. missed my flight due to long queue in the immigration despite checking in early and the flight took off earlier than departure date but thats not the problem. the way i was treated at the gate was a disgrace. instead of trying to listen to my queries i was bombarded by remarks where its not the airlines fault and its entirely all my fault and the airline is not liable. i was only trying to raise my queries 1 what happened to my ticket 2 whats the alternative to get to my destination. at least i get an idea what can i do next. but all i get is a small piece of paper with the customer service number to reach out to called the number and all i get was voicemail  all executives were busy. managed to get through once and while verifying the phone got dropped off. the most surprising thing is all the staff at the gate just left left me by myself i had to hunt for my luggage somewhere at the 4th floor of the airport and again no one was there. they had no idea where my luggage was and they made me wait at the corner for 45 minutes at around 12.30am. this is disgraceful for an airline. whats worst is how i was being treated. maybe those staff are just hurrying to go home with their bag packs. absolute disgrace maybe its a one off but this is the worst experience ive had in my life    gold coast to chennai via singapore. i paid extra for extra legroom seats and for food and beverages. on boarding the aircraft i discovered that my seats are not extra legroom seats. the staff refused to help me in any way despite having paid extra for those seats. all they offered was that i may get refund for the extra charges if i pursue with airlines office after completion of our journey. food quality and quantity were both pathetic.    bangkok to osaka via singapore. worst ever. flight information notifications confusing and misleading. we knew that no free meals would be provided but were astonished to be told that passengers cannot consume any food or beverages they bring to the plane. not even drinking water is provided unless you pay. was told that the planes used to have water fountains but they were removed. how mean is that our decision never again.    i have had a mixed experience flying with scoot. my flight to athens from sydney was uneventful and easy however my inflight meal which i purchased at the time of booking the ticket was quite rubbery and not hot. this isnt something id write a bad review over however my experience on the return flight back to sydney has been absolutely atrocious. after attempting to purchase additional baggage online multiple times on separate devices the website failed and crashed many times. i was finally able to get through and pay for my extra check in luggage 123 the night before the flight. upon arriving at the airport to check in on time i was told i was unable to because o had an outstanding balance of 83 to which they couldnt tell me what it was for but if i didnt pay i wouldnt fly. not only could they not explain this fee the attendant who was handling this issue seemed to be incompetent with their system and couldnt get it to work. although i wasnt exactly sure what was going on because she ignored me as if i wasnt there and would stop intermittently and fill a stapler with fresh staples this went on for so long that i had my baggage given back to me and told i had missed check in and now had missed my opportunity to get my flight. there was zero communication to myself as the customer no attempt by the staff to be helpful or treat this as an urgent matter to assist me in getting this issue sorted out and no apology for the fact that this was an operational fault of scoot as an airline. i was upset at the fact that i had now missed my flight and the attendant that had been supposedly helping me simply rolled away in her chair and sat behind a desk messing with receipts. not to mention the huge line of frustrated and ignored people behind me waiting for assistance for a separate flight. i cant believe how horrible this experience was as a customer. i hope the airline improves on this in the near future because id hate for anyone else to have to go through what i experienced today.    pretentious and unprofessional. we generally avoid scoot but for this routing the timing and fare were the best combination we went ahead. most important we arrived on time and safely and so did the luggage so no complaints about that. but in general this airline is really annoying to fly. their business class doesnt even have paper towels in the bathrooms  you can dry your hands on facial tissues. no blankets  unless you want to pay 15. oh and though its a singapore based airline they charge for extras in usd  because they are bigger. no entertainment  not even screens. seats recline somewhat. food varies from not bad to quite mediocre. service is officious and rigid  even when there were only ten people in the business class cabin they couldnt bring themselves to be flexible on mealtimes. everything is about the rules nothing is about the passengers. i dont think thats the fault of the crew  it is probably the management. trying to check in on line from tokyo was impossible because the website  whether the jp website or the sin website  only supplies singapore as a point of departure there are no other choices. condescending  the pilot refers to the staff as our scootees  as if they are owned property. its basically a runofthemill lowcost airlines with pretensions. i wouldnt say avoid at all costs i would say expect a quality of service and professionalism a little below airasia and you will probably get what you are looking for.    i will never go with this lowcost airline again. boeing 787 from singapore to athens on a 11 hour flight i expect a tv and and at least a free bottle of water for the money you pay but got nothing if you wanted water you had to pay. it was shocking never again.    kuala lumpur to surabaya via singapore. this is the first time i fly scoot. somehow i do have a high expectation since it is the lowcost subsidiary from singapore airlines. but my journey was quite dull. the interior of the aircraft is pretty much empty. the seat does not really recline or just broken. in comparison with other lowcost airlines if the ticket price is way reasonable i would not take scoot again.'"
