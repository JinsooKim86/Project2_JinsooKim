Tel Aviv to Vienna. The worst airline in the world; It is one thing to take security seriously, but to refuse to answer simple and righteous questions to why I am receiving an extra security check, violates my rights as a passenger and only suggests that staff, working for this airline, act extremely unprofessional and treat their passengers with absolutely zero human decency and respect. A passenger like myself, who has no history whatsoever, which could suggest a potential threat, deserves to be heard out, especially when the two companions, one of whom is my boyfriend, did not receive any kind of extra security checks. This airline treats their passengers like terrorists, without having any hint or evidence of any wrongdoing or criminal history. If you can avoid traveling with this airline, I would highly suggest you do so. This airline calls themselves safe and professional, but none of these values are taken into consideration.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

This is the only reason i fly with them since their equipment was old and broken. We fly business and we never got a comfortable seat (none is 180 degree flat), they are very old and do not work properly. The crew admits to these issues but nothing is done. We took many flights with El Al in the past, but no more. We will wait for the competition to bring the newer A/C (787?!) and lower the outrageous price that El Al charges when there is no competition. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Full business class with flat bad for 4H flight, excellent food and the best cabin crew I have met in the last 10 years. Professional, nice, calm, quick – best in class. Overall super nice flight thanks to the air crew.",Business,4.0,nan
Boeing 767,Premium Economy,3.0,March 2018,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,Johannesburg to Tel Aviv ,2.0," | I am a frequent flyer, I travel about 40 weeks a year. Using many companies from Virgin Atlantic to BA to others, London is a major hub after all. It's been many years since I've taken a flight with El Al. See I am originally Israeli and take pride in all things from Israel, but this one even my best selling skills cannot spinoff. El Al is charging 900 pounds for a flight from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv (I do LND to JNB every two weeks) which is 9 hours duration, they use a plane from the 80s that is so dated in its seats, décor and electrical (no USB ports or electric plugs) and no entertainment device for an 9 hours flight (thanks for helping me to focus on my work more). If I've had any other direct flight I would simply not choose to fly El Al. In short I'd say get your act together and be competitive, if more companies would fly to TLV you would simply go out of business.",Business,1.0,2.0

King David lounge is no more than poor, embarrassing, old and spartanice. The food is inedible. The 737-900 configuration is 2x2 with full business service but do not expect a full bed like in the 787 or 777 that El Al operate. The Air crew were very good as usual – that’s the best part of El Al, although issues with hand luggage - the aircraft was full and ground team were very soft - this causes 30 min delays as they had to take down lots of luggage from the cabin.",Business,3.0,nan
Boeing 737-900ER,Business Class,5.0,January 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Tel Aviv to Rome ,3.0," | Flew Tel Aviv to Rome. Flying business in single aisle aircraft in Europe is usually getting the same seats but without the middle seat occupied. On El Al you get 2x2 configuration with nice business seats and full business service. The seats are hard and manual but its dramatically better vs other options. The service on this flight was nothing beside perfect. Warm welcome, super professional and nice team. Really can be a top service in any airline.",Business,5.0,nan
Boeing 737-900,Business Class,5.0,January 2018,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,Munich to Tel Aviv,4.0," |  Munich to Tel Aviv. We can even start before explaining the check in and security process for El AL in Munich, which is the most complicated and unfriendly. Its start in Terminal 1 (the old one in the Airport), then goes to check in K. this check is located after the parking area. At the beginning you think you are lost. But that’s the direction. Then you arrive to the separated terminal dedicated to ElAl. No lounge for business class, slow check in and security, no shops or proper drinks (small kiosk with basic things). Flight with a friendly and professional air crew but who will remember that after the long long way to this terrible terminal.",Business,2.0,nan
Boing 787-9,Economy Class,1.0,December 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Newark to Tel Aviv,1.0," |  I have never been that much disappointed at a flight company. El Al has the worst service, worst meals, and worst manners i have never seen. I flew from Newark to Tel Aviv on the 28/12/2017 on the flight that is supposed to take off at 19h45. Although I booked 2 tickets when made the reservation, I was not even sitting next to my fiance. We asked to have the places changed, and a  rude lady told me the flight was full and she could not do anything for us, then when boarding she actually changed my fiance's seat to a more far away place. Once in the airplane, we discovered all seats were mixed up and everyone was trying to change seats and it was a big mess, we had more than an hour delay on the aircraft because people were being off boarded and their luggage needed to be found in the hold. We could not sleep in the plane because everyone was standing and even before we land the captain was begging the passengers to seat because they were already waiting with their suitcases. Last surprise was finding my luggage broken with things missing and my padlock disappeared with the zip. When going to the claiming counter at the airport, the lady told me that the zip was not included in the insurance, and she could not do anything for me. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Los Angeles to Tel Aviv direct flight business class on a 777. The seats do not recline to 180 degrees friendly staff and personal tvs. I agree the security is invasive during the check in process but in today's world I welcome it!,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Bangkok to Tel Aviv. After the friendly attentive Thai service from Melbourne to Bangkok El Al was a stark contrast. The security at Bangkok was excessive. I appreciate the need for tight security but only non-Jewish/Israelis were cross-examined. The guy doing the questioning was rude. I was made to wait for about half an hour then taken to a downstairs room - with no explanation of what was happening. My bags and shoes were taken into a separate room for inspection. I felt the entire time that I was a criminal. Onboard the flight was totally packed and the FA's did the bare minimum. I didn't get my vegetarian meal - but luckily the breakfast meal was vegetarian (kosher) and quite tasty. I will avoid flying EL AL at all costs in the future.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,The check-in security procedure is far too invasive including asking to see photographs on my camera itinerary on my laptop receipts etc. I understand the need for security but looking at personal photographs and items on my laptop is beyond ridiculous. The onboard service is mediocre food below mediocre and the quality of aircraft is below average - on two 6+ hour international flights we were subject to viewing in-flight entertainment on projection screens at the front of each section of the aircraft. My luggage was left in Tel Aviv even though there was a 5 hour layover.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,AMS-TLV-AMS. The security procedures were not too tedious or invasive security people were friendly. We flew Melbourne to Amsterdam by a separate booking and one of my suitcases was lost before the El Al flight. Schiphol staff filed the complaint and told us to follow it up in Tel Aviv. The plane was an old 737 the food was not so good neither was the quality of the service. In Tel Aviv the lost and found department not only helped handle the luggage problem but gave me and my wife free toiletry kits with T-shirts underwear and all the basics not just a cheap disposable type. The luggage arrived to the place where we stayed safe and not tampered with. The flight back was still with 737 but better service and food. El Al FAs might appear rude not paying enough attention but you do need to know how to talk to them. Overall I'd rather fly a European or Asian airline but El Al is acceptable when required to go direct to Israel.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,LHR-TLV return. The flights were busy but check in and security both ways quick and efficient. The staff questions were y polite and professional as were flight staff. The planes - ageing 767s - had no proper entertainment system but a better leg room pitch than usual in economy these days. Food quite poor. Overall: a much better experience than I had feared.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,"LHR to Tel Aviv return. Outbound on B777-200ER. Seats excellent PTV but I didn't bother with it. Economy over 80% full but staff attentive. After take off served drinks and nibbles followed by meal. Tel Aviv to LHR was a venerable 747 - dated but everything worked. Aircraft was full and cabin crew working flat out. The bargain was the seat upgrade - economy seats are fine but if there are seats free on board you can buy what's really a premium seat with about 48"" legroom at bulkhead or exit rows - just $39.",nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,International seats as small as domestic SAA. No drinks served understaffed food disgusting. Flying EL AL has been the worst experience of my life. Now I know what it means when they say you get what you pay for. I will gladly pay an extra few thousand rand next time to go another airline - but will never again fly EL AL. They are so concerned about their security issues they forget all about their customers. They make you feel like a criminal and treat you like a dog during flight.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,"EWR-TLV-EWR. First trip on new 777 almost full but we had the center seat empty. Food was good and hot. Comfy seats and minimal noise. Return delayed by an hour due to a broken lavatory door. No empty center seat this time and a ""would not shut up"" passenger next to me made this flight a lot less comfortable. Dinner good although served at 2-30 am! Used frequent flyer miles and the cost for two tickets was $155.00 US round trip.",nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Tel Aviv to Frankfurt on B767-300. On the bad side the flight was delayed for approx 2 hours due to a technical problem on the incoming aircraft. However we were given accurate information and breakfast was offered in an airport café. Aircraft was old but in good condition and clean. Seat comfortable and seat pitch fine. Staff friendly and attentive serving water during the flight. Hot meal was fine. Headphones free of charge IFE limited to old overhead monitors showing a recent movie.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,MAD-TLV Business Class B737-800. On the positive side attentive crew and excellent lunch service. Entertainment program enjoyable. Seat from the old generation but comfortable. Service and comfort would shine more with an upgraded airplane. On the preventive side some flights form the USA and South America connecting in Madrid with ELAL to TLV do not have enough time for luggage to be transfered and go through ELAL strict security process which includes passengers recognition of each piece. This is due not so much for the extra time for ELAL security but mainly for slow luggage transfer and baggage claim at Barajas airport.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,C-class Luton-TLV and return TLV-LHR. Out on a tired 757 with far from state-of-the-art seats and antique IFE cheerful crew decent food. Smooth security screening at Luton. Easy clearance through newish T3 at TLV. Return on a 777 - again fairly weary but with an excellent crew. I know my experience is not in accord with others but I found nothing really to complain about other than a somewhat tired collection of aircraft.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,CDG-TVL-FCO. CDG-TLV on B777. Aircraft reasonably new and IFE acceptable though not brilliant. Long boarding delays due to what seemed like poor organisation and passengers not following instructions. Econony class was reasonably comfortable. Food not bad. TLV-FCO on an old B737 IFE limited and quite poor and seats were not as comfortable as the B777. The service was reasonable and security whilst thorough and overbearing was not as bad as I had thought that it would be.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,I did not enjoy my flights from JFK-TLV-JFK. The meals were OK lack of legroom was appalling. The IFE was passable but nothing on demand just a few movies on a cycle. El Al is too permissive with the amount of carry-on luggage permitted. But the big problem is the passengers who treat the aircraft like a city park wandering the aisles clustering in conversation groups to the point of ignoring the crew’s instructions. El Al needs to enforce some decorum. Crew did their best to smile but seemed to have given up on any hope of more civility. Nice snacks in the galley throughout the flight.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Bangkok to Tel Aviv. Very old aircraft dirty and many features/items not working. Entertainment system appalling still projecting movies onto bulkhead screen and only radio options in seat. Too much cabin baggage allowed. Food surprisingly good although no frills like other carriers. Sparing with water but available on request. Lots of children on board so all bulkhead bassinets taken. Cabin crew did their best generally cheerful and accommodating. Long flight time but didn't have too many options to get to Tel Aviv was also expensive for economy class ticket. TLV security measures - be prepared and stay calm!,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Airplane dated and small seats but crew friendly. Breakfast good other meals fair to poor. At airport in NYC I was interrogated and my companion taken in a private room and his bags searched. Fine with us - I feel safer.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,"I have been flying El Al since 1968 but the last trip was the worst. The seats are smaller than most airlines and my seat was next to the galley the noise and smells were horrible. Instead of the advertised dinner meal- they have switched it to just a sandwich - either egg or chicken smothered in peppers. Flight attendents were actually very rude and sarcastic and informed me Israelis eat their meal at lunch - assuming no one else flies this airline - and they said breakfast was better - horrible also. After 40 years of flying El Al I was so surprised - they always had great food and extra if you requested it. I did send a complaint letter and they called me and said they are trying this now because they do cater to Israelis and they like egg sandwiches for dinner. They said maybe they will ""Sell"" food - well after paying about $1300 they will give you a sandwich and hope you buy the better food?",nan,1.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,TLV-LAX-TLV. Extremely poor service for unaccompanied minors. Despite having paid the 75 USD unaccompanied minor fee (150 USD roundtrip) at the point of origin the agent at the check-in counter at LAX forced my children to pay it again on the return trip. This despite the fact that the airline record which I later obtained clearly showed the fee was paid round trip. The refund procedure has been another nightmare. Upon arrival at TLV the employee who was supposed to escort my children to the arrivals area released them without asking to see my ID and without requiring a signature. Very sloppy indeed.,nan,1.0,nan

Never again! On all 4 legs of the flight I was treated like a criminal by ELAL security the front room staff are rude ask the same questions without listening to the answer they left me in a room for over an hour each time and failed to advise why. I appreciate security is very much needed but it must be professional. Israelis were barely checked!

nan,First Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,TLV-JFK. Flight was overbooked and denied boarding even though we were on a tour. I understand this is a common occurrence and that Israelis are given preference over residence of other countries. El Al wanted to place us on standby even though there were seats in business and 1st class. EL AL wanted to place us on the 600am flight from TLV to Barcelona with transfer to AA plane to JFK. So instead of arriving 600am we would arrive 300pm with no sleep. Not acceptable. Wanted to purchase 1st class ticket EL Al did not want to sell. Finally convinced El AL to sell me the 1st class tickets. Once I became a paying passenger I guess a group ticket does not count as a paying passenger attitudes change and El AL became friendly. Flight was pleasant lots of space seats folded flat FA attentive. Unless you fly business or 1st class cannot recommend this airline.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LAX to TLV recently and the worst flight I've ever been on. Bad leg room terrible food and an elderly lady next to me trying to take over half my seat I've come to expect nothing more from most flights.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,EL AL between London and Tel Aviv 4 times now and each time has been stressful in one way or the other. B767 has really bad legroom and is very cramped with very poor IFE. You don't get a choice you just watch whatever is being shown and Iwas a good 4-5 meters away from the pathetically small screen. Many passengers refuse to conform to any rules ignoring the crew instructions. El Al needs to be more forceful in maintaining a level of decorum. Food is very good service was friendly on flight and the airport. Security is lengthy but the security staff are polite. Since I don't have much choice of carrier for business flights I can be sure that I will be flying with them again but after 8 flights with El Al I'm as prepared as I can be - some good earplugs an eye-mask (they keep the lights on too long overnight) an ultra-small laptop to watch my own movies on the cramped seating area and the all-essential neck-pillow. Try to get the thursday evening flight out of Tel Aviv rather than the Friday morning flight - its a lot less busy albeit no less noisy and irritating.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,The restrooms and aisles were blocked for long periods of time as men congregated to pray. The seats were awful - narrow and hard.

I was seated next to the galley and the attendants left the curtain open at all times. I kept closing it so I could get some sleep since it was a 1 am flight but the attendant always opened it again. There was so much noise on this flight that I could not get to sleep at all. The reservation desk of El Al made a mistake with my return flight and it took 2 hrs at the airport for them to fix it.

One complaint is that they kept the lights on to allow them to sell Duty Free items for another hour. TLV-EWR newer B777 but not with IFE on demand. Service for dinner only a sandwich since it was a midnight departure. I got a Gluten Free meal which was nice and actually had a taste. The seats on B777 were nicer. EWR much easier to connect.

New seating in 'shells' meant there was no reclining seat annoyance. The angle of seat recline and general comfort was poor and I could not get comfortable.

In the end we spent about 1 hour at the check-in counter telling some young security guy about our private lives and personal relationship.

On the 16 hour flight between Los Angeles and Tel Aviv El Al kept the cabin lights dim and enforced all window shades shut for 14 hours. I have to concur with previous posters about the lack of decorum: some passengers insisted on fully reclining their seats during meals and landing.

We were not asked a single question by the check in agent. Within 10 minutes we had cleared security and had boarding passes in hand. We then went to departures where we went through airport security normal metal detector hand luggage through a screening machine. We never encountered any type of interrogation or any rude employees. The entire process took less time and was less invasive than an airport in the states. We flew a 747 in coach row 26 three seats together on left side of plane. The seats reclined a full 8 inches comfortable for a long flight. The in flight entertainment was great.

The food (special kosher) was atrocious there was only a limited (non alcoholic) bar selection and the entertainment was virtually non existent. Fortunately it was a night flight and the reasonably spacious aircraft allowed us to sleep. The staff however were very friendly and helpful and I felt they were trying to make up for the inadequacy of the rest of the product.

Practically all other airlines flying direct on this route or similar ones to the East Cost have switched to seats that recline to a full horizontal flat-bed position. El-Al insisting on an old fashioned 3-compartment configuration with a separate first class must differentiate the first from the business and remains with those seats that leave you slipping toward the floor in your sleep. Also the in- flight entertainment system on the 747 is years behind and offers close to nothing. They'll either have to catch up with the rest of the pack or be left with their ultra-orthodox crowd. It's a pity because the crew on both flights was eager to please and sometimes downright enthusiastic much more pleasant than anything I've encountered on other airlines.,nan,3.0,nan

The bathrooms were filthy just an hour after take- off and were never cleaned. My IFE wasn't working and I got a cold stare when I asked the FA to fix it.

On the outbound quite a few seats open in Economy Plus section a couple of rows in front of us and the flight attendant offered to let my husband sit there so my son could lie down across 2 rows and sleep. Food was adequate for economy class (but no alcoholic beverages offered except for red wine). On the outbound my seat cushion in 26A was loose and there was a big gap in the back exposing crayons and a number of other little goodies left over from previous flights. On the return we sat in row 25 just behind Economy Plus. When the people in front of us reclined they may as well have been sitting in our laps! Good for them regarding the recline horrible for us. Speaking of recline my seat and my son's seat would not stay reclined and I kept having to adjust them. Entertainment system completely antiquated and limited!

Fiasco getting my luggage at arrival. Crew speak very softly on microphone. Aisles are so narrow because airline is packing as many passengers onto aircraft as they can. I heard complaints about legroom in Business Class. Not worth extra investment I'm told. Eleven hours is a long time to be cooped up in such a tiny seat.

I don't sleep well on airplanes but the economy class legroom on the 747-400 was inadequate and made a very long flight rather uncomfortable even in an aisle seat. Food was OK but I don't understand serving breakfast for a second meal on a daytime flight when it is already 2 pm at the destination. Because the second meal was breakfast there was no soda served so my choices were water tea and coffee.

EL Al had recently been buying many 767-300's which are soon to be replaced by the 737-900 but for the time that they're owning them they are upgrading them which was obvious to me with mood lighting and the installation with Economy Plus.

On return trip we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our seats which we did as I had had both hips replaced. We accepted this and paid $99 each to be given two seats under the TV screen at the partition of the section I could not stretch out both of my legs as it was impossible. I asked the hostess to move the both of us as these seats had less leg room than we had previously been allocated. I explained to the hostess that we had paid for extra leg room and that it was impossible to sit in these seats for 10.5 hours. We were moved to the area at the kitchen which was more leg room. but the noise and traffic in the aisle was pathetic. To charge $99 each was nothing short of a RIP OFF. I suggest that It is about time that EL AL bought some new planes and retire these old planes to the Arizona graveyard. Never again.,nan,2.0,nan

The seats I was assigned were split 2 seats together and another 2 seats together mid-way in to the plane. I was under the assumption that when I get to the airport I could ask them to place us near each other as it would be very inconvenient and uncomfortable to be separated from family members on a long flight like this. At the airport the representative said she would see what she could do. There were available seats closer together and closer to the front of the plane. The last thing I expected was that the tickets that were given to me would be taken away minutes after. For no apparent reason the representative revoked the seats. As she handed me the tickets she simply said that she could not give us those seats anymore and the only seats now available were the ones in all the way in the back of the plane. She assured me we were still all going to be seated together and now that's all that could be done. The reps showed no remorse. After boarding the plane I realized that they put my 2 kids with my wife and had me seated in the middle section of the plane. I had to ask someone to switch seats with me so I could be near my family. The seats were unacceptably tiny for a 10 hour flight I am an average sized man and I couldn't move my legs! The smell from the bathroom was absolutely unbearable! I stood up for most of the flight.

On the flight to Bangkok we discovered that our seat were next to the kitchen. Needless to say that there was a lot of interference and I hadn't the opportunity to sleep much despite the fact that it was a night flight. The seats were as promised of an improved model with a higher pitch and a greater recline angle. On the flight back to Tel Aviv the Economy Plus section was situated at the front of the plane were generally you can find the Business Class. This time there was no kitchen nearby but the seats were of an older model with an increased pitch. El Al didn't deliver the same product on the two flights despite what is published on their site.

I needed to do exercises for my blood circulation but there was nowhere to move. If I stood in the aisle for more than ten seconds there was always someone pushing me one way or the other or the airline staff needed to get past. I stopped to talk to a friend and one of the other passengers who wanted to get past yelled at me to move. It may be more economic for ElAl to narrow the space and push in more passengers and earn more. Why not offer a bonus for anyone who remains strapped in their seat for the entire flight without moving! The entertainment was intolerable and unacceptable and geared to one sector of the population only. For a twelve hour flight there should have been a choice of films or music with a much wider variety. There was no classical music no games no non-fiction film no topics of general interest - nothing on Israel or on a religious topic.

When it looked like we were going to miss our connection my wife went looking for the one El Al employee in the baggage claim area. She told my wife that it wasn't her responsibility (wrong-the reservation was made through El Al) and to go talk to WestJet. When our bags finally came out we went looking for her again because we didn't know what to do. After we finally found her again she once again told us to find someone from WestJet (who then told us it really was El Al's responsibility but tried to help us anyway).

The best part is you didn't even start your ten hour torturous flight with El Al! You then begin to deal with the rude cantankerous flight ""attendants."" These flight ""attendants"" are there to throw your uniform meal at you and give you dirty looks and make you feel like they're doing you a favor by bringing you your food. The food is surprisingly pretty satisfactory. Maybe the only good thing about this airline is the meal. It's usually a dinner with chicken and rice and a pastry. For breakfast it's usually a piece of bread and a half frozen omelette with yoghurt. Then after your meal you want to try and get some sleep. You begin to think that after about twenty minutes the ""attendants"" will take your meal tray to the garbage. You might as well try to fall asleep because you will most likely wake up a few hours with the tray still there! The crew is unbelievably rude. While you continue to sit like a sardine in their cramped ""seats"" you try to fall asleep which is even harder. You then wake up after a few hours (if you're lucky) of uncomfortable sleep and wake up with back and neck pain.

They are representing their country so you would think that they would care about what visitors think but they were completely indifferent. Once the meal was served that was it you didn't see them unless you went to the back of the plane and asked for a drink and then they didn't even look at you when they poured it. The lack of service etc was even more noticeable because our flight from Australia was with Thai and we were very impressed. The flight back was in a better plane with more leg room and bigger screen but the entertainment choice was still so poor that I didn't bother much and the food was still average.

The online seat reservation system indicated a reserved window seat but on arrival at the airport I discovered that no reservation had been made and I was given the dreaded middle seat. The seat was uncomfortable and the adjustable headrest could not maintain its position. The wine revolution that has swept Israel during the last 15 years has obviously deftly bypassed El Al. The red wine can best be described as simple plonk better used for cooking. The meals were a little industrial but average on a world standard. The crew were friendly and tried hard. The purser's announcements were in broken English and thus barely coherent including the safety demo which was performed manually due to inop IFE.

We planned a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia in very high detail, about six months before traveling; flights and ground services were booked and were reserved accordingly. On July 3rd, 2016, we left with high expectation, a group of five people, to fly on EL AL flight LY081, planned to depart at 2230. We had a connecting Vietnam Air flight to Hanoi, with a layover of two hours and ten minutes, significantly higher than from conventional MCT. Although we did an early check in early, and left our contact information, EL AL did not update us directly on the two-hour delay in flight. We heard of this delay only on the way to the air field. The magnitude of the delay was reveled when it was too late to book an alternative connecting flight, while we still had the opportunity (free seats wise). We had to wait for hours before the flight left, almost 3 hours after the scheduled time. We arrived to Bangkok after an exhausting flight in El Al's old 747 plane, amazing to see this plane is still in service (seat handles ashtrays openings, still existing). Upon arrival to Bangkok, EL AL representative escorted us, trying to help us find a connecting flight. We were on a ""waiting list"" for Vietnam Airlines flight, which was scheduled to leave at 1905. If we had gotten on this flight, there would have been a minimal damage to our trip itinerary. We were delighted when we learned that we had seats available on this flight. But, we were asked to pay for re-booking of flight. EL AL were not willing to paying the additional $120 per person for this change. In order to avoid extra costs (cancellation of hotel reservation, change an itinerary, etc.), we decided to pay the above amount and to clarify the matter with EL AL, in a later stage. Unfortunately, the payment process prolonged and the flight left without waiting for us. When we turned to EL AL station, to arrange the next connecting flight, they declared they cannot help us, and told us to come back on the next day. We had to stay another night in Bangkok and cancel the ground services booked and paid in Hanoi, Vietnam. We found ourselves the first alternative connecting flight, that had seats available (Thai Air), and paid $ 350 per person. It goes without saying that since the trip was carefully planned, on a daily and even hourly basis, we had to make changes and concessions and disrupted our enjoyment. ",Business,1.0,nan

El Al showed no remorse that we were going to miss our flight to Vietnam, even so they wouldn't even write us a letter for insurance.

It is better than having a layover. My trip to Tel Aviv almost made me change my opinion which had previously been based on several previous horrible experiences on El Al. Trying to reach El Al by phone or even email is terribly difficult! I was trying to get signed up for Frequent flyer miles before the flight (the website didn't work) and I could reach no one. So back to the flight - the flight over was pretty good. The seat was the most comfortable I had ever had on El Al. The flight back, I paid an extra $150 for a seat with more leg room and more angle on the leaning back of the seat. The lady in front of me truly had more leg room and truly had more leaning back on her seat. In fact, hers worked so well, her seat back was pressed against my knees the whole flight and the lady also didn't want anyone touching her seat and let me know about it. Anyway, I paid extra for a better seat and it was less comfortable than the seat I was in going over that was just a normal seat. The movie, game, and watch where you are in the flight thing was out of order for the whole plane! There's more to the story, but this is enough. I can't get in touch with Customer Service. They asked for my opinion in a survey and I gave it, they did not respond to the reply that reported my dissatisfaction with the flight. It was a long 14 hour flight! And that woman kept her seat back until we landed! I can say the staff in the airports has improved their performance. I have been flying to Israel regularly for 27 years. The staff courtesy in the air has also greatly improved. The cleanliness of the bathrooms is remarkable, as they used to be filthy. I have said it before but really, I will never fly El Al again.

Boeing 777,Economy Class,3.0,November 2016,4.0,3.0,1.0,no,TLV to LAX,3.0," |  In October I arranged a trip with El Al from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles for myself, my wife and my daughter (seven years old). I was to fly to LA at the beginning of November. My wife was to fly out on Thanksgiving with my daughter. My wife was then to return to Tel Aviv a week later, and I was to return to Tel Aviv at the end of December with my daughter. I had no complaints about my flight to LA in November, aside from the '90s vintage entertainment system with several channels of movies on loops. The plane was comfortable enough and clean, with relatively good food and no trouble with the service. Then, due to an internal dispute, El Al arbitrarily canceled the flight my wife and daughter were to take to Los Angeles, providing no solution whatsoever and destroying our plan. We were notified of the cancellation a few hours before the flight, when they were already packed and ready to leave, leaving little time to make other arrangements. We were on the phone for hours trying to reach El Al, but nobody answered. My wife and daughter were crushed and upset. To salvage the rest of the trip, I had to scramble to book alternate flights with United and had to spend several thousand dollars on alternate flights—way beyond the cost of the original flights. I had to rebook my own return flight with United instead of El Al because my daughter obviously can't fly alone. There was no other option but to cancel the trip and return home. El Al was nowhere to be found throughout this traumatic experience. It wasn't until several weeks later that we received a refund for my wife's and daughter's flights. El Al refused to offer any compensation of any kind for the trouble or distress caused, or the additional cost incurred. After a month and a half of wrangling with El Al's customer service, the only compensation offered was a partial credit for the return flight I could not use, which could only be used for a single ticket with El Al. El Al's management and personnel are apparently highly irresponsible and incompetent, putting their own internal disputes above customer service. I highly doubt we will ever fly with El Al again.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,October 2016,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,TLV to BRU,2.0," | Tel Aviv to Brussels. As a frequent flyer of El Al, I've learned to deal with the sometimes outdated plane interior, long waiting lines at Ben Gurion Airport (both for check-in and security), delays and the absence of a proper inflight entertainment system on European flights. However on our last two flights with El Al, the cabin crew managed to reach an ultimate low for service standards. The night (early morning) flight from Tel Aviv to Brussels was packed with screaming kids and (praying) men, who hijacked the plane to turn it into one big playground. For 5 (early morning) hours we had to suffer from the constant aisle traffic, loud screaming and ultra-orthodox men and kids bumping into other passengers. Although El Al can't be blamed for screaming kids and annoying passengers, they should be able to cope with it. Unfortunately the crew decided not to act upon our (and others) requests to stop the mayhem. Even more so, the El Al crew encouraged the behaviour by announcing that everyone should get their drinks at the back of the plane, dramatically increasing the amount of aisle traffic and people bumping into us. For the rest of the flight the cabin crew did not visit passengers or provide any services to them. If you needed something you were to get it yourself from the back of the plane. Our flight back to Tel Aviv was much better, albeit that the flight attendants were particularly unfriendly and unorganized. When handing out meals, several rows were 'missed' and did not receive a meal. Apparently something went wrong with some of the meals. In the end we did not receive a meal. After notifying the crew, we got an unfriendly ""there isn't any left"". No alternatives were offered. Upon return home we filed a complaint with El Al as an opportunity to take away the bad feeling we were left with after the 2 dreadful flights and numerous service failures. Unfortunately El Al's customer service did not have the courtesy to contact us, despite several follow ups. It has now been over 5 weeks and I doubt we will ever hear from them. I do however know that we will not use El Al again. A company treating its customers in such an arrogant way is not worth my money.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,1.0,November 2016,4.0,2.0,2.0,no,FRA to TLV,3.0," |  Took this flight to go from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv in November 2016. Check in was efficient although the usual high security procedures. Check in staff very unfriendly. Seats were comfortable, food was good. The only thing that was really unpleasant was the mood and the friendliness of the cabin crew. No smile on their faces and questions are asked very unprofessionally. Instead of asking if I ordered a special meal they just said ""what's your name, what's your name, your name"". They obviously don't enjoy their work. Next this I will go with Lufthansa for a lot less money.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Courtesy car arrived at the promised time, met at airport by a porter who took me and my luggage to El Al Security and Check in, then he took me and my cabin baggage to Priority security. The lounge was quiet and ample Kosher Food was available. Priority boarding to plane, small but perfect First Class cabin, wonderful service from the Cabin Crew. Was loaned Bose earphones to listen to inflight music. Fresh and ample breakfast served on china with proper cutlery. Seat reclined to flat bed. Met at door of plane and escorted through Immigration and Customs, taken to courtesy car and driven home. Could not have asked for more. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Booked a baby crib, triple checked crib was available for us and was assured it is. Got on the flight and the crib is taken ""Because the plane got changed"". Had a 6 month old baby on my lap for over 11 hours. Also, when I book an El-Al flight I expect to fly with El-Al plane and crew, and not some chartered falling apart plane. In 2016, inflight entertainment should be the norm, especially when EL-AL advertises it. Spanish crew were nice and food is decent. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

The regular schedule flight has the lowest charter service levels. The cabin was overcrowded, with almost no leg space and narrow seats (I'm 60 kilos, not obese). Not enough space for luggage in cabin storage. The crew only did one cold beverage run. If you want tea or a second cup of water - you have to go to the stewardess and ask for it. Hard to judge about the entertainment, since no one offered headphones, even for a charge. Blankets are short in supply - first grabs first keeps. Only one pillow was detected. No seat swapping, not even for the obese disabled man stuck by my side (near the toilet). Security is good, but other companies offer it too. So, what's El-Al's excuse?",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The Boeing 737-800 is the oldest version as El Al is replacing it with the 900ER The business class seats are 2x2 manual and faraway from a bed position.

The 767 is old but it is clean and have the entertainment system called dream stream - you need to download the APP before the flight or you will get an IPad in business class with the app already there. Seats are 2x2x2 with the old version as it used to be standard in the industry 5-8 years ago.

Upon arrival the air crew welcome was very nice. El Al offer real business class with 2x2 configuration, full business service and meals. The 737-800 is the old version of the El Al short - Mid distance aircrafts. Most of the 737 they have are 900ER, the 800 is mostly for the low cost ""UP"" airline by El Al. Well, looking at the 737-800, the aircraft was old and needs proper refurbishment. Seats are very tough and hard and upper sides of the seat have seen better days. No WIFI and no proper entertainment system – headline group screens. Arrival to Tel Aviv the plane directed to out of the terminal parking and used the bus to the luggage and passport control, unfortunately El Al do not take care of business class passengers with dedicated van or transportation so the moment you leave the aircraft they treat you like an Economy class passenger.

Boarding was exactly on time with a warm welcome of the crew. El AL operate ""real"" business class in those single aisle aircraft meaning 2+2 and about 150* titled with full business service - separated from the economy with full service. Right after take off the team close the windows shade (we left 0530 AM) in order to give us a proper sleep.

After take off, the cabin crew served food to random people around the cabin, they just had no order. The cabin crew itself wasn't good, very impatient and unfriendly. The food itself was no more then fine, and the old IFE didn't even work. I slept most of the flight so I don't know what happend after the food.

Our flight was very bumpy and the captain kept putting on the seat belt sign - but not once did cabin crew come round to see if we had complied. And nor did they come round with water during the flight. Very poor! The flight was 30 mins late departing, with no explanation or apology. But at least it was bettter than the outbound flight which was 50 minutes late departing - again with no explanation. Food was bland and unappetising - very poor. Movies were acccesed on this aircraft on your own tablet (note - you have to download the El Al Dreamstream app before you fly) - but the movies were mainly pretty old.

When checking I was the 5th one in line to get my boarding pass and pass through security I understand you get questioned for security purposes but I was standing for 2 hours getting questioned one after another that’s all because on my US passport it said My nationality said I’m Kazakhstan - they treated me horribly and were so rude and made a huge problem on why I’m flying from Boston and not New York. I honestly don’t see why you can treat an innocent person like this! So finally I pass security after 2hrs of being questioned and got in line to get on airplane. So while boarding they asked me to come aside and into this security room and I asked the guy if there was a problem he rudely replied yes we do have a problem and told me I was supposed to be here at 730 and shut the door. I was never told to go anywhere after waiting for so long - in security room they check my bag and asked to check me id. So when I finally arrive to Israel when. Walk-in out after I had my luggage they made me walk through security all over again nothing was upsetting as this you have ruined my whole trip made it stressful to come to Israel and fly back home, how much tears I have shed to just come visit my sister who had been living in Israel since 2012 and see my friend on her wedding day.

It started late, no clear row for Business vs Economy, no priority for business or seats location, boarding all the aircraft in one call including wheelchairs. Security after gate and right before the aircraft was a mess as well.

Boeing 767-300ER,Premium Economy,3.0,November 2017,3.0,4.0,1.0,yes,Tel Aviv to Paris CDG,2.0," | I love the 767 as its not super big and for sure offers a better flight experience than the 737 all versions El Al offer to Paris. The economy is 2x3x2 so the windows seats are preferred by far from the middle one. I choose Economy + which offers a few more cm in space and a welcome kit including a bottle of water, basic amenity kit and basically that’s it. Same seats and same food as economy. The aircraft looked ok and yes we know it's an old one but first impression was ok. Then came the second impression. Many technical problems with the entertainment system during the flight so basically after 3-4 times the crew reset the system, they told us – we will not have sound today during the flight and we are sorry. In addition the reading lights were on all flight as they couldn't turn it off. The crew were ok and nice, but so many technical problems in one flight was not easy for them as well.",Business,2.0,nan

EL AL 'Lost & Found' at Ben Gurion airport is ONLY interested in getting the customers out of the way as quickly as possible; that was my experience both times. They don't listen to the customer's requests or details. This 2nd time I didn't even get a toothbrush. I had to explain that my luggage would arrive on the next flight (see explanation further below), I told the assistant 3 times and only then did she bother to check her system.  1st flight to Israel with EL AL: I explained my travel schedule but they took the luggage to my 2nd address, therefore I didn't see it for 3 days until I arrived. They told me they would call beforehand, they never did. When I called them the day after my arrival, they said it was already with a driver who was already in the North. 2nd flight to Israel with EL AL: Whilst flying, the stewardess told me beforehand that my luggage would arrive with the following flight (I was 1 of the first people to check in!). I was requested to go straight to Lost & Found after clearing customs. This time I only gave them the address in Tel Mond where I would be staying first. I told the assistant at Lost & Found where I would be staying AND I showed her the exact address on my phone (it was typed). The following day I called Lost & Found. The girl on the phone was in a hurry and she said that the driver would call me. I had to tell her 3 times to slow down and please listen. I wanted to double-check the delivery address, then she insisted that I was staying in Tel Aviv and not Tel Mond. I had to convince her that was not true. She then gave me the courier's telephone number upon my request and just before she hung up, I double-checked the address again. Only then did she notice that she gave me a number for the Tel Aviv courier. I was put on hold twice, then I got a different number; unfortunately, that courier told me he wasn't working. I called Lost & Found again to explain; a different girl (this time) also insisted that my address was in Tel Aviv. The previous customer assistant didn't change the information in the EL AL system. She connected me to the previous assistant, again I was put on hold, then I got the correct number. Regarding luggage: if you don't pro-actively chase up EL AL, then things will almost certainly go wrong.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

El Al's Boeing 737-900ER are the most modern model before the 737MAX that are now being delivered to airlines (not to ELAL yet).

Boeing 737-800/900,Economy Class,3.0,October 2017,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,Luton to Tel Aviv,3.0," | Lucky the travel agent kept seats for us in advance because the online check-in is really not good on El Al. They don't even give you the choice to pay for a better seat or to upgrade with an additional cost. Lucky we have Israeli passports, so the security check in Luton was fine. Non-Israeli passport holders are subject to harsh security questioning. There was a delay in boarding – more than an hour. The monitors at the terminal kept showing that everything is on time – bad joke. We were sitting at the gate, I was looking for an electricity point to charge my phone, so asked the guy at the gate (not an El Al worker) if I can use the electricity point. He said ""sure, it's just another ten minutes till they finish cleaning the plane"". So I understood that the ground service company working for El Al at Luton, isn't really a good one. Makes sense, as Luton is a low-cost airport and El Al operates a regular full service commercial flight, bit of a clash between the two. After boarding, the captain announced that due to bad weather the flight was delayed. Really? It was hardly raining all that time. What bad weather was there? Took off 70 minutes late. Upon arrival at Tel Aviv, about 50% of the passengers did not receive their luggage. Yes, approx. 50% of the passengers on the flight. We were told that due to bad weather the luggage could not be loaded on the plane. Again, really? Come on, flights take off when snowing. A few drops of regular, normal English rain can't to that bad to a flight procedure. Just admit that you have a lousy ground service company and that you don't really care about your clients! Friday morning the lost luggage claim was opened. Till now, Saturday night, almost 48 hours later, the tracking website shows ""still tracing luggage"", the El Al representatives on the phones tell you a different story each time you call. To conclude – last time I flew with El Al was 5 years ago. Now I know why. There are better options at better prices and at better service.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
