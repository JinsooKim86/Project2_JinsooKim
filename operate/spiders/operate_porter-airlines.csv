nan,Economy Class,1.0,August 2018,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Washington to Windsor,2.0," |  Washington to Toronto. My flight was delayed by 3 hours going to Washington and again 3+ hours on the way back. Both times the communication was not existent and the customer service the worst I've experienced. They lied every 30min and what they told didn't match the delay emails we would receive. Even the flight attendants from Washington to Toronto couldn't crack a smile which could have gone a long way considering the terrible experiences and lies we had just endured. Upon arriving to Toronto already at risk of missing my connection. That flight was delayed as well. I explained my risk and not one person attempting to help or call to say I'm coming. Nothing! I then was searched not once, not twice but 4 times, before I could run to my gate just in time to have the gate attendant shut the door. All I received from there were excuses and blame on me, instead of an apology on behalf of the company. Completed disappointed and will not take this airline again.",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,February 2018,5.0,1.0,nan,no,Mont-Tremblant to Toronto ,5.0," | Mont-Tremblant to Toronto flight was due on Feb 20, Porter re-booked me to Feb 26 - six days later. Reason was bad weather. No compensation, no hotel, no alternatives. As a couple, we both needed to get back to town for work, so we booked at taxi for $250 and drove from the ski resort of Mt Tremblant to big Canadian hub city of Montreal, stayed in an airport hotel ($200), and flew out the next morning. We got to our work locations a few hours late. Subsequently, I contacted the Manager, Customer Relations, Porter Airlines, who said ""The rescheduling of your flight six days later was based on seating availability and make a claim with your insurance or credit card provider."" Basically - tough luck. We spent $4000 on this ski - hotel - flight package, and had to scramble and arrange for ourselves a taxi, new flight, hotel in the dead of cold winter night in remote French speaking Quebec resort town - lovely customer relations Porter!",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,July 2018,4.0,1.0,nan,no,New York to Toronto,3.0, | Porter Airlines New York to Toronto flight cancelled. Stated due to weather while radar shows no rain or high winds. No comp offered for extra hotel or taxis. Next flight was too late next day to catch Monday meeting. The icing on the bad service cake is that they damaged my luggage and their solution is for me to leave or at the airport for repairs then spend more money to go pick it up once fixed. No concept of accepting responsibility for what used to be a pretty good airline.,Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,June 2018,3.0,1.0,nan,no,Boston to Toronto,3.0," |  Boston to Toronto. We recently flew with this airline for a short commuter flight (approx. 1 hr 40 mins). Our flight was delayed 40 minutes, but with little explanation as to the delay. Our pilots did endeavour to make up time in the air. The design of the plane is such that, depending on the seat, passengers may experience louder in cabin noise (than had been my experience with other airlines). In-service was fairly standard, but did include free alcoholic beverages - I believe there was one white and red wine selection, respectively, and one brand of beer. On arrival, we were met with damaged luggage - one hardshell suitcase had been cracked and punctured, and one softshell suitcase arrived scraped, dirty, and weathered. We submitted a claim for the hardshell suitcase and were directed to also follow-up by phone. As the damage was extensive, we declined the airline's offer to attempt to fix the suitcase, but decided to accept the reimbursement for the bag (a standard amount) that would have at least partially paid for the replacement of the bag. After leaving the counter, we awaited the free shuttle advertised as a perk of flying with this airline. However, after waiting 15 - 20 mins, we learned that the shuttle was not running that evening and that we would need to find another mode of transport into the city. When we did arrive home, we did follow-up with the airline but were only able to leave a voicemail, re: compensation for our baggage. After not receiving a return call within 2 weeks, we found another phone number for the airline and connected directly with a kind agent who apologized for our baggage difficulties and for the missed contact. She also informed us that, unfortunately, unlike what had been described at the baggage counter, this airline's policy would not allow issue of a voucher to cover the replacement of the exact style of bag that was damaged (part of a set), but only offered a replacement bag that the airline deemed as equivalent, or a travel voucher with the airline. We did learn that, because the planes are smaller, bags are stacked (more so than, I imagine, with a larger carrier) and potentially resulting in the damages we experienced and reported. We are now paying out of pocket to replace our luggage. After this first experience with the airline and for what was to be a relatively short flight, I cannot recommend this airline. Even if this was a unique experience, the response of the airline still leaves us without recourse and paying more out of pocket to replace our bag than was the cost of our flight. It is not worth the expense of flying with this carrier when other major carriers fly this route, and without these challenges.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Before booking our flights to Halifax for a weekend getaway, we had also looked at other airlines. Our choice then fell on Porter Airlines because it offered better prices and better travel times compared to the competition. Both flights departed on time, and the seats were comfortable and had decent legroom. Porter only uses Bombardier Q400 turboprops, which are efficient and reliable airplanes. Snacks and drinks were offered, and were good enough on both flights. Overall, both plane rides went very smoothly, and I remained positively impressed by Porter. Highly recommended.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

No explanation for delays, other than the convenient weather excuse.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
Bombardier Q400,Economy Class,4.0,May 2018,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Toronto to Boston,3.0," |  Toronto to Boston. Frequent flyer with this airline here. When it's good it's fantastic, when it's bad it's a disaster. The Good: The higher tiers of VIP status are very useful. Free front seats, free luggage, free flight changes, priority re-accommodation, line bypass at security (although this has not been consistent lately). Free change to earlier flights on certain routes. The city center airport is great for anyone living downtown or traveling to business meetings downtown. The wait at customs is never long. Security usually not bad. Luggage to carousel time at city center airport is crazy fast. Free snacks in the lounge and free drinks/snacks/alcohol in flight. Flight attendants are usually pretty nice. Even before I had VIP status, they would occasionally accommodate a change or request where any other airline definitely would not have. The noise doesn't bother me as I am used to it at this point, but if you are used to jet planes then you will find these planes noisy. The BAD: Flights are fairly regularly significantly delayed, mostly during the winter months. Flights get cancelled more often than other airlines as the planes are tiny, so is the airport/runway, and the weather by the water is not always cooperative (fog!). 2. Communication to customers regarding delays is almost non-existent. You can track your incoming plane on a variety of apps and know the outgoing flight will be delayed by a ton, but Porter rarely reports the delay until 15-30 minutes before the original scheduled departure - at which point most people are already in the lounge waiting.  City center airport's US departures and arrivals side is mixed with the Thunder Bay/Sudbury routes for some strange reason. The result is long waits at the gate once the plane arrives, just sitting around doing nothing and stuck on the plane because a Canadian flight is offloading/boarding and the US arrivals can't mix with the domestic. I have waited up to an hour to get off the plane in the past because of this problem. One of the absolute most frustrating thing about Porter. 4. Unpredictable line bypass - this has been worst in the last 6 months. Those of us with VIP rely on our security line bypass, often arriving 30 mins before a flight with carry on only. It seems to be unreliable lately on the US side with the line often closed.",Business,5.0,nan

They literally cannot take their planes off on time. Once your flight is canceled be prepared to wait 4+ hours to talk to a customer service agent in order to have to privilege of getting your money back.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,It takes you back to the days when airlines actually cared for the customers and they were not just a seat number. The cost of the flight was perfect for our budget. We took advantage of a 30% discount that was offered during Christmas time. They gave us the opportunity to choose the seat we wanted on the flight. The aircraft was clean and for it's size comfortable. The cabin crew were courteous. It was nice getting a glass for drinks rather than a can or a paper/plastic cup. They also provided a delicious snack during the flight. There was no extra charge for a glass of wine. Check in great - they have kiosks set up so it take only moments to check in. Pleasant waiting for the flight in a very comfortable lounge area and again provided with refreshments at no extra charge.,nan,4.0,nan

The check-in desk had a small issue with my passport details but this was sorted out with no complaints. Boarding was very quick as my flight has only 20 passengers. Departure from Montreal was on time. The seats were really comfortable and crew were friendly. Inflight service was a beer and a bag of chips, which was generous for a really short flight. Arrival into Toronto was on time and as I did not have any checked luggage I was at the terminal exit in just under one minute. It's great they have a free shuttle bus service to Union Station - that saves passengers a bit of money. Will be happy to fly with Porter again in future.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I have used Porter for booking business flights for management and colleagues and in the past year we have had numerous cancellations of flights with very little or no notice. Porter should not claim to have so many flights per day to certain destinations when they cancel flights on a whim because there is not enough people on them. I would not recommend this airline for anyone using it for business travel unless they allow themselves a huge window prior to their first meeting or chances are they won't make it as their flight very likely will be cancelled and they will be bumped to later in the day.,nan,1.0,nan

The lounge was modern and comfortable enough with frequent updates on flights delayed due to weather. The cafe area in the terminal was a nice touch but was a bit messy when I arrived and the toilet needed a bit of freshening up too. Onboard cabin was clean legroom great service friendly and professional. Tiny onboard snack served and a real glass of wine. Can't complain. Good value great service on the ground and in the air.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,NYC to Toronto and delighted by Toronto waiting lounge. The airport is extremely convenient to downtown Toronto (arriving we walked to the new Thompson hotel. Returning we took a cab for about $8.) The waiting lounge in Toronto features seating for 2-4 people with small tables reading lamps and low screens so that every seating section feels semi-private. They also offer complimentary coffee tea sodas and snacks (nuts Walker's shortbread). I found the check-in and waiting experience convenient and pleasant.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Toronto to Chicago Midway was outstanding. I had to reschedule last-minute and had this done with no questions asked for a pittance. The experience at Toronto airport is civilized. Check- in staff friendly and the same number of agents (check-in and waiting lounge) would probably serve like 20 times more people at a regular airport. In the lounge free wi-fi espresso teas soft drinks munchables papers power plugs and fabulous views of the city. On the plane there was some tasty food and drinks served in china and glassware. And when we arrived our bags were waiting for us taken off the belt with handles pulled out. How's that for a nice touch? Plus the immigration at Midway is a breeze. I enjoyed the lack of commercial outlets around the airport - this is down to taste but do you really want to pass through rows of greasy spoon and faux haute couture establishments on your way to the plane? The only legitimate concern remains their apparent willingness to cancel flights.,nan,4.0,nan

Have not experienced flight cancellation/consolidation with Porter in three trips thus far in spite of having two flights being nearly empty! YTZ is immensely convenient and in spite of some lower fares to YYZ they rarely make up for the increased stress taxi fare and time that comes with flying into Pearson. Porter is much more stress- free. Good cabin and service for short-haul excellent ground staff in YTZ - nearly missed my flight and they managed to get me from the ferry to the gate in 5 minutes flat (do not recommend trying this intentionally however)! Good service and value but VIPorter frequent flier program needs work - coordination with booking system and check-in is poor (name on VIPorter didn't match passport name necessitating a few annoying calls).

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Montreal-Toronto. Morning flight. The night before there had been weather related issues that disrupted the positioning of crew and equipment resulting in cancelled and delayed flights in the morning. It happens and one cannot blame an airline for that. However the ground communication was not good. Porter has a problem in providing updates at the best of times. Although I received an email I was already at the airport when it arrived. I noted that the flight crew was at the gate and one of the additional delays was due to there not being a flight plan issued for the already delayed flight. I am usually a big fan of Porter's inflight service but the service on this flight was poor. All I wanted was a glass of water. The FAs forgot our row and the one behind us. Minor issue but when added to the flight delay and poor management of the situation it put me into a grumpy mood. It was my worst Porter flight experience. Porter is the preferred commuter line for business travellers and on this day it successfully encouraged a great many to consider the alternative Air Canada service into the airport. I hope Porter improves as I do like the airline but its slipping bit by bit and will see this reflected in the loss of passengers as they return to the AC shuttle flights.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,First time flying Porter Chicago Midway to Quebec City via Toronto round trip. Bottom line: excellent. Arrived in Toronto and was a bit confused on how to transfer to the connection. Coming into Canada from USA one retrieves checked bag (even though checked through) and goes through Canadian customs. Once through customers one takes it upstairs to connecting flight bag transfer where it is scanned and sent on its way to the connecting flight. On the return to the USA this step is not necessary since USA passport control and customs is done at the USA destination airport in my case Midway in Chicago - which was very fast. I echo the comments of others pleased with on board services. The only thing that would make Porter even better from my point of view would be to add on board wi-fi. One additional suggestion I would add is to always check in at the Porter service desk once you get in your lounge (they have a USA bound lounge and a domestic Canadian destination lounge). For web check in travelers which I was one there is an added security step that they need to do. I had thought this was done in Quebec city but apparently they had missed that.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,I have mixed feelings about Porter. I have found flights between Ottawa and Toronto are getting cancelled more and more often. Sure they'll bump you to an earlier flight if there is room but they are also quick to cancel your flight and leave you stranded for another hour or four in the airport. It's not bad in Ottawa as you can walk around (just a huge inconvenience) but in Toronto it means you're stuck at a tiny airport with nothing to do! The lounges are nice and it's great to get wifi service but if these flight cancellations become any more frequent I'm going back to the other airlines which is why I'm giving this air service a lower score (otherwise I'd probably put it at a nine). Staff have been nice enough which is why I'm not reducing the score to lower yet.,nan,3.0,nan

The direct flight from Pearson is two hours however I live 10 minutes from the island airport and over an hour from Pearson so for me the time was neutral and avoiding the crowds annoyance and expense of getting to Pearson was a big plus. Check-in security and the waiting area at the island airport makes you feel like a person travelling again. The turbo prop planes they use have no vibrations (unlike other prop planes I have flown on) and it really feels just like a jet.

On the morning of our flight back to Dulles I received an email that our 11am flight had been cancelled and we were rescheduled on the 6pm flight. I called customer service to get booked on the 1pm flight and of course that flight was fully booked. Porter had only re-booked one seat on the 6pm flight not two. I spoke with the customer agent and the best they could do was put us one in front of the other and recommended I ask again at the airport. As we were 2 hours from the airport I had to reschedule our transportation to the airport. At the airport the check in rep did manage to change our seats together. The terminal is comfortable and complimentary coffee snacks and soda helps pass the time. I would fly Porter again when offering a decent sale price but I would be prepared to be flexible!

A lot of folks are impressed with the time savings of flying an airline from the Island. Here's my experience when arriving from the US. We arrived a half hour late due to weather — not Porter's fault. However Billy Bishop Airport should have been named Mickey Mouse airport. When the plane arrived at the gate people anxiously got up to leave. After a few minutes the plane's door opened and people started getting off. Then those people were sent back into the plane. It turns out that a domestic flight was loading and it's against rules for international arriving passengers and domestic passengers to mingle in the same zone. Why there is only one zone I don't know. People on our plane had to wait until the other plane was loaded. Then at Canadian Customs and Immigration there are two officers for passengers and one other who looks after airline staff first before helping with regular folks. Since another US flight had got in just ahead of us it took about 40 minutes to get through. However I was surprised to see people who had been much closer to the front of the Customs line still on the Island waiting in another line for the ferry to take us back to the mainland. I find that Porter uses its seat sale promotions as a classic bait and switch. I was enticed by the low fares advertised but could not find those fares on any flight that was convenient. In the meantime I'll pay the extra limo fare to go to Pearson and fly Air Canada which everyone loves to hate but which over many decades has proved to be extraordinarily reliable.,nan,nan,nan

Cancel your reservation and forfeit any refund you may get. The money would be given as a ""credit"" to use on another Porter flight. 2. Take your luggage and leave. You could then call Porter and see if the flight was rescheduled. Of course if you miss the flight you don't get a refund or credit. 3. Wait for endless hours and hope the flight takes off at some point. Of course if the flight is cancelled you would likely be stuck in Jersey for a couple days until it could be rescheduled (due to Memorial Day). Continually lied to by Porter CSRs and were only told the truth by the flight crew. No more slots to fit the flight in until Saturday and they hoped to fly it out after the airport officially closed and land at Pearson instead of Billy Bishop. This is ultimately what happened.

Only one seat indicated to be available. Call customer service. Initially they have us sitting several rows apart but finally get 2 aisle seats same row. Refuse to allow us window and aisle seat same row without payment for seat selection. We never pay for seat selection on any airline - and we fly worldwide - not starting now. Told the flight is full. Go online and pretend to book five tickets same flight pay for seat selection - get desired seating. Do this while on phone with customer service and they still refuse to change our seats. This is a simple request and a common one. Accommodate your customers. Better yet make your online ticketing and check in system work so it recognizes that people who book together should be seated together. This is not rocket science.

I am a very frequent traveller and thought that over the years I have encountered every type of delay and issue but this one just floors me. We are travelling for a sporting event that Porter has associated with and offered a promo code and now they have us leaving before the event is even over! I am nervous now that my flight won't even be scheduled correctly for the departure. I can understand weather mechanical delays etc but scheduling this wacky is poor customer service. I am now faced with an extra night in a hotel and a complete upset in my schedule. When I speak to the customer service they are not apologetic.

There was no effort to either consolidate the lines or open another line to handle the 100+ passengers who had just deplaned leaving it to people in the competing lines to fight it out between themselves. I had to intervene to prevent a screaming match from turning to blows. There were people on my flight who had been trying to get a flight out of Newark via Porter for two solid days and failed.

The diversion is due to a curfew on landing and taking off from Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport. Our issue is that Porter Airline did not communicate to passengers that the flight would be diverted. Porter did not inform those waiting to pick up passengers at Billy Bishop Airport. Airport was closed at 23.00 and no staff were present. The family member sent to Billy Bishop Airport was left searching for our daughter.

There was a standby in Toronto which would have got me home 2 hours sooner but there were no procedures in place to ensure that those most affected were given priority.

They took two trolley loads of baggage off and re-configured how they packed everything. Funny how they were re-loading golf clubs and not luggage! When all was said and done five pieces of people's luggage were left behind. I don't understand their logic in loading golf clubs when luggage was supposed to take priority. I don't understand how Porter can promote themselves as a golf destination airline and then not understand/plan that majority of people are going to travel with a piece of luggage and a golf bag. They should be pre-planning for 50lbs per person and make sure that requirement can be accommodated.

Then they said there was a mechanical problem and they had to wait for another plane to come in. After finally boarding they announce we are 20th in line for take-off. Then the airport shuts down the runway for 20 minutes. By the time we take-off its after 10pm so no way we can land in TO before the 11pm curfew. We fly for about an hour thinking we are going to Toronto when they tell us we have to land in Ottawa. They blame all this on the weather. Put us up in a hotel 30 minutes from the airport. Porter fails miserably when it comes to having a back-up plan and communicating with their passengers.

The flight from Newark to Toronto was on time and the service was faultless. On arrival in Toronto all looked okay for the next leg to Sudbury but then that flight was cancelled because of maintenance issues. I was shifted to a later flight scheduled to depart four hours later but was delayed by a further two hours. Many other flights were also delayed. Credit goes to the cabin crew on this flight for maintaining a positive demeanour despite being faced with a very grumpy passenger load. Based on comments I heard on the aircraft and have read on here cancellations and long delays have become commonplace at Porter. I think this airline is perhaps growing too fast and its aircraft inventory is too small to cope with anything but one of those extremely rare days when nothing goes wrong.

Flight left about 10 minutes late and after 20 minutes in the air the captain came on the PA system to advise that a latch had come loose on the cargo door and we would be required to return to Chicago. Another 'mechanical' issue I suppose. Flight eventually left one hour later so that we arrived about 2 hours late. So Porter wasted 4 hours of my valuable time yet wanted to charge me $75 for having 1 kilo excess baggage. I think the service was really unacceptable.,nan,1.0,nan

We got to the carousel and there was no sign of our checked luggage. Eventually a cleaner told us he'd seen someone from Porter go off with two cases. We searched around but could find no Porter desk or even a representative. A helpful lady from United suggested we go through customs and then contact the Porter office, after she had asked by tannoy for a Porter representative to go to the carousel to no avail. Eventually we found the Porter desk, which was unmanned. A contact number was displayed and we spoke to someone in Toronto, who clearly didn't care. They were aware that two bags had been collected, but the agents had gone home!!! Both our cases had a mobile number on the label, but no effort was made to contact us and so it was off to our hotel with no luggage. This is a small airline with no back up provision and no sense of customer service. They have no help desk in arrivals and you're left wandering around the airport looking for help. The following day we rang their customer services in Toronto and were promised a call back - none ever came. They then admitted that they were unable to ring international numbers (they're an airline!) and so couldn't ring our UK mobile. Our hotel receptionist was incredibly helpful and eventually got confirmation that our cases would be sent by courier to our hotel. She told us lost cases were quite common, but the airlines normally delivered them in the early hours of the morning. She'd not heard of an airline closing up, going home for the night and abandoning their passengers. Our cases never arrived by the promised time and it was after several more expensive calls to Toronto that we were finally re-united with our bags. ",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

No reason was announced publicly, but a Porter employee said that the crew did not show up. We were re-booked on a flight the following day at 7:35pm (more than 26 hours later). This flight was delayed significantly and eventually left after 10pm, which meant that it could not land at Toronto City airport (which has an 11pm curfew). So it landed at Hamilton, and Porter bused us to Toronto. We arrived at about 1:15am on June 20, more than 30 hours after our scheduled arrival time. The ""travel disruption"" was the worst I have experienced in 40 years of flying. Porter seemed to regard the cancellation as a routine event, although they were incompetent in handling it. They provided no information about the cancellation by email or text message, contrary to their claim that they will do so. No Porter agent was at the gate at the scheduled departure time of the cancelled flight. They also refused to book us on another airline, although seats were available. They were also very disorganized. Initially, they handed out vouchers for a Hyatt hotel near the Dulles airport, but the hotel refused to accept the vouchers, and people who went to it had to come back. Evidently the Porter employees didn't know the hotels with which Porter has a contract! They then collected those vouchers and eventually issued new ones for a hotel much further away, without a restaurant and not within walking distance of any restaurant or food store. During the flight that ultimately landed at Hamilton on June 19, the flight attendant claimed not to know where the plane would land. She announced that we would land at an airport other than Toronto, and gave out information for landings at Toronto Pearson and Hamilton; she issued only a very perfunctory apology for the re-routing and got angry when passengers complained.

They refused to put us on a wait list for the remaining flights for the rest of the day. Porter are not equipped to handle the slightest deviation from normal operation of their daily schedule.

I was supposed to fly from Boston to Montreal via Toronto (PD946/493) on June 30, 2017. However, my last leg from Toronto to Montreal was canceled. I would even say ""canceled in a mean way"" : the flight was already delayed, it was finally time to board, and then they provided an argument for cancelation citing some problems earlier this day. You can imagine the mood of about 75 passengers lining up to be handled and rerouted by only 3 people of Porter. Just do the calculation: let’s say 50 units of people times 10 minutes each divided by 3, that is a long waiting time when you are upset and tired. My turn finally came at around midnight. Airline staff were evidentially overwhelmed by the situation and not at all cooperative. First, they only wanted to reimburse the lost flight or book you on another flight two days later. These were the only two alternatives, nobody talked about taking charge of food, lodging or other expenses, which occur during such a situation. Fortunately, I had the luck to talk with our corporate travel agent during my waiting time, who consulted me not to accept any reimbursement and push for other alternatives. Furthermore, she informed me that Porter Airlines had empty seats on Saturday. Confronted with this statement of open seats the next day, my counterpart from Porter simply stated that they were for paying customers and not available to us. Also, they were unwilling to put me on another airline. So, I eventually accepted a flight on July 2, i.e. 2 days later, and they actually had to offer me to take charge of the hotel, which I had to look for myself. But, I was advised that all other expenses are on my account. Let’s make a long story short. Instead of getting to Montreal in some hours, I will hopefully arrive within 2 days. This all is quite upsetting, but what upsets me most is the uncooperative attitude of Porter’s staff. Personnel did not show any empathy or concern for their passengers in this situation, even worse, they did not even try to support or accommodate its passengers during this mishap. =",Business,4.0,nan

Porter has no problem rescheduling you when they cancel their flights or they are late and we miss connections. Flights must be safe, aircraft fitness and weather rules must be followed, I get that. I think about half of my multi leg Porter flights work out as planned. Recent flight was delayed an hour and a half due to inbound problem at Toronto, arrived in Toronto late, the flight was on the ground, but closed. They would not hold it, schedules to keep you know, spot on next flight. Another time, meeting finished early, can I take an earlier flight? No, wait for my flight, it arrives late, as a result I miss my connection to Ottawa, instead of home an hour and a half early, its 2 hours late. It goes like that. In my view it costs them nothing to fly you in a vacant seat, earlier flight. And after the many times they've slipped my connections, maybe they owe me consideration.

That doesn't work for people trying to schedule meetings and events.

Before security, a Porter agent runs up to me and tells me I cannot have a 'third piece' (my blazer). I tell her it's just a blazer (not even a full suit).

Outbound we got offered the same snacks as served in the lounge with our beverages. Complimentary wine was served in a real glass. Returning (same time of day) we got a lunch box with a half sandwich and cheese and crackers. I would still prefer to fly in a jet than a Dash 8. They claim it to be quiet but its really only quiet compared to other propeller planes. All in all nice service and a good product. But really 20 years ago all the airlines offered a snack lunch free drinks and in a jet. The Toronto Island Airport is a great location but it will be nice when there are some facilities before security to allow people to visit before going through security. One concern is that with the amount of overwater flying Porter undertakes using this airport on Lake Ontario (and now they fly to Newfoundland too) I would have thought that the seat cushions would at least double as flotation devices.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,August 2017,3.0,2.0,nan,no,Halifax to Toronto,3.0," |  Halifax to Toronto. I started flying Porter Airlines this time last year, they were a perfect solution to the many trips I've taken to and from Canada. However, my last experiences have been nightmarish. My girlfriend and I started our trip at Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) in Toronto, our flight was scheduled to leave at 5:45 on a Friday. We arrived at the airport around 4:00 to an extremely crowded check-in counter and mile long security line. The line was serving no function as customer service representatives were pulling people out of the line based on their flight number.  Not to mention, the flight updates were coming simultaneously with the scheduled times of departure. We waited about an hour in check in, where we gave up and brought our supposed checked luggage back to our apartment. At that time we found our flight was delayed further. Long story short this process delayed us around 5 hrs from the time we were supposed to fly until we found out part of the leg of our trip from Montreal to Halifax was cancelled around 11pm. We gave up and went home. We ended up rebooking with Westjet - and flying out the following night. Coming to the end of our trip. We were scheduled to fly again with Porter from Halifax - a stopover in Montreal - and to arrive to Toronto. Our flight was set to leave at 7:30 pm from Halifax, it was delayed before we got in. Then we boarded around 8 pm, then deplaned due to mechanical failures in the bathroom. This delay put us back another hour. At that point a porter representative explained to us that since we delayed our flight so long. Billy Bishop would be unable to accommodate us due to their curfew. So our options were Pearson or Hamilton. Which was just a bold face lie, when we got in the air they told us Pearson Crews were on strike and we were headed to Hamilton where a shuttle would bring us home. I'm usually not one to complain, but this airline has been totally oblivious to the basic needs of their customers. As we landed in Hamilton, an automated voice came over the intercom with a pre-recorded message. Then the stewardess pulled out a binder to read a standardized apology on behalf of the airline. Saying ""we're sorry, we have arranged a shuttle, there will be no refunds"" - ""we hope you have enjoyed flying porter"". At some point this company has to step up and face their problems head on, and take some responsibility for the service that they value providing.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Never did they ask why we had to get back on time, just made the call on his own. First and last time for us. We waited beside the counter not knowing we weren't getting on.

The novelty of the free lounge wears off pretty quickly if you have to be there for an extended period of time. Also, the time and money saved on the journey to Billy Bishop is not worth the risk of my flight being delayed. Another big disadvantage is that there is no US immigration/customs at Billy Bishop.

This call never came. We kept trying to reach the call centre but they shut at 11 PM! We ended up paying a huge fare to finally fly with Air Canada as Porter never got back to us. Since then we have contacted Porter through the web form, call centre and even at the airport desk - this happened 2 months back and our complaint has still not been handled. I work in the travel industry and am not a fan of North American airlines but this was a new low.

Ultimately when I arrived in Toronto to speak with the staff I was told that it would be too bad for me, and that there was a staffing issue so I was stuck in Toronto. I could rent a car or take a train and be reimbursed later. I took the train. The next day I watched my phone like a hawk for any trouble regarding the returning flight for my daughter and myself.

I took another train at my own expense to Toronto to make it home. I did not get home with my daughter until after midnight because of this, My entire weekend was spent on a train and a phone on hold with Porter, I was screwed around by Porter and the staffing issues that were clearly at the forefront of the issue, these flights were booked months ago and were cancelled with no time for alternate arrangements to be made.

Before departing for the airport, I checked the status of the flight and noticed that the morning flight from Toronto to Timmins had been cancelled. This happened to me the week prior. No reason is given for the flight cancellation, but it appears that if the flight is not fully booked it will be cancelled, usually within hours of scheduled departure.  Unfortunately this appears to be a routine practice for Porter. Upon checking my scheduled flight, there was no delay indicated. The flight was scheduled to depart at 3:45. At 3:47, I received an email indicating the flight would be delayed and would not depart until 4:17 pm. I was at the airport and checked in when I received this email. A 32 minute delay is minimal, but the actual departure was not until 5:50 pm. As is usual, there was a distinct lack of communication from Porter staff. I have been given a $100 voucher from Porter, due to the previously mentioned flight cancellation. The voucher must be used towards another Porter flight. I will not use the voucher, nor will I fly with Porter airlines again.

This is for a flight that lasts 50 minutes in the air. Porter has almost on the hour flights to Ottawa, but they put me on a flight that is 10 hours away and ruined my plans. In addition, the call centre takes on average 40 minutes to talk to someone, all the while hearing ""your call is important to us"".

My original flight was two months ago and I have had zero response from customer service and no follow through on the vouchers that were promised to us at the gate. I need a simple piece of paper that state that the flight was indeed cancelled, and the reason, so that I can submit it to my travel insurance.

Always check your email, never assume that Porter will text you critical information, such as flight cancellations. According to customer service: we communicate by email. My call to customer service ended in being disconected by a supervisor after repeatedly questioning why the flight was cancelled.

However, it turned out to not be worth it whatsoever. My original flight was delayed for hours, then finally after continuous delays, they cancelled it altogether because Billy Bishop does not allow planes to land late in the night. They rebooked me for a flight the next day, which I couldn’t take because I would have missed the event I was flying for in the first place. I requested a full refund, and they said they would process it, and over 14 weeks later I have not gotten any money from Porter. I have called them multiple times, and each time the wait is over 30 minutes on hold to be told that my refund is processing. The next time I had to fly to Toronto, I took Westjet. Even though one of my Westjet flights was cancelled, they gave me a place to stay for the night and provided transit to the hotel.

The only drawback was that on the return leg, the waiting lounge in Toronto City Airport was busy making seating a bit of a problem.

But I was lucky enough to get on standby and make it home the same day I was meant to fly out.,Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Bombardier Q400,Economy Class,1.0,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Timmins to Toronto,1.0," |  Porter Airlines delayed my return flight from Toronto to Timmins on November 9, and it was a disaster ultimately diverting to Hamilton (which they failed to tell everyone until boarded and door was locked so we were trapped and not headed to our destination). Beware, they do this on late flights I've come to learn. The flight did not post a delay but did not board and no announcement was made prior to the scheduled departure time of 5:45pm. At 5:52pm I received an e-mail notification of a delay to 6:15pm. Shortly after that, the ground staff announced the delay and said it was a short delay “due to scheduled maintenance” (which made no sense as I assume you do all scheduled maintenance at your hub in Toronto or the GTA). At 6:03pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 9:20pm. There were no updates provided every 30 minutes per their ”Delayed, Diverted and Cancelled Flights” policy. At 7:43pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 9:35pm. There was no further information provided in respect of what was happening during all of this, which we later found out Porter was flying up another plane and the one we were supposed to fly on had been taken out of service). At 8:25pm I  received an e-mail notification of a delay to 9:45pm. This made it 4 hours, which according to their ”Delayed, Diverted and Cancelled Flights” policy meant passengers should be provided with a meal voucher – This did not  happen. At 9:52pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 10:00pm, at 10:23pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 10:20pm. Eventually, the flight boards and there was no warning about what was to occur next. Once everyone was on board and the plane door closed the Captain came over the PA system and said that we would not be going to Toronto but rather to Hamilton, Ontario (over an hour away by car) – there was no other detail provided. I asked the Flight Attendant what this meant and she said that we would fly into Hamilton and then a shuttle bus would take us to the Royal York hotel (not to the Island Airport to be able to get my car – which you could not get off the island given the delay). Several passengers demanded to get off the plane – this meant a further delay, by now it was approximately 10:30pm. I asked if I could fly out the next day and was told I could, so I decided to get off the plane. When I got to the counter inside the terminal at Timmins the agent said that the morning flight had been cancelled, again another fact not shared prior to my decision to disembark. They also told me the midday flight around noon was full on November 10th and I could not get on that flight, leaving the only option the 5:45pm flight the next day. I was told Porter would not provide a hotel in the circumstances but I could make a claim, which I did and they denied to pay anything other than $8.00 for a meal. I had meetings in Toronto on November 10th so I had to fly out in the morning, that left my only option to purchase a one-way ticket with Air Canada on a 5:20am flight (cost $392.42 CAD), plus meant additional expense to transit from Pearson Int’l back to the Island to retrieve my vehicle.",Business,1.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,2.0,May 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Boston to Toronto,3.0," |  Boston to Toronto. It was my first time flying with Porter, and will be the last. Both ways, my flights were delayed by hours at a moment’s notice (was told at the gate). I  should’ve paid a little more and flown with a more reputable airline; Porter was a waste of money, and more importantly, my time.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,May 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Halifax to Windsor,nan," |  Halifax to Windsor. Extremely disappointed with Porter. They delayed my flight five hours to supposedly get a part for the plane. How this was not known until after we should have boarded is beyond me. They handled it poorly, basically you're out of luck and have to wait. All other flights are booked as well so I have no options, and will be missing a day of work now.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Toronto to Newark,1.0, |  Toronto to Newark. Worst airline I have flown with. They constantly cancel flights at a moments notice due to various issues such as ‘crew staffing problems’ at a moments notice. They then don’t answer the phone and I have been on hold for 3 hours before hanging up. Very slow to refund cancelled flights. Very expensive to rebook with a different airline at a moments notice. ,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,April 2018,4.0,4.0,nan,no,Toronto to Sudbury,4.0," |  Toronto to Sudbury. 3 round trip flights with Porter over a one month period. 2 return flights cancelled, Porter can't fulfill it's part of the agreement. I recommend avoiding Porter unless you have lots of time to be wasted on hold and stuck at airports waiting for Porter to delay your ""rescheduled"" flight. I will no longer be subject to Porters terrible customer service.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,November 2017,nan,nan,nan,no,Montreal to Toronto,nan," |  I sit and wait on the phone for about an hour and a half to receive a refund and no one bothers to pick up. I understand there was an ice storm and that the airline was not able to fly us  (Sunday April 15th - Toronto to Montreal). But if you keep canceling and rescheduling flights for two days later, giving a credit does not seem appropriate. I would like to get a refund. I had to take the train to make it to Montreal, at my cost, and I do not wish to have a credit with Porter and run the risk of this happening again during my next booking. If only customer service offered a person to listen and help at the end of an hour and a half wait, I would not have written this review. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,April 2018,3.0,3.0,nan,no,Boston to Toronto,1.0," |  Boston to Toronto. I had broken my foot while in Boston and needed to get home so I could get casted in hopes to avoid surgery. There was a storm in Toronto (obviously not Porters fault,) so the my cancelled our flight and rescheduled us on another flight three days later! After 5 hours on hold to book an earlier flight I was told there was nothing they could do and that they couldn’t give me any feedback whether or not to go wait at the airport. When we got to the airport my husband and I were booked on different return flights that day- which was fantastic. But I was appalled when I got on my flight (first one out so I could go to emergency) and saw 2 free seats on the plane. We were missing work, spending $300 a night on hotels, I was in severe pain and unable to walk- and Porter offered no support while having open seats on a flight. I’ve had negative experiences with Porter before but this cinched it- I will never fly Porter again.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,April 2018,3.0,3.0,nan,no,Quebec to Washington D.C,2.0," |  Quebec to Washington D.C. Beware: 30 minutes before boarding your flight it could get cancelled. Then they can't put you on a different flight until 4  days later because they are such a small airline and have no partners. What's worse is that no one can get you a refund, even after you've waited an hour and 37 minutes on the support line. When asked about a direct extension to call into (because they said they couldn't refund you since you didn't book directly with them) they have none. When asked about an email to use, they said they only have an ""online form"" which, if you read it, is for ""Compliments, suggestions and complaints"". Absolutely amazing. My point is, yes, this was a very unique experience, but as an airline based in Canada where the weather is often snowy and knowing their planes are smaller than the normal commercial crafts, you would think they would hire more people to give you support at the very least? When to fly with Porter: If you have all the $$ and spare days in world and don't mind just having your entire travel plans twisted at their pleasure. When not to fly with Porter: If you are a normal person and would rather not spend twice the amount to return home. Their actual flight experience is average. Nothing different form a major airline. They entice you with free drinks/snacks, but its your average things. Nothing worth spending time stressed out about making it home, booking last minute travels, and spending 12 hours on the road.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

This airline seriously lacks organization, as my last 5 flights have been delayed by 2 hours or more. Finally have learned my lesson and will never fly with these guys again.

I received an email that our original flight time from Newark to Toronto was cancelled and rescheduled but when we went to check in, the woman asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight out. Frustrated with the cancellation we gladly agreed, only to go through security, check our bags, sit on the actual plane, to be told to get off the plane as only I had been moved to the earlier flight while my friend was not. After getting our carry on back, we were lectured by the airline attendant that this was our miscommunication. Due to this, my friend and I doubted that our luggage would be placed back on our original plane and not lost. I do not recommend this airline what so ever.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Due to fly Porter Airlines from Newark to Toronto City. This airline is so unorganized. My friend and I were told we were moved to an earlier flight, got checked through the gate only to be told by the flight attendant that only one of us was moved to the earlier flight. I was rudely told to leave the plane, and after asking for an explanation I was confronted by one of the Porter Airline employees who continued to tell me the whole thing was my misunderstanding and mistake. Now we are waiting on our original flight and had to make sure our luggage wasn’t being sent on the earlier flight without us. Not a good experience at all.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
