nan,Economy Class,2.0,November 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Gatwick to Toronto,3.0," |  Gatwick to Toronto. The flight left on time and arrived on time. Service was not friendly or welcoming. It is an acceptable pragmatic level of service, that suggests a sort of begrudging tolerance for people being on their plane. The food was not great, the salad was served frozen (complete with ice chunks - there was no one in visible sight that ate this) and when we advised the flight team, they were aware of the problem saying they would report the problem back again. Seating is saggy, not uncomfortable but it was not the top of seat comfort that is available on longer distance flights. The onboard entertainment options are terrible, poor movie selection, no tv screens on the two groups of side seats (6 out of 9 seat abreast) and the central 3 seats share common screens appearing every few rows. Air Transat was nominally cheaper than other airlines, but only nominally. The time of their flight was more suitable for our purposes but better options exist at very similar prices.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
A310-300 TS,Economy Class,4.0,October 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Toronto to Paris,3.0," |  Air Transat is a terrible airline. I hope to save you the time, money, and stress that this airline cost me. Honestly, pay the little extra and go with another airline, Air Transat will get that money out of you somehow anyway and probably more. Flew Toronto to Paris. Cons: Online check-in system: 1) It let us check in without informing us that the expiration date I entered on one of the passports did not meet the requirements to fly to Europe. They only told us once we got to the gate that we could not board the plane. Had their system given us an error, we would have had time to get an emergency passport before the flight. They cost us $1000 in extra travel costs as we needed to buy another flight. Their customer service was one of the worst that I've encountered. 2) Checking in online does not save you from their line-ups at the airport. Horrible customer service when you call - takes 20 minutes to get hold of someone and when you do get someone they are rude and will do nothing to help you. No in-flight entertainment, you have to download an app and use your own device which you cannot charge on their planes. Not acceptable for an 8.5 hr flight! Even the things they did have on the app were terrible, random episodes of shows, and outdated movies anyone? Did not even respond to my complaint after we got back on vacation - it seems like they don't care what kind of experience you have, they already have your money. If you have any dietary restrictions at all bring your own food - they may have a meal for you, but any of the snacks will not meet any requirements. Don't drink anything - we had a turbulent flight and the washrooms were not in use for the last 3-4 hours of our 8 hour flight. Pros: The in-flight crew were decent - the crew that checked us in were okay - I guess they didn't lose our luggage so that's something.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

I later asked about accommodation etc but the check in staff were asking each other about this, we were asked to sit where we could (the checkin area was tucked away in a corner the next floor down from the main checkin area). A chap arrived later and told us we could have a room in the Gatwick Hilton and a voucher for food to the sum of £10 each. We were told how to get to the hotel but no transport was provided (my wife and I have walking disabilities) it took us 20 minutes to walk there. Not at word was mentioned about any form of compensation for the delay. We eventually arrived in Vancouver having effectively lost a day of our trip to Canada. Today is 2nd November and after many efforts by both my UK travel company and myself, apart from a “do not reply to this email”acknowledgment we are still awaiting a human response.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

I have taken many trips in my life, and this one has got to be the worst one! Terrible from the moment my husband and I booked in September until our return, the customer service was very poor. The agents gave the wrong information, I had to call over 5 times and each agent gave me a different answer. This put a sour taste for our honeymoon. Once on the flight I was even more disappointed. No service, no drinks, no snacks. On our way back, a rude woman in front of me pushed her chair all the way back on me to the point of actually hurting my knees. I asked her politely to move her seat up and she refused. I called the flight attendant and instead of acknowledging my feelings, she tells me to move seats. I did not want to be separated from my husband it was our honeymoon! The flight attendant calls her superior, who was very rude and sarcastic. She told me the same thing as the other stewardess, ""switch seats, don't have your table down, you have to cooperate"". I did not feel like arguing. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Flight to Glasgow was way better than flight home. On the way home we found a few of the stewardesses to be cranky and unprofessional. (Not all) The food was inedible. Seating cramped and Wifi on Cini App kept going down. Why not offer a free fruit, cheese/cracker plate instead of the gross, salty food that was offered? The amount that goes in the garbage is wasteful.",Family Leisure,4.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,October 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,no,Toronto to Glasgow,1.0, |  Toronto to Glasgow. We had an overnight flight with our 9 year old daughter. It was awful. The seat space was exceedingly cramped. The cabin area where we were seated was also uncomfortably hot. I went to the flight station at the back of the plane to ask for water for my daughter and explained that it was very hot in our area. The flight attendant handed me a cup of water without any word/comment/eye contact whatsoever (not one word!). Second request for water later on in the flight was met with exactly the same response by the attendant's colleague. The staff interaction was so rude it was quite bizarre. Air Transat provided an extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant flight experience.,Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Easy check in, on time departures, early arrivals, really polite cabin staff, decent airline food, clean aircraft, great price. On the outbound flight I ordered the Option Plus meal separately and, while the meal and wine were both good, I did not think that it was worth the $25 extra charge.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,October 2017,nan,2.0,nan,no,Calgary to Vancouver,1.0," |  Calgary to Vancouver. The worst experience with Air Transat that I have ever had. The 1030pm flight was delayed 50 minutes. I was given the furthest back seat and I realized that there was an audio system in the cabin above my seat. To play the safety video, one of the short flight attendants said 'excuse me' and stepped on the edge of my seat that I was sitting on. Little flesh of my leg got squeezed but I couldn't move for her safety. Not only once but a few times, she stepped on back and forth to play and stop the video and I thought that was rude. After that, during the whole flight, the flight attendants were very loud chatting at the back and I couldn't sleep at all. When we finally arrived, I saw staff unloading bags literally throwing! This airline does not possess manner, customer service nor care. Very disappointing flight with Air Transat and I would never recommend this airline.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,September 2017,1.0,4.0,3.0,no,Montral to Prague,4.0, |  Montreal to Prague. We found the dinner offering of a hot sandwich the worst meal we have had on a cross Atlantic flight. We fly 2 times a year across to Europe and this was the worst meal any airline had provided us. We paid for option plus and received no complimentary drink. The bar service after the meal never happened. The quality of the food service would make seriously think about traveling on Air Transat. We had taken a Air Transat flight last June from Venice to Toronto and the food was much better and the complimentary beverage was actually provide. It would seem Air Transat has made a conscious decision to downgrade the quality of the food they serve. ,Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

However, when we checked both in YVR and Varadero airports, we were given different seats. We were very disappointed with the service. On January 30th 2018, I sent an email to ask for a refund, the answer was they will send a feedback within 10 days. Up to today, February 14, 2018, no reply has been sent from Air Transat. So far, I have sent 3 emails to ask the same question, but nothing has change. This airline is not reliable and not worth to buy any service provided. I don’t think I will not take this airline for my vacation.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,February 2018,2.0,3.0,2.0,no,Vancouver to Punta Cana,3.0," |  Vancouver to Punta Cana. Air Transat's prices are lower than other airlines', but not so much lower as to warrant choosing them. They need to understand that money is not everything. Stress and broken trust are just as important in the long run, and will cost them many customers. We chose this airline for our holiday trip for the sole reason that it was advertised, and confirmed upon booking, as a non-stop flight to that particular destination. Not ""direct"" but specifically ""non-stop."" West Jet offered a very similar price for a comparable duration of flight, but was upfront about a stopover. When it came time to check in, we found that the departure time had been advanced by 2.5 hours because now the plane was making a stop-over. If you've worked a long shift the previous day and cannot sleep on planes, getting up at 3 am compared to 5:30 is not a pleasant start to a holiday. The same added stop-over for the return trip, only this time the plane was scheduled to arrive late rather than leave early. We arrived home in the early hours of the morning. Say what you want about the fine print and their right to add a stop, but false advertising is still false advertising when you speak plain English. The booking number they give you on confirmation is useless when you try to access My Booking: the system keeps telling you that the number cannot be found. It was impossible to log and select seats even with the option to pay for them, and by the time we checked in for the flight, all the window seats with an adjacent middle seat were taken. They can't seem to get organized even when the customer is willing to pay for seat selection. I have nothing negative to say about the flights themselves and the onboard service; the personnel are friendly and helpful. ",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

They were explaining that it's finished and who were sitting on the first rows bought all of foods! I registered my kid for Kids Club but there isn't any advantage - no special things nothing.

We arrived at Toronto Airport January 24 at 5:30pm from Montego Bay. The seating is terribly cramped and uncomfortable. A small drink of water, soda or juice is offered during a 4 plus hour trip: however, you can order a small amount of food (piece of pizza and drink). A can of beer or mixed drink is an outrageous price. There is no way of resting on this airline as the entire time passengers are bothered relentlessly by airline staff encouraging them to spend, spend, spend on overpriced junk. Earbuds (to watch a movie) are a price of $9.00 per passenger. If you're the unlucky ones (as we were) seated in front of the emergency exits, your seat at the same cost as all other seats, does not recline: however, you may be offered free earbuds that do not work at those seats, and if you ask for assistance in getting the earbuds to work and the flight staff simply ask others around you if their earbuds work then proceeded to do nothing any further, much less, they don't have the decency to come back to you with an answer or assistance - they simply move on as though you didn't ask them for help at all. Disgusting! When we left Jamaica we had our bag with two bottles of boxed rum and a couple of breakable items labeled with white tape marked in large bold red letters reading fragile, and we paid $35.00 American dollars to put that bag through. Upon arrival at Pearson Airport in Toronto Canada, we found the bottles of rum and breakables broken - the luggage ruined. We then went to the Air Transat rep and received a pile of attitude from staff refused to address our complaint.Another Air Transat rep stepped up and told us there was nothing he could do or would do about the broken goods or soiled luggage but gave us the brush by handing us a Air Transat card to call the office.

I booked a ticket from Air Transat 2 days before the flight as I missed my flight during my stay in Nice. They have the ""Option Plus"" which gives you 2 baggage allowances and some other extras. Plane was an A310-300, pretty old (around 25 years old) There was no personal IFE, moreover I was sitting in a window seat and I kept hitting my head to the side because of the shape of the plane. There were wires going under the armrest (see photo) which seemed weird to me. Seat itself was comfortable and the legroom was fine. Drinks were provided throughout the plane, and I had a full meal (chicken) which wasn't bad at all.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

When leaving Toronto they got us all to board the plane and then we sat there for almost 2 hours it started to snow, about an hr and a half of sitting on the plane we were lucky to get out of Toronto. Then on the flight to Jamaica the flight attendants were nice but flustered seemed to have no idea what was going on and the landing was the worst I’ve experienced, then went to claim our bags and both were damaged. Then we booked a catamaran excursion at the resort and it was through air transat the boat company was Chukka and they said drinks were all inclusive come to find out on the boat all they had was beer and rum punch my girlfriend hates both those things so she couldn’t drink then we get to Margaritville thinking maybe they will have better drinks there but they are charging 6-7USD for beer and drinks at a so called all inclusive excursion that’s ridiculous. I have nothing bad to say about the resort we stayed at the Grande Bahia Principe in Runaway Bay it is an amazing resort good food, entertainment, drinks, cleanliness, and staff. As for the trip back we got picked up at 9am from resort we checked our bags at 10:30am and they said the flight was an hour late so we thought nothing of it and went through security then we get up and see the board and it’s delayed 5 hours then we tryed to go out to have a smoke now knowing we’re delayed for so long but they wouldn’t let us out they said we needed an Air Transat rep to let us out so we found them all sitting in waiting chairs doing nothing in the airport and they wouldn’t take us out and we’re laughing about it after the fact very unprofessional.

They only came when it was time to serve beverages. When arrived at Cancun Airport, the Air Transat agents in the bus stop were completely disorganized. We had to change 3 times our waiting spot to finally board a shuttle to our hotel. All that after one hour wait on the bus stop. We weren't greeted with any contact at the hotel for the week we were there (like every other airline does). So I missed important information for my trip. For the trip back, we waited for over an hour before being able to board the airplane. The flight attendants got stuck in traffic between their hotel and the airport. No communication was ever given to passengers about the wait. Only when we took off in flight TS561 that the pilot explained to us and apologized. One passenger had grievances about the fact we were not made aware of the wait before, and the flight attendant told her it could have been anything that could've delayed the flight, so we don't need to always communicate delays. When we got back home, I called their customer service, and I was served with total indifference. No excuses given. She even ended the call by saying ""We can't please everyone"" and ""people call us to say that we are better than other companies"". Abysmal customer service.

On the negative side, I boarded the plane and proceeded to tell one flight attendant that I was going to Montego Bay with my son to celebrate my 50th birthday and that I had been flying for over 25 years and would it be possible during the flight to see the cockpit with the pilots for the first time ever, she said maybe when we land. It’s not that she said no, it was her manner, just uncaring with a phony smile (this trip was very  special for me). On a positive note, there was a very warm, genuine flight attendant on that flight who was kind and definitely belonged in that job. I even thanked her when I disembarked. I will give a good rating to Transat because of the impression that she left with me.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

We live in Victoria and either need to fly to Vancouver (30min) or take a ferry and drive (3 hours). We booked our vacation so we can take a 5:30 am flight from Victoria to Vancouver on the 26th of Dec 2017 (the first flight out from Victoria), arrive in Vancouver by 6:00 am, thus leaving us 2h 20 min to catch the international flight with Air Transat at 8:20 am. This flight from Victoria to Vancouver is $773.84 rtn, plus an overnight on the return in hotel at $289.95 as the flight back from Cancun arrives at 10 pm 3 Jan 2018 and there are no flights from Vancouver to Victoria at that time. Our Air Transat vacation not including the Victoria to Vancouver flights and Hotel in Vancouver on return was paid out as $10,484 to Air Transat on 20 October 2017.  24 November we receive notification that Air Transat changed the flight on 26 Dec 2017 to depart at 6:25 am, which will not leave us the time necessary to make the international connection. We contact Air Transat to discuss our concern and how their flight change will effect us ($420 to change our flights to 8:20 pm on 25 Dec 2017 from 26 Dec 5:30 am from Victoria BC and now a hotel on 25 Dec 2017 at a cost of $265.38). As opposed to sympathy and a helping hand due to their change a month after we booked this vacation and a month remaining before the departure date, we were told it is not their problem and we could cancel our trip and receive a 50% refund or figure out what we need to do to make their flight We have now had 4 vacations plus this one with them ... our loyalty obviously means nothing. Bottom line and money in their pocket seems to be the only option, and how their change has effected loyal customers means nothing. I suggest they don't care about loyalty. I dealt with this issue from 8 am to 11:27 am this morning, being put on hold multiple times, speaking to 4 different people and this is the final decision and offer ""We can give you 50% refund on your package and cancel it"".

Apparently the computer system was down for Air Transat and to what we heard it was the same the day before our departure. We stood in the line for 5 hours in the heat to check in, no organization at all, once in a while you heard them asking for passengers to Montreal only to process first and when they finished that crowd the next city was called we were the last ones. By the way all boarding passes and luggage tags were hand written.

Yet, instead of informing travellers, Air Transat staff transported us to the airport as if nothing was happening. We stood in line for over three hours just to check in, with virtually no communication - it was as if their agents were ""hiding"". Some other AT staff were taking pictures of the sea of people from atop a staircase. Glad we could provide their social media entertainment. The mark of a solid airline is how they react when stuff goes wrong - and it always does - Air Transat failed miserably buy putting their head in the sand, adopting the ostrich pose and hoping that we would all just go away.

My BF, 6ft2"" had an aisle seat and regardless, his legs could not fit anywhere, kept getting hit by the food cart and the food tray couldn’t unfold properly as it was resting at an angle on his thighs. The food was simply terrible. They served sandwiches that were just horrible. No one around us were eating their food and were all staring at one another in terror. I had requested a Gluten Free meal when booking and I would have preferred the horrible mushy sandwich to eat some of the condiments inside than the GF, ""I don't know what it was and can't call it a sandwich either with ingredients that are not only GF but also alien"". When I asked the Flight Attendant to get a ""regular"" sandwich she said, ""you selected GF and I'm not sure I have other sandwiches left"". She miraculously found a spare mushy meal. All this to say we starved. On the way back from Malaga to MTL, I tried upgrading to Club only to find out the extra charge was approx. $900 per person due to the fare price and upgrade costs etc. (fare difference 600 + 300 for upgrade or something of that sort). We checked-in online 12hrs prior to selecting our seats and 4hrs prior to take off, we received a message informing us the flight was delayed about 1hr, therefore we waited and headed to the airport as per schedule taking in consideration the delay, only to be the last ones at the counter where the crew made a comment that they were about to close check in even though we still arrived a little over 2hrs before take off. Basically they were operating as if there were no delays! We made it through and decided to buy our food before boarding, due to the last event on the way in. The plane was late for unknown reasons and was old. I remember taking this aircraft in 1998, one of my first trips to Mexico (3.5hr or so, short flight though). Now on the way back our flight was over 8hrs and the old plane, although the seats were more spacious and slightly comfier than the ""new"" version, had no personal entertainment system. We had to watch the movie playing on the overhead TV. Remember those? I thought they were extinct! They served a better meal and the staff were nicer and more enjoyable to the passengers, thanks to the head manager who I assume spreads good energy and is compassionate. I travel a lot for work and leisure, taking over 30 flights, if not more a year and I have never seen this.

A330-200,Economy Class,5.0,March 2018,2.0,1.0,5.0,no,Toronto to Cancun,4.0," |  On March 10, 2018 when we were flying from Toronto Pearson to Cancun (departure time 06:15), we were called to the counter at the gate to (verify Travel documents I guess), along with a dozen or more other passengers. When we came to the counter, the woman behind the counter immediately asked me if I would like to check my carry-on luggage. I said I’d rather not. She said that my carry-on might be too big for the plane and might not fit into the overhead cabinet. When I walked to the carry-on luggage sizing thing beside the counter, she said that one wasn’t for Air Transat; and the flight was full and she was asking passengers to voluntarily check their carry-ons. I hesitated for a moment. Before I could say anything, she said that we would need to check all our carry-ons (our family of four each had a carry-on). My son and daughter’s carry-on were quite small, smaller than the usual carry-on size. Then another Air Transat woman started putting check-in sticker on all our luggage, while I firmly said No and I would not want to check all our carry-ons. It was voluntary and our luggage was not oversized, and I refused to check them in. The younger women continued putting check-in stickers on our luggage, looked at me through the side of her eye and said “you will board the plane if you don’t check your luggage!”. I was very upset. I demanded to see her Air Transat badge but she refused to show it to me and tucked it under her uniform. In the end, a man in Air Transat uniform came out. He removed other sticker except one on our largest luggage. The funny thing was that, once we got on the plane, we noticed 1/3 of the overhead bins were empty! The bins on the A330 were very large and the largest carry-on would fit without any problem! I travel quite a bit, for work and for vacation. This has to be the worst experience with any airline I have had so far. I will avoid Air Transat whenever possible.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,5.0,June 2017,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes,Amsterdam to Vancouver,4.0," |  Amsterdam to Vancouver. I’ve been on vacation with Air Transat 2 times already and this June we'll go on our third trip with them. It’s so much cheaper than other airlines from my area. So far I never had problems with them. Flights were on time with no delays, cabin staff was friendly. Ground staff was friendly too except for that one woman who didn’t even knew I was allowed 2 suitcases so she needed to ask her colleague about that. Food was edible (still airplane food but okay). The first time I flew air Transat they we’re providing hot meals, I got the vegetarian Asia rice. It was actually good. When we flew with them last year, we got sandwiches which weren’t bad either. When you book Option plus you get additional snacks and drinks for free, and also you can bring two pieces of luggage (a big plus for me!) and choose your seats in advance. If you didn’t book this Option you have to pay for blankets and pillows if you want any or didn’t bring your own. Of course there are other airlines providing blankets and pillows but I think it’s disgusting regarding that those are most likely to never be washed after they were used on a previous flight. Of course seating is cramped, what do you expect for the price? I am short, so no problem for me if the legroom is limited. If you’re tall you shouldn’t book transatlantic flights with them. Overall the seats are comfortable with an adjustable headrest. The IFE (personal screens) is really good, you can check what movies are on your flight online or through their app. The only complaint I have is that those tv shows on the IFE are rust random episodes from random seasons,  so if you’re new to a show you can’t really watch it. You can use your own headphones for the IFE and it also has a USB port for you to charge your phone. On a flight back to AMS my screen froze after watching a movie. I asked a flight attendant if she could help and she immediately did! (If this happens to you just press the ""i"" Button until your screen restarts) In conclusion I’d fly with them again, and I will. You don’t get all the perks with Air Transat if you compare it to other (much more expensive) airlines. Pack your own food if you’re a picky eater and fill up your waterbottle after security and you should be good.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

In September of this past year I booked a flight home from Paris to Vancouver with my four children to see my mother/their grandmother who was in hospital battling the final stages of cancer. I planned our trip for a three week timeframe knowing very well I may have to extend our flight depending on when my mother would pass. Already an absolutely horrible thing to have to deal with, my experience with Air Transat didn't make it any easier. As our return date approached, I called the airlines to extend our trip so that we could stay with my mother until the end. The policy when it comes to changing flights is absurd! I called in advance respecting the timelines, that was not a problem, I knew there was a fee, I excepted that, what made this process next to impossible is that one has to choose the specific date of return, how am I to know in this case!? Not only that but not only to you pay a fee to change the flights, you also pay the difference in price. What should be a simple change ended up being incredibly complicated. My mother ended up passing away one week later than our return flight home. It was more expensive to change my flight with Air Transat for the 5 of us again, that to fly home to France and book a whole new flight with another airline. My children ended up not being there when their grandma passed. I had to fly them all home, and then turn around and get on another flight back to Vancouver. You would think that in the case of family emergencies companies would be a little more compassionate to grieving families. Your policy needs to be reviewed.

What's the point of checking in if you have to go to the counter to get your boarding pass? Seats are tiny, and customer service is rude and unhelpful to say the least. They told me that they spoke with the Air Transat staff at the airport and confirmed that no one had come to the counter, therefore I must've gone to the wrong counter!

It was an incredibly smooth flight on a beautiful new plane! The flight attendants went above & beyond to make us feel comfortable, happy and appreciated, and really knew how to take care of passengers in the right way, as they were smiling from the minute we got on the plane, to the minute we got off. All this to say, it was a great way to start our fantastic trip to Israel, and it helped make it a very memorable vacation. You can be sure we will be flying with Air Transat in the future.

The flight to Montreal was a full 2h 30min late in departure and the airline did accommodate for this by arranging connecting flights. However, even the accommodating flight was late to board by 45 min so there seems to be a trend of lateness here. Anyway, it took about an hour or maybe more for the luggage to finally come to the carousel. This was after multiple starts and stops of the carousel which was very demoralizing.

Our insurance company recommended a quick return to Canada. We had to cancel our flights out of Lisbon and find a way home from Porto. Due to the nature of the disease I only had about an 8 hour window when I was relatively pain free. The pain medications I had would only last an hour or two. I wasn't keen being trapped on a trans-Atlantic flight for 6 or 7 hours. We found one flight out of Porto to Montreal that left Porto at noon which was optimal. It was on an Air Transat A330. I couldn't afford any delays. Check in was quick and easy, the flight was right on time. The aircraft loaded quickly and fortunately for me it was not overly crowded and there was room to stretch out. We found the seats comfortable and food and beverage service was great. After 2 movies I felt confident I was going to make it without a pain attack. We landed in Montreal on time and after a long walk we ended up at the customs area with 500 other passengers. My pain free window was closing quickly. Our nexus cards worked like a charm and we were through to the baggage area in 5 minutes. Priority baggage stickers also worked and our luggage was out first. Hopped on a shuttle to an airport hotel. Rested for a day before we caught another flight to Edmonton. Ended up in the hospital when we got home. Now on the right meds and pain free.

We had so many problems on these flights and I will never book with them again. The flight was delayed by 6 hours on our flight to Rome. I missed an important meeting that I had in Italy because of this. I understand that they need to have a safe plane. However, there is an obligation that they maintain their planes so that they do not have issues. There was almost no communication with us to let us know what was going on for the 6 hours. The offered a food voucher after 3 hours and we had to line-up for an hour while they hand wrote them for each passenger. By the time that we got it there was only one food place open and we had to line-up for an hour! Really poor communication and customer service. They lost our luggage on the return flight from Rome and again there was no communication when the 32 people that lost their luggage and were worried about missing their connecting flight. We asked them on the flight to let the desk in Vancouver know so that they could be prepared for 32 people to arrive late at night from Rome and have the paperwork done. They did not do this and we had to wait for a long time to fill out paperwork. The seats, comfort and entertainment on the plane coming from Rome to Toronto was fine. The seats and comfort in the domestic flights was not good at all. The worst part is that when I called to talk to them about my poor experience - they really did not care. Do not fly with Transat.

Have flown with this company several times since 2012 and been quite satisfied for the price we paid. Always paid extra for Option plus as the quick check in and boarding / security outbound was worth the cost. Cabin crew have always been polite & helpful. However our latest experience was not comfortable. The outward journey was the worst, in an older plane which clearly needed upgrading. One of the seats in front of us was faulty and fell backwards to a bad angle each time the passenger leaned back on it, making it unpleasant to have right in front of our faces. The individual screens were not in complete working order and the outer arm rests did not move to enable easy exit from the seats. Food was edible but not great.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,October 2017,4.0,1.0,5.0,yes,Lisbon to Toronto,3.0," |  Toronto to Lisbon return. Flying out from Toronto is always a pleasure. Quick check-in, efficient staff, no hassles, it never takes 10 minutes to drop my bags, get the boarding pass and reach security. Organized boarding, excellent service. I purchased Option Plus for the extra bag and priority boarding, and it really helped me get settled in quicker and get my bags faster upon arrival. Very different story out of Lisbon on the return flight. There was a huge line in a maze for the 3 or 4 regular check-ins, and a single file with about 8 people in the Option Plus. I was the 9th in that line. It took at least 40 minutes to process the ones in front of me. We slowly watched as everyone else was processed before, and after the line was almost cleared, one of the counters closed, and two others were still there but chatting to each other, when they could have helped with the Option Plus standstill. This was an absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable situation for having paid for priority check-in and boarding, and seeing staff idling about. When I finally got done dropping my bags, passed security, an additional passport check, and had to walk 20 minutes to what was probably the furthest terminal at the airport, everyone else was piled up in an unorganized manner for boarding and I asked at the counter where the line for Option Plus boarding was. There wasn't one. There were two attendants at the counter talking to each other, and one female attendant sitting behind the counter pointed and told me to talk to the person checking boarding passes for everyone else and have him let me through. She could have very well checked my boarding pass and passport and let me through, but no, redirected me to the huge line. This man completely ignored me as I asked 3 times ""excuse me, sir"" gradually raising my voice each time. Eventually he noticed me and let me through by undoing the ""rope"", while I got nasty looks from other passengers who insisted on pushing me out of the way and not letting me through either. I actually got fed up and raised my voice with ""Sorry, Option Plus, excuse me"" and stepped in. This could have been avoided with a proper Option Plus separate line, or with proper attention from the staff, but most importantly, with actually processing Option Plus passengers BEFORE regular fare. I feel like I didn't receive the value for what I paid for the return trip. Toronto to Lisbon experience is a 10/10. Lisbon to Toronto would get a zero if I could, but at least onboard service was good. My rating is based on the return flight.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The flight was of a very good price at £350, fights are direct and leave and return at great times.They offer lovely food and drink. They fly from Manchester and London which are great points. On my flight to Toronto I had to book my seat with my baby bassinet in advance. I could not book it online, it was an incredibly fussy and tedious process of waiting a long time on the phone only to have to fork out £50 per way and request usage of the bassinet - the only one on the flight. Heaven knows what they do if more than one small baby boards the flight. The seat itself was not even right beside the bassinet, it was not particularly comfortable and the bassinet was way high above reach. The flight attendants were all too happy to pay attention to the elder folk around me but took no time to pay attention to me and my baby and ask if we were okay.  You have to pay for a “comfort set” - pay for your ear phones and blanket on a long distance flight. This says to me cheap and stingy and poor. I bought a gourmet meal; I got my food and drink - very nice in fact, until they came around with standard meals and drinks and offered me a drink. They said because I had had wine with my gourmet meal I “wasn’t allowed” it unless I paid. Technical errors trying to check in online.  My flight home the airline staff forgot to give me a bag for my pram at check in to cover it, when I arrived to board they had no spares and made no rush to check for me.  At boarding me and my then 3 month old baby were told to stand back and let the elderly and wheelchairs board, then we were told that the “Plus” option passengers had priority before us to board so we must wait for them to board. On the flight, my baby was sick and tired and I had to bounce him on my lap or he would have screamed. An air hostess came to me and said, “The lady in the plus section in front of you has complained that you are making her seat vibrate because you’re bouncing your baby.” To which I responded, “What would you like me to do?” And she just laughed falsely and walked away.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

On return we were in a larger completely remodelled aircraft with TV at every seat. We paid extra for bulkhead seats directly behind the premium seats and there was tons of legroom-worth the money. Unfortunately this area is where families often travel and we had a child who was noisy-crying a lot during the flight.

Wrong - Air Transat decided to change the schedule of our return flight to Toronto by 2 hrs (delaying it) so we only had 55 minutes between flights in Paris with a terminal change in CDG which is physically impossible. If you really want the cheapest flight and it's only one segment then maybe you can consider them. However for multi-segment flights it's asking for trouble.

Add to that it was the narrowest airline seat I've tried to fit in and I may be tall but I'm not wide.

If you are sitting near the front and have to use the bathroom - good luck because the toilets are at the very back of the plane (the other two at the front of the plane are reserved for the 20 people in Business Class). During check in at Pearson they only had 1 counter open for economy class and 2 counters open for Business Class.

Flights there and back were good friendly flight attendants and very friendly check in agents both flights arrived only slightly later than scheduled. I was pleased that Enerjet would honor Air Transats speciality ordered food selection. I had pre-ordered gluten free meals for my flights. On this flight my meal going down to Mexico was a GF meal consisting of one rice cake folded in half with one piece of ham in the middle along with a tiny container of coleslaw. The lack of food surprised me! Positive note is that when I checked in for my flight the check in agent reconfirmed with me my meal request. Meanwhile the regular meals consisted of a large sized wrap piece of fudge cheese and crackers and a potato salad. Thank goodness I brought along snacks to eat. On the flight home the flight attendant didn't bring me a GF meal but tried to serve me a regular meal I then mentioned my pre-order of a GF meal and she said they don't really have any as they had to hand it out on the way to Mexico that day. I let her know that I saw on the cart as she rolled up to me the food requests listed and saw it said 2 GF. She then phoned another FA in the back of the plane and brought me a GF meal. The same tiny meal on my way up but at least it was something. But yet again the regular meals to other passengers were double the portion variety and selection as the GF option. I was surprised that there was no inflight movie.,nan,4.0,nan

Everything was very smooth efficient and pleasant on both fights from check-in to in-flight service and getting our baggage. The flight to London was overnight and there weren't individual screens (3 out of 5 *) but they did play a movie or 2 and a show perhaps on the overhead monitors. I was trying to sleep so I didn't pay attention although I did notice the picture in the screens would jump/flicker regularly. The food was okay for airplane food and they were good with running the drink carts up and down regularly while still allowing quiet time for people to rest. The lighting overhead was really neat since it mimicked sunset and sunrise accordingly. The flight back to Calgary was daytime and there were individual seat back monitors which was awesome. Good selection of free tv shows movies even games and it worked flawlessly (5 out of 5*). I bought the ear buds on board with one of the packages available: the ear buds a snack (chocolate bar) and an alcohol beverage (Baileys) for $9 or $10. You could buy them separately for $3. Lunch wasn't fantastic taste-wise I had the chicken stir fry but it was still a meal and I'm not super picky. I do wish there was a little better selection of snacks - only caramilk or plain pringles but I should've remembered to buy snacks beforehand in the airport and I'm sure they're limited on space. Very friendly attendants on the flight to Calgary. We arrived almost 30 minutes early and it was a nice smooth flight. Baggage was already waiting on the carousel.,nan,5.0,nan

A travelling kit was also provided which included a blanket flight socks earphones blowup neck support earplugs eye mask etc. Overall I thought that the experience was worth what I paid and would do the same again I realise that everyone has a budget and it is expensive for the extras for the extra money paid this could be another weeks holiday to someone.,nan,4.0,nan

The flights took place on 27 August and 16 September 2013 Amsterdam - Vancouver v.v. In my opinion it's a crime to put so many rows in an airplane with seats so narrow that now a week later I still suffer from a sore shoulder and right arm. The back of my seat couldn't be moved in any direction. Alas the one of the passenger in front of me could so when she did which she did during 9 hours my face being 20cm from her seat.

There were some miserable flight attendants - passengers were polite around us and made the effort but the flight attendants didn't. We were near the front and the attendants in club class were very cheerful. It doesn't cost anything to smile and be helpful - some customer service training is required.

My only complaint was with Gatwick we arrived two hours before check in opened due to us having travelled from Manchester by coach. There was nowhere to sit down so we had to stand for the whole two hours. Once we got to check in we were told that our club class ticket did not give us entry to the club lounge and we would be expected to pay extra for that I did not pay as when we flew from Manchester to Calgary in 2011 again club class we were given both fast track through security and entry to the club lounge.

Unfortunately when we fastened our seats belts and were ready to depart our captain mentioned that we would be stopping in Paris to get more fuel. I do not understand how a direct flight includes a stop to get gas. Secondly customers should be warned beforehand because we would have booked another flight if we had known about this stop. We arrived to Paris at 3.45pm making it a 3 hour flight with an hour late departure from Athens. Told we would be leaving shortly but unfortunately an hour wait turned into a 6 hour wait. During this time we were told by a crew member that something was wrong with our engine and we would have to wait and see if it could be fixed or not. The way we were all treated was unacceptable! We stayed onboard for 6 hours we were not given water or food during this wait. We understand that safety is first and that mechanics were working on our plane but no one thought of the passengers. After 6 hours the captain told us that there was a computer problem and it had been reset but then we were told that because of our crew we had to stop again in Newfoundland. After 13 hours on that plane we were fed with a meal. We constantly asked for water and were told that the crew would be coming around for everyone and after waiting an hour no water was given. In the end we will never fly with Air Transat again and we would not recommend Air Transat. Our 8 hour flight turned into a 20 hour flight.,nan,1.0,nan

They could cut back on the announcements on an overnight flight when you are trying to catch a few ZZ. Don't really need duty free at 5am. Returned on one of the older models and although it had old layout we preferred since our seats were changed from the 3 configuration by the window to the 2 by the window there seems to be a bit more room.

I would highly recommend bringing your own food and snacks on board as the food served is absolutely dire. I know this is budget travel but seeing as the food service is about the only thing to look forward to while sitting for 10 hours surely they could do a little better!

Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards!

The speed with which their service is delivered is poor. My side had food drink wet wipe while my daughters side had none of those things. The food eventually was delivered about 10 minutes later. Another concern is that the attendants are quite a bit older and put respectfully not in great shape to be pushing a cart up and down narrow aisles. The airport at Punta Cana was ridiculous - there were at least 6 huge planes leaving within about 30 minutes of each other.

Everything was very smooth with just a few minutes of mild turbulence as we were landing. The movies were ok - a lot of international film festival movies. We were lucky to fly on one of the updated planes with the modern entertainment units on each seat. I have flown Air Transat overseas several times and I find the eastbound journey is usually the older planes as most people sleep during the overnight flight. The eastbound journey is with the updated planes as most people are away for the midday flight. The food is pretty awful but what can you expect for economy rates? My husband did get food poisoning when we were flying to Europe so from now on we only eat their vegetarian meals if at all possible.

Thank goodness because the regular check-in line at the Punta Cana airport had over 100 people in it! We got through the Option Plus check-in line in less than 10 minutes. Option Plus holders are also allowed to board the plane first so that was nice and we knew there would be space for our carry-on in the overhead compartments (which were huge anyway). Received free champagne a small wine bottle preferred meals and a snack as well as another free alcoholic drink. Seating arrangement was a little odd though. 3x3x3. Not very many people travel in a group of 3. The seats are very small though I'm only 5'5"" and it was tight for my body. I felt awful for my 6'0"" boyfriend who couldn't even put his tray table down flat. The tightness of the seats really put us in a bad mood and a lot of the others on the plane were getting cranky due to the lack of room too. The food wasn't bad it was edible at least. Instead of individual televisions there were only TV's in the middle and they were small and not very high quality. I don't know why they bother having televisions at all because people were just getting frustrated when others walked by to go to the washroom or stretch and caused them to ""miss"" parts of the movie. The only way I would travel with Air Transat again is if I was in a row of 2 (which there were few in the back and cost extra) or in club class.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,I flew one way from London Gatwick to Toronto in October 2013. The reason for choosing Air Transat was simply cost - other airlines are not interested in selling one-way fares. Only Air Transat and Icelandair offer reasonable prices for one-way trips and only Air Transat is non-stop. Both Air Canada and British Airways wanted about $1900 from London Heathrow to Toronto whereas Air Transat (from Gatwick) was under $500. The check-in agent at Gatwick was rude but she was the only employee I could possibly say anything negative about and since all other staff went out of their way to be positive I will just ignore this one bad apple. The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful as were the people at the gate. The flight left and arrived on time to the minute. Food was - well let's just say no worse than any other airline. I think the legroom was a bit better than some others. My luggage was on the carousel by the time I got through immigration. There truly is nothing to complain about. The particular plane that I was on did not have seat-back video but instead had the older style screens with their choice of movies. I brought a book to read so did not really even watch this. Really with all the negative experiences I have become accustomed to when flying I must say that this flight (my first flight with Air Transat) was a rare positive.,nan,5.0,nan

However lets start from positive side - check-in and boarding was ok with helpful ground staff. It should be highlighted that crew on board of the aircraft was friendly helpful professional and very skilled. The very negative side is that seats are extremely narrow and small. It is impossible to fit it. The plane A310 (very old model) was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 7) which is really painful since 2 extra seats in each row are put in. NO TV individual screens. The food is just horrible and not eatable. NOT recommended for Paris-Montreal route and my advice is to double check the model of aircraft before booking. Avoid at any cost A310.,nan,1.0,nan

The flight attendants were very cheerful and helpful throughout the flight the food was the best we've had on any aircraft. Wrote the flight we were offered wine beer liquor the cure coffee tea anything that we wanted. The nicest part about it is there is a separate washroom for only the business class.

It doesn't give you a better seat unfortunately but you get food and drink supplied throughout the flight and a comfort kit which was good to keep. The seats are quite small but I guess that's why they are the cheapest flight. I think your excited to be going on holiday so put up with the squashed seats! Very nice flight attendants and with the option plus you get served first and certainly get enough snacks etc. it was a refurbished or new plane so got new leather seats. On the return flight I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to club class perhaps they needed to fill the seats but I was extremely grateful and excited to get a bigger seat! Club class was fab compared to economy! Great food drink although flight attendants no different to my outward journey very courteous. Trouble is now if I fly with them again I want to go club class!

Tried to upgrade weeks earlier and was told it was full so check on the day asked at check in and was told it was $250 and that 2 people has cancelled but you had to ask when boarding and pay then so at the gate we asked again only to be told it was $360 and again you had to pay on the plane upon boarding the plane we mentioned we would like to upgrade and were told it was $460! I told the steward that this was the 3rd different price and he said that he wasn't prepared to haggle like a market trader! Couldn't believe my ears. Due to snow we then sat on the plane for 3 hours before take off which is no ones fault however in all that time the seat belt signs stayed on and no one was allowed to visit the toilet so when we finally take off and get to the right altitude virtually the whole plane is stud waiting for the loo which means food or drinks can't be served for about 1hr30 min.

Then taxiing out two people fell ill and we returned to the gate eventually taking off at 7am. In that time no food - just one glass of water - not even coffee. We then flew to Montreal to change crew (they were out of hours that's ok) and then flew to London - and were given just a tiny slice of pizza - on a 7-hour flight! Transat offered $100 compensation and despite Customer Services at Gatwick promising they would reimburse extra travel costs they then refused. Any proper airline would pay up.

Flight was listed as being 50 minutes late when we checked in. Boarded about 1700. Was informed that there was a problem with one of the washrooms and that they were waiting for a truck to come. Then told tank was frozen and could not be unfrozen and the plane had only two working washrooms. Was told that flights under 4 hours could fly with 2 working washrooms but flights longer than 4 hours required 3 working washrooms. Had 2 working washrooms in the back and one in the front so there was 3 washrooms. Guess the one for the first class passengers is not to be used by economy passengers even in the event of unusual conditions so it doesn't count. The flight to Saskatoon was to take 5 hours. Transat then told us we were going to fly to Toronto (less than 4 hours) change crews then fly to Saskatoon. Left Cancun at 2030. Arrived in Toronto at 2400 and changed flight crews. Arrived Saskatoon at 0430. After arriving in Saskatoon was told that no gate was available. Had to wait another 90 minutes for a gate. Deplaned just after 0600. Now been on plane for over 12 hours. Waited 45 minutes for luggage then told equipment to unload luggage was broken. Plane would be taken to Regina luggage unloaded then delivered back to Saskatoon. Forms had to be filled out to get luggage delivered to our home. No Transat reps around. Total gong show! Passengers now becoming very vocal. Canada Immigration officials were the most helpful.

As I'm moving to St. John's Newfoundland I needed the cheapest way of getting to that outpost with a large luggage allowance and the Air Transat Club Class seemed to provide that for me in terms of getting to Toronto before using another airline onwards. In the main it was excellent. The food on planes is usually of low standard but my Turkey Cacciatore was delicious the light snack meat platter before landing was equally tasty and the other little treats cookies fudge sweets champagne wine port and baileys. Inflight entertainment was fine maybe not as wide ranging as Air Canada but decent nonetheless watched a couple of interesting documentaries in between my constant scoffing. Staff were very friendly the slight downer were the seats not as comfortable some Club Class. But not the price of any Club Class aside so I have no complaints. A very good airline!,nan,5.0,nan

Boarding was done using buses but very well organized by the ground staff. Inflight attendants were very helpful throughout the flight. The negative side is that seats are so narrow that you cannot move a finger. The plane A330 was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 8) which is extremely uncomfortable. It is just impossible to seat 7 hours without any changes in a position. The food is just horrible. My advice is to bring my own meal. The comfort kits costs 9 Canadian dollars which includes pillow blanket etc. This is definitely the low cost airline and overall it is an average experience.

Wanted to complain on the way passenger boarding was handled by Air Transat staff at Manzanillo airport which resulted in many young kids being separated from their parents. There was one general queue with four counters serving passengers. Then staff announced that there was a separate queue line for passengers with young kids. We and many other families moved to this queue thinking it would be faster. The problem was that the generic queue was serviced by three counters but there was only one counter serving the family queue! Moreover the only person serving the family queue had one arm in a plaster cast and was able to type in with one arm only. As a result the general queue with three counters available to them moved much faster and were all done by the time many families in the other queue were still waiting in the line. The general queue passengers got all the adjacent seats and by the time the families were allowed to reach the check-in counter the only seats left were single ones dispersed all over the cabin! Many young kids (including ours) got seats separate from their parents. When I pleaded with the counter person to find at least two adjacent seats for my youngest to be able to sit with the mom the reply was that there was nothing available and we should ask the passengers on the plane to volunteer and give us their seats. On the plane the stewardesses were able to help some (but not all) of the families by negotiating with the other passenger to swap seats. I think the above was result of a poor administration of the boarding at the airport. Had the airport staff allowed all the families with young kids to check in first before the rest of the passengers this could have been avoided.,nan,3.0,nan

Return leg in refitted economy - legroom tighter and seat less comfortable but IFE superb cabin very attractive with mood lighting. Crew food and drink excellent again.

During the flight we hit a lot of turbulence and the crew could not serve any meals during that long period. After that they rushed to do that service. The meal and the crew were fine nothing special. The seat was a bit uncomfortable it's the same comfort for their longest flights to Europe but I enjoyed extra legroom because it was an emergency exit seat. The inflight entertainment was an old movie show on the overhead screens. I also found some announcements made in French were a bit unprofessional but they were made in a joyful tone. Overall despite the turbulence the flight was fine.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,4.0,I purchased Option Plus for a return flight Toronto-Manchester. Outbound leg on April 6th provided excellent check in and also cabin service. Onboard our meal order was taken ahead of the economy passengers and also served earlier which provided a nice hot meal. Unfortunately the return flight on April 14th provided abysmal service right from check in. Even though we were travelling Option Plus red priority tags were not put on our bags by the young lady checking us in and when I pointed this out she told me they will be attached before they go on the aircraft and I should just trust her. Obviously I knew this to be untrue as I have used Transat many times in the past and of course I had to wait 40 minutes in Toronto for my bags. We left Manchester at 9.15 am and lunch service did not start until 2.30pm which is far too late and on this newly configured aircraft (2x4x2) the cabin crew served the meals from the front rows to the back rows which takes far to long if you are seated in the back and you end up with a cold meal. Option Plus passengers were not served in advance as we were on the outbound flight and when I pointed this out I was told I was mistaken. Basically Option Plus is not worth the extra money as the priority boarding and priority services you are supposed are often not delivered. The service is always more miss than hit and seemingly more so with the Montreal based cabin crews. Air Canada Rouge is starting to fly this same route so next month I'll probably give them a try instead. Air Transat cannot complain as I've given them enough opportunities over the year's to get it right.,nan,4.0,nan

Aircraft looked new Airbus 330's great inflight entertainment comfortable leather seats and plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft 1in). The airline staff are friendly and the meals were as good as any that you get in economy and better than most. We had some quite severe turbulence on the way back which the pilot warned us about and took time to explain it was all routine and no more than bumps in the road nice touch.

Narrow seats and inflight entertainment old fashioned screens down the middle of the aircraft. Crew friendly and efficient. Food good. Nothing from the flight deck whilst airborne. Returning on an A-330 in 6 hours 40 minutes inflight entertainment excellent in terms of films and TV. Yet again crew friendly and efficient. Food not as good but it's through the night so not as bothered. Again no flight deck announcements whilst in the air. Seats narrow but we had three seats to the two of us so effect minimised. Person in front reclined making viewing of seat back TV difficult. It's about time all airlines did away with reclining seats. Soft drinks free alcohol has to be bought but it's quite reasonable price wise.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,2.0,Flew Air Transat first time 5 June from Calgary to London Gatwick as only airline with direct flight. Check in was delayed 25 minutes as they seemed incapable of checking in more than one flight at a time and they were 2 passengers missing for the earlier Paris flight. This resulted in a huge queue at check in. Luckily we were there early and joined the queue as soon as the flight number showed on the board. Others weren't as lucky. As it was a night flight of 8.5 hrs was expecting pillows and blanket on seats. Nothing. I found I didn't need them anyway as any chance of catching a few zzzz was impossible as they didn't turn down the cabin lighting until after 5 hours into the flight and then only for an hour. They only used one drinks and food trolley per aisle so it took forever to first get a drink and then be served a pretty awful meal as we were near the back of the aircraft. My friend sitting behind me was left with a choice of pasta or pasta. When she said she didn't like pasta they offered her macaroni cheese as an alternative! At the point where they could have turned the lighting down they didn't and then announced the duty free trolley was on its way. Breakfast was a sad affair of partially frozen fruit salad and orange juice. Only good thing was we arrived at Gatwick 20 minutes early. Overall a very poor experience and one I hope never to repeat.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,nan,no,nan,1.0,"My husband and I purchased the Options Plus for a trip from Vancouver to Cancun. The outbound trip was uneventful and we had an excellent vacation. It was only when we returned home that it all fell apart. Our seat selection (part of the options plus package) was not available and no explanation provided. Our meal service although the Options Plus assured us a priority selection did not occur. We actually did not get any meals until we corralled 5 of the flight attendants none of whom believed us that we had not received a meal. It was only when the original flight attendant confirmed that we had not had a meal did they believe us although I am not certain as to why Air Transat employees thought I would attempt to obtain two meals. I was advised that the ""other side screwed up"". I am not certain as to why I needed to have that piece of information however my ""choice of meal"" was now the children's chicken nuggets as that was all that was left. When we arrived our luggage although clearly marked priority was the last to arrive on the carousel. Not an indication of priority handling. When I complained to Air Transat - their response was simple - the Options Plus is only worth $19.50 per person each way. That is a little strange given that I paid $238.00 for the ""privilege"" of not receiving the service which apparently is only worth $19.50. So - no seat selection no priority luggage handling no meal. If I hadn't paid for Options Plus I would have received a better level of service - I would say live and learn but I don't believe that I will be using Air Transat again.",nan,1.0,nan

First time Air Transat user and had read the reviews so was very very apprehensive. However we were very impressed with the speed of check-in (both times) extremely quick through the queue. The service on board was good (only one attendant was rather abrupt but not rude) food was fine. The inflight entertainment worked fine each time although they charge £5 for headphones. Both flights were on time. Temperature on board was comfortable and there were plenty of refreshments. We would definitely use this airline again and it was good value for money.,nan,5.0,nan

Could not read a paper as passengers crammed into me could not stretch arms wanted something out of my pant pocket. forget it no leg space cramp's. For the amount of money we pay and have that nightmare of a seat is unacceptable and even if I wanted to purchase duty free that I did not try getting a credit card out of your wallet I would have to ask the other 2 passengers centre and aisle seat to stand up so I can move.,nan,2.0,nan

I was shocked to find out that the flight had changed departure times to 6.10 pm and I wasn't even notified.

My last return flight from Calgary to Manchester May 25th however was a delight. After boarding from what must be the worlds most miserable staffed airport in Calgary the cabin crew could not have done more to revive my good spirits. The flight was smooth and on time and we were well supplied with excellent food and refreshment throughout. Despite the long journey the cabin crew remained attentive and cheerful and added good humour. I am due to fly again in October and am looking forward to the trip.

Checked in online only carry on bags arrived at airport only to be told to check in again so they know we are here-very silly. Boarding process very disorganized but still managed an early departure. On board seats 2H 2K welcome drink and headsets. Decent meal that we had pre-selected. Excellent service lots of drink refills without being asked. Return flight July 27 was the exact opposite. Honeymooners were upgraded to Club Class at the last minute causing confusion. Had to ask for headsets only 1 FA serving not the 2 as advertised.

This year we were in row 1 for both legs and these are great seats but they need footrests or footstools. It was a brand new cabin new mood lighting but the service was cheerful and the drinks and snacks constant. Only problem was with trying to pre-book meals on both legs and finally gave up only to be offered what was left on the actual flight but it was good enough. The prices are creeping up. Have flown Club with them in old config and it was fine now with only 12 seats it has pushed up the price quite a bit. Still worth the money for early boarding disembarkation drinks and snacks and peace and quiet in a really small cabin. A real negative though is now in July 14 you can book flights for next year but no seat maps are open. Wonder what is going on there. I am not paying over£1k for a seat I can't choose.,nan,4.0,nan

Both flights were great and leg room was more than expected. Food was not bad for Airline food. We loved Halifax Airport but were not impressed with the bag drop at Air Transit. The staff weighed the luggage then we had to take a card over the bag drop scan it and the bags should then go through which they didn't! Then had to do it all again.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,4.0,"From booking with 'Canadian affair' to collecting our luggage on the return flight we were really pleased with Air Transat. Our YYC-LGW return itinerary went almost entirely without flaw. The ticket price for our itinerary saved my spouse and I an excess of $1000 over booking with KLM or Air Canada. We booked our seats in advance (21A & 21B on both flights at $20/seat/flight) and then utilized Transat's new online check-in. The online service was simple and easy to use with a dedicated bag drop and next to no line-up as a result. Our flights were both on refurbished A330-200 Twin engine Wide-body jets. The 9 across configuration Air Transat uses (over the typical 8 on most A330s) was noticeably tight but not impossible or overly uncomfortable and on the outbound flight we lucked out having the block of 3 to ourselves. Mood lighting on both flights was neat to watch and I actually agree that it made a difference in the overall perception of time and minimization of Jet Lag. The two airplanes had differing overhead bin designs the outbound being Airbus's new style curvy bins and the return being their older style. Although this doesn't seem like something the average person would care about the difference determined whether or not the seat had an overhead personal air vent. Only the older style bin aircraft was supplied with this feature - one I hate seeing airlines remove. It made the return flight all the more comfortable to have a little blast of cool air. Legroom on both aircraft was the same and is slightly above the norm I'd say somewhere around 33"" pitch. Transat's new inflight entertainment on the A330's is a great system with plenty of newer mainstream movies TV shows and music to choose from. Even the food onboard was good. On the return the food was more of ""microwave dinner"" calibre - each of us ordering 'orange chicken' but perfectly edible and of good enough taste. They are small though so consider packing a snack or taking advantage of their onboard purchase menu. Upon arrival of both of our ""on time"" flights our bags were delivered in good time even though we did not pay extra for Option Plus or priority baggage services offered. Overall we were incredibly pleased with the Transat Experience after reading some less than satisfactory reviews - and would absolutely fly with this airline (and to this surprisingly easy to access and navigate airport) again.",nan,5.0,nan

On the outward flight we had a slight delay from Gatwick (nothing new) but made up time and arrived early after a very pleasant flight. On the return to Gatwick we took a few minutes early and arrived half an hour before our due landing time. I do not know if the cabin crew at Air Transat have been on a customer care course since I last traveled with Air Transat two years ago but there standard of care was first class on both flights. The only downside was the food but then airline food is a joke unless you pay top dollar for your flight. One new item on the return flight was the availability of Internet connection. Alas I could not get Google Chrome to download the app onto my Android tablet. It was my fault not being an IT person not Air Transats. All in all well done Air Transat.,nan,5.0,nan

On arrival in Toronto we had to wait for over one hour for our luggage to arrive. A bad end to a near perfect flight. Our journey home from Toronto was almost the complete opposite. On arriving at the airport we found the longest queue ever for the Air Transat flight. There were no supervisors about to speak to. Seven flights were all queuing for the same five check in desks. We had to stand in this queue for one hour and twenty minutes. With approx 50 people still in front of us two supervisors arrived and shouted for passengers travelling to Manchester to come forward. The plane was obviously a lot older than the one we arrived on. The TV s were in the middle. We had paid £20 extra each for our seats. These were near the rear of the plane and there were only two seats not three as elsewhere. Apart from that were no different. We had the usual inconsiderate passengers in front of us who reclined their seats as far back as possible so we had minimal room. Do not bother to pay this extra. It is not worth it.

Having purchased tickets at a brilliant rate I was expecting the old cliché; you get what you pay for! The reviews and comments of existing customers were leaving me with little hope of a comfortable stress free flight. I was however pleasantly surprised at the quality of the flight. I was expecting old planes with one TV for a number of passengers with old seats with minimal legroom but the outcome was the opposite. TV's in the headrests for each passenger with a small but decent selection of films to choose from clean cabins with adequate legroom.

I always fly Club Class and find that it is well worth the extra cost. Club Class allows you special check in and your baggage comes out first at your destination. The Club Class cost is not much more than regular Economy in most other airlines but should not be mistaken for First Class or Business Class in other airlines. Some passengers seem to believe that the additional fare should give them much more than it actually does. Crew members are always pleasant and the service is very good. The food could be a bit better (Menu hasn't changed in at least 4 years) and movies could be a bit more recent but other than that I have no complaints. The best part is there are very rarely any delays so that is better than most other carriers.,nan,5.0,nan

Only glitch was when Rome Gate staff thought a backpack was too large to be a personal item (it had 2 full bottles of water and some snacks) but we were in no mood to argue about it.

When you consider the add ons people pay for in econ like seat selection and extras you have to pay for Club Class is (by far) the way to go from what I've seen in other reviews.

I'd suggest bringing ear plugs as they are not available on board and should you have a family of screaming kids for the entire flight (as we did) you will need them. The staff although friendly gave no suggestions or assistance to the screaming children.

The plane to UK was extremely old and the seating very cramped - we were exhausted by the time we reached our destination. On our return flight the plane was a newer model and the seating we had selected was nothing in comparison to the layout online - although alot more comfortable than before.

Booked seats ahead of time to get into the 2 abreast at the rear of the plane. Generous leg room and the wider aisle. Worth booking the seats ahead of time in spite of the fee but they are all doing that now. Started boarding well before departure which meant we were ready to go on time. Pleasant young cabin crew in both directions a refreshing change from the somewhat more mature attendants on the rival carrier. Drinks cart soon after take off. Meals not gourmet but quite adequate.

Return journey on A330 with new Club class was even more comfortable the new seats and PTV are a useful upgrade. Cabin service was again great with very attentive flight attendants. Flight delayed due to weather closing the airport which is out of the airlines control. It was a little confused as we had started to board the flight before the delay was announced.

Should be a lot better when the aircraft get upgraded. Cabin crew are very good and pleasant for the whole flight glass of wine with meal was nice and plenty of coffee after it we paid extra for our seats 37a 38b on the A330. I'm 6 ft tall and had plenty of room well worth the extra money I would recommend bringing water with you as you have to pay for drinks and only take VISA. I will fly Air Transat again as they offer a direct service to Toronto from Dublin we flew out on a Tuesday and returned on a Tuesday as the A330 was being used and I believe is a nicer aircraft than the A310 which is much older and doesn't have the 2 -4 -2 seating configuration.,nan,4.0,nan

If you want a half- decent seat or a realistic amount of luggage for an overseas journey or even a headset you'll have to shell out a fair bit more money. If you have to cancel for some reason you won't get any of your ticket or upgrade back. The real notable problem though is the very meagre meal service. For an 8 hour flight the meals are more the size of a snack and certainly not enough. And even if you want to buy something extra unless you have a credit care you're out of luck.

Both flights went well with no delays and very good service. Excellent leg room and friendly cabin crew. Inflight entertainment was poor but I believe this is being upgraded. My one criticism would be the food. I ordered a special meal but there was no record of this on the system when I checked in. I tried to contact Air Transat whilst in Canada but could only get a recorded message telling me that I should have requested this through a travel agent at the time of booking which I had done. A warning to anyone with strict dietary requirements as they state that special meals cannot be guaranteed. Vegetarian options are available as standard however the meals were rather bland and basic.,nan,4.0,nan

Toilet with baby change was broken on my side of the plane and the aisle to cross over was blocked by an elastic strip so I had to walk all the way to the back of the plane and back around to change my child.

Arrived at Vancouver airport 2.5 hours before departure to find check-in queue already 100 metres long. Inadequate number of check-in desks trying to deal with 3 separate flights. Queue moved 10 metres in 40 minutes but then a bit quicker. Concern mounting everywhere that we would be denied boarding or that flight would be seriously delayed. No announcements no staff on hand to explain - general couldn't-care-less attitude. Asked to see check-in supervisor but she declined to appear. Finally we arrived at check-in after 90 minutes standing in the queue and saw that they had opened more desks. Further 30 minutes standing for security and we headed straight for departure lounge to find them already boarding. Miraculously flight left on time but a lot more could have been done to soothe angry passengers. Once aboard cabin crew on this flight completely cackhanded. Man next to us had chicken dinner tipped into his lap. I was hit by passing trolley at least six times because my arm was about 10 mm over the edge of the arm rest (I am 1.82 m tall and weigh 80 kg). Tonic water went down narrowly missing me but wetting floor all around. Night flight over the arctic but windows kept up all the way so no sleep possible.

On the day we travelled every flight was overbooked so people were being strongly encouraged to accept vouchers and travel later in the week. We were not told at check in as we apparently should have been that due to a catering strike in Toronto the food quality on the flight would be greatly diminished. They weren't wrong - the worst food and the smallest amount I've ever seen. As for the complimentary glass (less than 100ml) of wine with dinner. We ordered an extra snack from the cabin crew which took over 2 hours to appear and the new seat-back video system has very few movies / shows loaded and they're definitely from the bargain shelves of the video rental stores. They've also installed the kit to run the screens underneath your seat so if you're in the habit of occasionally sitting with your feet positioned behind your knees you'll be very uncomfortable.

The inflight entertainment was hopeless and immediately forgettable. Return flight was in the older version of the A330 with screens in the middle of the plane every ten rows. No escape from inadequate films. Trying to sleep was impossible being woken every 20/30 minutes with some announcement or other. Again there was a prohibition on the consumption of duty free drinks - alcoholic or not. However there was seemingly no limit to the amount that could be bought from the trolley as evidenced by a group of youths occupying two rows of seats.

Flight was delayed for 3 hours on a stop in Calgary due to severe thunder storms so no fault of the airline. Return flight on an older A330 with overhead TV screens.

Most seats are in a 3+3+3 configuration which gives a very narrow aisle. I was careful to book an aisle seat in the rear of the cabin with its 2+3+2 configuration giving more space. The in-flight films were a bit naff but who cares. Take your own earphones if you want to watch the films. The meals were small and basic but again so what as long as the seats are good.

As a vegetarian I got the exact same tasteless bland food while going and coming back. When I checked in at Gatwick for my return flight the lady at the counter surprised me by saying that only 5 kg of baggage was allowed as a handbag and that my shoulder bag now counted as an extra cabin baggage - a clear ploy to earn extra money. So my total cabin baggage now weighed in excess of 5 kg. So what did I do. I took out my jacket and put it on took out my e- reader and lo behold - my baggage now weighed less than 5 kg.

TV screens are 10 rows apart and no individual screens. The food was inedible. The flight was delayed but we arrived in Toronto early. Now from Toronto to Gatwick to begin with we checked in staff seemed very friendly but didn't quite know what they were doing we stood at the check in for 10 minutes while the woman serving was talking to another member of staff. We took off because it was a night take off the lights went off then the reading lights began to have a mind of there own going on and off flickering on and off. It was about 1 hour into the flight before we were offered a drink the food was even worse this time. It was impossible to sleep as the staff come around every half an hour to offer you something. Then the lights went out and it was pitch black in the cabin until we landed the reading lights worked just then landing the lights came on and flickered on and off until we got to the gate. We waited half an hour to get off the plane when we got to the gate. Then the real fun began Air Transat had lost out luggage and we are still waiting for the bags.

I was fortunate to have planes with seat-back televisions and found a decent amount of films/TV shows/audio etc but no games. I'd say the food wasn't the best airplane food I'd tasted but there are opportunities to buy food at the airports before boarding. If you're over 5ft 10ins tall and the person in front of you reclines their seat you'll feel a bit squashed. Cabin crew on both trips were professional hard-working and friendly and bearing in mind the reasonable cost of the tickets I'm satisfied with the service and would use Air Transat again.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Premium Economy,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,2.0,We booked Club class for our trip to Italy September 7 2012 because of the added comfort level on a longer overnight trip. We were devastated by the transformation from the old Cub to the new Club class. The seats were very uncomfortable there were more seats added to the cabin and the service was anything but good. On the way home September 28 2012 we were treated to the old Club class on a plane that had not been refurbished. The difference was amazing - smaller amount of club seats much more comfortable and roomier seats with absolutely great service. Change is not necessarily progressive in this case it was just discomfort with poor service at a higher price.,nan,2.0,nan

Young flight crew aboard outbound flight preferred older crew on return - but no complaints. Bottles were warmed upon request. Plane was not full so we were given a seat for my daughter to sleep in and she slept the whole way! Smooth and comfortable flights always on time or early. This is my fourth time flying AT from Toronto to Amsterdam and have never had a bad experience with them! Have flown Club Class as well before definitely worth it!

The food was good. if you want great service and amazing food spend the extra couple hundred dollars and fly with a different airline. There were recent movies played on the screens but had a tablet and watched my own. We left slightly late and arrived in Frankfurt almost 45 minutes early. On the Return flight from Frankfurt we had an A310 with the old configuration. I saved about $300 per ticket (bought 2) and I will defiantly fly with Air Transat again.

Return flight sound quality was so poor you could not stand to listen to it anyhow. Customer service took over 2 months to respond to my complaints.

I was fobbed off with 'corporate policy'. Leaving GLA their entertainment was still shown on a tube TV and they didn't stock a single vegetarian meal leaving a half- dozen people eating extra loaves of bread - which were stale.,nan,2.0,nan

Airbus A310 was full not much legroom in my middle seat. Service was standard smooth flight pilot pointed out Greenland as we flew over. Return was also full very chatty attendant who must have mentioned that we were going to arrive ahead of schedule in GLA about 10 times before take-off! Also informed that we were flying on the day of Air Transat's 25th anniversary. A bit more legroom this time (different A310 maybe?) again service was fine slept for a few hours and awoke to landing in fog in GLA smooth despite this. Transat are the only operator to fly this route direct and that's why I booked.

Booked Row 1 and despite what seat guru says it is a bulkhead both ways can't straighten legs. Service was fine. Even though we had booked direct Madrid to Toronto they changed schedule days before we left to have a stop in Montreal with a plane change. When we got on new plane our seats were taken by Transat crew going to Toronto which reluctantly moved. Frustrating to fight for your seat after a 8 Hour flight.,nan,3.0,nan

Check-in was smooth even though we had to wait half an hour after the scheduled check-in opening time. Boarding was relatively smooth as many people didn't know where the gate was. Departure screens were all broken so people only found out 10 minutes later. Once settled in we had very attentive service from the cabin crew. The food (pasta and beef) was nice but the pasta was slightly bland. We also had a pizza which tasted nice. In-flight entertainment was a shared TV screen but it was fine for the 7 hour flight. Also to mention they need more toilets for economy passengers as 4 toilets for over 200 people isn't good enough. Flight was enjoyable but they newer planes with individual TV screens for everyone.,nan,5.0,nan

Told it was due to plane reconfiguration. They were offering a $230 refund even though the upgrade cost almost $400 and a seat in economy. However they only had 2 seats available the in the very last row of the plane. I had no other choice than to cancel my travel plans due to what I was being offered. I guess the airline thinks that because they are the only direct flight to Manchester customer satisfaction is not important. Next time I will choose another Airline even if it requires a connecting flight.,nan,3.0,nan

Then another toilet blocked leaving just two toilets for all economy passengers. People complained as we had to queue and wait for nearly 20-25 minutes to use a toilet. Staff were pretty rude to a number of passengers who complained to them direct. It was agreed that the club class toilet could be used by those in economy. Our flight back we flew club class we checked in on 14 Oct at Montreal all seemed to be ok just as we were leaving the desk the operator requested our documents back again and removed two bar codes from them and put two others in their place.

I have no issues regarding the non-renovated A330-300 in which we flew Toronto to Paris - having two Club Class lavatories on this plane was very nice service and food were excellent and flight attendants great. Our flight from Frankfurt back to Toronto was one of the older A310-330 which was a complete embarrassment and insult to the whole Club Class experience. The condition of this old A310 has almost completely turned me off ever flying Air Transat Club Class again. For two passengers I paid a fair bit of money for the Club Class experience on this flight only to find that my headrest had become detached and was falling off the back of my seat. The armrests on both of our seats were worn bare and ripped from use looking tacky and shabby. The seat ahead of me was not secured properly and as a result had twisted sideways into my seating area. The seats were worn and uncomfortable for this 9 hour flight. Come on Air Transat! Not having power ports personal seatback video screens and air flow regulators is not acceptable when flying in this day and age. The shabby-looking cabins are not helping either.,nan,3.0,nan

This was the last leg of our World Trip and we had travelled on 9 different airlines as we travelled around the world and were now heading home on a Canadian carrier. Terrible! That is the word to describe the rude service of the staff on board. The airline claims it was voted as the number one Leisure Airline in the world. How can that be? They charge you for everything on board and when you ask for something the first thing they tell you is that there will be a cost involved. Enough already! We know just sell me the item I ask for.

Flight was great with all the extras included in the upgrade very much worth the cost for the option plus! Flight back also delayed and it was over booked upon check in they asked if I would fly back the next day. Air Transat counter was a bit out of the way at Gatwick but was posted and easy to find. I received a complementary upgrade to business class on the way home which was a real treat on a long flight! Overall very happy with the service food entertainment and seat!

Seats were a little tight (9 abreast on an A330) - but tickets were cheaper than other carriers.

Air Transat called in March 2013 to inform us that our Manchester flights had been cancelled and we could only fly from Gatwick on those dates. No apology was given no offer of compensation or even transport to and from Gatwick. We were then offered alternate dates to fly to from Manchester which we took. Upon check in at Manchester it became apparent the seats we had booked had been changed due to the change in dates after some discussion we were offered extra legroom seats for free which were excellent. The flight took off and landed on time it was an old plane with shared screens playing videos during the flight. The food was edible and came with a very small glass of wine. The return flight which was also on time was a refurbished plane with new leather seats and personnel touch screens. If they hadn’t cancelled our flights I would have given them an excellent rating for the price but I would not trust making expensive holiday arrangements that rely on one of their flights again following this experience.,nan,5.0,nan

After being late to get to check in I was told that I would have to either return to the back of the check-in line to remove my camera bag or pay $30 extra. I was told they would not check my luggage if I attempted to remove anything at the counter. When I questioned their logic and explained the situation with the late bus I was given a sneer and a sassy comeback. So all in all it left a bad taste in my mouth about them.,nan,2.0,nan

The experience was exactly the same as national flag carriers who were 3 times the price. The planes were on time and were modern. Good in seat entertainment and the crews were professional and courteous. Most of the plane was made up by large holiday groups of retired people who were very friendly and well behaved. Not like your average business trip with grumpy middle age executives in a hurry.

Only some small things irritated me: whilst sleeping and listening to music using their entertainment system the announcements which were much louder than the music would often cut in and rouse me from my sleep.

I travelled with my family and we had a baby and paid additional money for the bassinet seat at the front. I really can't say one nice thing about this flight. The lighting is awful fluorescent mood lighting which appear not to work and was directly over the bassinet no method to dim. Seat arms are solid and could not be lifted up (unique to the front row middle) which is crazy. In addition all the galleys have been removed so there is one at the front and back with just row after row of seats. I fly a lot long haul and typically you have some space to stretch your legs or stand around. Not with this config. Food - rubber pasta with cheese sauce - this was not even edible. One positive point is they are cheap you do get what you pay for.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Toronto to Athens May 26/13 - Checked in online a few hours before flight. No good seats left (our fault due to late check in) check in at airport went off fast and effortlessly. Older plane with no individual screens. Row 27 (middle) right at the washrooms. The meals (3 choices) and service were good. Seats were comfortable enough. Entertainment was fair. Return was the same style of plane (Row 24 window this time). No individual screens. Meals (3 choices) and service were good. My only complaint is Air Transat really should be using the newly configured planes for all the long haul flights over 6 hrs. It would make the very long flights more enjoyable.,nan,4.0,nan

So anything I put here carries the caveat that it may all go pear shaped at a later date. Having said that though it's a case of so far so good. I have never had a problem as yet. The flights have left and departed on time I have enough leg room and the seats are certainly big enough for me - an average sized person. The aircraft's are clean and tidy and I have found the food always to be hot and tasty. You only have to pay for alcohol from the bar but what the heck you get complimentary wine with the meal. Staff are friendly and helpful. The entertainment can be a bit iffy at times but they are upgrading the entire fleet so teething problems are to be expected. I always take my iPod and a book just in case - it's just a matter or preparation. I would recommend Air Transat to anyone.

But overall it was a good pleasant flight definitely more value for money as the fare was really cheap. Just like any other North American carrier the service and cabin wasn't what you find on Asian or European carriers but having said that the crew certainly made up for it with a great friendly attitude.

Despite having requested and received confirmation from our travel operator that gluten free meals would be provided on both the outward bound and return flights these did not materialise. At the Air Transit check-in desks we asked the attendants if the requested gluten-free meals were on board and both times we were told no.

It seemed that everyone forgot there were washrooms at the back because there was not a lot of traffic. Meals were what you would expect.

We travelled as a couple paid for a VIP check-in and entered the line-up in the middle of the pack but for some reason we were the last 2 passengers to get our boarding pass. We couldn't even get seats next to each other. I tried to speak with an agent on board to see if we could be relocated to sit together but no one seemed to care. Onboard the service was horrible. Always were the last ones to be served and I couldn't even order a sparkling wine chips or chocolate because flight attendants were too busy attending to other passengers or attending the option plus passengers first.

The seats were okay if you're under 5 ft 10. Being over 6ft I thought it lacked some room. The in-flight entertainment was poor an old and boring movie. The food was bad but typical of what you normally get on a plane (barely enough to get you alive in fact). The departure wasn't on time in Montreal we lurked around the airport for more than an hour for some reason. The staff is fair. Would recommend if you're poor and stingy like me.

However departing Cancun on April 28th was an entirely different experience. The staff member weighed our luggage and told us we were overweight by 8 kg. We did not do any shopping and did not purchase any items on our trip our sole purpose of our trip was to get married.

This gives you more room on the isle side which is very comfortable. Option plus gives you a lot of pleasant privileges: a bottle of Prosecco per person first choice of hot meal snacks from the bistro menu comfort kit.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,We purchased the Option Plus. That put us in a different line for check in which in the end was not special. It allows for an extra checked bag for each person. On the plane it gets you a comfort kit: blanket eye mask and blow up neck pillow. Sadly they smell like plastic which was ok after being aired out for a week. Leaving from Montreal the airplane did not allow us to control our own air conditioning. 8 hours of flight while being hot and jammed in like a sardine was not great. Each of our seats had a TV screen and our choice of movies and TV shows to watch. The connection for headphones for my son and I was not good and we had to hold the plug in place to hear. The staff were pleasant and helpful on the way out. The way back from Rome was terrible. We thought we had learned from the way over and dressed in cool clothing. This time there was a/c we could control. But the screen was in the center of the plane and you could watch the movie they chose. It took me more than half way through the 9 hour flight to figure out how to get the sound to work. They did have Wi-Fi which helped take away some of the boredom for my son but the battery on my laptop gave out. The staff were rude and dismissive. On the trip back we had to change our tickets returning earlier than the 2 months we had planned. I fully expected to pay a change fee but I was told that can't be done and I would have to purchase new tickets. While shocked by this I bought them hoping that once I got home I could write to customer service and get some help. When checking in our bags I asked if we could please use the Option Plus that was paid for round trip on our first flight to cover the one extra bag we needed to check. I was told no. The guy behind the counter even begged of the supervisor since when he weighed all three bags we were still well under our weight limit.

Other than that there was no attempt to clean the washrooms. At one point a father with a young son stood in the open washroom door and cleaned the toilet so that his child could use it. The washrooms became stinky as the flight went on. The passengers in the row ahead of me who were directly across from the washrooms were constantly reaching out from their seats to close the washroom door that was left open. All in all the whole experience was disgusting. Other public facilities with washrooms post a sheet on the inside door and staff are required to check off cleaning duties every hour. How can you expect a cubicle toilet to remain clean over a 9 hour flight when it is in constant use. I expect a clean washroom on my flights.

Our options were a non-stop flight with Air Transat or a three leg flight (Toronto-Munich-Lisbon-Faro) with Air Canada. Air Transat cost about $300 each more than AC for economy class. Its planes are all more than 20 years old and this route uses the original seating mainly 3-3-3 in a plane designed for 2-4-2. Leg room is less than AC and seat width much tighter. Food was the worst we have had seen since flying American to California. On the return flight the attendants repeatedly walked the aisles imploring passengers to take the inedible mini-pizzas! YYZ-FAO: arrived early and were invited by the friendly agent to switch from row 28 to bulkhead seats! We chose right side which has half curtains rather than a fixed bulkhead and I was able to stretch my legs out in front of me (I'm 183 cm mainly legs) no extra charge! Unfortunately the 3-3-3 seating does not give enough room for the food carts to pass the fixed bulkhead without slamming them repeatedly against it and forcing through an exercise which was repeated throughout the flight and drove our aisle passenger to find another seat after a few episodes. Overhead screen was directly above our heads so we were unable to see anything. Five music channels with volume settings too low to hear or too high to listen bring your own entertainment. Two rear and one mid cabin toilet for about 240 people is way below what is needed on 6-8 hour flights. Cabin crew were efficient but not overly communicative and not very visible after the meal service was over. The flight left about 20 minutes late but arrived almost one hour early so we had to wait for Ryanair to vacate an arrivals slot at FAO. Return flight was almost 2 hours longer in row 26 middle a claustrophobic experience when the seats in front were slammed back for sleeping. The small overhead screens were showing an animated feature to an audience of snowbirds averaging probably 65years old great program planning. Overhead storage is very limited and too many passengers are permitted to bring oversized luggage causing much frustration for later arrivals. Overall these out-dated aircraft need to be replaced with modern equipment for overseas flights but apparently the once a week flights to Portugal have no competitors so Air Transat can charge higher prices for less comfort and an inferior flight experience.,nan,2.0,nan

No one bothered to clean them. 2) The movies were out of date. Dated back to 1990's. They did not play any new releases. Basically there was nothing to watch. 3) You had to pay for blankets and pillows snacks and alcoholic beverages. 4) The fire exit seats were by the toilets and the poor passengers were freezing.

The seat of three had only one screen in the middle. 5) The food on the plane was not better than AC. 6) The duty free was rubbish. 7) All stewardess were sitting in a row of seats at the back.

After another email stating that they were false advertising magically they found me another seat on a flight the next morning. The food is rubbish and not enough of it only one meal on a 10 hour flight also the exact same as the outbound flight no option to even purchase anything except pringles or crisps. The wine - I'm not sure where they get the stuff they serve with the meal but it is absolutely the worst after that you have to pay a premium if you want another drink.

Okay let's start with the good we paid the additional fee for the ""Option Plus"" and it provided us with what they said it would. Priority check in seat selection priority baggage handling and a few extras on board. For the round trip ticket (Vancouver to Glasgow) the price was better than the two big guys (Air Canada and British Airways). Flight both ways right on time and although we had an hour stop in Calgary at least we flew into Glasgow and avoided the ""Heathrow nightmare"" and believe me avoiding Heathrow was an absolute bonus. Seats were reasonably comfortable lovely mood lighting and a fairly good personal entertainment system. Service by the cabin crew was good on the round trip so all in all I would say the flight was quite satisfactory. Now the bad the food that was served was simply awful and I have no doubt the fight attendants knew that. I've made numerous trips back to the UK in the past 45 years and I honestly can't recall airline food being as bad as what Air Transat served on this flight. It really defies logic in my humble opinion as to why they couldn't add an additional ten to twenty dollars on a ticket and provide passengers with a reasonably quality meal.

Consequently the seats are appallingly uncomfortable and in my case resulted in severe back pain following both flights. In addition the food was disgusting and I didn't eat very much of it choosing instead to go without. There were insufficient pasta meals meaning that by the time we were served there was no choice. It was take the meat meal or go without. The breakfast served was indescribable. On the flight out we complained several times about the air conditioning which was set too high. The cabin was very cold and passengers were adding jumpers and even coats in order to try to be comfortable. Our requests to turn the air conditioning down a little were ignored and we were seated in a freezing flow of air the whole flight (we were sitting in central aisle seats - avoid).

The ground procedures at Manchester need an overhaul though. Check-in and bag drop only open at the prescribed time and then they insist on checking and tagging cabin bags (which are never inspected again so why they have to be tagged is a mystery) all of which makes the online check-in facility superfluous. This was not the case at Toronto so why is it needed at Manchester? There was less service from FA's on the return flight although this did give passengers the opportunity to sleep which would have been easier had not the FA's been constantly chattering in the galley area or tearing up and down the aisles!

Last year we were told that by this year we could expect an aircraft with the redesigned cabins and we're disappointed to find it was the old configuration with not so comfortable seats and no choice in the movies provided. It' s highly likely I would have scored a 10 otherwise. The service from the cabin staff was excellent and there were more beverages offered than we could drink. The meals were excellent - the best I'd ever tasted on an airline and overall it was a very pleasant experience. We had priority baggage but through no fault of Air Transat it was a waste of time as it took an hour to get through customs and immigration so everyone's bags were at baggage reclaim by the time we got there. I wouldn't hesitate to book Air Transat Club again and I'm hoping that on the return flight we will get the new cabins.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,4.0,Travelled with my spouse on August 23/14 to Paris and then returned to Toronto on TS 0489 on Sept 12/14. The flights left on time and seats were comfortable however the $300 additional charged for Option Plus is over the top. On the trip to Paris we noticed that only one other seat was designated Option Plus. We noticed a few things that didn't make much sense to us. If we hadn't booked Option Plus we could have still booked two similar seats at no additional cost and wouldn't have received the Comfort Package ($9) and one free small bottle of sparkling wine and small bottle of wine with our dinner. We arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance both leaving and returning and never had to wait in line so no big advantage here. In terms of our Priority Tags on our bags one bag in Paris took close to 20 minutes to arrive after receiving the first bag so again where is the value for money. On the trip to Paris we were asked if we could have wine instead of sparkling wine (why are customers not given that option). We noticed as well that the food cart went by us at least two times and when we were finally served whatever options the other economy passengers had were taken away from us-we were served leftovers. I suppose on a busy flight with many Option Plus passengers the issue of time would be taken into consideration (this was not our situation). This was our first trip with Air Transat. We travel to Mexico each winter. On the trip home to Toronto I discussed the situation regarding wine selection and timing of meal services with two flight attendants (very cordial) however they were simply following company policy. I should point out that I think we were the only ones with Option Plus. Again we asked for wine instead of sparkling wine and were accommodated (good) however the leftover meal was for a child not an adult-again why wouldn't we be served the same time as the folks in the front of the aircraft. Our bags were first-off in Toronto (good).,nan,3.0,nan

Even the attendants were having a hard time pushing the cart through the isles. Ensure to bring your own headphones pillows and blanket as they are not provided. They charge $9CAD for them. The food was just horrible with no flavor at all. Bring your own meal. Definitely as budget airline but definitely not worth the price they charge.

Apart from all of that the aircraft seats are fairly comfortable  the aisle between the rows of seats seems very narrow which does not lend itself to having a stroll around to stretch legs. The service is very mediocre and the food on both flights left a lot to be desired.

I anticipated that since AT had just received the 737-800 fleet they would be in good shape. Never assume. I was seated in 3a and seat 2a was missing the cover plate for the left arm rest exposing the wires and mechanical system. This area was also dirty. Above 2h there was a large piece of trim which was loose between the bins and the wall. Watching the attendants they struggled to operate the cabin lights and overhead entertainment machine. Now the worst. The forward toilet seat was broken in half left side which I reported to the attendants. On the way home the seat was taped together with what appeared to be white medical tape. The entertainment system movie was not working and both trim pieces in the same shape. No seat belt trays up or seat back up inspection from the attendants either taking off or landing.

Impossible to get out of that seat. I had to bother the passenger next to me. The plane was unbelievable hot because it sat on the tarmac and many were complaining about the lack of air-conditioning.

nan,Premium Economy,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,2.0,In the past 2 years I have travelled with Air Transat 26 times. In the early days I would buy an upgrade to club at the check in and at £100 pounds or so it was well worth the better seat comfort which was my main concern. The food and beverage is way above the economy standard. These days I only book economy as the rate for club is much more (£300) plus and you are not immune from the frequent screaming brat brigade behind the curtain. Now I take pot luck and get my seat allocated at the check in. I don't think I have ever been on a flight that has left on time - always 30 mins plus late as a minimum and on one occasion we left over 2 hours late! No apology coming from the crew and some missed the ongoing connections. To be fair the staff have been overall good given the standard of some of the passengers expectations. So why do I keep using Air Transat? Simple they are the cheapest and Gatwick is much better than getting round to hideous Heathrow. My advice for what it worth is if you can manage 7 hours get fed and watered before you go. Expect screaming kids and if you are lucky you will be far enough away not to worry about and in any case get some noise cancelling headphones they help a bit! Check out the cost of club over econ and to be honest it just don't add up. Personally I wish they would give decent seats no food and water/drinks available at a cost and I would gladly pay an extra amount for that.

Meaning from the time I boarded in Toronto I waited about 3 hours before I was served a lukewarm dinner which barely passed as edible. The flight crew were very nice however served extremely slow. My finished dinner was sitting in front of me for about 45 minutes before someone took it away. The plane itself was also not something I would pay for. The seats were extremely small (the smallest seats I have ever been on) and the aisles were so narrow I hit elbows the whole way down to the one of two washrooms onboard.

Very speedy check-in at Manchester with 'fast-lane' security included. Flight on time to the minute and as we were club passengers we boarded first. Greeted onboard by the staff and immediately offered us drinks and explained the workings of the seat and entertainment system. Legroom is more than comfortable and seats had a good recline. We were then given complimentary comfort packs headphones and amenity packs. After takeoff we were offered unlimited drinks before being served delicious meals served on china and tablecloths liqueurs after dinner and even came round with speciality coffee. Further snacks and drinks followed until we landed at Vancouver and our 'priority' luggage was delivered immediately. Similar service on the return flight and very organized hassle-free check in at Vancouver - again with 'fastlane' security. Plenty of drinks snacks hot-towels newspapers and a delicious Chicken dish served beautifully. After a relaxing flight a continental breakfast was served with fresh coffee juice and tea. We arrived at Manchester 20 minutes early. Air Transat offer a great Club Class experience for an amazing price. Seat comfort is probably not what you'll find in some other business class airlines but the clean cabin mood lighting relaxed atmosphere and very attentive service is exceptional.

Lunch was okay I dont expect a gourmet meal so it was as expected but the breakfast was atrocious in the cardboard box was an empty coffee cup an orange juice and a strawberry yoghurt.

I complained to the stewardess and took a couple of photos to remember the experience.

Food was quite good and well presented and the drinks on offer very generous. I have never flown with an airline that offers Grand Marnier as one of the drinks options I was impressed. Staff were helpful and attentive plane left on time and arrived on time. Flight back to London two weeks later was just as good despite being an overnight flight. Although the seats do not go flat they reclined enough to allow me to get some sleep.

So message to Air Transat is - major on your great flight prices forget the food (don't even offer it within the price - please do not insult us with an inferior product). Instead recommend to passengers that they take their own food (I did on my return journey and I was really glad) or offer a paid-for on-board food service of quality which passengers could purchase (""quality"" being the operative here).

My recent experience seems to be in sync with most of the posts regarding service provided with this carrier delays in departure are to be expected. Delays are not a deal breaker for me as I embrace safety first. However simple customer service is what I expect from an airline carrier in the wake of extensive cutbacks to this industry. My complaint really is very simple. I requested a window seat well in advance to the closing of seat bookings. As I booked my seat with the airline representative at the airport I was guaranteed a window seat I had even reviewed with the agent that this was correct (I always double check my reservations bookings). Upon boarding the flight I found that my seat was not a window seat and that it was the last row of seats in the centre of the plane. It has been two weeks since my flight. I still don't understand why they would not tell me the truth. I watched the representative check the seat bookings on the computers like I have done countless times before. Overall after having travelled with almost all the airlines in the world to every continent in the world Air Transat falls well below customer service.

When we arrived in PV I was pleased to see that there was a jetway since my mobility is poor but Air Transat doesn't use it according to the stewardess because it is an extra cost. So down the long stairs onto the pavement we all went. I only decided to comment when the online check-in offered out of Calgary did not work for PV.

Departure from Cuba was early as well were back in Ottawa almost one hour early. That was the good part. The seats are small and cramped. We were on 737. I had no legroom at all had to stretch leg out into the isle just to get some room. Got a huge bruise on my outer thigh from trying to wedge into the seat very attractive for a beach vacation. (I am 6 ft tall and not overweight). No meals (which we knew) just a small snack bag of cookies and juice or pop. Kind of cheap. Staff seemed nice enough but with no meals to serve focus more on selling stuff. Overhead small screens for movies (which were good). Had my own headphones.

The only complaint is that after being at the airport at 4 am checking in boarding etc took off a little late due to the catering company being late loading the plane. But to be handed a piece of banana bread for a breakfast was disgusting. Very hungry by the time that dinner was served being option plus I mistakenly thought that I may get a choice prior to the serving nope - by the time that the FA's got to row 28 all they had was a rice dish full of peppers so I went hungry. Thought that perhaps a dessert might suffice. Well a piece of fudge does not cut it. Not the FA's fault but they must have had something else on board - no offer whatsoever. I will be sure to pack my own food next time if they can not do any better than that cut out the food.

First issue was that they boarded plane from both ends at same time without regard to seat location. I was in the second to last row and was boarding from the front. Took 15 minutes to find our way to back of plane. Main problem was that someone forgot to order the right amount of food. This was a supper flight and we did not arrive till midnight. I estimate that half the passengers were given only a bag of peanuts for supper. From talking with the flight attendant seems this situation was not all that unusual. The worse part is that no one informed the passengers before boarding. We would have had plenty of time to buy some food before boarding.

No it is not a luxury airline but it gets one from A to B safely and at reasonable cost. If you don't like the food take your own as I do.

The audio jack didn't work so there was no sound to watch the movie. On the return flight Air Transat uses Enerjet. The plane was a 737 the legroom was terrible & I'm average hight.

The ground crew on the other end were totally unprepared for the flight. All in all our family vacation was reduced to losing a day and a credit given for future flight at a cost of $250/pp. Since this is the second time I've flown Air Transat and twice in-a-row that my vacation was reduced by a day (the first time was on my honeymoon to Italy) I will not fly Air Transat again.,nan,1.0,nan

The outbound flight departed one hour late but arrived 5 minutes early so kudos to the pilots for making up the lost time (which was due to affairs outside of the airline's control). I was impressed with the quality of the food which both tasted good and sustained me well until I got to Canada and the wine was of good quality and I was pleasantly surprised by it as well as free non-alcoholic drinks throughout the flight! The in-flight entertainment system had a wide variety of options and I was kept entertained for much of the flight. The remainder of the time I was trying to sleep which given the leather seats and frugal legroom was rather difficult but surprisingly it was bearable for the 8 hour flight. The cost of the headphones didn't bother me as I brought my own with me and were compatible with the socket on the monitor. The flight crew were very charming and were happy to help with even the smallest of things (in my case filling in the landing card). The inbound flight back to London was much the same although one point I would make is that the overhead lighting made sleeping early on in the flight impossible as it was a bright orange for around 30 minutes after take-off before changing to a light blue and then to a dark purple. Would recommend bringing eye covers if you're intending to sleep on the red-eye flight. The flight crew were very polite in awaking passengers for breakfast which along with the dinner served 6 hours previously was small but tasty. I would definitely recommend flying with Air Transat as a very affordable way of flying from Europe to Canada and many of the costs for supplementary items can be easily offset - to avoid paying for a selected seat check in very early on so as to choose a good seat that hasn't already been chosen; to avoid the costs of headphones and blankets these can be brought with you onto the plane and the flight crew don't mind at all; the flight crew are also happy to move you to another seat if there is one free which is almost guaranteed on an Air Transat flight which are hardly ever fully booked.,nan,5.0,nan

They have upgraded their old entertainment system to something on par with AF/BA/KLM now, however that is only in the renovated planes. The food is as bad as it was, but I'd say that for the price this is to be expected. I never have any expectations regarding the food they will serve so I'm not disapointed. They are usually still the cheapest for CDG to YUL so if I wanted something a tad better I'd pay a bit more.

Our flight from Toronto to Glasgow was pretty uneventful. Our return flight was also uneventful, thankfully. I appreciate the lighting and ambient music that seems to play as boarding and de-planing takes place. It can really add to a zen atmosphere and help people who might be having some pre-flying jitters. One thing to note, Air Transat: get your food situation together! Each flight, we ended up basically getting the worst they had to offer meal-wise because none of the decent food was left as everyone before us had opted for it. I was not at all impressed by this. We booked seats towards the back of the plane to avoid screaming children as best as we could, only to suffer as far as meal options went. Be prepared to need more of the food you know people prefer.

Contacted AT and were told that since there were 2 infants on the same booking (we were flying with other family members with infants) system and AT policy dictates that passengers must check in at the counter.

AT lost my spouse's booking even though we had more then ample proof of payments and booking. We were told to contact AT customer service. We were told that AT just went through a system upgrade. To me it appears that a system downgrade occurred. Spoke with the supervisor who reluctantly contacted AT and resolved the issue. Check in time - just under 1 hour. Flight TS561 PUJ to YYZ due to the system upgrade check-in took over 1.75 hours (a lot of other customers were also complaining) at the end of which we were told that AT could not honour seat selection for 7 people in our party.

Air Transat offered the older passenger a seat at the back of the plane away from her friend that she had paid extra to sit beside. She refused, I offered to go to the seat at the back of the plane and gave her my seat. Staff were rude and ungracious to me and the elderly passenger. They only offered refreshments with meals.

Both crews efficient, and slightly more friendly on the return flight. Drawbacks - Seats ok, but recline in their 'Club' class is not to Business class standards, nor is the seat pitch. Very much equivalent to a Premimum Economy offering. No priority when leaving the aircraft, so economy pax near the No2 door got off first - rather poor.

Attendants consisted of senior staff who were friendly and responded to requests with courtesy. Someone mentioned in a review that the seats at the very back do not recline. I was in the second last row window side, and the girls behind me had their seats reclined and they were the last row. Dinner was served on the flight, but I didn't have any because I was trying to sleep. Inflight entertainment consisted of a mixture of new releases and older movies. You could also track your flight. All entertainment is located at the back of the headrest in front of you. Bring your own headphones or pay for them from Air Transat for $9. As we approached the U.K. they came around with breakfast which I chose a slice of very moist banana bread and a beverage of choice.

We flew into Paris CDG airport from Montreal at the beginning of August. The treatment we received on board in Club Class was excellent but when we landed the nightmare began! Not only did we not get off first, we were herded off of the plane and down two sets of portable stairs to waiting, unairconditioned buses which had been sitting on the tarmac in 32°C heat. The buses had approximately eight actual seats but were filled by about 35-40 passengers who had to stand in the oppressive heat. Once we finally arrived at the terminal we also found that there was no priority line for Club Class passengers. Our return trip through CDG was just as bad with no priority lines and long waits until we got to our gate. Once at the gate the Air Transat staff were inattentive and unprofessional. The monitor indicated that our flight was on time but we had yet to be processed up to five minutes before our supposed departure. I went up and asked what the problem was and was informed that our flight was delayed. I then told them that maybe they should share that info with the passengers as their monitor still indicated that we were ""on time"". We were finally processed and then once again herded onto overheated buses which sat, full of passengers, for ten minutes in 35°C before allowing anyone to board. Not the ""Club Class"" service I had anticipated! I filed a formal complaint with the airline but have no illusions as to the likely outcome.

We have used Air Canada mostly but also British Airways and Virgin Atlantic before they stopped this route. Air Canada's Economy since they squeezed an extra seat in each row is awful and their premium economy is just OK. BA uses ageing 747's and premium economy (WT+) is just OK. Air Transat Economy is also tight with a 3-3-3 configuration but their new ""Club"" is just 2-2-2 and looked attractive so we decided to give it a try - pricewise it is about the same as AC and BA premium economy. However, in our opinion having just completed the outbound flight it is streets ahead of BA and AC. We had 1A and 1C and the leg room and width is fine. The screens for the entertainment are fantastic (especially compared to BA) and the AVOD system worked well (although my wife's did need a reboot half way through the flight). The meal service was great - served course by course on nice china with smart cutlery. Choice of wines from the bottle. With only 12 seats the service was miles ahead of PE in BA and AC. Nice snack prior to landing, again on nice china with a drinks service. The coffee was excellent - not the usual rubbish. Personally I would put this ""Club Transat"" mid way between PE and business. The only downside - you are not first off the plane - it is a shame Transat can not organise this. So, as you may gather - I am a convert.

We chose Club Class, seats 1H, 1K. Club Class would be considered a poor man's business class, however, believe that is an apples to oranges comparison. Transat's Club Class is more aligned to a Premium Economy product and that is the class I've denoted in the review profile. All considered, Club Class seats are fairly comfortable with generous width; pitch, however, is on the tight side (36""), particularly for the second of two rows that make up Club Class. The first row has greater distance between back of chair and the bulkhead, however, these seats do not have a foot rest as do the second row. Not having a foot rest does make a difference over a longer flight; I recommend a portable (inflatable) foot rest that will make a world of difference. Given a choice, choose the first row over the second as it is more spacious and you'll avoid a reclined chair invading your space. As well, go row 1 on the right side of the aircraft as the one Club Class washroom is just adjacent to seats 1C and 1F. Inflight amenities include blanket, neck pillow, socks, slippers, toothbrush with paste, and head phones. The inflight entertainment system is easy to use and full of films, shows, games and music. The dining experience in Club Class is so-so. The cold meat plate offered on overnight flights is sparse and unappealing in look and taste. The only positive aspect is the hot soup offered. Breakfast in Club Class is similar, the best option is the cold breakfast which offers a varied fruit selection, yogurt, bran cereal, and rolls. Avoid the egg dishes, bland and unappetizing. Service was very positive. Flight staff were professional, personable, friendly and present. Club Class pre-boarding is helpful as flights tend to be crowded and Terminal 3 (Toronto Pearson) organization of gates makes for chaotic boarding generally. While they may board first, Club Class passengers do not deplane first but the delay to disembark is not a material one.

I think the reason for this is that Air Transat do not have any competition for this route and so they treat their customers accordingly. This plane (return flight) was more suited to short haul not a transatlantic flight. More rows of seats have been added in economy and so squashed together knees touch the seat in front and you have to slide in to your seat. The new ""slimline"" seats are more suited to people of child size. I am 9st 12lb and was still overhanging the next seat and so constantly changed my neighbours radio station (controls on top of arm rest) on numerous occasions. This had a knock on effect and was happening all over the plane. Everyone in economy was complaining about the space provided. It was an absolute disgrace - never again. Seats not cheap £500+ return for economy. Please will some other airline take up the Manchester - Toronto (Lester Pearson) route again. It is desperately needed. Next trip I will travel and have a 1 stop rather than endure that rubbish again. If you have any choice at all - do not travel this route.",Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0

Our flight was delayed by 2 hours (while we were in the air) due to fog in Glasgow.

Even an airport official with a yellow shirt which read ""ASK ME FOR HELP"", knew nothing about Air Transat's ground crew at the airport. Finally, at about 1:30, four Air Transat staff casually walked into the airport and set up their counters where 12 passengers were standing, away form the 200+ that were waiting since 12:30. There was a mad stampede to get to those four check-in counters. Then it appeared that they were having problems with the computer and told us that indeed there was a computer problem and they were awaiting assistance. It took another 25 minutes before the first boarding pass was handed out to a loud round of applause. This all became extremely exasperating especially for those adults with kids. There was even one elderly lady in a wheel chair. When we finally boarded those who paid for pre-selected seats realized that their seats were occupied. More confusion and confrontations occurred on board as some exasperated passengers refused to give up their seats to those who had prepaid for them.

Coming home was a big concern, but the staff at the airport were amazing. I did have to see the doctor at the airport and then I was taken through the process of checking in. They had managed to get me three seats that were empty and I took up the three of them with my cast etc. Cabin staff was absolutely amazing, because getting me down the aisle was no easy feat, and of course I felt guilty about holding everything up. I was in a great deal of pain and I just wanted to get home to Canada. I felt very ill when we took off and they gave me ice chips which helped immensely. I was the last to leave the plane and we ran into the problem of no wheelchair with the left leg extension which was going to be a big problem. But between the maintenance staff and cabin staff they rigged up a milk crate to the front of the wheelchair so both my legs rested on it. It caused quite a stir in the airport.  We also had someone there who took us through Customs and the young lady stayed with me while my husband waited for our daughter who was picking us up.

The screen configuration reminds me of charter flights I used to go on in the 80's. I appreciate that this not a new aircraft, the first A310 was delivered in 1983 and the last in 1997 but this type of aircraft should either be updated or not used on long haul.

I am not a person who gets nit picky about much but would never fly Air Transat again. To begin with what is said about the seats is true. I travel a lot and they had to be the worse I have encountered. No padding and the least amount of leg room. Four hours into the trip I was dreading the return trip already. The service was horrible but not because of the staff. There is too few of them. Putting on your light and waiting half an hour for any attention was considered the norm. We had a big spill and it took 42 minutes from the time I hit the light and we received help. Once the carts get in the aisle basically forget it. No service at all other than eventually a meal arriving. On the way there my son slept the whole time but on our return trip he was awake and apprehensive. He gets motion sickness easily so reading etc was not really a choice but they had those video terminals so I counted on that to help entertain him for the 9 hour flight. About an hour into the flight his terminal started experiencing problems and shut down. We traded seats so he could use mine but soon mine did the same thing as well as the one in the third seat. I hit the light for some help. 52 minutes later I finally flagged a stewardess going by. Her response was a big fake smile, a shrug ""nothing I can do about that"" she says and begins to leave. ""Wait a minute. Please come back here. I paid the same as everyone else and have a child with me. I was told we would have a terminal and have no other way of entertaining him because I counted on it. . I don't matter but I need one for my son"". Her response was that there was ""no guarantee"" about the terminals. I can move seats if I want. I stand up and look around. I see single seats here and there. I need to sit with my son though. The closest ones were six rows apart. I could see three spots with duel empty seats but the person in those rows had spread out. I asked one to move. He refused. I then asked the same stewardess to help me find a row we could both sit in because they were out there. She turned to me and proclaimed loudly ""I don't understand what you want from me"". We finally found a seat thanks to a wonderful passenger going out of her way to help and we ended up in a centre row. My terminal quit after five minutes so don't count on them for entertainment. I was blown away at the lack of empathy shown over a mom wanting to sit with her young son. The icing on the cake was I paid an extra $240.00 to choose our seats when we booked just to make sure my son and I could be together and he could have a window seat. When I called after the trip I was told that payment made no guarantee either. I was offered $50 off my next trip. That was after I said I would never use them again. ",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Not only did we not have extra leg room, but our seats did not recline to even give a little bit of extra space. We were livid and asked to be moved immediately. Our return flight was the same scenario. Even after the travel agent called Air Transat again to confirm extra leg room we were not only in regular seats but we were behind the extra leg room / emergency exit seats. We spoke to the 2 ladies in those seats and were told they didn’t pay for reserve those seats. What a slap in the face for us since we not only reserved but paid extra for our seats.

The following morning picked up for a 10.30 departure which left as 12. Voucher for breakfast provided. The new menu onboard is diabolical. Warm sandwiches (for 9 hour flight ) all of which have cheese. We were offered a price reduction on our next flight.

A330-200,Economy Class,1.0,July 2016,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,MAN to YVR,3.0," |  We have flown Air Transat for 10 years and we have generally have always been happy, however, this year has been our worst experience ever. Our flights were not cheap, we paid £2499.22 for two return flights (Manchester to Vancouver) and car hire and we expected much better than we got. Both our outbound and inbound flights were delayed, 5.5 hours and 6 hours. The outbound sector picked up a delay a week before our departure (3 hours at Manchester), it picked up further delays on each sector it completed thereafter. The airline could have delayed passengers at home, but did not. The inbound flight was delayed because it was waiting for a part to be delivered from another airport. YVR is an unmanned hub, namely it has no directly employed Air Transat employees at YVR only handling agents.  It's maintence base at YVR didn't have the essential part, thus the aircraft was grounded until the essential part could be sourced, delivered and fitted. The point here, is that Air Transat operations would have know the length or likely length of the delay but mislead passengers by continually changing the delay. Vouchers for refreshments were give out but some of the food outlets had closed. Moreover, passengers who smoke (not me) were understandably frustrated at being trapped in a nonsmoking envrioment. The airline has recently changed its meal service, however, referring to it as a meal service is misleading. A hot (soggy, tasteless and burnt) sandwich (there is a choice of 6, we travelled with family who were on a separate booking, thus we all tried different sandwiches and were in agreement they were soggy, tasteless and burnt) napkin and bitter coffee or weak tea service in a polystyrene cup doesn't by an stretch of the imagination qualify for a meal or service in any language.The sandwiches were so unpopular, the crew completed a second service to get rid of them. I emailed my complaint down route but received no response. The same service was offered upon the return. When I returned I complained, and advised the airline that this change in service was purely a cost saving excercise and that the snack service was not acceptable for the duration of the flight. The airline advised me it was not a cost saving exercise and in any event it was complimentary.  We paid a lot of money for our seats, they were not cheap, they were the most expensive we had ever paid. This season Air Transat has been bogged down with lengthly delays throughout its sectors (LGW, MAN, GLS, AMS, YVR, YYC, YUL) and the changes in its inflight service, crewing and flight planning, presumable to make efficiency saving, are costing it both financially and in its reputation.

We have flown Air Transat before, we like them because they fly to Manchester from Toronto and are reasonably priced. It has always been a bit cramped but acceptable.

The person in front of my wife put his seat right back and at times when we were instructed to bring our seats up this person ignored the instruction.The flight attendants passed by but didn't notice until I pointed it out to them, even coming in to land. Otherwise the flight attendants were fine. I had the second worst sandwich in my life from Manchester to Toronto and the worst sandwich in my life from Toronto to Manchester. The drinks were fine but surely for a 6-7 hour fight they could provide a small meal. I notice that the flight attendants had a meal, but I am sure it wouldn't be too much more trouble or expense to provide the same for the passengers. I will probably fly Transat again, but if there is only a small difference in the price from Air Canada, I will probably go with them even if they do not fly directly to Manchester.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

The groundstaff at YVR were partially nice but a few of them that I had to deal with becuase of paying were highly unfriendly and unmotivated. Before boarding there is no lounge access with Club Class. The Club Class cabin consists of 12 extra wide seats with a bit more legroom that recline a little more than normal seats. Asides from the extra width, they are similar to premium economy seats of other companies. Before take off we were served some cava while after take off there was a bar service with a few crackers. The meals are pre-ordered normal meals served on china. There was a hot meal, a salad, some cheese and a dessert. Really nothing special. I would say a standard meal from a more respectable company like Air France / KLM or Lufthansa. The drinks were plenty but then again nothing special. When it came to sleeping we had a tiny fleecy blanket and an inflatable pillow. There was a little service pack with toohbrush, handcream, socks, slippers etc.. During the night they came by with chips and chocolate bars. The breakfast consisted of some fruit and a hot mini cinnamonbun. Which left me rather hungry after this nine hour flight.

This is very misleading statement as the meal service includes only one tasteless sandwich as the main course for 7-8 hours flights. This is not acceptable and the airline should allow passengers to pre-order normal hot meal as other low cost carriers doing (eg. Norwegian shuttle, Air Baltic, Fly Dubai, Pegasus etc).

Check in fine at Toronto, but we tried to explain to the agent that we were entitled to fastlane security. After looking completely confused she stated that only British Airways got fastlane security from this Terminal, we have had fastlane from Vancouver and apparently it is only operated at 'selected' airports despite Pearson being a hub. At the gate, the crew were standing around waiting for the aircraft to be taxied round which caused a 40 minute delay. Thankfully as Club we were boarded first on to an aged A310 in fair condiiton. No amenity packs left on our seats, and when we asked for one, we got a confused reply saying they had not been left on the aircraft. We were offered an 'option plus' pack but we declined. Not the fault of the airline, but there was a baby screaming at certain times throughout the flight. Why anyone would want to take a baby in Club Class is beyond me. Also, there was a fault with the seat back TV as it had a red tinge in certain areas of the screen. Served the usual sparkling wine before take-off but service lacked from this point on. After take-off, we waited at least 1 hour before anything was served. The stewardess serving the Club section came round and asked for people's menu choices and eventually we had to attract the attention of another stewardess to get a drink. We did try the call button but being a 25 year old aircraft it didn't work. Word must have reached the purser of our frustration as she personally came to speak to us. When we informed her of the lack of service, she first said that 'there was possible turbulence and they may not serve drinks', after further conversations she then apologised and explained that 'the stewardess hadn't been with them long'. After this we were served in the way that Air Transat normally treats it's Club passengers. The Club Class on Air Transat is usually great, but we found on this occasion, the sense of exclusivity which we paid a lot extra for was really lacking.

That delay pushed the landing back to 12.15 am (Vancouver time). The worst is yet to come - after customs we had to wait 2.5 hrs for our luggage to arrive. The Air Transat counter staff were absolutely usless and couldn't offer a proper explanation of why the luggage were not coming or offerings any kind of solution. A lot of passengers with small kids got fed up and left. Finally around 2.30 am the luggage started to come up on the carousel. Later on we found out the reason for the delay was being short staffed. They had scheduled one crew member to empty a 300 passenger aircraft (saving money or a mistake I do not know). It has been 4 days since we returned and no one from the company has boderred to return my calls or offer an apology or explanation. ,Family Leisure,1.0,nan

We fly every year to Portugal and have used Air Transat every time. The food was always quite good. However on this trip they have stopped serving proper food. We were delayed an hour so sitting on the plane for 10.5 hours. We expected the usual tray of food, salad, main course, desert, but no they have stopped this and now all you get is a choice of 5 different bread rolls. That's it, for a 9.5 hour flight - one lousy bread roll, I could not eat mine it was stodge and tasted foul. Just slices of meat and bread, no salad or anything else inside. So I had nothing to eat on this flight. I asked for an alternative that was not bread and they did not have anything to offer. The seats are very narrow and hard, no lumbar support and virtually no foam in the seat part, like sitting on a plank. We will not fly with them again.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The club class we usually take is now priced at $450.00 each. We use this only because of the leg room and supposedly the larger seats. Last year the seats weren't much bigger than the regular seats. We ended up having only pasta type meals. I thought for paying that outrageous money we would get steak but not. We had a small glass of sparkling wine and never offered another. Remember there are only 12 seats in this section so staff are not over worked at all. When we asked for some little snacks the staff looked at us as if we had 2 heads. We each in that 4 hour flight got 2 drinks and we had to ask for the second ones. There is nothing in the package that is worth that much money other than to select your seats, a bit more luggage and not even the best service. You had to ask for everything. I felt for that price, we should have had more drinks and a real good meal. Don't ever book club class as it's really not worth the money or the time. Unfortunately, they have gouged all of us that travel because of this club class.

Going from Manchester I thought Option Plus would have boarded amongst the first passengers but myself and others were disappointed as we were not called first. My return journey was hell. I booked a seat and of the three seats in front one was empty and a passenger from the middle seat moved in front of me and at once put their seat back. The passenger would not put up the seat for me to eat my meal. I asked the air hostesses to ask them to put their seat up but they refused. They eventually moved the passenger to another seat and asked me to move to the seat in front where they said I would have more room. I did this reluctantly as I had booked the seat I wanted. I moved and the person in front proceeded to put their seat down again. We did not have the next meal as there was too much turbulence, however, the meals were horrendous anyway so not missing much. I did think we should of been allowed a drink. On arrival at Manchester I was delayed as my suitcase was missing. I filled in a form and given a number to ring next day. I rang and was told my bag was in Gatwick. Although I arrived home Tuesday morning I didn't receive my suitcase until Friday after 5.00pm.

My husband and I were a little bit worried about flying with our 9 months old but the staff of this airline made it smooth and memorable for us. From the beginning they made sure we have everything we needed, I wanted hot water before taking off and one of the flight attendants grabbed the bottle and came right back with hot water. Would you like extra blankets? How about a pillow for your baby?  When we got to Toronto airport, we noticed that our baby's stroller is damaged so we seeked guidance in how to make a damage claim. The gentleman filling the report was very understanding and helpful. The next day, after contacting the repair shop that we were referred to by Air Transat, told us that they don't fix the brand of our stroller and we have to contact the airline and get help directly from them. All the agents we spoke to were helpful . The manager contacted me and listened to me explaining the situation and the condition of the stroller and of course asked me to provide and show proofs and within just a couple of days they contacted me and told us they're going to replace the stroller for us.

I have flown Air Transat Club Class at least once a year for many years now and the service and food have changed dramatically. Check-in at Toronto going to Dublin, I had to wait while the Club Class area was used for families. On the aircraft, we waited for quite a while to get service after takeoff and the crew were not very present so I had to get up a couple of times and go to the galley to get what I needed. The crew did not keep economy passengers from using the front washroom, which is supposed to be for Club only. This flight was after 11 pm, so they served a light snack (which was terrible) and then breakfast before landing. Choice of 2 types of omelette or fruit and a bagel. Really? The return flight was no better. On the initial beverage service, I was missed and had to ask for a drink. The food was not very good and the bread was brought around after most people had finished their meals. Again, people from economy used the Club washrooms with no crew checking it.

Boeing 737,Economy Class,2.0,March 2017,2.0,4.0,2.0,no,San Jose to Toronto,1.0," |  Air Transat has taken maximizing the number of passengers they can carry over customer comfort and safety to a new and disappointing level. I was assigned seat 11A which is the row in front of the emergency exit over the wing. As I found my seat, I heard the woman behind me complaining at having paid a $50 premium for the extra leg room that the seats by the emergency exit usually offer. Usually the spacing of the rows is wider to allow access to the door in an emergency. Even Air Transat's website shows the seating by the exits to be this way but on the plane I was on, they removed the seat immediately beside the door but left the two beside it, presumably 12B and 12C. The spacing of the rows appears identical meaning that in an emergency we would have to pass through the seat row to get to the door. It turns out that the extra leg room she paid for is actually just the extra space afforded her by the seats in row 11 being locked in the upright position at all times. In my opinion, there is not enough space between rows of seats for anyone over 5' to assume the crash position they always tell us about in the pre-flight safety announcement. I spent the entire 5 hour flight from San Jose to Toronto sitting straight up with the back of the seat in front of me inches from my face. Three days after the flight I still have a stiff neck. If they are going to charge the people behind me a premium for their increased comfort at the expense of my discomfort, I think they should be passing that money on to me as a discount! I would have passed on the incentive and chosen a more comfortable seat. I was also concerned with my seatbelt. It seemed badly worn. I could pull the belt through the buckle easily. I have my doubts that it would provide much restraint in an emergency. I am not new to flying, and I don't recall ever seeing a belt this loose before but it may be normal. I found it less concerning than the restricted access to the emergency door. The flight attendants seemed stressed and were a bit short with people. I'm guessing it is not a lack of friendliness but more too many passengers per attendant. I cannot comment on the food because credit card is the only accepted method of payment and my card was stowed below. How can you force your customers to buy their meal and then not accept cash? Check the size of your carry on bags. Air Transat's maximum dimensions are smaller than those allowed by many carriers. My industry standard bag was one inch too long when you included the wheels. They say on their website that if you bring your bag onto the plane and it doesn't meet their dimensions you will be charged $75 to check it vs $25 to check it during check in. They didn't push it in my case but the threat is still there. Profit over safety is no way to run an airline. Spend the extra money on an airline that takes your comfort and safety seriously. When I was shopping flights, the difference between Canada's major airline and Air Transat was $25. After spending two weeks in Costa Rica and feeling so relaxed, winding up with a stiff neck that has lasted three days on my return flight has been very disappointing. I would not recommend Air Transat.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

This makes all the difference and thanks to them my overall experience was positive and pretty much in line with what I'd expect from a budget transatlantic crossing. Forewarned is forearmed though. I would advise buying a sandwich before or eating in the airport rather than going for the Euro Bistro menu as it really is horrible. And make sure you have your own entertainment packed.

Flight was delayed twice. The second time the flight was delayed, everyone was sitting at the gate waiting for the 1630 delayed departure. Air Transat changed the time to 1830 without informing the passengers waiting. I just happened to notice the change while walking into the airport. I asked the gate agents if that was in fact correct, I was told to ""wait for an announcement"" The ""announcement"" came approximately 20 minutes later. A $100.00 voucher was told would be given to passengers. As of 8 days later, no voucher. Note, this voucher would be given for another flight on Air Transat, not sure who would want to deal with them again. After paying $1000.00 to upgrade to Club Class, Air Transat decided to bump passengers from economy to club who were complaining. One couple who complained the loudest got a free ride in Club beside my family's $1000.00 upgrade - really fair. The best part came on departure in Cancun. They did not have our meals we ordered. So after paying, my child had no meal. He was given bread to eat. Please note, that this flight was during dinner time. Baggage in Toronto was just as bad. 90 minutes for bags to come to baggage hall. Priority bags did not come out first, in fact they came out last. What a waste.

When it came to meals, they practically threw the 'food' on our trays like we were pigs on a truck.

My wife got a vegan/vegetarian meal on both directions which looked and tasted awful and were served 25 minutes before everyone else and the drinks. My kids meals got screwed up and my meal was nice and cool on the way out but the beef with mash potato was not bad on the way back. Don't expect iPad or samsung devices to get wifi unless you pre down load an app or have a degree in overcoming your Android settings to allow it to work. The icing on the cake for me was the £65/$115cd I was charged for a picture that was 20"" x 20"" and weighed 5kg at Glasgow check in. First if you are a Canadian resident but travel on UK passports don't expect to be able to check in coming into Canada. So no way to check excess bag prices or add one. Straight away female is up to me and asking if it was an extra bag....egh no it's a bubble wrapped picture 1 inch wider than the carry one cage thing. Sorry £65 please. So she explains it to the supervisor I asked to see who walks up and does not even try and be nice with a ""How can I help"" just walks up and say ""I'm the supervisor"" on good start thanks. So our bags weights were 20/18/15 and 18, you are allowed 23kgs, well under our hand luggage were all small body bags. I asked could I just carry the picture and have it put into the hold at the door like the strollers etc - no it's a bag Sir, no it's not a bag it's a picture, no it's an excess bag sir. Then I'm told if I had gone As an Options or club customer I would have got an extra bag! Oh thanks that's great advise for a young family on a budget. Bottom line is I won't fly with them again and I will do my Mexico trips through Costco. So congrats Air Transat your $110/£65 has in fact cost you $3500 for next year's transatlantic flights and $6000 for my Mexico trip in the spring. Did I mention left late and arrived late both ways which according to the latest results is Transat speciality - dead last on the list I saw.

Instead of being honest from the start, they had us wait around the luggage claim for over 3 hours, insisting that the luggage was coming. After they finally admitted it was not, we had to wait in a huge line to claim the luggage. Again, zero assistance even with a screaming baby. We were called and told the luggage was on its way, it never arrived. It took several phone calls and arguements for them to finally bring out luggage, which supposedly was there the whole time.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,March 2017,2.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Porto to Montreal via Toronto,2.0," |  Porto to Montreal via Toronto. Air Transat is the 'work-horse' of airlines. For a lower price, I don't get 'frills' nor do I expect any. My review is to complement the staff on both my outbound and inbound flight. They are polite, service-oriented and efficient. There were quite a number of passengers on the flight that were pressing the call bell excessively. The flight attendants were gracious and helpful. I could not believe their patience, especially with some unruly passengers who refused to sit down when we were going through turbulence. I just wanted to give a thumbs up to the professional crew. Will continue to use Air Transat in the future.",Family Leisure,5.0,3.0
nan,Economy Class,2.0,August 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Vancouver to Amsterdam via Toronto,1.0," |  Vancouver to Amsterdam via Toronto. The worst experience. Apart from the inflight service which was pretty low, we did not get our sport luggage on arrival back home and it's impossible to talk to someone who knows and obtain information about our luggage. It is a nightmare and the company doesn't seem to care. We are left with numbers and email addresses that do not answer and no idea of where our luggage is. I presume it's lost and therefore we are looking into compensation. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A310,Economy Class,1.0,August 2017,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Toronto to Lisbon,1.0," |  We left Toronto for Lisbon and because of baggage strike the plane got delayed 2.5 hours. Plane left without our baggage, and we had to wait 5 hours at Lisbon airport to give info to lost baggage. There was no Air Transat rep to be seen at all. Baggage took 2 days to arrive at the hotel. The food on the plane was awful.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Manchester to Toronto,1.0," |  Manchester to Toronto. Really bad airline to fly. Selected my seats and when went on the plane, some other family was sitting on our seats and when I complained they did not help me at all. I was looking forward for my Canada trip but the start of the journey was very bad and I had to sit on the other seats from my family and my 2 year old son always liked to come to my seat but I could not do that. It made worst when coming back, I selected extra leg room seats and they did not give me that -I booked the seats but they did not give that too and there was not anyone who can help us. I did not want to argue so I just sit at the given seats but I decided that I will never fly with this airline. I travelled a lot but did not have such an experience before.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,August 2017,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Vancouver to Manchester,3.0," |  This was my annual round trip to visit my family in BC. Have done this trip most years since 1989, so have used a motley collection of airlines. Of them all, Air Transat was the first one I said I'd never use again, back in 2001, but have now been stuck with it for the past three years since it took over my non-stop route. This year was an improvement on last. The food was actually edible for a change. Everything was on time. There were no passport queues when I entered Vancouver. There were no check-in or security queues when I departed Vancouver. The flight was comfortable. The crew were efficient (although I do miss the entertaining Canadian crews of the other airlines). The inflight entertainment was ok with a choice of 30 films. I was not very keen on the purple ceiling lights. It was only in the bathroom did you realise you were on an old plane - the cabin fully refurbished but the wash basins - the old crackle cream ones - were a dead giveaway. Happy to fly with them again.",Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,August 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Glasgow to Calgary via Toronto,2.0," |  Glasgow to Calgary via Toronto. Of the 4 flights on our return journey only one plane was decent - newish, roomy enough, seat back entertainment system. The other 3 planes were old, cramped and no seat back entertainment which isn't good for a transatlantic flight. Baggage took ages to arrive. We sat on the plane for over an hour in Toronto waiting to depart. On our return the flight that was meant to depart Toronto at nearly midnight was delayed 1.5 hours which is hard going when travelling with a 5 year old child. Most of the staff were pleasant though especially 2 of the female cabin staff who helped me when I fainted on the first better aeroplane. This has not happened to me for years so it was unexpected.  They also switched the scheduled type of aeroplane at the last minute on one of our flights probably as not enough bookings so we got a TERRIBLE plane from Toronto to the UK. Never will we fly Air Transat again.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,August 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,Calgary to Amsterdam,2.0," |  Calgary to Amsterdam. I found such a bargain with direct flight to Amsterdam, also with 7 hours between flights on the way back via Vancouver I would be able to set several business meetings with my partners. Oh, was I wrong! The results are: I had to pay nearly $1000 for additional flights, nearly missed my conference, had to cancel my meetings in Vancouver, and from Vancouver to Calgary flew in so old aircraft. if you are going to use the service of Air Transat, be warned: the plane may be late 1-3 hours; customer service does not care about you and refuse to help you. The company is so badly organized, that one hand does not know what the other does: for example, we were told to take our luggage in Vancouver and give it back to Transat desk worker, who was supposed to check it in again. We spent an hour running all over the airport trying to find one Air Transat worker. No luck: they did not know that their own plane was late 2.5 hours and left. Later, they asked us to pay again for luggage, because ""we kept it for too long"".",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0
A330-200,Economy Class,3.0,July 2017,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes,London Gatwick to Vancouver,4.0," |  Flew London Gatwick to Vancouver. Air Transat is exactly what it says on the tin - it's North America’s best leisure airline. It leads WestJet and Rouge, and probably isn't as good as Air Canada or British Airways, but I saved 400 CAD / 250 GBP by flying with them. On both the outward and return leg, I pass chaotic check-in desks for other airlines to find no queue on Air Transat. Easy and fast. While Transat are not in the Gatwick Connects scheme, you can use it to self-connect to other airlines on arrival (only) at Gatwick. I connected to easyJet very smoothly (max 6 hours later) which saved me taking by bags to a different terminal and queuing up to check in again. This option was cheaper than the other connections I could have booked, all of which involved late night arrivals at both ends. The plane was clean and new with mood lighting. A couple of the seats had issues - on one occasion a passenger near me had a faulty headphone jack so they upgraded him to Option Plus (comfort kit, free alcoholic drinks) and gave him the gourmet meal. On another occasion, the passenger reported a headrest issue and as there were still 15 minutes before departure, they had a couple of mechanics come and fix it. Basic but passable hot meal (with one free glass of wine or beer) as well as a pizza slice on the way out. On the way back, the meal was a choice of hot sandwich and the snack was a small slice of carrot cake, filling but a bit cheap on a 9-hour flight. Still, I could have upgraded to the gourmet meal for C$25 each way and then I would have eaten better than on AC/BA economy and still saved. Also, my fellow passenger had the Option Plus wine which was much nicer than the free stuff. Again, if it's important to you, you pay a little extra and you can get it. The crew were nice on the outward flight and polite enough on the inward leg, but I senses some morale issues. Inflight entertainment on screens - not a great selection (39 movies, 20 or so music artists, a small selection of TV shows) but you didn't have to download an app and stream it on your own device (WJ/Rouge) and everyone also gets a USB port for charging. Flights delayed by about 30 minutes on both occasions. All in all, I would always choose a full service carrier if the prices were the same. That being said, I'm thankful that Transat has broken the monopoly. With so many things you can upgrade (before or during the flight), you can basically choose the flight you want and the price you want.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,August 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Toronto to Cancun,1.0, |  Toronto to Cancun. Been to Mexico so many times with different airlines but this has been the worst experience ever with Air Transat. I had the worst experience with the cabin crew as I was waiting for 2 hours to get a glass of water after asking so many times and got a bad attitude from the crew. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,August 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Toronto to Montreal,1.0," |  Toronto to Montreal. The most horrible experience ever. This 1 hour flight turned into a 5 hour nightmare. The flight was suppose depart at 6pm but due to fuel issues got pushed back. Apparently the fuel was delayed and they missed their slot on the runway so it got pushed to 8:30pm. That was not the end of the nightmare. After arriving at Montreal airport, they inform us that there was a mixup with the luggages and we ended up waiting 3+ hours for our luggages. The crew didn't know what was going on and there was no communication whatsoever. Can't believe such a short flight can be such a hellish experience. I fly frequently and have never experienced such travesty from any other airlines. Air transat was the first airline I tried and I thought it should be fine since it's a short flight but boy was I wrong.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
A330-300,Business Class,5.0,June 2017,3.0,3.0,5.0,no,Gatwick to Toronto,3.0," |  Gatwick to Toronto. Was nearly an hour late departing. My wife and I had club class seats 2A and 2C, the seats were quite wide but the legroom in row 2 was very poor for the price. The option plus seats on the row behind had far more room than us. If you can be sure to book the first row as you can stretch out as much as you want. The heat on the aircraft was ridiculous made worse as there are no personal air vents above your head, be sure to bring plenty of water on board as you will need it. Waiting to take off at Gatwick and coming in to land at Toronto was so hot I thought I was going to pass out! I have never experienced this before on any other flight that I have taken. Food and on board is included in the price, you are advised to pre-book your meal by the airline as if you don't you will have to have whatever is left. Personally I thought that this was a strange thing to do but I guess it's a cost cutting measure. Flight was very smooth with no problems and a good choice of inflight entertainment. There are USB ports on each seat so able to charge gadgets. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Toilets were reasonably clean but could of been better given that they were only being used by 12 passengers and the crew. The flight arrived on time, but had to wait for almost 2 hours at Toronto for our bags as they had decided to put a flight from Glasgow on the same luggage carousel as ours, so had to wait for all of their luggage to be claimed before ours was put on. Think there were 4 or 5 carousels not being used in baggage reclaim area. This wasn't a very pleasant experience as you were stuck with around 400 other increasingly angry passengers in a relatively small space. I'm assuming it was like this because Air Transat are a small airline and only have access to a limited number of carousels. Probably wouldn't use them again unless I had to.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
