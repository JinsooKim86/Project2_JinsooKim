The plane seemed in a very good condition, provided spacious economy seating, had very professional treatment from the ground staff, to the cabin crew, and to the pilot himself who kept us updated at all times, and was able to arrive just on time. The only negative thing I would say is that it lacked entertainment system.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I bought my round trip tickets from the KLM official website to fly from Dulles airport to Nairobi and back. I'm a green card holder but my 2 children that flew with me (ages 3 and 11) are American citizens. Flying into Kenya had 1 connection stop at Paris CDG which went fine. Our return flight had 2 connections, Paris and Amsterdam which, to my greatest shock, is not okay with a green card but is ok with an American passport. I requested to have my children fly as unaccompanied minors while I reschedule my flight at extra fees bit I was denied that. All I was told is to exit the airport go home until I could raise enough money to buy new tickets with 1 connection in Europe or reschedule our flight at $817 each to fly the next morning. So, I had to pay an additional $1634 for my children that were in time and didn't need visas to make 2 connections in Europe.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Bangkok-Amsterdam with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Friendly crew. The food was good with a locally cooked pad thai for lunch. Wine was served, in small bottles, which makes a nice change compared with the wine served straight in plastic glass. You could ask for more, without being given the usual nasty stare. Another meal was served 3hr before landing, nice potato salad with raviolis in tomato sauce. Rounds of drinks were provided during the flight. The IFE was OK.

Boeing 737,Business Class,5.0,July 2018,4.0,3.0,nan,yes,London to Amsterdam,3.0," |  KLM is a very efficient carrier in terms of its online check in and customer service interface. However the ground service at London was very poor, so were its lounges. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 4 was a nightmare. Despite being a Sky Priority member traveling on business class the queue was long. Later I realised there was technical issue with the luggage belt in the business class check in section. No explanation was given and there was no attempt to serve business class passengers using economy class check in. The Skyteam lounge in T4 was also very poor. It is a very boring and dated lounge and the F&B offers weren’t great. It was far inferior to the Plaza Premium lounge on the other side of the airport. It was very disappointing to see a substandard Skyteam lounge considering they have so many flights out of T4. The service inflight is what really makes KLM a reputable airlines. The crew were chatty and extremely friendly. Everyone received a warm welcome – not only for business class passengers. Breakfast served was decent – fresh juice, good quality yoghurt and warm pastry. Returning journey was as good as outbound. Skyteam (KLM) lounge 52 was large but very basic considering its KLM’s hub. It felt like a waiting room in a large train station. Gate at Schiphol was crowded and boarding was late, but ground staff were friendly. Crew in the cabin again was first class and very elegant. Unfortunately my luggage didn’t arrive in Heathrow, perhaps due to the short connection (1 hour) in Schiphol. The queuing system at luggage enquiry wasn’t great but the handling agent was very sympathetic and knowledgeable. I was united with my luggage later in the evening so nothing to complain!",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

One among our teenage children is a minor. Apparently, we are required to carry a birth certificate for minor children regardless of being on a US passport, to enter South Africa. KLM did not inform us (1) at the time of booking with their Skyteam partner, Delta, on delta.com (2) during online check-in on klm.com and (3) during check-in at O'Hare. Imagine our shock when they did not allow us to board the Amsterdam to Cape Town flight! What followed was a 48 hour nightmare where KLM showed that they did not care about us as customers. Eventually, we did continue our trip after a lot of welcome help from Delta and a lot of personal cost borne by us. The true worth of an airline shows up when things do not go to script. KLM showed that it has neither the technology, nor the process, or the people to operate as a customer-oriented international airline in the 21st century. Shame on you, KLM, for not taking accountability for your deficiencies and for putting us through hell. KLM does not deserve to be on SkyTeam, and in fact should go extinct just like the 747s it continues to fly from US to Amsterdam or its time honored tradition of skimping on meal service.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

I checked my email and I had already received an email telling me that I had been automatically re-booked onto another flight, which was an awful red-eye overnight journey via Munich - the last thing that I wanted to do after just getting off another 12 hour flight. I went to the Air France/KLM help desk and the kind lady there managed to change my auto-booking to a convenient early morning, direct flight on Air France. She also organised a hotel for the night close to the airport, meal, shuttle and food vouchers, and an amenities kit. The wait time for all this was not too long — maybe less than half an hour — quite good given that there were quite a number of people stuck there. Even though it was quite annoying that I arrived a day late in Amsterdam, I was satisfied with the overall service of Air France/KLM and the way they handled the cancellation.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

The check-in at Schiphol airport was very efficient, although the attendant that served me was not friendly. The food on-board was quite good. I ordered a gluten free meal and this was tasty and included a GF bread roll, which is a rare bonus. They also offered me a drink at the same time as they served my special meal, which doesn't usually happen - quite a nice touch. They brought plenty of drinks out throughout the flight. I thought the seat was really comfortable for economy class, with a good head rest, and unusually for me I even managed to sleep for an hour or two. The flight attendants were quite warm and friendly and graciously obliged my requests for extra drinks and snacks. Were were given hot wipes (disposable towels) in the morning before landing. The entertainment was also quite good, with user interface being one of the simplest and easiest to use in my experience, although I think that there is room for improvement with their range of TV shows. The pilots gave several clear updates throughout the flight, which I always appreciate. Plane landed basically on time. Overall a good experience!",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

The flight left slightly later than scheduled due to the late arrival of the aircraft. This flight is a 5th freedom flight from SIN to DPS as the flight originated in AMS. I was In seat 1A and was very impressed with the seat. Highly adjustable to whatever position you want. There is power available to charge your electronics. The seat was a little dirty but I put this down to it not being the first flight and the tight turnaround, nothing abhorrent. The only downside is the immovable ottoman footrest. If you are under 5’7” you may struggle to reach it. The inflight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies and tv shows as well as an interactive map showing you the route. It was much more responsive than other IFE systems that I have used recently and the remote is touch screen which helps a lot. The food was respectable for such a short flight, with two choices for the main, either chicken or beef with all the trimmings. Altogether when the salad and desert it was very tasty and the crew kept filling up drinks and offering bread rolls. I was surprised to get a meal on this flight but I was glad I did. The crew themselves were very happy which was pleasant and they were very attentive. The KLM houses were a unique experience as no other airlines do this. I got house number 28 and it is filled with a Dutch Gin. Overall it was a nice flight compared to the competitors on the route and was very well priced for a business product.

As a general rule the long-haul flight went well - on time, very comfortable Economy Comfort seats, friendly and attentive cabin crew, plus very smooth connections via Schiphol. However, I must agree with an earlier poster here that KLM's catering department does appear to have lost the plot a bit, at least in tourist class, with meals featuring very fatty chicken. (This had happened to me before with KLM, as I mentioned in an earlier post in this forum about a year ago). At least they did do two drinks-trolley runs, which were much appreciated. If they'd just pick up their game a bit on inflight meals, these annual trips of mine via Amsterdam to the Baltics would be close to perfect.

Through the Dutch media we were warned that Amsterdam Schiphol airport should be overcrowded. Through the KLM website we received the advise to arrive at the airport 3hrs before departure. Since we can use the Skypriortity fast track services at this airport we took our chance and arrived 2 1/2hrs before flight and slipped through luggage drop-off and security in less than 15 minutes! Boarding was efficient and on time, on board we were welcomed by the crew who had the time for a chit-chat with all passengers while boarding. The flight departed and arrived well on time. The onboard service consisted of a warm sandwich and a drink followed by a 2nd round when muffins were distributed. We had exit seats (pre-booked) which are the best seats on the plane with tons of legroom. Disembarkation in Lisbon was OK but we had to wait over 30minutes for our luggage to arrive on the belt.

The hand luggage was taken from me when I was already on the plane due to lack of space: it has not arrived to destination and the risk is that it has gone lost. Tthe 2 connecting flights were both operated by KLM but they did not manage the delay and did not organise any transfer in Amsterdam that make sure that we would not miss our flight. Many travelled complained since many connecting flights were not managed and people had to stay overnight in Amsterdam. While staying overnight I was not allowed to have my hand luggage back. In the end such hand luggage didn't reach the final destination and since the ticket on the suitcase was handwritten (done onboard as explained). I really doubt it will ever get back to destination. Last but not least the personnel in the planes and in the airport was always very unfair and it was impossible to speak to a responsible manager. It's the 3rd time I have this same kind of adventure with KLM. I strongly recommend to choose another company I will never fly KLM again.

The cockpit crew did a good job and managed to make up for some time and arrived in Amsterdam slightly earlier which gave me an hour to transfer to a JFK bound Delta flight instead of 30mins. The cabin crew was pleasant and efficient. There was some light snacks available in the galley although the food portions for the 2 meal service seem a little light. I did see quite a few hungry passengers approaching the cabin crew for food about 8-10 hours into the flight. The meals were satisfying and had a decent variety of items. I took the exit row seat (50K) against the wall (no windows). The seats seem cramped. Whenever the gentlemen next to me unfold his arms, his arms would come into my seat area and rest over my arms. This is not a case of his arms resting on the shared arm rest but a case of the arms coming past the armrest into my seat area. I put it down to the seats being placed too close next to each other which made for a very uncomfortable 13-14 hours flight. I'm 5'6"" and not overweight so I don't think I was too large for my seat.

KLM planes are generally old and uncomfortable but on short flights that is not a problem. On longer flights (I flew to South Africa 4 times this year), I would not recommend them. The staff in almost all cases is friendly and will do all they can to make the flight bearable. But don't try to complain to KLM customer service, they are the worst in the industry and will ignore your request or simply insult you in their answer. I think KLM quality is going down over the years.

I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380.  However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet.

This is probably the last time I take KLM, especially for long distance; I only did because I have flying blue and wanted the miles (not that being a FB customer for 10 years has brought me any tangible benefits). KLM is basically a low-cost, Ryanair style carried which pretends to be a proper airline. On this 10-12 hour flight, the seat in front of me was broken, so the guy was basically in my knees, as there is no legroom to start with on these horrid, narrow seats, where you will also jostle for the armrest. Food was simply awful, though less bad coming back from Hong Kong; I know the Netherlands are not a culinary hotspot but they could have made an effort, this was canteen food, everything shrink-wrapped in cellophane and unappetising to say the least. There was also way too little food on the way back, and no advertising of the measly sandwiches available in the galleys (only one choice though, slightly musty Dutch cheese and butter, healthy!). The stewardess seemed reluctant to give them away, does she take them home at the end of service? Entertainment system is ancient, not even touchscreen, with small, pixellated screen and a pathetically poor selection of movies and other stuff; really bad!

Wine selection was good enough to try various kinds of wines including ports wine as a desert wine. Entertainment was basic, there is a room for improvement with more channels and movies.

To find some sleep in this narrow situation is difficult. The legroom in the extra legroom economy is fine and the recline of the seat helps. In my opinion this is worth the money. The new entertainment system in the 777-200 was fine and they had a nice collection of films and shows. The flight attendants were friendly and nice. Boarding in Cape Town as complicated and inefficient. There is so much space in the hall but they have to do it right in the smallest corner.

On the way out I had just carry-on luggage and made my connection at the last minute. On the way back I managed to reach my connection, but my check luggage did not, which was not really surprising. It was delivered the next day. Used Web check-in which working fine and KLM allows to pre-select seats during the reservation process at no extra cost. Checked luggage is charged extra, but prices are reasonable (EUR 10 per flight).  FA´s friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable for the length of the flights. Drinks served including beer and wine, with additional drinks on request. A cheese sandwich with no alternatives served on the inbound flights to AMS and biscuits/crisps on outbound legs. Forget the food, but the drink service was okay. Not a bad inflight product for European standards. However, room for improvement operational wise (delays and lost luggage). I had pretty much stopped flying KLM 10 years ago when service quality decreased and their previously good frequent flyer program became rubbish.

Our final destination was Quito. In Amsterdam uninterested staff in the transfer area. We could not get our Boarding passes from KLM for the flight from Lima to Quito with TAME, a carrier unknown to us. Our luggage was to be sent directly to Quito with the same flights. Onboard this KLM flight, the cabin was old but the service was OK. Inflight we were told that a person would meet us and help us with the transfer in Lima. Nobody turned up so we had to find the gate for TAME by ourself. That was not open so we went to KLM gate for the returning flight, they knew nothing and were not interested to help us. Eventually we received our Boarding passes at the gate, Economy class as this was the only provided, we were not informed of that. In Quito, were we arrived 7 hours later than our original shedule, our luggage was missing so we made a search with help of a serviceminded person of TAME. The day afterwards we e-mailed KLM and asked them to contact us, they did not. Next day I called them and was told that our luggage was not their business any more but it was up to TAME to find out were it was, they did not intend to follow-up on this. In our hotel we had wonderful staff that called the airport a lot of times and at last, 40 hours after arrival we got it delivered to the hotel (sent from Lima by LAN Chile). The baggage tags were left and we could see that KLM had not redirected the luggage, no wonder that they were not transported properly. KLM has put a new standard to their device ""Sky Priority"": For a little more money we make your trip much more exciting.

That means that half the aircraft didn't get the meal they wanted and got stuck eating a vegetarian meal that was absolutely sub par! Bland and just nasty. I really don't understand how a airline can stiff half the aircraft's passengers with one of the most importent parts of the flight, the food.

Captain walked through the business class cabin, looked a little tired and dour, but thought nothing of it. The replacement crew for the Singapore to Amsterdam leg was seated in business class with us, creating a sense of calm and well-resourced and relaxed crew. Seats are the new World Business Class with full flat bed. I didn't use that feature, but definitely clicked it down to about 60 degrees to rest after my third glass of wine. The cabin amenities are great. Good food. Wine selection is incredible. I chose an Argentinian red that really kept its spice at 35,000 feet. Weather looked like we should expect quite a few bumps, but we emerged from 10,000 climbing out of Bali and captain immediately took off the seat belt sign and we cruised along quite smoothly and silky for most of the two hours of level flight. There was one moment of lightning and big hammer tops, but captain and first officer artfully wiggled around them picked up speed and got us into Singapore 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Cockpit messages were brief and not very informative, but that's okay. Professional and cool and was happy that they were clear and gave all the details about arrival and weather. For the most part this is just a lovely luxury shuttle from Bali to Singapore.  I felt relaxed, calm and really satisfied with the service. I've used it three times since I learned about this route. Something about being in those big blue planes makes you feel respected and appreciated. Cabin crew was great and ratio of passenger to flight attendant was good.

We experienced very good customer service from the KLM social media team who resolved an issue with a inexplicable change to our inbound flight very quickly, and they were extremely responsive and helpful. The outbound flight was very good - we found there was more leg room than on a lot of flights. The entertainment was excellent with latest movie releases and good TV system. The staff were efficient and food was fine. With our inbound flight, we received an email 24 hours before the scheduled flight time stating that our flight from KL to Amsterdam was delayed by 4 hours - meaning departing at 0320 and missing our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Leeds - not good. The email stated nothing about what KLM were going to do about this, so we immediately phoned the customer service team. The lady we spoke to very quickly made alternative arrangements for us - by booking us on a completely different flight with Malaysia Airlines to London and then BA from London to Leeds - this solution meant departing at the same time as the original booked flight, and getting back to Leeds slightly earlier than with the original booking - so we were delighted with this solution and the way it was arranged so promptly, with email confirmation coming through straight away. Our only gripe is that fact that the original email was lacking in information and we had to call the customer services team rather than them proactively communicating the alternative option to us. All in all I was impressed with the quality of the outbound KLM flight and the excellent customer service received at various points throughout our experience with this airline.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

I flew on Emerates on the same route last month and was happy to see foldable armrests. In another matter, I was told at the gate the Nairobi to Amsterdam flight was completely full, but there was one seat available in business and I might be lucky to get upgraded. I was seated in one of the best economy comfort seats 17C. Great, after take off the stewardess approached me saying she can offer me a more comfortable seat. Having flown extensively with KLM over many years, this normally means an upgrade to business. I took my stuff and followed her only to be shown a seat behind the bulkhead, which had absolutely no foot or wiggle room. It was one of the worst seats on the plane with a crying baby right next to me. When I tried to get my great 17C seat back it was already occupied.

First you go all the way to 1 end of the airport for check-in (the AF area), then you are sent all the way accross to the other end. There, 45 min queuing for security as there is one lane and no Sky Priority. Logically KLM flight should be handled with the AF terminal, where all is clear. After 45 min waiting the gate is not indicated, then you reach the gate where the personnel moves to another one (just telling a few pax around). At the gate, the AF personnel did not bother organising the flow, did not set the Sky Priority lane and just boarding randomly.

It has been the first time I flew Business class on KLM and my experience was somehow disappointing mainly because of the seat confort and the disappointing onboard gastronomical experience. Very surspisingly KLM didn't offer on this 11 hour flight a full flat seat which should be a standard today for a 4 star airline. The seat did not completely recline in horizontal position, which made sleeping very difficult and unconfortable. As I complained to the cabin crew, they told me that on various KLM planes there are still the old business class seats (as the one I was in). So, be aware when booking KLM business class because you could experience a very unconfortable night flight without much sleep as I had. I also found the catering experience disappointing. The food quality of the main course was not good, meat was dry and hard. It looked like an economy class meal, just heated up and presented in nice porcelane. I don't like neither the way food was served in business class as flight attendant serve it from the usual economy class trolleys and they still serve you a plastic (I guess it was hard plastic) tray on your table. I found it a real lack of class, KLM should really improve the way they serve this dishes to its guests in the business class. The quality of the coffee served on board was undrinkeable. IFE should be updated to todays standard. Its not user friendly, it looks old and the choice could be better. The staff is very friendly, helpful and caring about its guests, they really like to interact with the passenger. The quality and personnality of KLM flight attendants is probaly what makes KLM so unique. On the short leg from Amsterdam to Guayaquil everything was perfect. A good and tasteful light meal was served and again the staff was very nice and caring. VIP Lounge in Guayaquil is of really poor quality. It looks old, somehow dirty, food choice is not that much great as there is a lot of junk food and you have to pay for alcoholic drinks. However KLM offers a welcome beer or a glass of wine to its passenger which is very appreciated. To summarize I would say that KLM has a very good product for shorthaul and transatlantic economy class whic defeats many of its competitors. However KLM should really speed up in updating its Business Class experience because they do not have a competitive product today. For me it was not good value for money.",Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0

I had the pleasure of flying its brand new 787 from Osaka to Amsterdam and what a pleasure it was. The cabin lay-out is similar to what is found in other upmarket companies like EVA Air, with all the latest gadgets, including wifi on board. Checking in Osaka was standard, straightforward and fast, but the line for security was long. The lounge was nice and well-catered, but a bit cramped. Boarding was smooth and well-organised. The inflight service was excellent - good catering (both Japanese-based on the recipes of the famous Yamasato restaurant at the Okura in Amsterdam and western), and portions were copious. The atmosphere in the 787 cabin is very pleasant. However, staff hinted that there was little space for them in the pantries and that this hindered them in providing the desired service levels - not noted by me, at least. The flight departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. With the upgraded cabin lay-out in its old 747s and its 777s, KLM is now scoring high among its European competitors. Transit at Schiphol airport was smooth. And at the end of the flight I was lucky that Delft bleu house 96 was on board, so I have my collection complete again.

On the shorter Newcastle sectors we were served a small cake and a drink, and the longer hop to Madrid a hot pizza. Bags were rapidly delivered. They were trialling the new AirFi system on the Madrid route - it wasn't internet access, but streaming entertainment, games and news loaded on which you could access with your wifi device - a great idea. Amsterdam was easy to navigate (much more than CDG or LHR).  The transit into/out of the Schengen area  without any  queuing.

Outbound lost connection and inbound nearly lost the connection as the gates of European and International flights are on opposite sides and there's at least 20 min walk + passport control. With the congestion of high season passengers should make sure that they have at least 2 hours for each connection. This is the only fault I found with KLM. Short connections flights should not be sold in my opinion. Apart from this, I flew with the B787 Dreamliner, a different story of comfort in Y class. Meal (sweet and sour chicken) wasn't exceptional, but the snack (quiche) was quite nice. Cabin crew is excellent. Couldn't expect any better.

I enquired why and he said that in business and first they are on the seats and I'm flying in economy where they are never given out prior to departure. Weird that I have always had them before waiting for me (so did their sister air France). The worst aspect was the seat. Absolutely no leg space. I have rather average legs for a female and there wasn't enough space for them. And the seat did not recline. I fly on a weekly basis and annually board long haul flights multiple times and have never experienced such discomfort on a plane. Worst of all, upon reviewing the flight the reply to the complaint was to imply that passengers in economy get what they deserve when they don't upgrade to a better class. Unbelievable.

I traveled with a second person and we bought our tickets a month before the date. We started at Baltimore and got assigned seats for our Baltimore to New JFK flight as well as the flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam. When we landed in Amsterdam for our travel to Stockholm we were told that we weren't guaranteed a ticket and that we had to fly standby. This made no sense because we had bought our tickets a month ago and because we checked in to all our flights more than 24 hours before the flight to Stockholm. After much drama and waiting, we ended up getting seats but not sitting together. After more than 24 hours of travel and hundreds of dollars spent on these tickets it was a huge disappointment to not be able to sit next to my partner. We definitely were not the last ones to buy the tickets or to check in at the airport. The staff didn't have a good explanation and while they were friendly and courteous I am not inclined to fly with this airline again due to their incompetent way of assigning seats. This was too stressful and there are dozens of other airlines to choose from. In summary I felt cheated - I did not get what I paid for when traveling with KLM.

Even though the plane is not even two years old (and therefore very clean/crisp), this aircraft still features the old world business class. Since this was a daytime flight this is ok. The service on board was simply spectacular. KLM has invested a lot in the 'be my guest' program, to refocus staff attention on the well being of the customers anfd this is clearly paying of. After the meal service, slept for the remainder of the flight. The Delft blue houses are a unique gift, that adds a pleasant souvenir. Even though we left Schiphol about 45 minutes late.

The general feel of the airplane was that it needs to be updated. The food was ok, the seat and leg room were ok (although the reclining seat was clunky and didn't work very well), the staff was great, but the entertainment part was definitely behind, and there were no plugs for smart phones or computers. First, they didn't provide ear buds. I came prepared and had my own. Even if you have your own, you need to ask for an adapter, precisely because of the age of their entertainment system. Their entertainment system is old (think probably from the early 90s). The colors on the screen were awful and you could barely see anything. I skipped all the major blockbusters in the selection, because watching them in such poor conditions would be ridiculous. The choice of movies was ok, but quite average compared to other modern airlines. On top of all that, my unit was not working properly for the whole beginning of the trip, and because of that, the call button for the staff was also not working. Eventually, I was able to grab someone from the staff and they had to reset the unit. All this to say that, although I would still be ok recommending the airline, it would be with some serious reserves. In an age when connectivity and entertainment have become such important things on a trip, they can ruin a whole part of your journey if they don't live up to modern standards.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

I won't deal with the seats because we all know they are being changed to the new sleeper style (well new to KLM about 10 years behind the industry). Lounge in AMS is excellent with lots of services. All in all a fine experience.,nan,4.0,nan

Cabin crew are committed to making your flight pleasant! The food is delicious. The old planes they were using for this route were too old now with the 777 I felt much better. I recommend that since this is a very long flight that they use their best aircraft's on this route. I also took KLM flights within Europe and had the same good experience.,nan,5.0,nan

Plane appeared to be an early generation 777-200 as the cabin was looking a bit dated and seats a bit worn. Plane was clean though. Food was decent though nothing to rave about. Arrived in AMS and checked the board for my transfer to BRU and all appeared in order. I get to the gate just in time to find out my connecting flight got cancelled because the plane had no crew. KLM offered to bus the passengers on the flight to BRU but I made my own way. KLM provided the usual voucher and an apology. Return flight from MRS to BKK via AMS was fine. On the AMS-BKK leg I was on the same 777-200 but bought the premium economy for this leg hoping to be able to get some sleep. Seat I selected lacked legroom because the seat in front of me had the equipment box underneath it so I had to sit at an angle to stretch my legs. With the exception of getting off the plane first there is little point in buying premium economy. IFE system was seriously dated. Small screen with visual static (it was visible on all the other screens I saw). Hopefully KLM upgrades these when the plane goes through its next D-check. Overall experience wasn't bad but the European carriers need to step it up when the Gulf and Asian carriers offer a superior experience at the same relative cost.,nan,4.0,nan

When we arrived the previously-arranged assistance was there with a young man putting us immediately on the buggy and taking us to collect luggage and out to the station at the back. Could not have asked for better service. On the return trip passenger assistance did not want to know about us. KLM staff in Moscow messed up the luggage and told us they couldn't send it from Moscow all the way through to Brisbane so we had to find it at Schiphol with an 18-hour lay-over and manage it ourselves. One staff member took pity on us and checked our luggage in overnight. Had to beg to have use of the buggy to get to China Southern for departure back to China en route to Brisbane. Although all of this was booked from Brisbane and re-checked all along the way and we had such a good feeling about KLM we felt the attitude of most of the staff was brusque and not helpful.

On my second last flight KLM 705 on April 10 the cabin crew were excellent whereupon KLM 705 June 16 cabin staff were of a very low level. Some staff will do everything so the guest will enjoy the journey while another crew sees the guest mostly as a distraction to their work. Aircraft's are ok but no more a major upgrade is necessary but what really makes the experience of KLM worthy as a choice is cabin crew.

Seat backs were a bit hard but overall 13+ hours in their seats did not feel unbearable at all. IFE was good but the outdated screens could do with an overhaul (777-200). I found the service to be good. The flight attendants were always visible and very attentive. They keep you well stocked up with food and drink during the flights. Yes attendants can be quite terse at times but this was mainly due to passengers ignoring the command to put their seatbelts on during times of turbulence. Elected to upgrade to Economy Comfort on EZE-AMS return leg in order to attempt up get some sleep and to be one of the first to disembark the plane due to a short connection time (45 minutes) and it was worth it.

Lounge shared with 5 Asian airlines looked dated not clean limited food/snacks on offer (instant noodle soup) dirty washrooms and cramped seating. Wifi OK. Boarding chaotic. Priority given to family with small children resulted in 40% of all pax moving forward. On board seating unacceptable as to be expected no lie-flat seats. Food and beverage service just acceptable. Not a fan of a Dutch Winter meal (hutspot) offered in mid-summer. Professional friendly Staff. Offering a non stop YVR-AMS service is a big plus. For me the only reason to choose KLM.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,CWL-AMS-CGK in Business Class: delayed out of Cardiff meant very tight connection in Amsterdam with no time for luggage to be loaded. I was offered a night in Amsterdam but couldn't opt for this due to business meetings in Jakarta soon after arrival. Bought a few clothes which I hope KLM will reimburse me for. Luggage delivered to my hotel room in Jakarta the following night. Service on Cityhopper F70 and B777 good and food reasonable. I thought movie choice a bit limited but music choice adequate. on AMS-KUL I thought the service was only average which was unusual for KLM in my opinion. Allowed to remain on board during brief stop in Kuala Lumpur. Looking forward to return flight in August and being able to fly into Cardiff a regional airport close to my home.,nan,3.0,nan

I was in the business class and have never experienced such uncomfortable seats impossible to lie down normally the bottom of the seat is slanted down so your feet are way down and you can slide - moreover it is so narrow that one arm falls in the alley. During the flight I pointed out to the flight attendant in the business class that there was no more toilet paper and she thanked me and put a new roll you would think she could check the other bathroom no. Some time later I was in that one no toilet paper either both rolls empty. This is not acceptable. Not once did any of the cabin staff make any effort to communicate during the flight with the passengers. They just did what needed to be done and finished (except check the lavatories). Glad I am going back with Air France.,nan,2.0,nan

On return managed to dig up my AF/KLM frequent flyer card to avoid suitcase penalty. All airport staff at LHR and AMS indifferent and suggested it was my fault for carrying a suitcase. As such everyone else did carry cabin baggage only which caused a lack of storage space on board people checking in bags at the aircraft door (with no charge) and complete chaos on board both flights. Cabin crew good and polite a reflection of Dutch personality. Check in at Schipol airport via a machine for boarding pass then a second long queue to print your own baggage tag (after payment of course) and then load your own bag into machine oneself. Complete chaos again due to people not understanding the process how to stick tags on. Staff rude or indifferent.

Check-in very busy - not enough AF staff at Sky Priority for this busy time of year but managed to check bag all the way to China at the very last minute. Booked economy and got upgraded to Business upon check-in for the CDG-AMS segment. Was initially told they wouldn't be able to provide a meal at check-in and was told again once on-board by an apologetic AF rep who got onboard to inform me personally that there wouldn't be a meal for me. Ended up being served an AF meal which was nice as I didn't expect anything. Some passengers were served a KLM meal while others were served an AF meal which seemed strange somehow and created some confusion with the crew.

A small delay getting security clearance but still onto plane with plenty of time to spare. Service has clearly improved in the World Business class. Food much better than previous trips all served on a stylish black tray. Service good and with a smile. Had a couple of visits from the flight leader. Generally good experience.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,2.0,In general I find the service of KLM terrible. On my last trip from Birmingham England to Amsterdam a stewardess just before we should have begun to taxi for take off came down the isle and said that I was too heavy to sit in an exit row seat and will need to change seats. I am not too heavy the stewardess had called the incorrect name. The other person in the exit row was not much heavier than myself though. The stewardess was followed by the co- pilot who said that we all had to be very quick because KLM was loosing a lot of money waiting. They should not have asked us to leave our seats and they also should not have waited for just before takeoff to do so. I am 6 ft 190lbs. I do not like their seats on their long haul planes. They give me a back ache as it seams that they have a type of lumbar support which I find too low.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,Zurich to Chicago with a layover in Amsterdam. My flights to Chicago were wonderful. They upgraded the plane to a 747 from a smaller aircraft and made announcements on board that after we were in the air they would move people around. I was moved from an aisle seat with 2 people next to me to an aisle seat with 2 empty seats next to me. I found the food service quite good and the flight attendants very friendly. While I would have liked a better selection of movies to watch the amount of TV shows I could choose from made up for it. However the flight home was a bit different. When I checked in at the airport I was given a middle seat although I had specifically booked aisle seats for my entire trip even paying to upgrade when I needed to. After a bit of hassle at the check in counter this was resolved by giving me an aisle seat in the exit row. The exit row seats are very narrow I had to wedge into it and if you were very large it would be very uncomfortable. At take off and landing the flight attendant who sat facing me took away everything on our laps including coats blankets and the boo I was reading. I understand putting bags away but really my coat and book? While the food and service seemed almost as good as the first flight for some reason they kept forgetting to give drinks to my row they would start at the row behind me. I will definitely consider KLM again but they would have to be the cheaper option for me to do so.,nan,4.0,nan

Flight out slightly older 777 seat not that comfortable and screen too small. Flight attendants the best I have met slightly more mature ladies with children so they really know how to help you out with a baby. They took it turns to carry my daughter around the cabin and went out their way to be helpful with food. Schipol airport is the best airport I have ever been to for small children. Dedicated lounge staff changing facilities cots for babies playgrounds all free. Food at Schipol great value and quality. Manchester is awful no help with luggage. no baby facilities welcome to blighty (not). Second flight to Manchester efficient and well run. Flight home was on a very windy day flight had a go around at Schipol. Schipol again fantastic for the little one. We had 90kg of luggage (even a baby bath) and KLM took care of everything for a small fee. Flight home to BKK again outstanding cabin staff (no dumb pretty trolly dollies) 777 though needs a refit.

Same happened on the flight to the US. It was a great flight for someone (like me) who isn't keen on flying! Flying from Norwich is a real bonus for me as I only live 25 mins away from Norwich airport. Bit disappointed in the way back as JFK to Amsterdam was with Delta and although I believe they are part of KLM they weren't anywhere near as good. Meal disappointing and cabin crew not so friendly.

However after getting over the novelty of MD-11 I think KLM should seriously think of replacing them on such a busy long route as Montreal. The seats are excellent and roomy however this is a long trans-atlantic flight and putting an aircraft with no individual IFE's on it is inexcusable.

Unfortunately the flight on 1st was delayed - apparently to replace the co-pilot's seat - long enough to miss the connection. I spent a pleasant night in a hotel. The return journey was also delayed long enough for my luggage to be booked on a flight the next morning. In fact I could have made the connection and was turned back at the gate. (The last flight of the day was already full with a waiting list. Another pleasant night at a hotel). I had as it happens arrived at the airport at about 6.30 am for my 1405 flight so I asked if it was possible to take one of the earlier flights. The answer was 'yes' but there would be a charge I declined the offer. Bearing in mind that problems pile up during the day it must surely be to the airlines advantage to get passengers on their way earlier if possible.

As a Dutch national living between AMS and BUD I had a separate ticket BUD-AMS that same morning connecting in AMS for above mentioned schedule which was booked through Expedia on a separate ticket. 10 days before departure tried to select a seat and modify the travel class for the leg RIO-AMS to Economy Comfort but could not access my booking. Check- in at BUD airport not overly friendly. Even though I had received an email from KLM alerting me that online check- in had commenced hey could not see any other booking and tagged my luggage only to AMS. Re-checked luggage in AMS but they also could not understand or solve issue. Online check-in Rio to AMS opens some 30 hours prior to departure. Tried to check-in and change seat selection and travel class online to no avail. System would only indicate that seat selection is not possible and check-in should be at airport. Eventually changed that during check-in at GIG which was friendly and hassle-free. Flight itself (GIG-AMS leg) was delayed by more than one hour but arrival was only 30 min behind schedule. Seat (first row of economy comfort) is comfortable enough and recline allows for relatively good sleep. Crew friendly attentive and professional. Plane clean. Food and entertainment sub-par.

The Dutch airline may not have the latest in product equipment the planes can be rather old however I love their use of technology and pr to create a wonderful flying experience. Checking in in Amsterdam on my flight to Venice was easy and totally automated. No more humanoids to deal with including baggage drop-off. Online check-in is also very efficient clearly outlining the steps with various additional options given including a last minute upgrade for a fee. The service can be jarring the meal rather simple and the seat very tight (although I have to say that I do like the seats recline angle which is not as straight-up as usual in take-off/landing mode) but perhaps KLM makes up for some of this with clever use of technology and marketing.,nan,5.0,nan

When asking for a drink before the food service they said only after food service - still 45 minutes away. In the mean time at least 20 times they walked passed my seat. The main issue we faced was with our baggage. In New York at check- in one bag was 24.5kg and the other was 18kg. They still forced me to unpack the lighter bag and move 1.5kg to the other bag. I found this utterly irritating especially since the tickets where bought together and our combined allowance was higher. The only answer I got was that its the policy. We took a few days break in Schiphol. There we had an even worse baggage experience at the check in. We used one of those self baggage check in machines because the normal desk had a huge queue. We checked our first bag without a problem but the 2nd bag was 24.2kg. The machine refused to accept the overweight bag and pointed us to KLM staff. Looking at the queue we removed 1kg of clothes and put it in our hand baggage. But what a hassle and that despite that we were far below our total baggage quota for 2 persons.

Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good.

The sandwiches and salad offered for this very short flight came in a very funky Dutch designed box. We had 90 min transit in AMS and paid a visit to their lounge. Very large with ample seating but very little choice of food. Flight to BKK was a B777-200 with the old business class seating. Unfortunately no flat beds on this route at the moment. I could not sleep the whole 10hr journey. That said the crew made up for the flaws. Customers were treated with respect. Although the crew were by age older than most flight attendants that you find on airlines these days their many years of experience showed. They obviously enjoyed doing their duties and did not disappear for the entire duration of the flight only to reappear 2 hrs prior to landing but paced up and down the aisles offering refreshments and snacks. Although the food is not elaborate it was simple and very tasty and was presented in fashionable Dutch designed dishes and cutlery..

Therefore they lull passengers like me into booking with them when we could in fact book a comfort seat with another more reliable airline. Offering me a refund is not acceptable in view of the fact I could have booked with someone else and had a much more pleasant trip.,nan,3.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,Flew AMS-YUL and return on KLM on 14th and 21st February respectively. On the first leg our original plane developed a fault which resulted in a delay of 3 hours. However arrangements were swiftly made to bring in a replacement aircraft (even the same type MD-11 allowing us to keep our original seating assignments). Despite the delay the cabin crew were not grumpy in fact they were very friendly the seats were comfortable and the food delicious - KLM economy class desserts are certainly a cut above the rest. A wide range of in-flight entertainment kept us entertained throughout the flight. Return flight was even better than the first - Cabin crew were brilliant - the food quality was again high all of which contributed to a very enjoyable flight. The plane itself was in good shape - the whole point of the trip was to fly on the MD-11 and we were able to accomplish this with pleasure. We have used KLM in the past and will continue to use and recommend them in future as they can be relied upon to provide superb reliable service and to find solutions to problems swiftly when things go wrong.,nan,5.0,nan

Only thing to complain about is the economy seat on the B777-300ER planes. Jakarta - Kuala Lumpur was a short hop of 1.5 hrs. Everything ran smoothly: check in at Jakarta was hassle free. Onboard a warm meal was served not the best but really good for airplane food. The salad and cake were far too cold. The cabin crew were very welcoming friendly and smiling. Overall the service was very good. I had booked myself a preferred seat (30€) from KLM website in advance. Stop over in Kuala Lumpur was very smooth. Clear announcements made onboard in Dutch and English. Arrival announcements were also made in Indonesian and Malaysian although these were not that comprehensive. Kuala Lumpur - Amsterdam was a 12 hour leg. The cabin crew were excellent. A hot meal and breakfast was served on the flight. After the meal I slept for 7 hours even though the seat was uncomfortable. Economy seats onboard the 777-300ER plane just ruins the day. The seat pitch is 32"" and seat width 17.5"". The seat is a little too hard in my opinion and the recline is just ridiculous. Even the 737 I flew to Helsinki had a superior economy seat compared to the long haul plane. Transfer in Amsterdam was very simple and easy no problems whatsoever. Nice and friendly staff on ground as well even though a little colder service. Amsterdam - Helsinki was a very pleasant flight. Packed flight. The cabin crew were once again very warm and smiling. The food served was two pieces of sandwich which I liked. Seat onboard this B737-800 aircraft was really comfortable and reclined more than onboard the 777.

BCN-AMS was full of noisy Chinese passengers who left the plane extremely dirty after 30 minutes of flight. ""Breakfast"" was a single Edam cheese sandwich no other choice so I could not eat at all.

I was happy to get a good deal for my trip only to realise that now I can carry only one piece of baggage on international flight (Jet Airways still allows two pieces of luggage at same price). YYZ-AMS leg was the most uncomfortable one with hardly any legroom on Boeing 737. Once you fit yourself in the seat it is a mammoth task to pry yourself outside of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers. The seats themselves are pretty uncomfortable too. Thankfully YYZ-AMS leg lasts only 6 hours. I ordered Asian vegetarian meal - big mistake - tasteless food. Dessert contains only few pieces of fruit. The staff seemed ok - not courteous though. They seemed to be doing their duty but customer service is definitely not their focus. AMS-BOM leg was operated by Delta and hence space was not a constraint. Better service than KLM.

First the JFK flight: We flew on the lovely new Boeing 777-300ER on this extremely short transatlantic flight from New York to Amsterdam around 6 hours flight time. After boarding it felt very clean and new just as an airplane should be. After sitting down it was obvious the seats were incredibly small about 17.5"" wide. Luckily I had an aisle seat allowing me to stretch out a little. The crew acted calm and professional and wanted to help anyone in any way possible. After takeoff I watched a quick film and then was presented with dinner. Just before they served us hot towels which was a nice touch. In my case I ordered the vegetarian pasta dish served with rolls. The flight attendant serving the food was very engaging and personable and wanted to know nearly anything about our trip. My fellow students who came on the trip were sure to ask him questions to which he responded politely. After dinner I settled down for a small nap and just about four hours later the cabin lights were turned back on in preparation for landing. A hot towel was once again given to us which helped us clean up for arrival. Upon landing the flight attendants gave a very polite goodbye and sent us on our way very quickly. Afterwards I was sure to thank the gracious flight attendant who had been so polite to which he wished me luck and great fun in my final destination. Then the flight from AMS-ATH: This flight was conducted on board a Boeing 737-800. The seats again were very similar in that they were small. I was stuck with a middle seat in this case but slept soundly. A sandwich was served which doesn't happen on flights domestically in the U.S which gave me a sense of that European spirit. After landing in Athens the flight attendants once again wished us goodbye.

A330-200 for AMS-HAV means much better seat-width than sister-airline Air France's 777-300 used on CDG-HAV a far more comfortable 2-4-2 seating than the 777`s 3-4-3 and of course only half the amount of passengers making arriving formalities in HAV much faster. Still the success-key is the cabin crew and the in-flight service standard. First pre lunch drinks with pringles then a hot towel followed by a good hot lunch (choice of main) and after collecting meal trays: coffee/tea with cognac/liqueur. Ice cream was offered with coffee (and/or drinks) mid-way + several offerings of water/coke/juice through flight and a hot towel again before a new hot snack/meal in good time before landing. All this offered by crew members who seem to enjoy their work. Who can ask for more in economy?

nan,Premium Economy,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,KWI-DMM-AMS-MME Economy Comfort. I have worked in the Gulf for almost 3 years now and have only recently started flying with KLM. I generally use Saudia and have sometimes flown with Air France but I wish I'd decided to try KLM sooner. The caring and friendly service on board is great and the in-flight product is proving to be reliably good. Upgrading to Economy Comfort is definitely worthwhile. Seats 11D and 11G on the A330-200 to Kuwait and Dammam offer amazingly generous legroom. The catering service is the same as standard Economy but the options are interesting and have tasted appetizing. KLM also offers wine and beers once flights have departed Kuwaiti and Saudi airspace and these have been enjoyable. Movies on demand include current releases and the newer aircraft have decent sized seatback TV screens. There is no amenity pack - not even a simple pair of eyeshades and a toothbrush - on the overnight sector. This would make a nice difference when you are leaving the Gulf around midnight and landing at Schiphol at 6 in the morning. The in-flight management of services by the Purser was very polished and as previous reviewers have noted KLM seems to offer a solid choice. I took a connecting flight with KLM Cityhopper to Durham Tees Valley and the service was similarly friendly and professional on a Fokker 70 with two by three seating and the option of extra legroom. Bags were checked from Kuwait right through to Durham and the amenities at Schiphol whilst in transit were high quality. It is worth checking the schedule as some KLM Gulf destinations involve double hops and the order of these will vary from day to day. A flight from Dammam may stop at Kuwait before Amsterdam or call at Dammam en-route from Kuwait. If you board at the first call or leave at the second this will add a good ninety minutes to your journey whilst the aircraft is refuelled and cleaned. Passengers travelling onwards do not have to leave the plane and you can stretch your legs on board before additional passengers take their seats but travelling on the previous or the following day might remove the need for this inconvenience.

Upon online check-in one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear. We had to ring up customer support as the online check in gave no other seating options and asked to change this so that we could sit together. We were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. We were also told if we got to the airport early the check-in staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. We arrived at airport check-in more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. We were also told that we had to pay 30 Euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online (but we couldn't do it online or else we wouldn't have been able to change our seats at the airport!). We discussed our experience with the lady at the check-in desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. So we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 Euro per suitcase. We then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 Euro each to sit in an 'Economy Comfort' seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. Long story short: this two hour flight cost us $900 AUD up front to be seated nowhere near each other. When we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra $120 AUD. Would never ever fly again nor recommend to anybody else.,nan,1.0,nan

Food about average for an international airline. Planes were A330's seats much like Qatar Airways I rarely lay flat but it looked like others were able to. Amsterdam is a very good transit airport and the KLM lounge is very good thought it does not have a great variety of foods (what it has is good). Best part of the lounge for me was the ""deep rest"" room with chaise lounges in carrells in a very dark room with just enough light to get around.

I tracked the punctuality of the flight in the two days before my own and it was five hours late and four hours late respectively so I should have been relieved that we were taxiing only one hour late although my dream of a morning arrival in California was dashed. The reason given was late arrival of the inbound aircraft but with all the flight tracking apps these days airlines are going to have to be more creative with their excuses - our aircraft had arrived from Paramaribo hours earlier and on schedule. New business class seat on KLM is pretty good note that only window seats have a little shelf next to the headrest so I had room for books iPod et al but not sure what aisle pax are supposed to do with their stuff. Food was excellent was sorry they didn't have a spare as I would have eaten it up despite being quite full. Only downside was the crew were not very friendly overall and one in particular was extremely unhappy to be there a lot of hostility on show which is inappropriate given what biz class pax have paid.

I had a terribly uncomfortable seat (15A) in what KLM ironically calls economy comfort class and for which it even charges a premium economy price. The slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff I have ever seen on a flight. There were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. The crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if I had not asked them to turn them off. The cramped seat made sleeping impossible the food was average to poor and served without salt pepper or utensils which I had to request separately.

No such luck the cabin crew told me the roll-out on the 777's won't now start till October. The old business class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration simply isn't what you expect on a premium airline. Also due to staff shortages there wasn't a fast-track channel opened up on boarding.

I am not that big but leg (and knee) space was more than enough (considering it was economy). Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back. I had a good short haul experience (B737-800). Leg space good and nice crew. Nice snacks were served there as well.

Their tickets are overpriced compared to the comfort you get with Middle East carriers. The food is poor. The economy class menu is never changed - you eat the same food over and over again. The food is way below the standard of some other 4 and 5 star airlines. Same goes for the inflight entertainment. Not many new movies lot's of old stuff. And the screens and remote controls are old small and cumbersome. However the crew was as always most helpful and friendly and gave me the feeling of being valued as a frequent flyer and most importantly they got the job done on time. They get you from A to B without any / much delays which these days is more of an exception than standard at most airlines.

DFW-AMS was on-time FA's were very attentive and friendly addressing passengers by name and in at least 4 different languages based on the passengers nationality brilliant crew! WBC seats on the old Airbus 330-200 were tired angle-flats which although comfortable for resting were not comfortable enough for a decent sleep which I consider the most important requirement for a night flight in Business Class. Configuration was old style 2-2-2. IFE was AVOD but screens were again low quality and system has seen better time; e.g. only the third pair of headphones I received actually worked. Meals served were Cajun Tuna and Chicken Tikka Masala (or Steak or Cannelloni) for dinner and Blueberry Pancakes (or Feta Omelette) for breakfast. Food served was ok catering on the flight out of KLMs home base Amsterdam on the way to the US was far superior to the offerings on this flight back. Wine list again nice with some interesting choices out of the box. AMS-VIE was fine and on-time with nothing special to report seats were economy seats with the middle seat left vacant KLM uses a rented lounge facility in DFW which was OK with a good selection of drinks and limited food offerings definitely better than the typical lounges run by the US airlines. KLMs Schengen lounge in AMS was again comfortable again with a decent drink selection and limited food offerings. Transfer in AMS meant walking long distances but was eventless otherwise. Transfer immigration and security control involved considerable less waiting time than I remember from previous instances. I have flown with AA BA AY IB and LX on transatlantic routes over the past years and all featured more modern planes with better business class seating. KLM needs to retire or update these old planes to offer a really competitive transatlantic product. So except for the seating a good flight but due to the old seats far from perfect product for a night flight. Recommended if available at a very competitive price.,nan,3.0,nan

KLM also offers 'economy comfort' which seems to be premium economy but at €180 to upgrade I ignored - you can check out on the seat map if you actually get more room but I looked closely on the way out of the plane and there is no discernible difference in pitch and still a 3x3x3 configuration. IFE was exceptionally poor on this flight - I'm not sure if 2014 has been a bad year for blockbusters but very little worth watching and each TV show only has one episode which is very annoying. Why would you only want to watch one episode is beyond me. Food was pretty decent though and the service attentive so overall a positive flight.

Staff were attentive and often anticipated requests. The meal out of Toronto was fair at best but it always is. Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating. Wheelchairs had to push through with the result that people were stepping on each other. I mentioned this to the KLM attendant at the gate. She told me to write the management.

Every time someone called an attendant you could see several of them jump to attention and immediately attend to the passengers needs. The food was pretty good. My partner got the Dutch style meal and it was always delicious and I kept getting the Asian meal which was just ok. The website said that economy would get an amenity bag but these were missing from our flights so we didn't have an eye mask and toothbrush as we thought they would be provided but they were not. The seats were awful. My partner and I are not big or tall and we are usually quite comfortable in standard economy seats but these were horrible. My knees were touching the seat in front of me and there was a box under the seat in front of me so I couldn't put my feet anywhere. At mealtimes it was difficult to eat because we had to keep our elbows in to keep from elbowing our neighboring passengers. By the end of our going flight we had decided pay for the exit row seats for the return flight (AMS-NRT return). I don't get it because this is not a budget airline but the seats were so tight. There were cheaper airlines flying to Tokyo but we chose this one thinking it would be more comfortable.

IFE good especially - as expected - in audio rock music section which in KLM is among the best in the air. The only complaints are about the seating in B777-300ER. Formerly I have flew the 777-200 with 3x3x3 option and found that very comfortable. The 3x4x3 is not ideal. You could for a small fee get slightly more space for legs but not broader seats and the new arrangements are both narrow and hard. Paradoxically seats in the short-haul B737 are much better.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,4.0,My wife and I flew from Singapore to Bali on 23rd December 2014 - never again. First problem was with an officious male steward who although I knew where my seat was insisted on looking at our tickets telling me that was why he was stood there and then proceeded to direct us to the starboard side of the plane rather than the port side where our seats A + B were which resulted in us having to walk on down the plane on the wrong side and then cut through and then try to walk back up the plane against the flow of passengers to get to our seats. Second problem was on our return flight to Singapore on the evening of the 27th all the passengers were hanging around for hours at Bali airport as there was a problem with the plane. Not a problem until we heard that the flight was cancelled and that we would be moved to hotels. No one who could speak English or Dutch was available to liaise with the passengers to advise us of the arrangements. The crowd sort of drifted towards the exit but no one came to tell us about reclaiming our baggage or times of the buses etc. We then drifted towards to baggage reclaim hall down some service steps and then had to find where the cases were coming in. We then drifted towards the exit and then the fun started. The buses turned up again with no explanation and we were trampled on by the Dutch in their efforts to get on the buses. We eventually got on to a bus. but had to stand with our luggage dumped along the aisles. We then were again trampled on by them in their effort to get into the hotel so we stood back to let them fight it out. We then eventually got our room but no mention of how we were getting back to the airport the following day. We did get a phone call from KLM telling us we needed to be at the airport first thing in the morning to get a flight with Silk Air. We got a taxi back and thankfully the flight went OK no thanks to the very poor communication skills shown by KLM. Problems arise and safety is of course paramount but if there was some one there who could lead the tired passengers through the situation and keep them informed the matter would have been far less traumatic instead it was the blind leading the blind.,nan,3.0,nan

Skyteam lounge at Schiphol was large with plenty of comfy seating with bubbles wine and spirits and snacks. One of the nicest lounges I have visited. Again the flight on 777-200 was on time even a little early pushing back. Although the seats were the older style seats found to be quite comfortable. the recline was not as much as I hoped but still got 5 hours sleep. The staff on board were nothing but accommodating friendly and very efficient chose the Japanese menu to get me off to a good start even had great sakai on board. The return from KIX to AMS was good with a fast check in and efficient pass through customs (although no fast track was offered). The lounge is small but very comfortable with some odd seats looking out over the runway. Flight home was on a 777-300 which had better seating than on flight out. Again the staff were excellent funny and friendly. Could not ask for more. The food was well prepared tasty and very hot. The cabin was almost empty which meant could spread out. Got at least 6 hours of perfect sleep. The flight home from AMS to LHR was on KLM city hopper. Very small plane and it was packed.

Not much choice on the IFE but for me it was enough. The crew was very attentive and friendly. The food was good especially the icecream the served half way the flight. On the return I flew with a 777-200. It was on old plane but the seats were more spacious. The screen for the IFE was bad smaal and you couldn't see much on te screen in some positions. The crew was friendly again and there was good food. What I also liked is that the crew offering you plenty of drinks and after dinner they offer you liquor. Nice touch I didn't saw it on other airlines I flew with. We departed and arrived on time. So overall a good experience. I would definitely choose KLM again if the price is right.

The breakfast made even less sense - the main food was one square omelette with one bacon slice served with two pieces of cheese and one stale croissant. The inflight entertainment / control did not work and this meant no reading light throughout the whole trip no possibility to call the cabin attendants (even to get a glass of water I had to jump over my neighbour). All this on top of the old airplane lack of privacy and an extremely uncomfortable sleeping position (as the seat is not horizontal every time you turn then you have to climb up the seat again).

Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world!

The outbound journey was very pleasant with everything going very smoothly and the comfort in terms of seating food and entertainment was just fine. However when going back home we were notified that our flight was cancelled for unclear reasons that KLM did not want to tell us (we still haven't gott any explanation more than two months later). We got a less comfortable alternative journey home which worked out alright.

BRU to AMS flight delayed due to late arrival of incoming aircraft by 15 minutes we boarded the plane Captain was there to greet all pax upon boarding. Then captain took PA to inform us of further delay by 30 minutes as Schipol Airport have strong winds and to delay take-off in BRU until weather in destination cleared. Most pax including me had tight connections but again managed to catch onward flight. KLM is a very efficient airlines when it comes to baggage handling with tight connections. Food and drinks offered are ample and nothing to complain about. What amazed me is during second meal service 2 hours before touchdown in YVR I asked the purser for coffee but responded that it will be offered after the meal service are all done and after an hour she still recall that I asked for a coffee given the flight is totally full and very busy.,nan,5.0,nan

This was unacceptable and the airlines response was sorry too bad. Not the most intelligent way of treating a business class client. Check-in was disorganized and time consuming which was very odd for BKK because I have never experienced this at BKK. Part of the problem is that there is a scrum approach to check in. Boarding was equally disorganized and unusually unpleasant for business class on a BKK long haul. The plane departed late and arrived late but the Captain's honest explanation made it a non issue. The professionalism carried through to the on board service crew who were some of the most cheerful and efficient FAs I have experienced. Meals were disappointing as they were uninspiring and overly salty. Beverage selection was decent. The new seat left me with a sore back after 12 hours. KLM missed an opportunity to catch up with airlines such as Cathay EVA and ANA as the new seats are nothing special and still leaves KLM as a class below the aforementioned airlines. The amenity kit while nice looking was basic and again not as useful as Asian carriers no slippers were provided which is unusual on an Asian flight. Nor was I able to get a newspaper. First time on a long haul flight where newspapers were not available to me in the cabin. IFE was varied and ok although the map program is as bad as Air France's and not very informative. Overall it was a generic flight that got me where I had to go safely. The Dutch flight crew were excellent while the Air France/KLM ground crew in BKK were mediocre. I would not recommend KLM as a carrier on this route unless a direct flight to AMS was required as there are much better options available with the Asian carriers.,nan,4.0,nan

Food was OK nothing very fashionable and drink service as expected (although on return flight no vodka for Bloody Mary was available). IFE good especially - as expected - in audio rock music section which in KLM is among the best in the air. The only complaints are about the seating in B777-300ER. Formerly I have flew the 777-200 with 3x3x3 option and found that very comfortable. The 3x4x3 is not ideal. You could for a small fee get slightly more space for legs but not broader seats and the new arrangements are both narrow and hard. Paradoxically seats in the short-haul B737 are much better.

The crew were friendly and attentive offering plenty of food and drinks. The entertainment offered on the 777-200 was a bit limited but there was enough to keep us amused.

This cabin is reasonably laid out but the decor reminded me of early thirties Odeon cinema: rather lifeless and lacking warmth. Seats were OK and everything worked although the headrest was non adjustable. AVOD worked but limited choice of movies. Toilets were clean and had a good range of toiletries. Food was OK not outstanding although compared to the outward journey it was better. As on outward journey the cabin crew were excellent and went out of their way to ensure that wherever possible they made the journey as comfortable as possible.

Eventually managed to get two seats together. Boarding at Amsterdam was a bit chaotic. Aircraft was B777-300: unsure of the age of the plane but business class cabin in my opinion looked drab and dingy when compared to say Qatar. Seats were OK and everything worked. AVOD worked but choice of movies was definitely limited. Food choice was also limited and wine selection was restricted. General comfort was OK. The really good aspect of this flight was the cabin crew. They were extremely attentive and welcoming especially the senior purser and they were all very professional.

Took 4 flights with KLM in one week first leg is the long haul CGK-AMS with a Boeing 777-200 unfortunately KLM is still in the middle of refitting the cabin of B777 and we still get the old plane with very small PTV with blurry picture. Paid for Economy Comfort for this leg and got the first row bulkhead seats which has tremendous legroom. In flight service is good and friendly but the hard products really needs to be improved. Second leg AMS-LHR in a very old and small Fokker 70. KLM should already retire this type of aircraft but they did maintain the plane well it was clean and in good condition. Only the noise of the jet engine really bothering us as we sit all the way in the back (Fokker planes has the engines near the tail of the aircraft) luckily the flight to London is only 45 minutes. A cake and drink service is provided during this flight. Third leg London Heathrow to Amsterdam in a Skyteam livery Boeing 737-900 good legroom and service is similar as the AMS-LHR where we get a cake and a drink. Last leg AMS-CGK with a stopover in KUL also in an old non refurbished Boeing 777-200. Good thing the crew really performed well and deliver prompt and good service most of the time. Hopefully KLM is refitting their Boeing 777 flights quick enough as their fare is quite competitive and quite satisfied with their inflight service only hard products need improvement.,nan,5.0,nan

The next flight to Johannesburg was on a 777-300 sitting in the aisle seat in the middle row of four which was comfortable and had enough room and it was the same on the return flight too. On both flights there was nobody beside us so my wife had three seats to stretch out and sleep. The flight back to Glasgow was on an Embraer 190. The crews on all the flights were excellent on the short flights we received a sandwich/snack with coffee and juice and on the long haul flights we received a very tasty hot meal a liqueur with coffee ice cream and the crews came around with plenty of water and juice to keep us hydrated.

Flight was delayed in leaving due to a crew change pilot then took a wrong turn on the run way and we were stuck waiting for a while. Most of the passengers were just stuck waiting in their seats - the crew had not passed around the headsets so there was nothing to do. Had pressed the service button while waiting to get a set but the crew just stayed in the galley talking to each other (not in their seats waiting for take off).

We were travelling with a 2 year old but they made sure we had everything we needed (probably so the other passengers wouldn't have to endure the rath of a 2 year old but nonetheless) and we ended up having a very pleasant flight and didn't bother anyone else on the plane. We had seats at the bulkhead which have some extra legroom but compared to Air China Southern who we flew back with on a codeshare the plane was very cramped considering the average Dutch person is quite a bit taller than the average Chinese person.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squashed (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for an overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory! That said the service was good and the flight attendants were meticulous and more than happy to walk around offering snacks and drinks every hour even when passengers are asleep. Nonetheless never on this airline again for long haul flights maybe a short 2-3 hour one.,nan,1.0,nan

The short flight to Amsterdam was very good with a high quality snack and very friendly crew. Arrival at Schipol was 20 minutes early. Unfortunately Schipol Airport is undergoing refurbishment which makes it something of a mess but the lounge was welcoming and not too crowded. Boarding from Gate E7 was very disappointing. It was a mess. Everyone had to go thru a security check and the queues were long. Then once thru security it was standing room only. Boarding was just a rugby scrum as people tried to get out of the claustrophobic boarding area. On board the Dubai flight the crew were very welcoming. Departure was on time and the on board product was very good. I am used to the KLM Business Class seat and while it may not be a flat bed it is fine for the approx. 6 hour flight to Dubai.

Eventually had to pay additional fare on one of our flights to sit next to my wife on our honeymoon despite us previously booking seats next to each other. No apologies no suggestion that they would refund the additional fee paid. The outward bound flight from Amsterdam to LA was on a 747 that is in serious need of updating. uncomfortable rock solid and narrow seats with very little leg room. They ran out of one of the dinner options before they got to our seat no apologies or explanations just put in on our table and said 'here is your dinner' didn't even say what it was. As it turns out it was bland and terrible. Stewardess became quite stroppy when complained at lack of choice of meals and made it seam like she was performing heroic acts to try and get an alternative meal.

Previously I experienced some plastic items but not this time. The AVOD was OK but did not have as recent offerings as their partner Delta and the quality of the large screen was milky. The seat was surprisingly soft and was comfortable in any position including lie flat. The toilets were cleaned throughout and FA were always available in the galley with smiles. The FA were remarkably genial and good at their jobs. There were two toilets dedicated to all of business class and I never once saw an economy passenger try to enter. Overall I loved my flights.

KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible.

Tried both the Delta and the KLM flight #'s. Found KLM rep who sent me down to transfers who then tried it for me typing in both KLM and Delta flight #'s. No reservation so sent me on to Transfer rep who eventually found me and sent me back to a kiosk for seat assignment. Return trip from Kilimanjaro to Amsterdam I previously paid for Economy Plus seat upgrade with confirmation printed in hand and also on my Iphone. My seat 10J was also sold to someone else who checked in just before me. No other windows for the 12.5 hour flight so he finally gave me a window seat farther back. What a way to do business!

We were told that it was KLM policy to overbook flights and that this was ""in the small print"". I am revolted by this policy. We had bought and paid for our tickets and received several email confirmations from KLM about this. I was travelling with somebody who was simply not physically fit to be transported to another city to catch an alternative flight (the suggestion which was made to us at the airport). If an airline sell tickets which people pay for in good faith and intend to oversell the flight so that these tickets will be meaningless this needs to made explicit and clearly spelt out to customers - not hidden in ""the small print"".",nan,1.0,nan

The downside was that I felt like being served without a personal touch why? 1) No second pre departure drink. 2) I was asked what I like to eat without receiving the menu first and the FA forgot to ask which appetizer I want (normally that is fixed). 3) During the flight it was hard to get snacks and drinks (I had to walk to the economy class FA's and ask them). 4) In preparation for landing I had to bring my hand luggage back in the overhead bins on my own (FA asked me to get up and do it while she was standing next to me without helping me). The good stuff was the taste of the food and the good wines/drinks as well as a comfortable lie flat seat with an angle (only a few of the 25 KLM 777 are lie flat without an angle today). Speaking about the FA's on board they where always smiling and the economy FA's have been very helpful fast and with a personal touch.

KLM was convenient for me as I live in Birmingham and could therefore travel to Doha via Amsterdam without the need to travel down to London. The ticket price was also the cheapest available for this trip. The short hop from Birmingham to Amsterdam only takes about an hour but the 06.00 departure always serves a cold breakfast sandwich with tea coffee or juices. The layover in Amsterdam was 1 hour 55 minutes giving more than enough time to make my connection. The flight to Doha was not full whereas most Qatar Airways flights are as most of the passengers will be transiting. Once airborne the passenger next to me was offered the choice of moving seats so that we could all spread out a little making the journey much more comfortable. The IFE is adequate but the screen a little small though there is a good range of entertainment. On the outbound flight there were only two options for economy main course but the food was reasonable as airline food goes. All flights departed and arrived on time the crew were very good and I was pleasantly surprised that despite being the cheapest choice for my route KLM provided a service that I was more than happy with. I will look to see if I can get to my destinations via Amsterdam with KLM in the future and recommend for value for money.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,Our first flight on KLM. YYC to AMS. Since it was an 8 hour plus flight we flew business class. The aircraft was a newer Boeing 777-200 which for reasons that evade me did not have sequential seating (ABC etc). We booked our seats on-line and thought we were sitting together which upon boarding we discovered we were not. This happened to 5 other couples as well. The flight attendants were reasonable and everybody affected were willing to swap seats even though business class was a full bus to Amsterdam. The meals were tasty and there lots of snacks. My one beef is that KLM should monitor their cleaning contractors more closely. I lost some change and some items from amenity kit under the pod. In the course of reaching underneath I found all sorts of goodies which could have been vacuumed up. I enjoyed the flight and the lie flat bed even though flying east and trying to sleep is a Herculean effort. I recommend KLM and will gladly fly with them again. One last caveat: I am old school and believe that one should fly the national airline within reason to the country you are visiting. Flying discount airlines is a recipe for disaster and personal misery. I cite the most vilified Air Canada Rouge as an example.,nan,5.0,nan

Because we were boarding from a connecting flight we weren't able to arrive early enough to claim the bassinet seating (there were lots of babies on the plane) but the flight hostess was able to find another seat for the woman sitting beside my wife, so we had a place to put out 6 month old instead of holding him the whole time.

Not all desks were staffed and the agent controlling access seemed to have lost heart and surrendered. It was a hot day and the aircraft was stuffed full of people so boarding was highly stressful. It was not great for anybody when stressed kids made their presence known. The cabin crew were of little assistance, seemingly just wanting to get home.

The boarding was chaotic and took a long time, as it appeared more passengers had to change seats. The seat I was put in was the most cramped one on the plane. Once aboard the plane I told the purser about the situation, she refused to believe me and went out of her way to deny I even paid for an EconomyComfort seat. A nasty experience that ruined the positive holiday mood I was in. Food was so so: the classic choice between pasta and chicken/rice. Other cabin crew was friendly and helpful.

Our Boeing 777 outbound from YYC had power points and easily accessible USB. Some exec got cheap at KLM and we had to hunting on our hands and knees for the headphone jack which was buried in a strange place and no power points for our electronics. It was quite a sight to see business class passengers on their hands and knees trying to plug their headphones in. We are going to try Air France business class in the future and if that doesn't pan out we are switching back to Lufthansa.

The Boeing 747 had the worst of any plane we had been on. The Boeing 737 from Amsterdam to Copenhagen had more.

My carry on didn't fit in bin (upper deck, small bins), the flight attendent sent me to her colleagues in the back, but they were too busy, so I left the suitcase in the aisle, and it took about 30 minutes for someone to take care of it - not a very friendly experience in general. No particular attention to passengers asking about drinks, and serving wasn't good - food served with foil cover labeled ""remove before serving"", etc. I felt like I was in economy premium, rather than business.

The two biggest problems were the AVOD box under several seats in each row, which significantly impacted leg room if it was under the seat in front of you.

To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small. Didn't happen on European hopper flights however we flew economy as didn't see the point of an upgrade on a 45 min flight. Efficient, organised service from boarding to arrival.

No decicated queues for frequent flyers or Comfort Economy. Once onboard, the seats showed their age and lack of comfort on a night flight. In-flight entertainment system is very old, with ancient games, tiny screens, not easy to operate. Choice of films is not too bad. The food was, simply put, inedible. Hardly any drinks service on the night flight - or maybe I missed them as I was trying to sleep. Sleeping is barely possible, as the seats in Comfort Economy are still narrow, even though the legroom is okay. The cabin is noisy. Cabin crew impoite, even rude at times - did not feel welcome. Once in Amsterdam, we learnt that both our connecting flights (to different airports in different countries) had been cancelled. No help from ground staff whatsoever. We finally managed to change our bookings on the self-service machines and were ""compensated"" with a paltry food voucher for 5 EURO and 15 EURO for a 3 hour and a 7 hour delay, respectively. Finally, flight to Berlin was late and chock-a-block full. After a sleepless night and five hour wait I had to sit with bits of hand luggage on my lap because only one piece of luggage was allowed in the overhead bins. I am not going to fly KLM again if I can avoid it. ",Business,2.0,nan

Another small thing that I always fancy when flying with KLM, is that the food and drinks are served at the same time (as it's supposed to be with dinner) unlike many of the gulf carriers where I experienced many times that my meal was already finished when the drinks were served finally arrived.

At the gate KLM ground personnel asked for passengers with a trolley to come to the desk and hand in their trolley. As I have flown in all kinds of planes, I knew that in smaller planes some put larger cabin luggage in a space in the back of the cabin. So my wife handed in her trolley. A few minutes later I saw her trolley sitting on the tarmac, ready to be loaded into the belly of the plane, together with the checked-in suitcases. The announcement made through the speakers had not mentioned that the trolleys would be loaded into the belly of the plane. I would not have handed in our trolley. I first asked KLM ground personnel and later instisted that they would give me our trolley that sat there visible just below us. The ground personnel would not even politely acknowkledge the justification of my request and started to handle a request of another passenger about luggage. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I sat in a window seat, which felt far from the aisle. The seats are fairly standard for economy, anyone taller (i.e. more than 5'10"") may feel a bit cramped but the pitch is generally OK. The IFE did feel a bit antique, but only crashed once due to me overloading it. The stewardess quickly reset the system when asked. The catering is better than most, albeit the choice was a bit meager (only 2 options for dinner and a small breakfast), but everything tasted fine and was served with a smile.

The service was very quiet and peaceful: light is not bright and crew are not running up and down. For that reason, I will fly with them again if I have a long haul night flight. The in-flight system was defective: the flight tracking system didn't work after we took off from Tapei, which was annoying in such a long flight but the crew was nice so that's fine. KLM now plays with a strong Dutch identity (Dutch snacks, Dutch symbols on the food packages and even on the plastic cups), that really gives a charm that made that flight even better than the one I had 4 years ago. The seats look very modern and there's more space between seats than what I experienced with the other major airlines in Asia.

I found the provision of water on this flight significantly better than other airlines which give you pots of waters with meals, and cups at other services, this often leaves me thirsty and so I bring extra water on-board.

Manchester to Amsterdam was on an Embraer E-190 that was late coming in but was turned around fast. Short flight on a small but comfortable aircraft, crew efficient and informative. Captain came in fast as lots of passengers needed to make connections. Mad dash across Schipol to make flight. I am biased I like the B747, and ""Rio"" looked magnificent in the afternoon sunshine. I paid the extra for the premium economy seat and its worth every penny. Long but comfortable overnight flight to Beijing. Food was good, nice G&T and a drinkable red wine. Snacks can be had at anytime. The combi Premium economy area was very civilised, the babies well behaved. I have a toddler daughter so I know what its like to feel like a lepper amongst passengers when you have a little one with you. KLM aircrew are often ""more mature"" but that makes them far better at helping family flyers. If you can pay the premium KLM is a far better and time saving alternative to flying via the middle east to get to the far east. Saw a last glance of ""Rio "" as I left the airport in Beijing. I will be sad to see these big birds go. Yes I know the A380 is bigger and I fly them too but the jumbo has soul. Few whinges? Why does a full price airline have a 23kg luggage limit when the middle easterners have 30kg? Its daft. People will plump for the bigger luggage carriers. They did allow me to take a large box with a bike (25kg) for free. I did take 120kg in luggage pre-booked with KLM but no porters to be found in Manchester or Beijing.

Their measure for leg room must be people of 1.70m (5.7f). Yes, you can pay for more legroom. Crew is professional and friendly, no complaints there. Ground crew smashed our luggage beyond repair, most airlines have deals with suitcase shops that a claim is dealt directly. But with KLM you have to send them photos, proof of purchase, a shop's confirmation that it's beyond repair, and ten other things to their HQ. The claim then takes months to be processed. On the positive side they give you extra refund to cover for exchange expenses, bank fees etc. To sum the experience I would say you get far better quality services by airlines like Ryanair and Wizz Air, considering the price.

nan,Business Class,3.0,October 2015,1.0,3.0,nan,no,Moscow to Amsterdam,3.0,"I agree entirely with the reviewer who was disgruntled with KLM business class between Moscow and Amsterdam. The outward business class flight (Amsterdam-Moscow) had been with Aeroflot, and I was initially disappointed to learn that it wasn't going to be KLM. I shouldn't have been! The Aeroflot experience was really good - we were greeted on arrival with a choice of sparkling white wine, orange juice or water, we were given a proper menu for lunch, and were served with a linen tablecloth and napkin. We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide (though there's nothing separating you from your neighbour). The return, with KLM, was very disappointing. As the other reviewer mentioned, the seats were the standard narrow ones and they'd simply left the middle seat empty. That didn't bother me too much because it was only a medium haul flight, but the level of service and the quality of food was far inferior to Aeroflot. There was a choice of two main hot dishes, but no printed menu, and they had even run out of choice for the gentleman sitting behind me. He complained - justifiably - and whilst the steward serving the meals didn't seem to grasp the significance of a business class passenger not having his choice, the senior attendant did, and she was very apologetic and gave the passenger a gift of two small bottles of champagne to take with him on landing. But the hot meal was served in what was so obviously a microwaveable-type dish, with the foil cover left on it. We had been given a choice of orange juice or water on boarding - but no sparkling wine - and not until all the passengers had boarded (to be fair, the size of the plane would've made it difficult to serve us drinks as the aisles were filled with a stream of boarding passengers, but the absence of sparkling wine was disappointing - and they didn't have the finesse to give us napkins). There was no facility to watch a film. Basically, it was a standard flight that they'd just tried to 'tart up' a bit. With the Aeroflot flight, in contrast, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we had even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing. If I have to go to Moscow again, and am lucky enough to have business class flights paid for, I shall avoid KLM like the plague and make sure I get Aeroflot, who several notches above KLM.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

I like the earphones that are supplied, they fit over the ears and are suprisingly comfortable with good audio. Space around the seat is quite tight, (even in economy comfort) and when the person in front puts their seat back, their head is almost in your lap, can be difficult to eat your meal, while brushing away the person's hair in front of you. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Our main problem was with a very short connection in Amsterdam, and there was not enough time to transfer into the schengen area. However after we got through passport control and with 5 minutes until our plane left, the gate was closed, so we headed straight to a transfer desk.

Got nasty Delta lady who told us it's a KLM problem. We at least got a reference number. So I just called KLM to ask when I could expect my bag. I was asked to ham up and call back as this representative's computer was down. I called back and was eventually told I could expect my back within 8 hours. Our bags were at the airport in Amsterdam for 20 hours! How can one bag not make the flight? Do not use KLM. If there is a problem they suck. And if you do decide to fly with them, upgrade your seat.

The plane was very old, the entertainment system didn’t work, had to be reset for the entire plan, and still went out halfway through the flight. Clearly the crew were aware that it was a recurring problem. If you know your entertainment system is not working, you should disclose it in advance. Also, 8,000 points is not adequate compensation for it not working. If you listed a seat for sale and disclosed the fact that the entertainment system didn't work, you would have to offer more than an 8,000 point discount for someone to purchase it vs. a working seat. The plane in general was old, seats did not recline and return properly. The complete disregard for these obvious issues made me wonder what other, less visible, ways the maintenance of the plane was neglected.

I chose KLM because of hearing in passing how great KLM's service is and their food. They must have really gone downhill. The passenger next to me agreed we could not tell what the frozen green mush was next to our frozen meatballs. The food was disgusting and tasteless. The only thing really worth eating after thinking about it was the roll. And KLM's service was mediocre at best, the attendants seemed run down and not chipper at all. The flight was ok but the airplane has very outdated entertainment systems. Not touch screen. I could get past that but really don't waste your time thinking you would have some type of exceptional service if you fly KLM.

Embrear ERJ 175 and Fokker 70,Economy Class,4.0,February 2017,2.0,3.0,nan,yes,Amsterdam to Hannover,3.0," |  Today's trip was a one-day return without any checked-in luggage. In both Amsterdam as well in Hannover I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. The Crown Lounge in the Schengen area of Schiphol Airport was not too crowded and well stocked for breakfast. The lounge in Hannover is a contractor lounge with limited amenities but featured a good WIFI network. The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service, both left reasonably in time but arrived spot on time at destination. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed muffin and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise no coffee or tea was offered, probably due to the 40min. flying time. The outbound flight to Hannover was a brand new Embrear 175 while the return flight was operated by a Fokker 70. Both aircraft are fitted wit leather-covered slimline seats, however the older Fokker offers a more generous legroom then the Embrear. Cabin crew were friendly and professional.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
A330,Business Class,5.0,November 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,AMS to KGL,2.0," |  Flying to Kigali out of Amsterdam, where luckily KLM has direct flights. A great crew, attentive and the friendliest of other airlines I've flown. The only negative point remains that KLM charges a hefty price, as flyers on this route are captive (and mostly business travel).  I would understand this if the Business Class cabin had already been renewed; but as the A330 fleet is the last to be upgraded and I would have found fair that, until these have been modernised, Business Class fares would reflect as the actual comfort level which is nowhere like the updated AF/KLM quality. Older seats and a slightly worn out cabin are a bit expensive to swallow when you have experienced the New World Business Class. Service is great but the configuration is just seriously outdated when prices are not!",Business,1.0,nan

Flight left with 2 hours delay, due to snow and de-icing procedures at Amsterdam, which was beyond the control of KLM. The new business class at KLM is a major improvement compared to the old style, yet the 2 aside seating still requires that your you have to crawl over your fellow passenger when seated in a window seat. The seat itself is spacious and transforms to a comfy bed. Unfortunately not much stowage space around the seat. IFE system is decent. We had a wonderful purser in business class, very friendly. The 'Indische rijsttafel' was without a doubt the best food I have had on a plane. We avoided flying KLM for several years as they were far behind vis à vis other airlines on their business class product but we did not have much of a choice on the Curacao travel, and I have to state that I was pleasantly surprised to experience that they have catched up. All in all this was a good experience, with an extra thumbs up for the food.",Business,4.0,4.0

However boarding commenced on time. The seat onboard the Embraer 190 was a bit tight, but this was not too relevant for me on a 25 mins flight. The legroom was okay as well. After taking-off on time, I was surprised that KLM provided food and beverages on a 25min flight. We were handed a muffin and a water, very convincing for such a short flight. I was satisfied by the friendly cabin crew and the pilots, who let me enter the cockpit after the flight and congratulated me since I flew on my birthday. We arrived 10 mins early.

Fast and simple online checkin, on time departures of all four flights, cabin crew amazing. On the return trip, one of the flight attendants continued with us to Vienna and she was happy to see us again and we felt treated really special. The economy class service on KLM's short and medium haul is exceptional, and the shorter legs (VIE-AMS) we were served a tasty sandwich/wrap and hot and cold drinks, on the longer legs (AMS-HEL), we got a hot sandwich and two rounds of drinks. On the return flight they served a regular hot meal (pasta with tomato sauce) and a dessert. Transfer in Amsterdam efficient, arriving to C7 and departing from C8 was really convenient. For all flights, the atmosphere was very pleasant and the crew members looked like they enjoyed their work. ",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

The flight was scheduled to leave Houston at 15:35 and the day of the flight an email was sent out stating there would be a delay until 17:00, this was fine. The delay was ""due to operational constraints"", which I understood as issues with the plane's usual functions. At the rescheduled time of departure, one would expect that the issue would be resolved. This was not the case. The pilot was able to explain to us that one of the engines was having mechanical issues and an engineer would assess the situation. After an additional hour or so of delay it was decided that the plane was not in suitable condition to fly. I'm grateful for the discretion here. The passengers were asked to leave the plane and given no direction afterward. They offered hotel accommodation for out of town visitors as reparation. After exiting the secure area of the terminal the crowd of passengers could not find anyone to help us. I personally heard four contradictory statements on who to contact to reschedule the flight. After calling the number provided to me by an unruly ground worker for KLM, I was put on hold for a Delta helpline and the call was lost. The second time I called I contacted a helpful worker who rescheduled the flight for the following day. Overall I was looking forward to this experience and it was nice until we were asked to leave the plane. After we left it was slightly chaotic and I was disappointed.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

After dinner we were offered yet another beverage. All complimentary. The movie selection was atrocious! Am hour before landing we were offered a breakfast snack - it was fine.

In addition, our flight back was delayed which resulted in us missing our connecting flight and having to wait 6 more hours.

The TV screen is so small (or the way info are displayed) that I needed the support of the person beside me to be able to use it. No question to ask the help of the cabin crew, they are too busy to help.

I arrived in Newcastle at 830am on Thursday and discovered that my luggage had not arrived with me. I have experience this before with other airlines and understand that losing your luggage is a risk you take when flying. However, that was 3 days ago and I have called the airline 6 times to be told 6 different stories and different times to expect my luggage. They confirmed that my luggage was found and arrived in the UK (1 hour from when I am staying) on Thursday evening and said it had been picked up by the courier they hire on Friday morning. Currently the earliest expected delivery time they can give me is Monday evening. This is 5 and a half days after arriving in the country (and that is providing this information is not false like the previous 5 expected arrival times). I have asked to speak to the department manager but have been told that one is not available every time I have called. We travelled to England for a special occasion and ultimately do not have clothes to wear to that occasion. We have altered our travel plans in order to always be at the delivery location we provided in case the luggage does show up. This type of customer service is unacceptable in my eyes.

Boeing 747-400,Premium Economy,3.0,April 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Houston to Amsterdam,1.0," |  Houston to Amsterdam. I fly regularly between the US and Europe, usually on premium economy. Most times I end up on Lufthansa, British Airways or SAS, who all have wider seats, bigger screens and power supply in their premium economy class (I avoid the US airlines for all it's worth). The additional leg space and seat width makes the difference for me. For the first time I chose to try KLM premium economy for my Houston to Amsterdam trip. What a disappointment! The seats were the same as in economy class, i.e. exactly the same width. The only difference was a few inches extra of leg space. If you choose an emergency seat, which costs less than the premium economy on KLM, you basically get a better product. The screens looked like they came from a different era, pixelated and tiring to look at. Also, there was no power supply at all. Comparing with standard economy class it is of course much better to have the extra leg space, but compared to the competitors the KLM 'premium economy' is not really premium at all!",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Before I arrived at Lisbon Airport, I checked in online using the KLM app which was a very smooth and easy experience compared to some airline apps. On arrival at the airport I checked in my bags at the bag drop using the boarding pass which I had on my phone. The staff around check-in were absolutely fantastic, couldn't have been more helpful. As I boarded the aircraft, I was given a very friendly welcome by the cabin crew. The flight departed 15 minutes behind schedule due to an issue with ATC in Amsterdam. Once we were airborne the crew began to serve breakfast which consisted of a Dutch breakfast sandwich and a choice of drink. The sandwich was actually quite nice although the appearance did not look so tasty. Throughout the flight the cabin crew continued to serve light snacks and beverages, and the service was outstanding. The time lost at Lisbon had been made up during the flight and we actually arrived at the destination 5 minutes early than anticipated. I would certainly fly with KLM again for their outstanding service and value for money.",Business,4.0,nan

I had read a lot of negative remarks that we chose KLM rather resentfully, but the itinerary from FRA was more convenient than Air Berlin. For Curaçao, there was no other reasonable choice. This little competition makes the tickets rather pricy in comparison to flights to Asia. Their website is awful in many respects (I would have to fill pages, so I don't write why), that made our expectations not very happy either. We were very surprised that none of our prejudices turned out to be confirmed. Not a single delay, on the contrary - we reached all destinations up to 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Friendly staff on ground and in the air. On both long hauls, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful - we are accustomed to Asian Airlines and have become quite fastidious about service, but this reached the same level. Our prebookings of gluten free and Hindu meals had been lost by their sappy website, but the staff did their utmost to compose some convenient replacement food for us and re-ordered instantly our meals for the return flight (with success). The quality of the food itself was average but edible. The movie entertainment consisted mainly of stale news, mainstream thrillery, or animations which I preferred because the screens are not good enough for any dark scene in a normal movie - you see nothing but a black screen. Because of the cheap earbuds, acoustics qualities are very low and it was hard to understand much of the dialogues in English (English subtitles would help a lot!) - and there were few films in German. Seats were okay and there was enough legroom, so that we could even slide down a bit and sleep. For flights to the west, we will certainly book KLM again.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The cabin staff is very friendly, attentive and looks natural. This is the best cabin staff I have experienced, and I typically fly Economy. The new seat design puts KLM in a higher league, and the cabin space is quite relaxing, not giving impression of being full. Meal service is well time and diverse enough, good choice and what you expect in a normal Business Class. KLM fares are high for the Dutch market, but their scheduling is the best for making most of your work days. IFE is a bit dating as most aircraft now have some high def screens, but like many people I pack my own gear so this is not much relevant. All in all KLM is living up to expectation, no delays and the ground service is Schiphol is flawless. Time to upgrade the A330 fleet!",Business,3.0,nan

First flight with KLM and was a bit apprehensive, as connection from London was very short. The SkyTeam Lounge at Heathrow is adequate, enough space to sit and have a quiet drink and a snack. There is WiFi. Catering OK, but my usual carrier is Etihad, so the experience was a little different, no a la carte table service. Flight boarded at T4 from the gate opposite the Lounge, very convenient. At Schipol we had just about 50 minutes from touchdown to the onward connection, which was enough time to have a quick drink, find our way to the gate and immediately board the next flight. With such a short connection I was worried our luggage wouldn't make the flight, but when we arrived at KUL there it was! The new World Business Class is very open and comfortable. The seating is great, save for the fact that you have no direct aisle access for the window seat. If you are travelling as a couple this is fine, for solo travellers it might prove tiresome. The on-board service was great, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful. The catering was OK, very Dutch shall we say! The drinks were good quality, but a bit mean. Nothing that one could really grumble about. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new and classic programming to keep me entertained until bed time! The bed is great and I slept like a baby. Even though they are older aircraft I like the sense of space you get with the Boeing 777, which somehow you don't quite feel on other aircraft even the 380. The price was comparable to Etihad (about GBP 300 more) but the flight is 1hr to AMS, a 1hr layover and then a 12hr leg to KUL. Reverse journey the same timings. For EY you have a 3 or 4 hour layover and now they have adjusted their timetable you have to either leave UK early in the morning or arrive very late to KUL. The KLM timings are much friendlier. We left LHR at 17.00 and arrived in KUL 16.00 a much less stressful journey. Am flying back KLM and will definitely consider them for the next trip too.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The pre-departure lounge was quite good, and I loved being able to lie down to sleep on this overnight flight - very comfy pillow and blanket. I had a window seat and the drawback was that in order to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I had to literally climb over the bed of the person next to me. Try that when the plane is bouncing around! The window was so far from my seat that I had to unbuckle to look out. In an economy or comfort seat, one has under the seat in front of you, or the back of the seat in front, to put things. In business class, there was only one small shelf available and couldn't use it during takeoff and landings. There was no wifi on the flight but the movie, etc. selections were fine.

A long trip by any standard, made further complicated by KLM routing me via CDG when there is a direct flight from AMS to EDI! Firstly, check in at Lima was a mess, taking an hour in a badly organised queue with people getting angry. Then departure was 40 mins late with no explanation given. Also, despite checking in as soon as check in was open, KLM did not let me choose a seat ('unavailable' for some reason) and placed me in a middle seat, between 2 strangers! For a 12 hour flight. The seats were very hard on the Boeing 777, and the food was quite bad, at the level of hospital food or worse. IFE showed the same films I'd seen on the way there (with AF, a better experience). Then, arriving in AMS and tired after a long trip, I asked if I could not be put on the direct flight to EDI so as to save time and hassle; I was given robotic answers that this was 'impossible' with no explanation. After that, I find out that the Amsterdam to Paris flight is 30 minutes, then 1 hr late, making me fear I'd lose my connection! I barely made it, having to run in Paris CDG. Of course, luggage did not make it. I am very disappointed as I am an AF-KLM customer for 15 years with close to 100k miles and no consideration was given to this; the airline labels itself as the 'most punctual in the world' in its literature, which makes me laugh based on my experience. I have put in a formal complaint and will try to avoid this airline in the future.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

The flight was approximately two hours, service was good, friendly, professional, and a cheese sandwich with a beverage was served which is more than any US-based airline will ever give you on such a short flight in an economy cabin. I booked an economy comfort seat but to be honest I did not notice more legroom or more recline on my seat in this aircraft. Because it was only a few dollars I really did not look into it however I am not sure that the city hopper aircrafts have such seats available.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,5.0,April 2017,5.0,3.0,3.0,yes,Amsterdam to Manila,2.0," |  Amsterdam to Manila via Taipei. In Taipei We had to exit the airplane, go through customs, wait in the terminal and then return on board. This was a nice break for such a long flight and the fact that we did not have to change aircraft was also very nice. I paid extra for an economy comfort seat and for a gourmet meal. The meal was amazing and worth the extra $20.00. The economy comfort seat had decent legroom however I did not find it that comfortable, I also understand that on a 16 hour flight at some point your seat will become uncomfortable. KLM flight attendants did a great job at ensuring that there were some space in between the rows. For example I was seated in a three seat configuration and they made sure that the middle seat was empty. I learned a good lesson however which is never to book a window seat on such a long flight that way you avoid disturbing the person in the aisle seat specially if you are the restless type that needs to walk around the aircraft. I normally do not get up from my seat much but somehow I found myself quite restless and uncomfortable at times on the seat. I do have to say that I was very disappointed at the fact that on this flight and on this excellent aircraft Wi-Fi was not offered however the entertainment choices on the interactive screen were decent.  3 hot meals were served and every two hours they passed by with the trolley and offered snacks and beverages.  With the excellent service provided by Asian airlines like EVA I am not sure I would book KLM again for this type of a journey however they remain one of my top favorite airlines for flights from and within Europe.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Boeing 777-200 with new slimline seats. Having now experienced at first hand this seat I can only agree with the many reviewers that the closeness to the passenger sitting next to you is just too invasive. What I did like was its firmness and especially for taller passengers the vertically extendable headsets for good support but it desperately needs to be a few centimeters wider to win over my seal of approval. Even the so-called Economy Comfort seats (not to be confused with Premium Economy on other airlines) are only a fraction better as the added comfort might be in length and recline but not in width. Immensely appreciated the mixture of young and older stewardesses and top marks for the way they interacted with all passengers during the flight. On my two trips the pursers were situated in my section, whose professionalism I greatly enjoyed.  And one of the stewardesses was working on her last flight before getting married. This was with great fanfare announced by the captain followed by a guest appearance of one the off-duty pilots to congratulate her in person and making himself available to answer questions from passengers. Usage of the inflight entertainment system was easy and had a good selection of new, recent and foreign movies that I was able to catch up on. A few notes on the preparation of the trip, it was disappointing not being able to bid for an upgrade to business class as stated on the KLM website for the legs. Oddly enough, on this leg some business class seats were available to which I happily would have made a competitive bid.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

With 8 hours delay the KLM staff were exceptionally unhelpful telling a customer that they can't make the airport more comfortable or the plane arrive on time but she can guarantee he'll sleep on the flight and asked him to move so she can serve another customer just to tell them the same thing. Nothing was offered for the delay except a tenner for food. And they announced the delay by 2 hour increments instead of allowing passengers to make other plans or even catch some sleep. I wouldn't recommend KLM and won't be travelling with them again.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

In both Amsterdam as well in Norwich I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. The Crown Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport was crowded but well stocked for breakfast. The lounge in Norwich is a contractor lounge with limited amenities but featured a reasonable WIFI network. The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service. The outbound flight was delayed with approx. 45 min and the return flight with almost 2 hours. On both airports the ground staff had chosen to provide their passengers only the bare minimum of information about the delay. I only learned from the captain on the return flight that today's delays were due to faults in the underground fuel system at Amsterdam Schiphol airport. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed waffle and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise on the flight to Norwich coffee or tea were offered considering the 30min. flying time. The outbound flight to Norwich was a Embrear 190 substituting the usual Embrear 175 while the return flight was operated by a Fokker 70. Both aircraft are fitted with leather-covered slimline seats, however the older Fokker offers a more generous legroom then the Embrear.

I booked a flight with Etihad and didn't realise that one of the flights was with KLM until day of departure, which I didn't think was going to be a problem. First of all, the seats were not comfortable compared to other airlines I've flown with. You can't pull the arm rest up to get it out of the way.  I requested a vegan meal which did not go through to them, so I was left with no options on the flight for food - the flight attendant just offered me an apple when I brought it to their attention - this was a mistake of the airline. I accidentally left a jumper on the plane and contacted KLM immediately. They were quite hard to get a hold of - I waited on the phone for ages before giving up and messaging them through facebook which they have finally responded (slowly). In regards the the jumper they told me to contact abu dhabi airport and when I did, abu dhabi told me it was the responsibility of the airline if I left it on their plane. KLM said that if they found anything, they would give it to the lost and found at the airport - Abu Dhabi found nothing so they obviously did not hand anything in to the lost and found.

Very little food as well, I think there was less than 70 grams of protein in my fish dish. The placed some water and snacks in the galley but when it is all taken they arrogantly don't replace it so you need to ask. They seem more interested in chatting among themselves. Really bad. The website is bad as well and they don't inform you adequately about how many points you will make and always offer the worst ones for this, which only gives you 25%. All in all, bad. But punctuality is good and Amsterdam as a transit airport is efficient and hassle free.

This is the first time I've flown KLM, I've heard good things from the airline from family members which is why I booked. At the time KLM was best value for this route which was also a deal breaker. The aircraft was new with the 3-4-3 layout in economy. The seats on KLM did feel a bit narrow however may be due to the design of the seat. But the legroom was amazing, the slimm seats give you more room. i could slouch in my seat with the person in front reclined and still have room to spare. The in flight infotainment was ok, a few movies were good, some good series but no where near as good as other carriers. I was expecting a larger screen, it was ok but could have been better. Each seat had a USB and plug socket, very helpful. The staff were great, very friendly and came round often enough with drinks, food and snacks. Couldn't fault the staff. I was sat in the first economy cabin, a few rows after the economy confort seats, so I was a bit annoyed that I couldn't have my choice on the inflight meal, so I had to get the pasta but it was tastey and the aribiatta sauce was nice. The breakfast option was weird. It was a scrambled egg/omelette, was edible but not nice or horrible.

When checking in using the KLM app all was OK, but when I printed my boarding card at the airport I found out that I still had seat 4F in the outbound flight but that this was located in the Y section! When inquiring about this with the KLM check-in staff they informed me that this was due to a configuration change. ""But you are seated in Y+ and have the same legroom, so don't complain"". In both Amsterdam as well in Munich I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security but could not use the Crown Lounge in Amsterdam. On the return flight (which was not changed) I could use the lounge in Munich. This is a dedicated KL/AF lounge which has limited amenities but featured a reasonable WIFI network.

KLM surpassed my expectations in terms of service quality and integrity. Booking at klm.com was easy. Options sold via simple and attractive interface. Mobile check in worked well. Bag drop at Borispil airport took 2 minutes. Boarding was a breeze. The plane was clean and looked fresh. Crews were polite and attentive. Eco comfort seating was lovely. Their European catering is strange, but since there is a full bar service, not much to be unhappy about. Transfer at Amsterdam requires lots of walking, but terminal is perfectly organized, signage is easy and smart, security search was efficient (but not overly fast), so I have easily made a connection of 55 minutes. My bag made it as well. On the plane I loved the Eco Comfort small and private cabin. The seating was perfectly comfortable with good legroom. Entertainment had loads of films and shows and kept me occupied for the whole flight. No USB, no touchscreen, but ok. I loved the crews (very friendly, hard working and caring). Catering was of very good quality. My Japanese option was delivered first and didn't disappoint me. Lots of drink rounds. Great plane. Sorry to see 747s being grounded and replaced. The only annoyance was an 80 min delay due to wrong balance of cargo load (the plane was 747-combi). Finally they unloaded the wrong cargo to let us go, but even after that we spent 30 minutes waiting for available time slot. Great communication from cockpit and cabin crew. 10 out of 10 despite delay and tasteless food on European flight. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

It was a while ago flying a long haul flight with KLM and I was a bit concerned after many good flights with Singapore Airlines in recent years. But I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, service was much better than my last KLM long haul flight to Dar es Salaam. The crew were friendly and pretty attentive. Secondly, the food was tasty. It started with dinner (evening flight), finished with cheese quiche and ice cream in between. No problem to get more food if you left hungry and ask for. Enough drinks including wine, beer etc. Last but not least, the aircraft and IFE. For an 8 hour flight the seat width and pitch are reasonable. The electronic dimmable shades do work, mood lighting is nice and cabin noise is relatively low. In my opinion the biggest advantage of the 787 is the increased humidity compared to older aircraft. Nice IFE touch screen. However, if you look at the details my previous A350 flights with Singapore Airlines scored better on almost every aspect. KLM 787-9 is lacking a separate IFE control unit (for people who like gaming) and the screen is not adjustable, there could be more lavatories and it would be better if it had manual shades. Also the A350 cabin is a little bit wider. It would be nice if KLM replace their plastic cutlery for metal and replace the paper hot towels for cotton. The efficiency of meal service could be better as well (it was not very organised). Overall I was satisfied.

Now to the bad thing. KLM will let you choose a seat but if you want an emergency exit seat you have to pay extra. On almost all other airlines you an choose an emergency row seat when you are lucky enough to be one of the first to check in. But on KLM, no way. If you do not want to pay extra then you are stuck in the seats with less than 30 inch seat pitch. Now I am 196 cm tall where most of my height is in the legs, so a 30 inch seat pitch is just far too little. KLM won't even let you move after the freight has started unless you pay. On most other airlines I have never complained about this because I had a chance to choose an emergency row seat, but I am a really strong believer in the fact that I should not pay more to have the same kind of comfort as a person only being 170 cm.

Food good, nothing to remember but above many business class products on the same route, the cold starter was good and the chicken was soft and juicy. The only small disappointment was the amenity kit - different between ladies and gents: the gents one is basically an empty bag with socks eyemask and teethbrush, no lotion no nothing. And the nice little touch of the Delft house is always a plus for KLM.",Business,4.0,nan

I like KLM, nothing special, but decent quality and service. Seats and pitch better than with Lufthansa Group airlines. Food also better, especially on second leg with a pasta dinner during the 2 hour 20 minutes long flight time. No hassle at the airports, respected priority checkin, security and boarding. Second leg late due to a thunderstorm. Good communication from the cockpit. Distribution of water during waiting time. Somehow the flight was one of the last able to leave AMS after the services had restarted, so 1 hour and 30 minutes late arrival. Baggage delivery at OTP as always slow and disorganized.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,July 2017,4.0,1.0,5.0,no,Houston to Budapest,3.0," |  I had an absolutely terrible experience with this airline. Originally my flight was delayed and at the gate we were being told that we were going to be able to board soon. The pilot would come on and keep pushing the boarding time back. Finally after spending over almost 5 hours waiting to board we were told that our flight was rescheduled and we wouldn't be able to leave until that evening. I was hours away from home and extremely upset. The customer service representative that I spoke to was extremely rude and claimed that there were no sooner flights with any other airline. I asked her to check and she kept saying that there was nothing. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she actually told me ""no I had to listen to her first"" before I could be transferred. When I eventually got in contact with a supervisor (45 minutes later) I requested to file a complaint in regards to how I was being treated. The supervisor refused to give me anyone's names, employee ID numbers, or any type of reference to my complaint and claimed it'd be noted on their file. After over two hours on the phone trying to get the issue resolved/being told they checked numerous times and no sooner flight was available I went online and found a sooner flight within 5 minutes! They claimed that they didn't see that flight and I was rescheduled for it. The whole ordeal was mentally and physically exhausting as I spent the whole day at the airport and ended up missing a day and a half of my trip to Budapest! I've traveled frequently but this time the customer service was horrific. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

Flew from Incheon to Birmingham via Amsterdam. The new cabin is much improved however I was lucky enough on both inbound and outbound to get the single seats - I would have been very unhappy climbing over a seat mate as an individual traveler. The seat itself was very comfortable and I slept well. The major disappointment was the IFE the resolution on the screen was so poor it felt 20 years old and I couldn't watch for very long. Service was adequate but slow and sadly the food was rather boring for business class considering it was supposed to have been designed by a top Dutch chef. Overall my flights were fine but I'm unlikely to choose KLM again where Korean Air is available - their overall level of service is far superior.

I chose KLM for this trip because of an extremely attractive price offered at the time of booking. The price was so good I upgraded to Economy Comfort which I believe is worth the extra cost. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I deplaned and set about exploring options for occupying my 3-hour layover. After using the facilities and finding an open seating area for some relaxation and online activities, I discovered that my cell phone in its clip-on holster was missing from my belt. Panic set in an I retraced my steps and searched wherever I had been. I checked in with Lost & Found and while sympathetic and very helpful, they did not have my phone. What a depressing start to my safari adventure. I resigned myself to the likelihood that my phone was gone and I’d have to pay to replace it upon return to the USA. I boarded my connecting flight and had just gotten settled when I was approached by one of the flight attendants who held out an object in a plastic bag and said, “I believe this is yours.”  Life was good again. The phone had come un-clipped sometime during the first flight and fallen between the seat and the outside wall of the plane (I was in a window seat). The cleaning crew found it and turned it in along with the seat number where it was found. KLM staff researched the flight manifest and found my name and then looked up my itinerary and determined the next flight I would be on and forwarded the phone to the flight attendants on that flight. Now, that’s what I consider service. Thank you KLM. I would also compliment KLM on the food and staff service. Both were great. I will be checking KLM first in the future when looking to book flights.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,August 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,Barcelona to Lima via Amsterdam,1.0," |  Barcelona to Lima via Amsterdam. The overall experience with KLM was a nightmare. We arrived at the airport in Barcelona and Transavia was not able to print our boarding cards for the second flight (Amsterdam - Lima). Due to bad weather, we had to sit for 90 minutes in the aircraft, waiting to take off. Due to the delay, we had 15 minutes to make it to the second flight in Amsterdam but since we had no boarding cards, we had to rush in to the transfer desk. At that point the Schiphol airport was already a completely chaos. Queues everywhere. Not info at all where should you start queueing and so on. We lost our flight and had to wait in line for 8 hours to get a re-booking. KLM told us that the next flight (the following day) was full, but we could fly via Bogotá to Lima. We didn't want to do another connection but KLM said that they would only cover the hotel for one night (August in Amsterdam, not a lot of budget options to stay overnight). Our agent in Schiphol was extremely rude. I can understand that she had an awful day, but waiting in line for 8 hours is neither fun. We ended up accepting the flight via Bogotá and headed to a hotel we booked (KLM hotels were all booked out but KLM explained that they will cover the hotel expenses afterwards). The following day we took the flight and landed in Lima without luggage. Nobody knew where it was. When contacting KLM they said that they were not responsible for our accommodation but Transavia and that regarding our baggage, we had to contact Avianca, the airline which brought us from Bogotá. 64 hours later (plus an overnight in Amsterdam with our luggage locked at the airport) we just received our bags. I can understand bad weather. I can understand chaos and delays. But I won't accept irresponsibility and bad manners. To me it seems as they just want to clean their hands as soon as possible, even if you buy the tickets from them.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The flight has been canceled. Further information follows. Still confident that it would be good. A few hours ago, the news came that the flight we were in was now the next day. And then with a stopover. We would arrive at our destination more than 24 hours later. I could not afford this delay, considering work-related matters. Then you call. Wait for 40 minutes and you will not be helped. Eventually via Facebook Messenger had contact. But beyond that this was the best possible option and a referral to the complaint form, we did not arrive. Additional hotel accommodation was not offered. So I had to book myself. We are not informed about any refund or compensation. I have because I could not afford this delay to book a ticket with another company of € 400!  While waiting at the airport, KLM had several flights to Amsterdam. Apparently, with a flight that goes beyond 24 hours later than planned, you can arrange everything yourself, at least when you fly with KLM.  An annoying end of a vacation. Not on the same flight as my partner back. And huge costs due to cancellation.  I am definitely going to file a claim.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 77W,Economy Class,5.0,January 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Amsterdam to Tokyo,5.0," | Long haul flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo with KLM. We paid a bit extra to have Economy Comfort seats. While Premium Economy (which is offered by other airlines) is usually a different service class with more generous seats and slightly better service, Economy Comfort seats are standard economy seats with more legroom and 50% more recline (on long haul flights). The service is exactly the same as in Economy. However, Economy Comfort seats are usually much more affordable than Premium Economy seats.

The food was very good and plentiful, with a meal and snack served on the flight between Amsterdam and Freetown. They were generous with the alcohol, and I liked the fact that after dinner they came around with a small selection of spirits - quite rare in economy class these days. Though the TV screens were tiny, the IFE was adequate for the reasonably short flights, and there was a good selection of movies.

We make it to Amsterdam where we have a layover and head to the KLM lounge where my wife has a membership.

On Sep 1st due to a technical fault they delayed and then subsequently cancelled the flight the next day. My experience was horrendous. We were dropped at a DPS hotel at 2am and told to be ready to fly tomorrow. That was the last I saw or heard from KLM staff. For 2 days I was left without any information, food vouchers or a rebooked flight. The hotel did their best to provide support but they weren't even in contact with KLM for most of the time. I received a letter 2 days later saying that the ground crew would assist, they never did. It said they would contact me via phone or email with my rebooked flight, they never did. It took 3 nights in a hotel before KLM rebooked me onto a new flight, even though there are 15+ flights a day on that route. I still haven't heard from anyone at KLM and any attempts at speaking to someone who is responsible for the welfare of the passengers on that failed flight falls on deaf ears. I couldn't imagine an organisation demonstrating such arrogance and a lack of care but I have now seen it with KLM. If they are cheap and you can afford to take the risk of being left in a hotel for 3 days with no help or information then go ahead and fly, however after experiencing how KLM deal with delays and cancellations you would be far safer to fly a Low cost carrier, especially on inter-Asia routes.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

I had to ask the staff at the airport which were no great help and after 40mins didn't know when the plane was even landing as the screen had not been updated. Eventually the plane arrived. KLM was using Bulgarian Air. The seats on board were very tight together. I had paid for a little extra room but didn't get any, the plane was dirty, no toilet roll in the toilets and the passenger safety leaflet was stuck together with chewing gum. None of the cabin crew could speak English. All the emergency instructions on the plane were in English. The cabin crew did not instruct the passengers on how to open the doors over the wings in case of emergency. Cabin crew didn't give instruction on life vest or oxygen mask proceedure. Throughout flight the cockpit door was left open for long periods of time.  Cabin crew tried to hide this fact by closing the curtain. In this day and age this is shocking.

At first, someone sat on my seat and had my seat number.  Thank God there was a seat empty so that the other passenger could sit during the flight. My flight was delayed for almost an hour. And then, another poor service from KLM airport crew was that I had to put my hand luggage in the luggage compartment of the aircraft. I was told that I could pick it in Amsterdam Schipol Airport. But it was so complicated and took three to four hours for me to get that. So I gave up, and they said that it would be safely send with the other luggage (the 23kg suitcase) to my final destination. In Jakarta, after two hours waiting, my hand luggage didn't show up. So I filed a report, and after three days it was sent to the airport but in a very poor condition. The handle and lock are severely broken. Today is the 21st day after my arrival and I have received only one e-mail that asked me to give the luggage details, which I replied as soon as I could. But until now, not even a single mail or call have I received. KLM should be able to handle baggage properly and not disappoint passenger like this.

KLM is unfortunately lower than airlines like Lufthansa, Swiss or Alitalia (which I have flown a lot lately and they have really improved). I am not even considering some other airlines I fly every year like Qatar and Cathay Pacific. The seats are below market competition (I compare with Alitalia, Swiss, Iberia, Cathay and Qatar), and the food is not up to the standards of a Business Class. At least not what I use to fly regularly. The lounge is nice but the way you provide drinks and food is definetely the cheapest I have seen so far. Not a Business Class lounge at all. I had to go to the British Airways one that as I am a Gold member so they allowed me to enter even though I wasn't flying OneWorld. One good thing I have to admit.

As customers we have to except that cancellations do happen & that more often than not the decision to cancel is taken with our safety in mind. Every airline can run well under normal circumstances but a good test of a airline is to see how they cope with situations like these. KLM were aware of bad weather & by the time my flight had arrived had already cancelled a lot of flights, with this in mind you would of thought that a large business would ensure that they have enough staff on hand not only in the airport but also online & on the end of the phone to cope with the very predictable customer demand that would inevitably ensue. Not the case with KLM. Arrived in Amsterdam to a flight board of mostly delayed or cancelled flights, then had to virtually beg to get into the Crown Lounge with a Petroleum card despite being fully entitled to enter, I was later told that KLM staff were trying to reduce the amount of people in the lounge due to the cancellations. What is the point of issuing loyal customers with a privilege card if you are not prepared to give them the privilege in the first place? Upon being emailed & texted that my flight was cancelled I was given a link to click to re-arrange my flight, brilliant I thought, not brilliant as the link took me to a blank page. Not a problem I will go to the customer service desk & sort this. I (together with a lot of other people) had to wait for over 1hr and 30mins just to be seen, by which time all other seats were taken & waiting lists were at least ten deep for that days remaining flights. Not a problem, as I (& many others) hold a privilege card this takes my to the front of the ""waiting list"" for last minute seats, this is one of the major selling point of the privilege card system. But apparently when you most need this service KLM are not ready to honour it, leaving you as a loyal customer with no extra benefits that KLM had previously promised you in order to get your business & loyalty in the first place. 3 hours later I managed to re-book my flight, 5 hours later I managed to get to the hotel, to be far after this everything seems to be running ok. However, when you compare this airline to how other airlines cope with disruption KLM falls well short of just achieving basic organisation let alone good customer service. When you have your flight cancelled with KLM you will receive a voucher for 15 euros off inflight duty free which was not valid on my flight as my flight is under 70 minutes in duration. Or 2000 air miles credited to your account but only after you learn to read Dutch to decipher the voucher you have been given & then post in all your boarding passes & receipts to a international address, which will probably cost you the same in postage as the miles are worth. This is after you have tried to re-book your flight using one of the three online services they advertise, non of them worked & no response was received from any for over 12 hours. So in all likely hood you will have a 1 hour 30 minute wait to see a (understandably) fed up customer service rep. ",Business,1.0,nan

Outward flight in Boeing 737 was delayed for 25 mins because of early-morning fog at Schipol, and arrived similarly late.

Return journey had 737 for both legs. Delayed again leaving Venice, but flight to Newcastle on schedule.

The senior purser agreed that it was well below standard. So did the station-manager in Edmonton. KLM customer support ignored their views. It dismissed our subsequent complaint on the basis that information about the seats ""is explicitly presented on our website"". In fact it is far from explicit. Firstly, you do not expect to pay a full business class fare and get nothing more than oversize economy seating. Secondly even if you spend time trying to check it is virtually impossible to work out which aircraft you will be on. In addition the promise that you will have a privacy canopy is surprising. There was none visible nor any sign that there ever had been. We feel thoroughly cheated. The casual dismissal of our complaint has made it worse.

"Boeing 737, Fokker 70",Economy Class,3.0,October 2017,2.0,2.0,nan,yes,Amsterdam to Billund,3.0," |  Amsterdam to Billund. This trip was made in conjunction with the phase out of the Fokker F70 in KLM Cityhopper service. I deliberately booked this flight as a last salute to one of my favourite aircraft in which I logged almost 150 flights in the last 10 years. The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers. Upon disembarking all passengers were personally greeted by the captain and both cabin crew. We will miss the faithful little Fokkers!",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I never thought you could fit this many passengers on a 737, even EasyJet doesn’t pack them in this tightly. Seats are cramped and tight, also, no in-seat monitors, as a matter of fact, no monitors at all and also no onboard entertainment via WiFi nor any WiFi for that matter. The APU wasn’t turned on until 5 minutes prior to departure time and even though it was a 5 am departure, the aircraft was stuffy and hot. Given the tight seating, I was expecting a barebones service. This, however, was not the case, the in-flight service was outstanding. For breakfast, they served a tasty omelet sandwich. Service was fast, friendly and efficient, KLM unlike their American counterparts manage to serve the food and drinks at the same time.

My new husband lost his passport 2 days before our wedding, 5 days before flying to Madagascar. After a  passport office appointment they said it would likely be done by Mon/Tues when we were meant to be flying Monday. On Monday we were home waiting for the post hoping the passport would arrive before our evening flight that we booked with lastminute.com (spoiler alert, it didn't.) First thing we rang lastminute.com  to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didn't arrive, after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring KLM . So we rang KLM and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldn't be a problem to change and they would email the details through, so we waited a while. Then rang KLM again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again, then they of course didnt. Then rang KLM again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com Long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and KLM and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction. Now we treated ourselves with an expensive holiday for our once in a lifetime honeymoon but we are by no means able to just throw money away, and as noone would help after 6 solid hours of ringing people, we drove to manchester airport to see if anyone on a desk there would help. Turns out as i stand there making a fool out of myself sobbing my eyes out at the KLM desk they won't help us either and told us to ring the KLM number. So I had to make a decision, as we were unable to see if our flights could be changed to another day for a reasonable cost and in a panic of not being able to afford new flights for both of us I checked in myself and left him behind to sort this mess, in the end he just had to buy completely new flights, which also meant he couldn't fly back with me. I appreciate this whole mess was caused by a stupid mistake of my husbands, but seriously how hard is it to talk to someone about a change of flight . And even if it isn't something you can help with, how hard is it to not lie and say you will help but then don't, or even how hard is it to treat people with a little empathy and kindness. Every single person i have had to deal with from KLM, from the phone, helpdesk, check in desk and flight attendants were rude and looked like the last thing they wanted to do was do their job properly. And on the way back our bags were lost and every person dealing with that was equally unhelpful and rude.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Dubai to Quito and Guayaquil to Amsterdam, 3 legs in B777-200 and last leg in B777-300. It is the first time I have travelled with KLM and I must say it won’t be the last. I am really impressed with the quality of everything: fantastic clean aircrafts, comfortable seats, leg space which is the largest in the industry I believe for economy class, very experienced Pilots with smooth take offs and landings (in the Andes Mountains to be specific) amazing entertainment with Arabic movies and Halal food options on the Dubai legs, but most important I have to praise the flight attendants. They might be mostly above the 45 age range but they were all very active throughout the 4 legs I had with KLM, even the 12 hrs flights and they handled the situation of the delay due to the technical error with a lot of experience and patience and never showed any attitude to any passenger even the Humble Andean old ladies sitting next to me. They were very friendly and helpful especially to me to make me catch my connection in Amsterdam and they let me go first off the plane. They kept me informed about my Dubai flight situation. Even when my luggage didn’t make it to my Dubai flight the situation was handled in a very professional way. I arrived in Dubai and headed to the lost luggage desk to be surprised that the agent was emailed by KLM about my luggage situation and informed me that my luggage would be delivered on the next flight which was emailed to me as well by the airline. My luggage arrived safely and was delivered to me followed by another apology email for the incident. No wonder KLM is the oldest airline still in service and celebrating 98 years.

They didn’t answer right away, so the next morning I received a message saying that they are not taking my pet in the cabin from Amsterdam to Dublin because they are not approved carrier and it's only possible in cargo, which I understand but don’t understand why they never said anything while I was booking my flight? I was very disappointed, had to change all plans, rebook hotels etc. When I called customer service for explanation I did not receive any answer and they didn’t even know what i’m talking about, being very rude.

I got a text at 5pm the evening before my flight (original booking 11.20am next morning) to say that my flight had been cancelled due to high winds at Schiphol (Amsterdam); obviously there will have been a lot of planes affected and thousands of passengers so I was anxious about how I would get to my niece's wedding! I sent a personal message on Facebook (couldn't get hold of them any other way - all lines busy etc, not surprisingly) asking if there was any chance they could put me on the Lufthansa flight at 10.40am (direct, so avoiding Schiphol altogether); there was no reply by the time I went to bed but I awoke to a text message at 6.45am saying they had rebooked me on the direct Lufthansa flight to Munich as requested!

No response from flight attendant to service call. Food quality poor: bland and boring.

So what? Is this even legal? My husband (booked on the same flight) called KLM and because we had to be home within noon on December 1st, they booked us on a Emirates flight via Dubai on 9pm on November 30st. We almost didn’t make it to the check in, couldn’t get seats next to each other anymore. So how is this working: they just send a mail, hoping people are just accepting the change?

During boarding to Accra I told the staff that its very important to fly with my luggage and asked them to reassure its packed to the plane. They replied me they would do it for me. I boarded the plane with trusting them. They delayed my luggage (4 bags 23 kg each). I did not know when I would get it back so had to book the hotel in Accra instead of going by the car directly to Kumasi after landing. I went to Ghana during my time off from work. Delaying my luggage ruined my trip! The third day I had to buy some aids to be able to start my work with kids. Meantime I had to struggle with organizing picking my luggage up from the airport as I was in Kumasi when it finally arrived. They did not organized delivery to Kumasi. I involve few people to help me with my challenge. They called the airport every few hours, they were looking for somebody we can trust to pick my luggage up. I paid for the man who came at the airport to do that instead of me, he passed the bags to the bus to Kumasi, I also paid for the taxi to the place I stayed near Kumasi. Etc. I had to buy items like clothes, shoes, cosmetics, drops, etc. I had to buy to use as I landed just in pair of jeans, trainers and jacket. I did not know when my luggage would be with me. I wrote a letter of complaint to KLM. Attached about 10 invoices for the items I had to buy. KLM replied me after one week. They decide to pay me only 100 EUR compensation. For delaying 4 bags! I had to organize by myself picking the bags up and delivery to different city and paid a lot for that. I did not agree with their decision. But they are not going to change their mind.

KLM ground staff at BKK very nice and helpful/Baggage drop of very quick and efficient. Boeing 777-300ER took off punctually, cabin very clean but flight 100% full and 10 seats/row very cramp and uncomfortable. Flew KLM in 2013 and noted that 4 years later in 2017 KLM new Y seat of B777-300ER is narrower than the seats of 2013 and there was no footrest anymore which makes the long range travel less comfortable. But new excellent IFE with more choices of music and movies in several languages. Cabin crews were aged but very friendly, professional and enthusiasm throughout the flight. One hour after taken off hot towel was given before serving lunch. Quantity and quality of lunch in 2017 was average of Y class standard. After lunch duty free sales with great selections at attractive price (cheaper than Airport Bangkok). Unlike other airlines after lunch and duty free sale most of crews were still on duty and came often with soft drinks and ice cream during the rest time. Before landing at AMS we got 1 cold meal. After landing KLM crews still on “enthusiasm service” helping passengers took out the cabin baggage/ saying thank you and goodbye with smiles. Negative points compare with 2013 is narrow seat and food/beverage. In 2017 we got only 1 hot meal (lunch) and 1 cold meal (snack) for 12 hours flight compared with 2 hot meals (Lunch & Dinner) in 2013 but KLM’s enthusiasm cabin crews made these 2 negative points quit. Transit at Amsterdam is easy and convenience as always. On AMS-HAM short leg with better service than other European airlines. KLM served sandwich and full drinks including beer and wine on this short leg. All in all best value for money and KLM’s Y-class is beside Air France one of the best Y class of European airlines.

If things go wrong, you face an upward battle against limited options (flights), limited resources (costumer services, customer assistance). I paid 1700 euro for a comfort seat and they left me stranded in Amsterdam. No duty of care to be sure that I reach my final destination from the KLM side. Out the door the EU legal requirements.  The plane out of Houston has an issue, KLM needs to get it fixed. Paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. Most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure. Staff at the gate scare people away which see the issues coming because of their prior experiences. Before we fly, they have to get some drunken passengers of the plane including the one sitting next to me. Not even a Sorry Sir. Service degree as in nineties, AC dripping, cold all night, no new water bottle - I will fill it up for you Sir (really in comfort). Inflight entertainment system bad, no subtitle, breaks down and restarts issues etc. We get to Amsterdam. The whole 747 with connecting issues floods the service desk. They get annoyed by the passengers frustration, this situation ends up being hostile at the desk. The staff is well aware that due to end of holiday week KLM basically has no options  to offer passengers. Air France is full, KLM flights are full, Speed train are full (see later train desk told me). They give me a regular train ticket. While waiting the same women as at the gate reiterates her problem of meeting her connection to the river cruise in Basel. I suggest to call Lufthansa desk immediately as the only option to meet her deadline. The Service women all get hostile towards me. While the train ticket system breaksdown again, I notice the KLM assistance going in the Lufthansa option eventually. I get a train ticket no date no hour only a destination. The service assistant write down the departure time of the train by hand. Insists seat is numbered and I need to make it on time. I file a claim for my luggage and hope to meet my train. No train that fits departure time on screen. Queue to the train desk - no this is a train ticket but one for any train. No Sir Thalys is full  to Brussels. No regular train service, only this weekend works on the line. I find the Service desk in Terminal 2, have the 24 H desk of the Travel agency speak to the KLM rep. Travel agency insist KLM book me on the 8PM flight in Business, KLM refuses on grounds that there is awaiting list of economy passengers.

My customer journey with KLM left an incredible impact that marketing specialists can only dream of. It kept going on for over a month longer than my actual journey with KLM and created a number of lasting memories. The actual journey, however, never quite unfolded its full potential like a butterfly that's stuck in his cocoon. What a shame, I've heard many others say that KLM is a great airline. I can only verify this partially as out of the 4 flights I booked with KLM, I ended up only taking one. Here is why: One day before my departure from Berlin to Osaka, I received news that my connecting flight from Amsterdam to Osaka was cancelled. During the darkest hours of the night, some courageous customer service worker managed to put me on a Finnair flight which turned out to be a more than decent replacement. However, my chance to experience the Dutch Air Hospitality that KLM is renowned for was delayed. Talking about delayed, let me tell you the story of my flight home. The long haul from Osaka to Amsterdam was the only one out of the 4 KLM flights that I ended up taking. Once you manage to actually catch a KLM flight that's not cancelled, you receive warm and friendly service by the crew, decent-tasting food and a wide range of the latest cinematic enterainment options plus games and series. They even had some automatic kind of window blinds that turned the windows into a dark shade of blue (instead of the typical plastic blinds you get). This was very nice. I only wish I'd stayed up in the air for longer because as soon as we touched down in Amsterdam Schiphol, the chaos resumed. My flight to Berlin-Tegel was cancelled and I had to search for a replacement along with the numbers of other passengers who experienced a similar fate on that day. I arrived at Schiphol at 2 pm. The following hours included: me waiting in line - me being booked on a Lufthansa flight - being sent back from Lufthansa boarding because my name didn't get forwarded to Lufthansa - waiting in line again - being put on the waiting list for the KLM flight to Berlin later that evening - being sent back from boarding again because I didn't make it off the waiting list into the plane. Gotta mention that the customer service at Schiphol was very helpful the whole time, going through all possible options with me (I was disappointed that a rental car wasn't one, though!). You should have seen the look on the lady's face when I came back after the second failed connection around 9 pm. After 7 hours of from-A-to-B at Schiphol I resigned and agreed to a train connection the next morning and a hotel stay. These worked out. Unfortunately, my backpack got stuck in the loop at Schiphol and couldn't be given to me while I was there. It had to be claimed as ""missing"" and mailed to my address afterwards. Turns out the claim became real. My backpack really went missing and I had to wait 3 more weeks for it until receiving basically my whole wardrobe and souvenirs. Now that I am writing this, the compensation for products I had to buy as replacements for my delayed baggage has finally been paid (without problems) and I feel like my soul is finally at peace with this adventurous episode of being a KLM customer. When time has done its job mending the wounds, I will not hesitate to give KLM a second try. Looking forward to this future experience, a part of me hopes for another story to tell. Most of me however just hopes for a journey without the complications of this one.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Though the first flight had a delay and we hardly arrived on time at the connecting flight to Amsterdam, the ground staff reopened the gate and let us in. At Amsterdam Schiphol airport there was bad weather so there were a lot of passengers coming late. Unfortunately our baggage did not make it in time which I totally understand considering the circumstance of a connecting time below 20 min. When we arrived in Tokyo Narita the ground staff already prepared a baggage loss claim form with our names on it and informed us that the baggage will probably arrive the next day but latest the day after the next day. So we went shopping to get some necessary clothes for the next day, assuming that the baggage will arrive soon. I got e-mails, facebook, whatsapp and sms notifications that the baggage is already on the flight to Tokyo-Narita. The next I called the ground staff to ask for any news and they could not say anything specific, but called back a few hours later to inform us, that our baggage will arrive in the evening between 5 and 10 pm at the place in Tokyo, where we stayed. About half past 6 the baggage arrived. Excellent. Then I filled in the compensation form for the clothes I had to buy, and got a response within 2 days that the total cost of about 110 EUR will be refunded within 2-3 weeks. With Etihad I am still waiting after more than 1 month for any response for the reimbursement after I had a flight cancellation with a nightmare experience. With KLM I  felt that all the people are very concerned about any detail that is relevant for the passenger experience. Problems always arise at some point but how an airline company deals with it, makes a difference. From a passenger perspective, I really don't know, what they could have done better. The ticket price was also very competitive, especially considering that I booked 2 days in advance. It was the second inexpensive option and the connection with the shortest travel time. So value for money was really excellent! So if KLM offers a competitive price I would always this airline to an alternative. The service quality was remarkable and I always felt well taken care of.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

I know mistakes happen but a smile goes a long way especially for a customer who's patient. But anyways KLM did purchase me a new flight and that's it. I got nothing else from it.

Overall KLM offers a good service and has a great flight network. However, as soon as something goes wrong, don't count on this airline. I have now experienced it for the second time that a flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions and KLM just did not manage to provide any support. There is a busy hotline and the fact that you may miss your original connection once bad weather hits is totally understandable. The way how KLM reacts to this, however, is incredibly bad. In both cases, the airline sent an e-mail telling us that they would contact us within the next three hours, but in fact, they never (not even after two days) write or call back. You cannot reach the hotline (you get disconnected after one hour of waiting) or their Whatsapp support. When I tried to re-book online (which they offer for free under these conditions and advice you to do in their cancellation e-mail), the online-system aborts the re-booking process and displays a random error message. What worked for me last time is to book a flight with another airline and ask for a ticket refund at KLM. In sum, the airline just dumped me and didn't manage to provide any support. I would therefore not recommend this airline if you fly via Schiphol (frequently strong winds and flight cancellations) or you need support after something goes wrong.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

In the return flight at the airport they said the airplane is full so the forced us to put our handbags which contains all of our important things in luggage, and they did it again and send a (sorry sms) that the bag (which contains the car and home keys) will be delayed..

It was a long time ago since I flew KLM, mainly because of the price: KLM always turns out to be more expensive than other airlines. This time it was slightly more expensive than Alitalia, but since I was looking for a reliable airline -and not an insolvent one like Alitalia or Air Berlin, or an unreliable airline which cancels thousands of flights like Ryanair- I booked KLM. And I wasn't disappointed: smooth online check-in, super fast luggage drop-off at both airports, very friendly crew, rather good legroom, a decent snack and a drink, smooth flight and punctual arrival.. Just great. The only downside: the high price for luggage. I paid 100 euros for two bags. That's way too much, especially if you have a look at the big suitcases brought on board. If i only had known. KLM should really be more strict with hand luggage. Otherwise: would definitely fly again.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

All flights departed and landed on timee. Flight from MAN-AMS was very short, we were served a free snack and a free drink. Amsterdam to Seoul was less bearable. The Boeing 747 is very old and cramped, IFE is outdated and there are no USB sockets. The seat controls are kept in the arm rest and every time I leaned that way while trying to sleep I would accidentally lean onto the buttons and turn either the overhead light or the IFE on. Food was edible, wasn't really expecting much from economy. We were served dinner first, and the Korean option was available, then breakfast was served before landing.

We leave on a 12-day cruise in an hour with only the clothes on our backs. Every time we call KLM they just tell us to go out and buy more clothes. No sympathy or apologies. And it’s not that simple. We have suitcases full of expensive snow gear for our winter getaway. We can’t replace it easily. And by now the shops are shut where we are and we can’t even get more underwear. Every person at KLM has been rude, unprofessional and unhelpful. I would never fly with this company again. Outrageous service.

My last trip was uneventful. I was able to purchase comfort seats online, I was able to do mobile check in via app, mobile boarding passes worked, and I had no delay at any point at all airports of my travel. Check in desks in Kiev and Dusseldorf are well staffed and provide a very smooth and competent treatment. Onboard it was all right. Clean cabins, clean toilets, cheerful staff and smart snack concept including bar service. Somehow there was no battle over overhead luggage space despite full flights. Flights out were bang on time. Flights back both delayed by 50 min due to snow, but with excellent communication from the gate staff and then from the crew. Announcements onboard about connection gates and delays are much appreciated. Overall I had around 40 flights with AirFrance/KLM within last 12 months, and can say that at any case including flight cancellations I got very responsible and reasonable treatment. Highly recommended. P.S. I paid just 150 USD for roundtrip, so great value. P.P.S. Due to constant rush in Amsterdam only bus gates both ways for both Schengen and non-Schengen flights.

After a rushed flight from Nice to Amsterdam we were left with only 45 minutes, but I  wanted to have a freshen-up in the lounge. The airport is chaotic, but the KLM lounge was worse. I have never seen so many people in such a crowded space. You can’t find any decent seats and then there isn’t any space between chairs. After a quick coffee and a toilet break we left for the boarding gate. Well, even worse - there is a long queue for passport control. When we got to the gate it was already boarding time. The 777 was ok. Slightly angled seats with a tiny tiny foothold. I am 5.6 and my feet barely fit in it. When flat the bed is comfy but one has to angle ones feet sideways. The blanket is soft and warm. Service was very efficient but at times I couldn’t find any staff. Since it was a daylight flight I had to watch TV and eat. Food wasn’t great - beef curry was a reconstituted shredded beef without any flavour. The other choices were worse. Drinks were good. The pre-arrival snack was a dec3nt hamburger but it was cold. The amenity kit was poor - worse than most economy class. Just a pair of sock, toothbrush and toothpaste. And an eyeshade. We had a 1.5 hour delay due to a technical issue, which is not the airline’s fault, but still, they didn’t give us any drinks or snacks until after an hour. All in all, KLM has a lot to catch up on, even just within its group, to Air Feance’s standard. We flew AF in March, also business class, and it is a much superior airline. The French has a flair for service and food, while the Dutch has efficiency.

Admittedly the flight originated in Amsterdam so there was always the chance the arriving flight would be late. This proved to be the case and we left Singapore almost forty minutes late. The configuration of two seats by three per row (thirty seats per cabin) is ideal and there is plenty of leg room and the seats very comfortable.

They have all glossy Social Media on the website, but you only receive standard replies - nothing useful, no one cares. UK Customer Care do not care for anyone calling as they do not pick-up the phone - simple. Next time you book the flights, just dial the number and experience yourself.

Watch out if you pay for an upgrade and are unlucky enough to either get downgraded or have a cancelled flights. You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told ""the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight"". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone ""It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class"". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. All in all KLM are  not customer focused and are only focused on your money, making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. Whilst flying out of Dammam we have had our flight delayed (above flight) due to fog, we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information, hotel, transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. It took KLM 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport, and still we were not given any information.

Yep - he then handed the tray to a flight attendant and didnt think about the mouth guard for about 1/2 hour. He ran to the back and explained his predicament. The attendant we thought had taken his tray said he would check the trays. We were not feeling optimitistic, and also felt bad to be putting them to this work. He came to our seats later and said it wasnt in any of his trays. This was the answer we expected. We thanked him for his time and considered it a costly mistake. About an hour later, this gentleman came back and asked my son to come to the back. The attendants went through every single tray and found it!

On the other hand, I do not understand and accept the decisions of the station management in Zurich. It's dangerous to gamble with the loyalty of the top tier frequent flyer members. There is a vast choice for flights all over the globe and as frequent flyer I am able to make my choice! Either I get my tiers privileges or not and then I not booking anymore.

Have flown KLM before and will do again. Only annoying thing is fellow passengers with lots of hand luggage in cabin. One passenger got very aggressive with one crew member who needed to call the captain to get things calmed down. Problem was that the passenger was carrying too much hand luggage into the cabin.

It cost us an extra £92 on top of the flight which was already more expensive than other airlines. The flight was due to land at Leeds at just after 10pm. However the flight took off and then due to a technical issue had to return to Amsterdam. This is ok but no-one informed us of this, then after waiting we heard the flight the cancelled. Again no one called to say our son was safe, the chaperone we heard took our son to the KLM lounge and left him there with the lounge staff, neither the chaperone or the lounge staff thought to use the big folder around the child's neck to call the parents. Therefore we were running around Leeds trying to find out what was going on. We had called family in Amsterdam whom had return to the airport to see what was going on there also but no-one knew. Eventually at 01.30 we tracked him down to the KLM lounge. KLM never offered any apology or a hotel as thy are supposed to. Why didn't the chaperone or lounge staff call us. To me this is nothing more than neglect. KLM took 2 weeks to answer my email of complaint and then took 2 more to come back with an offer of the flight payment up to £250 plus £92 for the service and £100 family day if we paid for it first and sent them the receipt. The way they have been with us I am not sure they would do this so wouldn't spend that extra money on the off chance. I believe this is totally unacceptable as we are entitled by eu law for the flight money back so they for company like this to offer a £100 voucher for child neglect just goes to show how much emphasis they put on childrens well being.

On time, good legroom, decent snacks (especially the typical Dutch cheese-sandwich), very good choice of drinks. Best of all was the crew spirit! Cabin crew were charming on each and every flight, no matter how full the aircraft was. On one flight even the pilot came out of his cockpit and made his pre-departure announcement whilst standing in front of the guests giving the whole flight a personal touch.

This trip was booked using Flying Blue miles in economy and for both flights seat 11F (exit rows) was selected. I checked-in using the KLM app which is easy to use. In both Amsterdam as well in Oslo I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. Both flights were the typical KLM short haul service consisting of a pre-packed sandwich and a cup of coffee. What always strikes me is the difference in attitude between the mainline KLM and Cityhopper crews. The outbound flight to Oslo was operated by KLM Cityhopper EMB 190, a full flight with only 2 enthusiastic flight-attendants who managed to do 2 drink runs. The return flight was a 80% filled Boeing 737 with one purser and 4 male flight-attendants which were very busy studying their iPads during boarding.

They might seem value for money but I would rather pay more as the service I received was appalling. First of all was advised there were no seats for me when I was boarding so had to go back and sit down and wait for another flight which was very inconvient to me! Then I was brought last onto the plane because someone didn't show. We weren't even put on a KLM flight, it was City Jet and was tiny! You just about fitted on the seat, that's how uncomfortable it was. In comparison to it, easyJet seats etc are huge! Then I had to climb over people to get to my seat. There was no room for my bag had to have it on my knee. When I attracted the attention of the flight attendant and asked him to put my bag somewhere he said that I was supposed to tell them if I had a bag. They knew I had a bag because I carried it on the flight. They also walked passed me numerous times and saw it on my knee. Appalling customer service on top of everything else that happened. My feet are now on my bag, the heat is atrocious and the room is ridiculous. I've flown with other airlines and never again would I fly with KLM.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Boarding on time, departure also on time. Friendly crew. Told them I was not feeling well due to a chronic lung condition (have a FREMEC card). They immediately made aware and made a note. During the flight all went well. I found a diamond ring on the floor in front of me and handed it over to the purser. He checked for the person sitting in that row on the previous flight immediately to make sure that they could give the item back. The flight itself was short. The crew managed service in a breeze, Always friendly and smiling, the purser recognised me from previous flights (I am a flying blue platinum member). After landing and finally at the gate (which at Schiphol can take up to 15 minutes) everyone stood up. The family in front of me was apparently in a hurry, getting out all the hand luggage with a rush, even hitting me on the head, and the placing it even on the seats around them including mine. When walking out of the plane and being at the gate I realised that I left my iPad on my seat. But I was not allowed to go back. They told me that ""they will collect it for you"" and I had to go to ""lost and found"". There they told me to fill in an electronic document and within five days they would notify me. Well, after five days I received a message that the iPad had not been found and that they could not help me any further. What a pity, I mean I was less than a fewyards out of the plane and not even half of the passengers had left the plane so I could easily had picked it up.

However, when we checked in at LHR T5, we were informed that we had no allowance for checked in baggage, despite having purchased such allowance for 2 pieces at the time of purchase of our tickets. As a consequence, I had to repurchase baggage allowance. I subsequently emailed both KLM and the travel agency through which I purchased our tickets to have my baggage allowance refunded. However, despite my persistence and an exchange of emails, I have been told by KLM to claim my refund from the travel agency, whilst that travel agency told me to claim from KLM! It is obvious that either one is lying! I am very disappointed to say the least. I have been fobbed off by both KLM and the travel agency, both of which deny their responsibility to a paying customer. I expected much better from KLM, a supposedly reputable premier airline. But KLM is unethical and unprofessional, ignoring my latest email. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

We paid 1487.76 euros for the two tickets. Unfortunately I could not get back to Malaga in time to check in, so decided to go straight to Amsterdam and meet my partner there to catch the next leg of the flight. My partner  checked in at Malaga as planned and informed the representative at the check in counter that I couldn't get back to Malaga so was going to meet her in Amsterdam. My partner asked if the rep could arrange for our seats to be together for the Amsterdam to Panama flight. The rep advised it was best to both check in again together at Amsterdam. Once at Amsterdam check in desk the representative advised there is a problem and they need to go to the ticket desk. The ticket desk assistant tells me I will have to pay a 500 euro 'penalty' for missing the first flight. Even though I felt like he was being held to ransom I had little choice but to pay the 500 euro 'penalty' if I wanted to continue on the holiday. It took the ticket desk assistant at Amsterdam 10 minutes to carry out some admin and issue a new ticket. How can KLM justify 500 euros for this? It wasn't like we just 'no showed'. My partner checked in as scheduled and informed KLM at the check in desk at Malaga the situation. Why was nothing about penalties mentioned then? So disappointed at KLM's 'computer says no' attitude and their failure to see the customers point of view. Companies that hide behind t's & c's can not be trusted in my opinion. It's easy to be smiley and helpful when things are running to plan, it takes a real customer focused company to actually look into customers problems and come up with win win solutions. If you're flying KLM make sure you read the terms and conditions and don't expect any help if things go wrong.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

I upgraded to Business Class at check in for a reduced price, but to be honest I wish I hadn't bothered. KLM's Business Class product is inferior to that of other airlines I've flown with (e.g. BA, Emirates, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore) and worse than it used to be. The amenity kit was terrible and nothing more than you get with some airlines in Economy (socks, eye mask, toothbrush, tiny toothpaste). The food was no better than most economy food I've had. Some flight attendants weren't as friendly as they should be in Business Class, didn't smile much and didn't act like they were happy to serve you. It wasn't a personalised service as it is on Emirates and Qatar. Tip: Save your money and upgrade with another airline instead.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

I checked-in using the KLM app which is easy to use. In Amsterdam I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. Both flights were typical KLM short haul service operated by a KLM Boeing 737-800. On board service consists of a pre-packed sandwich and a drink of choice. The flight was 20 minutes delayed partly due to the late arrival of the aircraft and partly due to air traffic constraints over France. We arrived only 5 minutes late. Less pleasant was the 45min queue in front of the French border police. (Remember that France and The Netherlands are both founding members of the Schengen treaty). During the flight I have been consequently approached in English, even when I returned in Dutch! When returning at Lyon airport I found out there was a power cut at the airport. There was a long queue of passengers who could not be checked in. Security was closed. The Air France ground crew has done all they could fixing the issue and after a while all passengers were moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1B where we could pass security and head to a new gate. At the gate the airbridges did not work and all passengers had to embark after a short walk over the tarmac. Boarding was done manually by checking each passenger on a list. At the end we left 30 minutes late. The AF ground staff did a great job, considering there were no computers and no PA systems available. The return flight was operated by KLM Cityhopper EMB 190, a full flight with only 2 enthusiastic flight-attendants.

Rather good food and the friendliest flight attendant we have ever met, and we had traveled a lot with Malaysia Airlines, who till then were the champions of kindness. Seats a bit narrow but okay. Legroom not spacious but okay. Entertainment mostly boring trivial mainstream or old movies. The earphones are so incredibly bad - from my mother's language I didn't catch 25% of the dialogues, from French (my stepmother's language) and English I understood almost nothing. My husband decided to sleep and gave me his private earphones - that made a huge difference. Screens are very cheap, too. After one film, my eyes hurt and I decided to listen to one of my audiobooks.

Ground and onboard service very kind, food was average, but we had brought own provisions, mainly because they are not able to combine at least two food restrictions (for instance low carb and gluten free). Entertainment was poor, earphones same scrap as on the inflight. As I always bring my own comfortable down cushion, I manage to sleep even in Economy seats, so that was no problem. AMS-FRA: Started a bit later, same annoying snack as on the inflight, of course.

Small things that used to make the 8,5 hour trip nicer eg the Entertainment screens are old, the entertainment was not working on this trip for the entire way, the food has gone down in quality, less options for Economy class. One really big annoyance is my spouse had to pay for a seat to sit by me. One can see the cutbacks to service and this is not too good. The airline used to have a section for you too hydrate, have a small snack etc - that has disappeared.

The boarding of the flight KL1358 started 20 minutes late and we were in the sky about 10 minutes behind schedule so it was quite an efficient boarding process. My seat (1F) was very comfortable with plenty of leg room. As the Embraer 190 has a 2-2 seat configuration even in business, I had someone seated next to me. After the take-off, a dinner was served even with the short flight time. The appetizer consisted of beetroot and apple salad and smoked trout and was delicious for an airline appetizer.

For my trip from Prague to Moscow, March 14th, I had to make a quick stop in Amsterdam and therefore booked KL1356/KL3178 flights. However, before the flight, I got informed that Amsterdam lag will be operated by Transavia. As a consequence, no comfortable seats available. Such a change makes a big difference, given ridiculously small seat pitch at Transavia. If you value a basic level of comfort, you would avoid Transavia. Unfortunately, I was given no choice. During my online check-in at KLM websites I was also invited to “choose seat for free”. Just to learn, such a choice is in fact not available for me, given Moscow lag is operated by Aeroflot. Puzzled, I asked why it cannot be done given both KLM and Aeroflot are members of SkyTeam alliance. I learned that this is due to the fact that the respective systems are not interconnected as yet and ""choose your seat"" therefore no option. Expression ""as yet"" sounds real pathetic, given KLM is member of SkyTeam for already 14 years and Aeroflot for 12 years. Management of Sky Alliance must be real preoccupied by other issues if there was no time to implement such a simple feature like seat selection. In a summary, my KLM flight was no KLM flight.

Unfortunately, my bag was held at the custom, and only after two weeks of nagging they finally clarified that they can't deliver it and I need to take it personally from Luxembourg custom. Since I live in France, (in Pau, very far away from Luxembourg), I had to travel back to get it. The transportation is already expensive and if the delay didn't happen I would have avoided this problem. So I talked to the costumer service to refund me the transportation and until Now I get rejection. When I got my bag, it was completely broken and damaged but they told me that I could not send a reclamation because I did mot get my bag only after 3 weeks of my flight.",Business,1.0,3.0
nan,Economy Class,5.0,April 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Amsterdam to Birmingham,4.0," | Amsterdam to Birmingham. Since I'm not feeling very comfortable flying I am always searching for more information on internet on how to feel better etc. and I read an article that if you tell the flight attendant when you arrive in the aircraft that you are not feeling confident to fly then they can give you a bit more attention and believe me, it feels much better. I do that each time now but this time was very different as the flight attendant actually directed me to the pilots before take off so that I could ask questions and talk to both (pilot and co-pilot). They asked me at which moment of flying is uncomfortable for me and they gave me some explanations and answered to my questions for 5 minutes. I had no issue after that flying in the aircraft anymore that day. I was really relax and could attend my business meeting on a very relaxing mood too. I felt home! That's why I am choosing for KLM.",Business,4.0,4.0

The flight from MAN to AMS was punctual and excellent. I had upgraded to an extra legroom seat for £5 and it was more than worth it. The cabin layout is 3-3 and there was nobody else in my entire row either side! A small breakfast sandwich and hot and cold drinks were served. The cabin crew were excellent. The flight from AMS to LAX left slightly late but arrived bang on time. The cabin crew were wonderful, and my favourite thing about this flight. Last minute at AMS I upgraded to an extra legroom emergency exit seat; it wasn't worth it. The seat was narrow and, frankly, uncomfortable. Two meals were served during the flight, as well as snacks and regular drinks. There was also a self service bar for drinks and snacks; excellent feature. The food and drink were fine. Unfortunately, the IFE didn't work for most of the flight, which was disappointing. Overall, KLM wasn't perfect, but represented value for money and a fairly good product. The cabin crew on both flights were superb.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

The seat has a broken head support and when I mentioned that there was no help provided. I had to travel a long flight of approx 9 hours without proper head support. Staff are not friendly at all they won’t respond well.  I would never prefer this flight until this is my last option. Air Canada is  good with friendly staff and the give the best service in terms of seating and comfort and provide fine food. ,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

KLM have really got it right on this route and show that short haul can still be pleasant. Charming cabin crew, nice seats and even a snack of a sandwich, biscuit and drink served during the short 45 minute journey. Nothing at all to complain about. I will definitely fly with them again.",Business,4.0,nan

Very friendly cabin crew, and on time arrival both directions for Aberdeen to Amsterdam. The stewardess went out of her way to help us with our infant son. Passport control was not enjoyable on departure from Schipol (extremely long queues at 8.50am) but otherwise a pleasant journey.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,London to Abu Dhabi via Amsterdam,2.0, | KLM is the worst airline I have ever had opportunity to fly with. Horrible service from the beginning to the very end. They lost my son's luggage twice. When missed connecting flight on my way back was forced to pay for a new ticket. I was told that if I decide to fly with another airline (some of them were 3 times cheaper) I would have to pay 200 euro to get my luggage back (for the luggage that was lost anyway). Service on the plane was below any standard. Lady who was serving us obviously had a bad day and she was extremely rude. She was shouting at people. not enough food so never got what I wanted to. When asked for a drink I was told the bar was closed while someone behind me was served by other person.,Family Leisure,1.0,nan

KLM new ""revenue"" based customer rewards program that does not reward you when you spend more revenue. I fly with KLM on medium haul and short haul flights 8 times a month. When they changed their loyal program earlier this year I kept away from posting anything and waited to see how it would affect me. I am sorry to say that KLM staff on this flight have at best misunderstood the terms and conditions or at worst are purposely misleading customers on the terms and conditions of KLM's new loyalty program. I always upgrade to business class when there are seats available from my economy ticket and more often than not pay full price. On this occasion i paid $900 ontop of my existing ticket to upgrade after confirming with the KLM staff that I would indeed receive the 24XP points in order to retrain my gold status. The flight went well until i noticed that I had only been awarded 8XP points via my KLM app. Upon questioning KLM on this after the flight they informed me that although their system is now revenue based that this ""revenue based"" program do not recognise this type of revenue based spend?? I am now in the process of changing airlines. 8 x minimum and short haul flights worth of revenue based pending walking our the door for KLM.",Business,1.0,1.0

Boeing 737-800,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,London to Amsterdam,3.0," |  London to Amsterdam return. Original outbound flight cancelled due to staff shortages. To make matters worse, my rebooked flight was also cancelled, as was the one afterwards. One angry phone call later, I discovered my rebooked flights had not been cancelled, rather KLM had not entered by booking in to the flight correctly. I was eventually rebooked on to a convenient alternative KLM flight, but lo and behold, on the day I was due to fly, my flight was cancelled. After another angry phone call, I took an pleasant and uneventful BA flight to Amsterdam. Sure enough, my return flight on KLM was cancelled due to technical issues with the plane and my rebooked flight delayed by an hour. To their credit, KLM air crew were very nice and their planes clean. However, the chaos in which KLM seem to operate has put me off flying with them in the future.",Business,1.0,nan

I showed doctor letters explaining the necessity of the equipment. They threatened to not let me on the plane unless I agreed to let them put it in the hold with other luggage. Eventually this was my only option, with compliance and management contact being refused. This is especially disappointing of an allegedly high class airline. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 737 / 767,Economy Class,3.0,May 2018,2.0,4.0,3.0,no,Tel Aviv to San Francisco via Amsterdam,3.0," |  Tel Aviv to San Francisco via Amsterdam. The flight from Tel Aviv to Amsterdam was aircraft Boeing 737. It was a fully packed plane with only two restrooms for 5 hour flight. The aircraft had no entertainment and the two restrooms were not sufficient for the entire economy class section. There were lines constantly for the use of the facility. I don't know why KLM would use such an aircraft for 5 hour trip. On the other hand, the flight from Amsterdam to SFO in Boeing 767 was a totally different experience. The aircraft was much larger and it didn't fill to the capacity so it was much more pleasant flight with less aggravated passengers. Each seat had its individual screen for the entertainment.",Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0

The seat was comfortable, the cabin crew were wonderful, the in-flight entertainment was good, could be a little broader but cannot complain. The food though was rubbish, they ran out of beef when they got to me but that isn't the problem it's more the quality of food, they do come round with drinks a lot which is great. Really smooth flight. I've been on an American airline and they're terrible, so it's an overall thumbs up for KLM long haul flights.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

Fortunately none of our flights were cancelled, though our connecting flight from Manchester  was delayed and gave only us 20 mins in Amsterdam to catch our Lima flight. Staff were extremely good in up-dating the information and honest, saying if we were late the next flight would not wait. Our long-haul experience was fantastic, no delays or luggage issues, the FA's were really friendly and engaging; it was obvious that they took pride in their jobs. The seats are really comfortable and lie flat - on return flight slept for 6 hours. The IFE was current, good resolution and although the screen was fixed never felt I wanted to adjust the screen. Catering was of a high standard and tasty (though not as great variety of choice as offered by middle eastern airlines) and was never left lacking. One the subject of catering, the photos of short-haul sector catering - the chicken salad with accompaniment is what KLM presented on AMS to MAN compared with our BA Club Europe meagre offering of an unappetising  chicken sandwich (GOT to MAN in Feb 2018). Overall really impressed and would not hesitate flying KLM business class long-haul again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,3.0,December 2017,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Bahrain to Kuwait,4.0," |  Bahrain to Kuwait on an A330 in December 2017.  On this 1 hr flight, they served juices and waffle. The plane looks old and the crew looked tired which resonates as a gloomy trip. This is the cheapest ticket compare to the legacy and budget airlines flying between this route. Seat pitch is ok. Upon landing, we were stranded in the taxi way due to some other delayed airline blocking our designated gate. Since we were not moving, the air became really hard to breathe in as it smelled like the exhaust from the engine. A female passenger went ill and her children got out of their seats to seek assistance but a crew sitting behind a few rows shouted at them to sit since the plane is still taxiing. Unfortunately, none of the crew who were assisting can speak Arabic. How can an airline send their plane to an Arab country with arabic speaking travelers with cabin crew who do not speak the language?!",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
