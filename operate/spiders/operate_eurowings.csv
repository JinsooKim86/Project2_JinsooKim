nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Koln to Budapest,2.0," |  Second time I have flown Eurowings - never again. It is a truly miserable airline. The first time I flew (Koln-Zurich) my first flight was delayed 2.5 hours, and my return flight was delayed 1.5 hours. However, that is pleasant compared to my most recent experience, a Friday night flight scheduled from Koln-Budapest. After waiting more than three hours after hour initial 6:10 departure time, we boarded the plane. It was at that point that the pilot came on the intercom and informed us that the flight had exceeded the maximum time a flight crew is allowed to be ""on"", and thus the crew could not fly us. This was intentional - the delay was publicized fairly early, and avoiding the regulation would have literally been as simple as looking at one's watch. Additionally, there were only two staff working the customer service line for several hundred passengers. Took roughly an hour and a half to move thirty people through before me - can't imagine the people in the back of the line. Once I got to the desk, my questions were ignored and I was handed a ""Customer Relations"" card with a phone number that rang for over an hour with no response. Flight was delayed until the next morning at 10:10 AM, which means that everything I booked in Budapest (a little under 200 Euros) went by the wayside without being used. Absolutely pathetic airline. Your flight will not take off on time. The staff will try to scam you (and deny the EU regulations regarding passenger rights that are a) easily available online b) on a card in the airport). You would be better off walking.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

Ended up using the train. On the return flight the flight was delayed by 75 minutes and upon reaching London had to pay extra money for overstaying in the car park. On top of it my baggage was damaged by handlers. No apology has been offered. Have put in a claim and up to now they haven't acknowledged anything only to be given a claim/ticket number.

A320,Economy Class,4.0,July 2018,4.0,3.0,nan,yes,Munich to Dortmund,4.0," |  I was flying from Munich to Dortmund on Eurowings. This flight is also a Lufthansa codeshare flight. At Munich Airport, Eurowings departs from the modern and sleek Terminal 2 (i.e. the Lufthansa terminal). Eurowings has its own counters with its own agents and a different booking system, therefore its not possible to check in at the Lufthansa counters. There is a separate counter for Business Class/HON/FTL/Sen passengers. While Eurowings is not part of the Star Alliance, they have an agreement with Air Canada/United/ANA so that as a United Gold passenger I could use the lounge and priority check-in. No priority bag tags, though: they do not have them at all. The flight itself was good. In the so-called Smart fare a sandwich and a non-alcoholic drink plus water were included. Foodwise that is more than Lufthansa would offer on a domestic flight. The first ten rows have regular Lufthansa legspace, beginning in row 11 it is much more narrow. There was an additional 5€ charge for a seat in the first ten rows even in Smart fare/UA Gold. Crew was good. Flight was on time and boarding easy. I still prefer full-service carriers, but if Eurowings is considered low-cost than it is probably the best low cost carrier for me. Sidenote: The business class fare would have been 30€ more expensive.",Business,5.0,nan

The cabin crew was very friendly and courteous. The seat was more comfortable than other low-cost airlines. I also greatly appreciated being allowed to take my hand-trolley on board, boarding the flight through a jet bridge, rather than a crammed bus and, most of all, being able to select a seat for free.

I just went through the worst logistical nightmare while checking in for my Eurowings flight from Düsseldorf to Moscow on Eurowings. (July 27, 2016). I live in USA and was visiting my husband in Germany and then flying to Russia to visit my mom for two weeks. I was 26 weeks pregnant and my doctor had no issues with me traveling. I did not cover my pregnant belly (huge mistake!!) and was asked for a 'Mother's Pass'. I explained to them that my doctor in Texas approved my travel and that we do not have special mother's passes. The lady at check in called her boss who came to talk to me and proceeded to explain that all pregnant women in Europe are supposed to have a mother's pass from their doctor. It's the law. I pulled up my online medical records and sonogram to prove how many weeks I was but it was not enough. He insisted on mother's pass. Of course I tried to argue with him and he told my husband that I was slow in the head and he preferred to talk to him instead! That comment annoyed even more. They denied me getting on the plane and sent me to a different section of the airport to rebook the flight. Turns out all flight were booked for the next three days and my ticket was non refundable. And my mom was already on her way to Moscow to meet me! (She lives 6 hours away from Moscow by train). I was devastated but refused to take no for an answer. It was 30 minutes before departure, and I thought what do I have to lose? So I put on a very loose cardigan that completely covers the belly and decided to go through the same check in just go to a different desk. The most important thing was not to run into the manager who called me stupid and not be noticed by the lady who checked me in originally. I was lucky and it worked this time! They did not ask me for mother's pass since I covered myself. I went through security, got on the last shuttle to the plane, and just as I was taking a deep sigh of relief an airport official walked in right before the shuttle left and asked me if I was the one pregnant.  So I had to get off the shuttle and be interrogated again at the gate, this time by three people. After pleading with them and shedding a few tears, one of them asked about my due date. I told her November (three months away) and she laughed and said I was good to go! To make things worse they lost my baggage and it has been 4 days now and no bag yet.

Using a similar model to Easyjet and Ryanair of charging extra for everything doesn't work for long haul flights. I was carrying hand luggage and took food bought at the airport on board, which ended up being much cheaper than buying their smart fair. I did purchase sandwiches onboard which were honestly terrible and overpriced, and they also charge an extra 9-10 euros for in flight entertainment. The connecting flight was also delayed 3 times, the third time wasnt even announced meaning that I had bought a replacement transfer ticket from the airport only to miss it for a second time (I missed the first due to delays as well). The only thing they give to you is water, the absolute basic needed for human survival on a 12 hour flight and they don't even offer that very often. Not only this, but it seems that they hugely overbook their flights. In Bangkok there were signs asking people to voluntarily surrender their seats in return for 300 euros worth of vouchers. The check in queues were huge and at Heathrow they lumped all the check in and baggage drop queues into one without even any separation for the destinations. The online check in and self check in counters would not work. Luckily I alerted a staff member to this fact and he accelerated me to the front of the queue as I did not have luggage to check. If I had waited in the lines which were probably at least 1 hour long then I would have possibly missed my flight. On arrival to cologne airport the flight connection desk was empty, leading people to queue aimlessly for no reason. No one showedup and a security person had to come and explain where people should go to catch their connecting flights. I planned initially to buy food for the long flight in Cologne but got to the Eurowings terminal only to realise there was only a single cafe selling absolute basics such as overpirced croissants. Overall the flight was not that much cheaper than alternatives which include hold luggage and recognise the importance of food, refreshments and entertainment on a long flight. While I expected the food situation, the menu should not be so expensive and the cost of the flight should reflect the lack of amenities like other budget airlines and the customer service should not quite be so sub-par.

It is a small carry-on bag with wheels which is no larger than any other, but it was preposterous even to attempt it, because the aisle seat and middle seat were already occupied by people, and it was clear that the luggage would not fit underneath my seat. Being stuck between people waiting from behind to get on the airplane and unable to find a spot for my luggage, I asked the flight attendants if I can place the luggage temporarily and find a spot somewhere in the front; one of the flight attendants frowned and snapped at me saying there is no space for them to save the luggage for me. The flight attendants simply stood there at the entrance without offering any help or solution to the problem while observing the difficulties that I was going through. I unanimously decided to leave my bag with the attendant as the only other choice was to either get off the plane with it or abandon my luggage; I chose the latter. The flight attendant later grudingly took my bag and handed it to another flight attendant in the front asking him to find a spot.

I flew to Barcelona for the same price with Niki who offered non-stop beverages and even some snacks. Second rate terminals and airports. Although only 8kg baggage is allowed most passengers had huge enormous bags - which led to poor space within cabin luggage compartments.

Friendly crew and good info from the cockpit. Booked basic so no food, but can't complain for 50 euros. CRJ900 is nice because of the much better legroom than on other LCC.

I was on a direct flight, no connections, and I wasn't late, so there was no obvious reason why my bag wouldn't land with me. What was worse was the tracking system. Although my bag was apparently on the next flight on the same day, I didn't find out anything about the status until two days later. On the same flight as me was a French woman who didn't receive her bag but her boyfriend did even thought they checked in their bags at the same time. When it finally indicated that ""item was located "" I went to Tegel to pick up my bag instead of waiting for delivery. I couldn't do much for two days because I didn't know when my bag would be delivered. When I went to pick up my bag, the bag recovery area in terminal C was like a zoo but this isn't just Eurowings's problem. But I did meet other people there who were putting in complaints at Eurowings for lost/misplaced bags from Paris as well. This seems to be a recurring problem I fly fairly often and my bag has been delayed only once. This is a short flight from Paris to Berlin. Such inefficiency!

Staff has a list indicating fare code of each passenger and serve free drinks only to those eligible, which at online check in 48 hrs (rather than 24) before flight passengers can pay for additions. The flight is similar to say Easyjet but better in that Eurowings does not make it difficult for passengers like Easyjet to stipulate that passengers must print boarding passes, and with Eurowings paying for luggage at counter costs the same, unlike Easyjet it costs more if not prepaid. The fight is on time and not bad in itself, except the arrival airport is Stansted that is inconvenient. I chose Eurowings for a lower fare than BA, but with a piece of check-in luggage charged for 30 Euros, and the inconvenience of Stansted (difficult / costly / time consuming public transportation) I have to say it is false economy to fly Eurowings on this route.

I was very dissapointed with the way I was treated by the crew, specially by a lady from the cabin crew. The flight was delayed, which can happen. But how hard is it to give the people waiting in line a heads up? Then by entering the plane it was hard for the crew to great their customers. I greeted them in their language and asked if there maybe was any room for my suitcase (which was the size it was allowed to be). The answer was no. I asked what I was supposed to do. She said in a very unpolite way that it could be packed downstairs. I was a little bit shocked by the impoliteness of the crew. If you become a cabin crew I think one of the first things you learn is to be polite! It was not my fault that the flight was delayed. ",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
A330-200,Premium Economy,3.0,February 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,Varadero to Cologne,2.0," |  Varadero to Cologne with Eurowings. First time I used a low-cost company for a long-haul flight. Put it simply, avoid using low cost on long flights unless you have no other options. I knew the remarks / complaints about the company so I was well prepared and it fullfilled my expectations. First some good points: Check-in was very fast as well as the boarding.  Departure on time and arrival in advance (great!). New equipement and safe feeling.  Now the negative: Food: don't expect anything grandiose from it. Actually the cold meal is just 2 big bread slices with a thin layer of ham. The main complaint is that you would get something better for a cold meal you order on board. The thing is, you paid extra for this meal. Comfort: seats are in textile material which is not the most confortable for long flights and the maximum angle is limited. Cabin atmosphere was horrible.  Relation with the cabin crew: so, so. That's the main problem with low-cost company, a seller-buyer feeling where the company wants the cuts the expenses at maximum while letting you pay for each extra. Premium economy (understand extra legroom) was a plus and corresponds with 34"" while standard seats are 30"" but there are some good seats among the standard economy seats with no seats in front (row 30 and row 4 in the A330-200). While it appears that the seat space was the same (for standard economy) as Ryanair seat it felt that there was more space. Also interesting to note we had to pay 100$ to get to the best class for the smart fare and 150$ for the basic fare. Interesting if you're hesitating for a best seat. I'm not sure however this stands for all flights. In the end I wouldn't recommend this company unless for short flights or if you don't have any other options. After the flight I regretted not to have booked a 15% more expensive flight with another company. However the basics are met, alive, on time and overall good logistics.",Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0

Never again, we will choose this airline, even though it is cheap. We understand why. There was enough legspace for me, but my partner (close to 2 meters) was struggling. Nowadays they ask $20 or so, extra, for extra legspace. Secondly: dear Eurowings, we are on an international flight! Everything was in German. Did it ever occur to you that are multiple languages in the world? I don't speak nor write German, perhaps your staff could learn some English and manners? Never have we experienced such arrogant and impolite flight attendants. Water was included in our Basic Fare, but we never got it, we had to ask for it and the flight attendant told me that on ""your next flight you have to make a squeeky noise."" Right, there won't be a next flight with Eurowings with us. Furthermore, the staff addressed other passangers quite rudely by ""ask the blond one."" Another thing that really annoyed me was the fact that everything had to be paid for: food, drinks and even the entertainment system was paid. We didn't buy anything as the movies were in German. Do you really expect this on an international flight? In any case, we would not recommend this airline to anyone.

First, I didn't know that there are a few categories to the fare type. Luckily I checked a week before my flight and only then i know my fare is the Basic with no luggage and meal on board. Luckily I found out in time to save me from paying a lot in the airport. Then come the ground staff. They are super rude! I was asked to either pay excess fees for another luggage or throw it away as they claimed my hand carry is too big. I travelled with AirAsia with the same amount of luggage. Eurowings, a nice airline name but poor airline in so many ways. Meals on board were bad and no inflight entertainment. Everything has to be paid for. The seats are so small with super narrow legroom and there's no blanket and pillow for you unless again you pay. I took their short haul from Cologne to Vienna and it was bad as well.

Booked them as their flight times were really reasonable and the price was good. Flying from London to Phuket the flight was delayed and we were told it was due to weather conditions, which is funny as from all flights at the airport their one was the only one delayed. From Cologne to Phuket all you get for 13 hours is a small bottle of water. There is food available to buy but they ran out of most items half way through the flight. They sold people headphones but it turned out their system was down, so there were no movies or anything. Flying from Phuket to London via Cologne there were supposed to be 3 hours between the connection in Cologne for London but they changed the time of the flight allowing for just 1, which would have been fine if they didn't fly out of Phuket an hour late for some reason. At Cologne the staff were rude and we were rushed and made to run, like it was our fault their flights are always late. We arrived in London to find out that they have left our luggage in Germany, so now we are waiting to get it maybe at some point.

The aircraft was pretty nice and clean while not offering any entertainment. I didn't arrange for any food as the flight was a quick 50 minute flight. The seat comfort is okay for a quick flight. I found the legroom okay but I am short, so if you're above 6 foot, it may be below average. There is supposed to be wifi after you watch a video but then it came up with a page I can't interact with and everything was in German which I don't understand.  Overall, for quick flights, I'd say it's generally fine if it wasn't for delays. My flight to Cologne Bonn was delayed by about 40 minutes which was fair enough. My return flight was booked for 7:35PM. This was later delayed to 8:20PM, delayed again to 8:40PM, then they said it would be another 20 minutes, then it was delayed until Midnight. They offered 10 euro food vouchers but with only one cafe at the gate and it not serving food at that time, they were pretty useless and there was a lack of communication going on. Customers were getting quite heated and asking questions and just told each other what was going on until things calmed down and I asked for an official word as to what was happening. Understandably, these things happen but this was my first time going away by myself and the other passengers seemed pretty shocked by this delay.

These have occurred whether or not bookings have been made well in advance or at short notice. Despite accepting my bookings and payments for direct flights, they have changed my last few flight schedules multiple times to completely unsuitable indirect flights. These flights would have extended my journey time (which is usually one hour 20 mins flight) by between three and seven hours, if not more, due to the bad connections. I have had to repeatedly rearrange my plans and re-book flight dates and times which has sometimes resulted in me missing appointments / events. If the airline(s) wish to discontinue their direct flights between Birmingham / Hamburg they should not make them available to book and then withdraw them sometimes almost immediately after booking is confirmed. This has made me very reluctant to book further flights with Eurowings. I have emailed customer service about this several times over the past few months and am yet to receive a reply, just automatic acknowledgements. Only after my first email was submitted I was advised I would receive a reply within 6 weeks, which I find unacceptable. I have since found another airline that have re-introduced this route so my next flight on this route is already booked with them. Apart from this the I have found Eurowings flights are generally on time, check-in staff and on board service satisfactorary.

The flights were booked online using my Miles & More Lufthansa account. As usual I printed out my Travel Itinerary documents at home and everything seemed to be correct and as normal. On arrival at Düsseldorf airport on Sunday 9th April we were faced with one of the longest queues for a Eurowings check-in that I think I have ever seen. After queuing for ages we finally arrived at the check-in desk, only to be turned away by the check in assistant because the name on my Travel Itinerary document did not match the name on my Passport. On close inspection my short first/given name was indeed printed instead of my full name. I explained to the check-in assistant that I booked on-line via the Lufthansa website with my Miles & More Account and even presented my Miles & More membership card which shows my normal full name. This form of identification was not accepted at the Eurowings check-in with the assistant stating that the names differed by more than 3 characters so she could not check me into the flight. I asked if they could simply update the Travel documents based on my Miles & More Card plus Passport. She could not. If I wanted the documents changed I would have to contact Lufthansa. I was sent from the Eurowings check-in desk to the Lufthansa service desk but the woman at the Lufthansa Service desk just said “sorry we are only a service desk we can't help”. I was re-directed to the Lufthansa telephone helpline, which also was unable to help. I tried to re-book the flights at the Lufthansa service desk, with a similar reply ""sorry we can't help, we are only a service desk we can't book flights"". Eventually I found L'Tur at Düsseldorf airport and re-booked the whole journey, with the same start and destination airports, on the same day (but later flights), with the same carrier (Eurowings), this time with the correct full names on the documents for an additional price of €688. When my daughter and I were finally on-board we were looking forward to a little something to eat and drink, but the steward bypassed us both, i.e. no drinks and nothing to eat. Apparently our tickets were “Smart something-or-other” which means no on-board service. I had hoped the treatment on the return journey would be better. We received nothing to eat or drink. An altogether disappointing treatment for tickets costing over €1000. I had resigned myself to this being one of those bitter life learning experiences, “next time check that all the details on the documents match up 100%; until I started checking some older travel documents at home. To my surprise I discovered that I have travelled with my daughter with the same carrier and same type of document errors several times before, but without all of this hassle and extra cost. It seems obvious to me that the flight that we were booked onto was overbooked and the check-in staff were looking for an excuse to bump passengers off the flight.

He told us, to find the ticketing desk of Eurowings. The Eurowings woman smiled and looked friendly, but she said nothing. So we found the Eurowings ticketing desk in the terminal. There we met the first helpful Eurowings employee. He made a booking for us on the evening flight to HAM, and he asked us why we had no luggage with us. Before we could get our new boarding passes, we should ""go and find it"". He literally said, that Eurowings doesn't care about luggage which is rejected due to missing flights.

It took 5/6 days until I actually spoke to someone on the phone to still tell me my pram had not yet been located this was a different number I called which I found on the internet. 13 days later I received an email to say they had found my buggy & were sending it to pula airport near to where we were staying the next day, however we were expected to fly back to the UK the following day, their colleague had written in the wrong information of how long we were staying, I then received an email on the 28th July to say they were transferring the pram to London Stansted & I would be contacted once they know delivery time to my home address. The pram was delivered to my home address on 1st August, 19 days after we checked it in at Stansted. The inconvenience & stress of not having our baby pram for the whole holiday totally ruined our time we couldn't go out in the evening as my toddler does not sleep in our arms just because staff could not do his job properly at Stansted - so disappointed with Eurowings service.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

So after another hour, finally checked my luggage in, had some extra weight, went and paid 50 euro for extra 4 kgs and that is fine but the staff member was a really a bad host. Not a smile, not an apology, more interested in making you pay. Good thing I booked extra leg room, drinks and snacks included, guess what? A cup of lukewarm coffee was all I got.

I can honestly say it is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I do not know what goes on in their Operational control center, but it is the most delayed airline. The on-time performance of this route is 63%. What a joke. I fly them 4-5 times a year there and back and I am happy if only once a year they manage to fly me on time. I have had delays where the flight took place the next day, I had delays where the flight from Cologne was already over Czech airspace, and they had to turn back because they realized the crew would run out of duty time - real proper management their. Last time, to minimize the delay from Budapest to Cologne, they replaced the AC in Budapest, as the originating flight from Cologne was over 2 hours delayed. So they took us with an Air Berlin plane which was already positioned at Budapest. I paid extra money for added legroom, as I am 6.2ft/187cm, did not get extra legroom seat on Air Berlin plane. Numerous occasion my plane was so delayed landing in Cologne that there was no longer train service during the night, so I had to take a taxi home, which sometimes cost me more money than the plane ticket.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

That is particularly upsetting as I have paid as so called ""Best"" customer for a service that I am not getting. Also, given the difficult integration of AirBerlin crews and aircraft, the levels of reliability in terms of plans leaving and punctuality have suffered greatly. Trying to rebook flights is not made easy with waiting times of 20 - 30 minutes for the hotline.

Only to check in at the airport and discovered that nothing was changed and then still to be told by the check-in person that it's okay as Eurowings allows 3 mistakes. All that trouble in the first place. We were delayed without prior notification and feared that we'd missed our connecting flight. Fortunately there were quite a few passengers on the flight who had to get the same connecting flight and it was announced that the connecting flight would wait for us in Cologne. As a flight of 9 hours we thought we'll be given a meal, not a chance. A bottle of water and that was it. Had to pay for meals. On arriving in Cape Town, our luggage was nowhere to be found and no one could help us. It appeared connecting passengers from London did not have their luggage transferred onto the connecting flight.

I have got Senator Status for many many years and have spend a lot of money with Lufthansa and the Lufthansa Group. This seems to be irrelevant if you fly Eurowings.

The plane was supposed to leave at 7.05 pm, was postponed to 8.15, 8.45, then 9pm. A Czech Airline plane finally landed at 9. By the time we went in, they closed the door at 9.35, and we did not move, they told us that the airport was temporarily closed to clean the tracks from the snow, then they moved the plane a little, ""to go to de-icing"", nothing happened (although we saw some planes leaving). At 11pm, they told us we would go back to the airport, we waited an extra 30 minutes to get a bus to the terminal, and were completely left alone by this so-called airline. There are 18 conveyors belts for luggage in Dusseldorf airport, and no indication where our luggage was, and nobody to inform! There is no customer service whatsoever from Eurowings, we only got a message saying ""if you want to find an other flight, go to ""www.eurowings.com"". By this time all airport hotels were full. Both Eurowings and the airport employees had disappeared, all counters closed! I spent a sleepless night in the airport, and am well past the age for this kind of rubbish. A chance I had a smartphone, I had to find on my own a way to get back. There is 1 Thalys per day from Dusseldorf airport to Paris, at 6.06 am and I managed to book a seat. I finally arrived home by 3pm on Saturday. What adds to my frustration is that the Air France flight I originally wanted to take did leave on time (I heard the “last call” by 7.50), and that all this was about 2cms max of snow (3/4 inch). When it happens in Paris, everybody shouts that this is an inefficient, badly managed airport (which I believe to be true), but here, between Eurowings and Düsseldorf Flughafen, the myth of German efficiency blew away. Eurowings' business models is based on what they call ""optimization"" of the aircrafts' flight time. It means that they simulate on computer that they can make as many flights as possible in a day with planes coming from various airports and companies. As any person with a minimum of sense knows, in real life it does not work, which is why they are so often late. As they don't care about their customers it's not a big matter for them. On the way in, I had a propeller plane from Air Berlin (I know, they are supposed to be bankrupt) which was already 50 minutes late (the flight time!) at midday.",Business,1.0,nan

The customer service window had approximately 75 people waiting for help with missed or canceled flights. We did manage to get a flight 6 hours after our initially scheduled flight but that was also 1 1/2 hours late. At one point they decided to board the plane and loaded all the passengers onto 2 shuttle buses. For whatever reason, the very crowded, sweltering buses were left on the tarmac for 30 minutes before the drivers opened the doors and there was a mad trampling rush to get off the buses and board the plane, it was total chaos. The crew on the plane were the rudest I have ever encountered and I fly a lot. They bypassed myself and my daughter with the service cart and then acted very put out, when I asked for a beverage. I was told that everything on the cart needed to be paid for because of the class of my ticket.

The airport of departure was changed via email at 3 in the night. New airport is more than two hours away. We had to rent a car tot get there in time. There was a bus between the two airports but this was not communicated in any way. Guess people didn't deal their mail in time and showed up at the airport with busses ready.

Only reason I flew them was because they have a direct Cologne to Venice flight. It was supposed to be an evening flight out of Cologne. The gate was changed twice. Flight was supposed to be at 7:10pm. Delayed to 8:30pm. Finally ground staff came on to say that flight was cancelled at 8:20pm. Load groans from passengers. No explanation. Zero emphathy. No alternative arrangements provided except to say that a refund is available. I receive an email later from Eurowings with steps to obtain refund. Because of the lack of communication, a majority of passengers ( at least 140 people) rushed to the lone Eurowings desk almost all at once sparking chaos. There were only 2 support staff manning the desk and they were quickly overwhelmed. Most of the passengers were standing in the back hoping to glean information from other passengers.  It is a disgrace to leave paying customers in the lurch with no support after the flight is cancelled by the airline.  I needed to get to Venice to meet my family and had to scramble late at night to book another flight. I found another flight on Lufthansa the next day from Frankfurt. That meant I had a stay overnight (find a hotel) in Cologne and catch early morning train to Frankfurt. I had to buy a new air ticket, pay for overnight hotel and pay for the train ride to Frankfurt all at my own expense. I will never fly Eurowings again.

I was supposed to fly from Miami to cologne Germany and when I arrived st the airport in Miami I received an email two hours before my international flight that it was canceled. There was no information given on what to do, where to go, why it was canceled, etc. I called the “Eurowings” help number who told me to go to Lufthansa and they would help me. When I arrived at the Lufthansa desk, the employees there asked why an unoffiliated airline would send them to their airline to fix the problem. At this stage, I called Eurowings help desk back, and stuck them on the phone with the Lufthansa employee. After the Eurowings employee was slightly understanding of why Lufthansa couldnt fix their problem, I was sent to Eurowings counter where everyone was camped out on the floor with no answers. Once a representative came out they informed up they would do their best to get us somewhere near our destination the following day and they did not know where to put everyone for hotels so to stick around until they could figure that out. I flew with another airline with no help from Eurowings. Now - I’m trying to fly home from Cologne to Miami and the flight is delayed an hour and a half at the moment with absolutely no information as to why or what’s happening. Never fly this airline. It’s horrendous and the staff are rude and unhelpful. I wonder if we will ever take off.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,December 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Düsseldorf to London,1.0," | Avoid this airline at all costs, I thought Ryanair was one of the worst budget airlines I had ever had the misfortune to travel with but no, Eurowings have fought hard for their title of worst airline ever and they deserve it. Myself and my 15 year old daughter were due to fly out of Düsseldorf back home to London on the 10th December, it started to snow slightly and then I received an email notification to say my flight had been cancelled. But at this point it was showing still ‘on time’ on the departure boards in the airport, feeling a tad confused I joined an extremely long line to the Eurowings customer service (and after two hours) reached the front and rebooked on to a later flight that evening. When we went over to the ticket desk to receive our new tickets and to check in for the later flight the male Eurowings check in clerk smirked and said “you won’t be getting on that flight” which made me think about maybe booking a hotel nearby just in case (which I did). After more hours of hanging around the airport, the later flight was indeed cancelled and we queued up again at the customer desk but this time I was in a 4 hour queue, when I eventually got to the front of the queue we weren’t offered an apology, an offer of somewhere to stay, or even a glass of water but were stuck on the next day morning flight at 6.55am. We got to our hotel which was now fully booked and set the alarm for 4am. On waking at 4am I saw that there was an email informing me that our flight had been cancelled again. So back to the airport to join a 6 hour queue and noticed the airport was full of sleeping passengers who hadn’t managed to book a hotel. While in the queue I once again provisionally booked another night in the same hotel (as it was offering free cancellation if we didn’t need it.) Once I reached the front of the queue we were told all flights that day were now full and we had to stay another night, again not any apology or offer of food and drink despite it now being 24 hours since we had been stranded. We were put on the 11.00 flight for the next day. We spent another night in a hotel, another day of food and drink that I hadn’t budgeted for and still not one offer of anything from Eurowings for me or my daughter. We finally made it home in the afternoon of the 12th December and as advised on twitter sent off all my receipts for hotels, food, drink etc and received an email back to say they would process this within 5 weeks. Five weeks have now passed and after phoning the customer services of Eurowings I’ve been informed that it could take 7 weeks, oh no wait maybe 8 weeks and the 5 weeks was just a figure they tell their customers. I would think carefully if you are thinking of flying with these jokes. I wouldn’t fly with them again even if I were offered free flights for 20 years. They are cheap for a reason.

Absolute appalling and ridiculous airline, I recommend to never use them wherever possible! I had a total of 4 flights booked with them on 1st May and only 1 made it on time. Worst was when in LHR told me that I will get grounded overnight in Duesseldorf on my trip home to HAM due to delays and there was actually an alternative direct flight LHR-HAM with available seats, but they could not be bothered to put me on that flight. So Eurowings rather flies an empty seat and grounds a passenger half-way due to delays than moving a finger for bringing a passenger where he booked to go. So I rebooked myself on the alternative LHR-HAM not to get stuck the way Eurowings had planned it for me. And than that 4th flight again got delayed by about 3 hours. Considering only 25% of my 4 Eurowings flights made it actually even remotely on time, I question their capability and competence",Business,1.0,nan

But on both flights, they distributed only the snack box and offered no other drink. The crew told us, since the flight is fully booked, they would not offer that additional drink service, because there is not enough time with a crew of 3. I call that a rip off, if you pay for a drink, you should get it. It is not my problem it the crew is on minimum. That is the reason why I book SMART Tarif, because I want a coffee on an early morning flight. This is not the first time that this happened with this airline.

nan,Economy Class,nan,March 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Birmingham to Dusseldorf,nan, |  I booked a flight from Birmingham to Dusseldorf some months ago with a connection to Erkilet (5 hours layover) via kiwi.com. Lufthansa is my favourite airline for many reasons so was actually really pleased to be travelling with Eurowings and had no need to check reviews - or so I thought. Being a bit of a plane geek I had been keeping my eye on the flight for the last few weeks and noticed that it was very delayed and diverted twice over the last month which I thought was odd it was then I started checking reviews and was horrified therefore I had a inkling that my journey may go wrong. Flight from BHX departed at 7.45 and my taxi was coming at 5.15 I woke at 4.15 and saw a text message which had been sent at 1.20 that morning telling me the flight to DUS had been “changed” to depart at 12.05  This meant that the chances for getting my connection were slim. As if a departure time is simply changed that close to the time ? It clearly wasn’t a delay - they wouldn’t text you about that would they? Thankfully I had the option to not accept the changes with kiwi.com and get a refund (which I’m sure will not be easy) so that meant I could look at other options as I simply did not trust them not to just cancel it altogether. I then had to re book with THY at double the price but I couldn’t take a risk and guess what at 11.15 Eurowings text me again to say the flight had been cancelled. So glad I trusted my gut and rebooked otherwise would have been stranded at BHX. Absolutely shocking. They wrecked my travel plans and caused me so much hassle not to mention that what was a fairly cheap ticket booked ages ago turned into a very very expensive trip. I really wouldn’t advise anyone takes any chances booking with these jokers.,Family Leisure,3.0,nan

I fly a lot with Eurowings and every time without fail there is a delay or cancellation at the airport in Cologne. It is never announced on the board or from the staff either. There is always a problem with having too much hand luggage on the flight and, instead of sorting it earlier, the airline always leaves it to the last minute to arrange for baggage to be stored in the hold. Once on the plane there have only been a few occasions where staff have helped passengers store their hand luggage. The majority of the time they just stand back and let the passengers sort it, resulting in further delays. The service of this airline at the airport should be a lot better.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

But on this particular rotation it was way better. CGN-HAM on brand new A319 with nice interior and comfy seats. Cabin crew very nice, but the service itself was like a pure low-cost. However, the flight was very short (just 45 minutes) so could not complain much. Return hop operated by Adria Airways - delayed by 45 minutes. Interior nice, overhead screen with live flight tracking, cabin crew served tasty snacks and soft drinks free of charge. Staff nice and smiling.

I booked the flight with departure time at 7.05 and arrival time at 08.25. After 16 days Eurowings changed the departure time to 06.25 and also the duration of the flight as the arrival time remained the same (from 1 hour and 20 minutes to 1 hour and 50 minutes) without any explanation. When I got to the airport, after the check in the departure time was delayed by 30 minutes at 7.05 due to a freezing in the toilet area of the airplane. We finally got in the plane at 8 o'clock instead of 6 o'clock where we have waited for about one and a half hour for take off. When we finally arrived in Geneva at 11.15 we couldn't get off the plane because of some other plane taking our parking place as we were told by the captain. The doors opened at 11.45 so the overall delay was over 3 hours. During all these hours we were offered only 5 centimeters of sandwich and a water. I checked after 5 days online there was an online form for a reimboursement of 250 euros for the delay that was never sent by email so the company doesn't inform passengers on their legal rights and also after completing the form I have never received a confirmation email. The plane was an old airberlin plane, a bit dirty and old interior but with good leg room. Nevertheless the crew was smiling and really nice. I will never fly again with this company because the problem is not that it is a low cost airline, but the whole organisation and planning of the flights. Easyjet is also a low cost airline but I have never had an of the problems above.",Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0

Flight was delayed 3 hours and we were announced only the evening before flight. Original departure time 06:40, new departure time 09:30. We got bit stressed but all was ok at the end. We booked hotel next to airport in advance so slept and were fresh but we saw plenty of people not taking hotel and waiting at the airport whole night. They looked destroyed in the aircraft. Secondly, food was really poor. Piece of bread or cake at beginning of the flight and after 11 hours first (and last) warm meal. Last 2 hours before reaching destination staff decided to serve warm meal. They did not announce what took them so long. Warm meal (meat or pasta) was not tasty and too small portion. Full grain bread and 30% percent butter pretended to be healthy but tasted really bad. You can order anything additionally and pay for it, if you catch some of staff of course. Entertainment package was a joke, anything you want to do - listen music, watch a movie you must pay 10 EUR per flight. This could be included in ticket of such price category or at least offer could be improved. I saw 80% of the movies already and I am not a big movie fan, there were just so few movies. Btw if you decide to watch a movie, then earphones/headphones must be purchased if you do not bring them with you.  Beverages were average. For alcohol or something special you need to pay. Seats were ok, average. Staff could come around to collect trash during flight more often. Staff as such was not enough for such flight, not enough in amount, could be more polite, could be even more trained. I must admit there was no problem with my luggage and we arrived safe home, catching second connecting flight. Second flight Cologne-Hamburg was short and pleasant, even staff seemed much better. In my opinion airlines must get better prepared to handle long flights such Cologne-Phuket. They cannot operate them in this way.

The problem was, we were running around trying to find the gate, but there was no-one there to tell us that the reason we could not access the gate was because the flight was delayed (which was not what the board said). The return flight was also delayed. We had a connecting flight in Germany and a bus was supplied to take us from the plane to the terminal. Whilst myself and a friend were carrying hand luggage and assisting two 5 year olds down the steps, the bus driver decided to close the doors and leave. In the cold and the rain with two 5 year olds and a connecting flight (which we were late for) we were told to wait and the bus would return. After waiting a while, we decided to walk at which time the staff started shouting at us and threatened to arrest us.

Both of way needed transfer once. The way I went there and the first flight when I return were totally normal. you know in such long flight you could have some basic entertainment and food.  This flight is the only one that you need to pay every single thing extra! For example, the earphone. I didn't start my movie at the beginning but I felt it's odd when the crew was selling this. They gave you access to a movie without earphones. Moreover, when cabin crew started to serve the food, they ignored me, I thought she may did not see me. So I asked one staff in the end, and she said the ticket I booked is just seat without service. I said how come I book a seat to spend 12h without food. She said I could buy it with cash, but Euro only. I just have dollar left but they did not accept it so I left with empty handed and during these 12h I have nothing to eat.  What's more ironic, when I decided to start a movie to transfer my attention, I noticed even I have no right watch anything, they request me to pay again! I was  extremely angry.  I started to worry about my luggage if they transfer it or not. because in that situation I didn't book any service except a seat. I landed, all the info I received, there is single word mentioned that I don't have extra service. Last but not least, this young team's attitude and service is horrible. I strongly felt that they don't care the non-German speaking guest. Everytime when they come to me, they will tell me I need to pay to get what I need. The lady who distribute food, she just skipped me, I was trying to ask her, and she pretended as if I am a troublemaker or food beggar!

The result was to beg several assistants of the family company of Lufthansa to overbook my flight to Thessaloniki for about 3 hours until they finally found a way to overbook my flight as well as for other 10 people in the same flight. As overbooking is a usual tactic for Eurowings, they definitely should mention that in their website .My experience was really horrible and I would never book with this airline again, although my flight was rebooked without any cost in the end.",Business,1.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,4.0,4.0,nan,yes,Munich to Stansted,5.0, |  Munich to Stansted. Excellent flight with good comfort and excellent staff. Delayed takeoff due to extreme weather. Air bridge at both ends made entry and exit easy. Food on board looked fine- we didn't eat but we had tea and a chocolate bar.,Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,December 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Stansted to Puerta Plata via Cologne,1.0," |  Stansted to Puerta Plata via Cologne. Worst airline in the world. Flight was late leaving from London, could have offloaded us but kept us on the flight knowing we would miss our connection in Cologne. Flew us to the wrong airport and then left us stranded to try and find our own transport 6 hours drive to our original destination of Puerta Plata. No onboard entertainment, staff in airports are just reps and not Eurowings staff and they could not have been more unhelpful. It was the most horrendous journey of my life and I would never wish flying with Eurowings on my worst enemy.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Vienna to Rome,1.0," |  Vienna to Rome. At first I was notified that the flight was delayed. Then after dropping the luggage while searching for the gate, the flight was cancelled. Apparently the company independently rebooked my flight and had to wait there for 5 hours. In addition, nobody gave the passengers notice about the food & drink coupon that apparently we could use. While rebooking the flight and taking the new boarding pass, I emphasized several times to re-address the luggage, as I needed to have it with me today. We landed and there was no my luggage. (Other passengers were in the same condition too). The luggage was delivered after 3 days. The airline didn't respond to my emails, not speaking about the compensation. Don't recommend the airlines at all, 0 customer service!",Business,1.0,nan
