Airline was already delayed from London, and Jeddah’s airport was so disorganised, you can see from screen that the next connecting flight going to Philippines is already boarding but no gate. So have to queued from where Filipinos are queuing, with people pushing and squeezing as staff didnt even bother to arrange the passengers according to their zones while boarding. Worst service ever, no blankets provided to passengers as they run out of stock, entertainment was worst as earplugs provided hurts my ear and the sound quality was ridiculous. You rather listen to the noisy sound of the plane rather than listening to it’s entertainment using its earplug provided. Worst nightmare came during luggage claim - waited for almost 2hrs only to find out that my luggage was left in London. Saudia staff in Philippines were terrible been promised that will be able to get my luggage the day after as they will put it on priority as told them that will be travelling again to HK, but got my luggage 3 days after.I wont be using this airline again for the stress it has given me.

When I first got to the lounge I did not understand how in world this extremely disgusting lounge where I could hear mechanics drilling into an area and open construction going on ever be a business class lounge. Secondly the flight got delayed and no announcements were made on the matter, an announcement was made an hour later after which the passengers were told to immediately board the plane. My parents and I were stuffed into a bus with economy class passengers and faced extreme humiliation. A man was spitting and screaming in front of my fathers face while talking to his peers at a very uncomfortable distance whilst my mother was stuffed into a corner afraid that someone with wrong intentions would ‘brush’ past her. I on the other hand was being repeatedly smacked on the back with a mans heavy bag, who once again was very uncomfortably close to me, invading my personal space. Upon asking this man to move away he kept on doing the same thing. When we pay for business class we expect premium treatment not to be locked in a cage and humiliated or get headaches from the sound of construction. Never in my life of traveling all over the world have I seen such an atrocity of an airlines. Never again. If it was possible to give this experience 0 stars I would have.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

The first flight (Singapore - Jeddah) was pretty okay, probably because we were less than 40 people. Once we landed in Jeddah, the nightmare began. Jeddah is probably the worst airport I have ever been to. Nobody can speak English. The Jeddah - Cairo flight was delayed. On TV, it was displayed that the boarding was taking place which was misleading. Once I was finally told that we could go (by another passenger who could speak both Arabic and English, the Saudia staff didn't help at all), we had to take a bus. We then arrived in front of the plane but we had to stay inside the bus for 20 minutes since the cleaning staff was still inside the plane. Once we landed in Cairo, it took about 1 hour to get the luggage. On the way back (from Cairo to Singapore via Jeddah), the flight experience was pretty terrible, especially on the Jeddah - Singapore part (via Kuala Lumpur). There was a lot of turbulence and kids were running, literally! The cabin staff didn't do anything at all to inform parents that the kids should remain seated. They didn't care at all. Once we finally landed in Singapore, I was told that my luggage had been lost along the way. I thought I was going to be the only one. We were only 18 people for the Kuala Lumpur - Singapore part. Out of the 18, I met 7 other people who did not get their baggage. They were coming from Paris, Istanbul and Cairo.

Saudia has been improving a lot recently. The staff quality has improved. I departed from Dammam and had a connecting flight through Riyadh to London. The plane from Riyadh to London was brand new. The flight crew were very helpful though I feel they could have come around more often asking passengers how they were. They served a very weak breakfast for 8 hour flight and no snacks or lunch provided later on.. I felt as thought the cabin crew forgot because they spent a lot of time talking in the back. They have awfully young local male hostess who seemed to have spent a lot of time chatting to the female cabin crew for hours.

When we get on board they decide that it is free seating we sit anywhere (although we would have been more than happy with our original seating) then get told to move when I complain a supervisor comes on shouts at my family and I and than threatens to have us offloaded by the police. All in all it takes an extra hour to move everyone around and find enough seats (although even then some passengers appear to be seated in the galley the whole journey). Flight attendants have no concern whatsoever for safety never checking seat belts or providing extensions for children. Plane (747-400) in a mess with bits falling off inside the cabin. Return journey we have 1 business class seat and 4 economy - better (ie. on time at least and good service in business) but very rude attendants in economy demand my wife to prove we have booked the seats before serving a meal - only start backtracking when we realize that we also have a business class ticket.

Comfortable seats decent legroom economy about half- full. Newspapers offered (mainly Arabic) followed by soft drinks. Typical airline food. Seatback screen but not AVOD - system had to be re-set twice by cabin crew early on but otherwise no problems. Flight smooth with the exception of a couple of Arab children running repeatedly up the aisles - fairly normal on MidEast airlines where parents rarely discipline their offspring. Major stroke of luck on arrival at Jeddah as I was attending a conference for which Saudia was handling many of the arrangements so whisked through VIP lounge passport stamped and into a taxi within 20 minutes of getting off aircraft. Jeddah-Riyadh again a 777 an 80-minute hop. Aircraft packed which made the serving of a full breakfast particularly impressive : full marks to the cabin crew. Not a lot of smiles from them but understandable when concentrating on serving 300 people in such a short time. Riyadh-LHR another 777 but this time 10-abreast (3-4-3) and seats noticeably thinner and less comfortable. Felt as though there was around an inch less legroom too which made an appreciable difference. Cabin crew helpful: one FA volunteered that my seatback screen was not working and offered to re-seat me. Only problem was again children running around and one little girl was actually standing on her seat as take-off started. Toilets acceptable. In all a series of flights I would rate as better than average and around 30% cheaper than British Airways.,nan,4.0,nan

Check-in staff at the airport had no concept of client service. Check in itself took about one hour because the system was down. Once my wife and kids (one child and one infant) boarded the plane they found that it was an old leased 747. They were seated all the way in the back - tables and footrests were broken. The level of service was extremely poor. Unfortunately the Jeddah - Khartoum route is completely neglected by Saudia in terms of quality standards (even though they are profitable routes) and i can't wait for the free-skies policy to take effect so that the competition either forces Saudia to raise its standards or to disappear. For me I have experienced similar problems on the Jeddah - Paris route and that's why I think that a three star rating is exaggerated - two stars maximum.,nan,1.0,nan

Just prior to take off cabin crew serve us dates and a glass of water - for breaking the fast. Cabin supervisor decided it was time. 40 minutes after wheels up they announce the breaking of the fast.

Departure was set for 3:45 am however plane was delayed on the ground for 1.5 hours and we ended up departing at 5:15 am. Delay apparently due to the fact that they left some luggage in the terminal. During the wait aircraft was hot and sticky and air conditioning was giving out hot air despite the 38C outside temperature. Cabin crew couldnt' be bothered to reassure passengers shrugging shoulders and showing no signs of care at all to complains.

When I asked the man at the counter which gate we should go to he waved his hand dismissively and told me to go to immigration. When my wife went to immigration she was told the flight was cancelled and referred back to the airline. We came back and asked a Saudi Airlines employee; he told us the flight would leave at 1300 hrs. I asked him why this information was not communicated to us earlier as we had provided our mobile numbers at the time of booking. I also asked why this was not told to us when the boarding pass was issued. There was no satisfactory response to my questions. We reached our home at 3 am and returned to the airport at 11 am. There was no indication at the airport of when the flight would leave or indeed which from which gate passengers should depart. The staff of Saudi Airlines were of no help at all. The plane finally left at 2 pm. On board my wife found that her seat would not recline and she had sit upright for 5 hours. Though Saudi Airlines advertises vegetarian Indian food for flights to India there was no vegetarian meal available. Not only is the service deplorable but staff are brusque and unhelpful. We choose this carrier because it is the only one that has a direct flight from Riyadh to Bangalore.

Saudi Arabian has a small Business Class Lounge which was crowded but offered a selection of hot food sandwiches etc. The boarding process was a bit chaotic but that has been a feature of this part of the world for many years and you just have to go with the flow. B777-200 had the new leather Business Class seats angled lie-flat and there is an AVOD IFE system with a large screen. This was not operative during this short domestic sector. Business Class cabin crew comprised one male and three females – a mix of Asian and Arab personnel who were attentive and cheerful.

For one there was nobody at the gate to answer any questions (DMM to DXB). Business class service on board decent food was average.

From the initial boarding a male flight attendant was rude and condescending to passengers. Once seated in assigned seat the aircraft was not full allowing myself and another passenger to share the four centre row seats. However before take off a flight attendant repositioned the passengers in front of us into our row stating the row was reserved. Although not pleased I thought that they had good reason perhaps a passenger who needed to lay down due to age or medical condition. However once inflight it became painfully obvious why the row had been vacated. The cabin crew actually arrived with blankets and pillows and throughout the entire flight from Dulles to Riyadh took turns sleeping. It was shocking that paying customers were placed in this position so the attendants could sleep! The food was good and adequate throughout the flight. The in flight entertainment initially appeared to be on par with other airlines however the movies ended 1.5 hr into the flight not to resume and no explanation as to why. I was very disappointed with the level of professionalism extended by the cabin crew in particular the male attendants.

Aircraft's are a mix of old torn planes and ok however I don't like the leather seats concept looks very old and full of strains. No entertainment at all on all sectors some flights with no refreshment however I was surprised on Dammam-Dubai sector they had a full service which was roughly a 75 minutes flight but full dinner and tea and coffee was served. Cabin crew are ok not very friendly but they were doing their jobs with no enthusiasm but doing it right except for the Asian crew as they are always cheerful not very fond of SV but I have to take it every time I am in KSA due to domestic flights though nothing major to complain about but will never fly it in international long flights.,nan,3.0,nan

The thing I really like about SV is that it's such a punctual airline. Flights are almost never late. Saudi domestic flights are not that expensive and are fully changeable fares with no penalties. If you are traveling domestic travel light and carry it all on. Security at domestic airports in the kingdom is not that strict so you can get a bottle of water and toothpaste through security. Does not charge extra for exit row seating. They also allow a free checked bag on domestic flights. Food service and inflight entertainment on international flights are pretty good actually. But 10 across on Saudi's 777's make it for a very tight flight. I certainly recommend taking SV to the USA during the low season! My flights to JFK were empty. We're talking 75 people on a 777. The amount of personal space on an empty widebody is amazing! I am very disappointed that Saudi has decided to cut costs and downgrade domestic food service. They used to offer hot chicken and rice the local dish on domestic flights. It was always delicious. Now they offer cold snacks only: a muffin cheese sandwich or a tuna or chicken sandwich. I used to get the sandwich but not any more. It is truly a mystery meat sandwich with very little taste. Flying during Ramadan is always a treat. They pass out the snack boxes and tell the passengers when they can begin to eat even if it's 10 minutes before landing they will land with the trays down with the catering items still on them! The cabin crews are friendly all the time. Saudia gets you from A to B without all the fuss of American carriers that's for sure.

GVA to JED was small plane (A320) the plane was clean and plenty of legroom. Food was good. Service was overall OK. The second leg was on new 777. The staff was rude and impolite. I was given a seat in business class along with few other passengers. Before departures one of the cabin attended ordered all the passengers to leave business section and find a seat in economy.

I found that this is airline is punctual and gives the standard care of an airline. Jeddah airport maybe one of the worst airports for connecting flights but its not fair to review the whole experience of Saudia based only on airport. This airlines offers a good price to travel with good food and good care throughout the flight. Of course the standard is not up to Emirates or Singapore Airlines but they are doing good job.

The Catering has been cut you used to get a full meal service on international flights regardless of length Saudia I would have to say had some good catering on board now its a frozen bread sandwich with tea or coffee better off give nothing as no one eats them.

At least 77W equipment was modern and clean. 4 hours transfer at RUH I accessed the Premier lounge with my Master Gold: dirty toilets no showers no quiet zone. Rude ignorant shamefully arrogant ground staff at RUH. Second leg RUH-CDG: old 772 aircraft dirty and smelly toilets rude and disorganised Arabic cabin crew.

My only disappointment was Jeddah airport because I had 5 hours transit on my way back to Manchester. Most of the security staff at Jeddah airport did not speak English which made it so difficult to explain. We were given a dinner voucher for our 5 hours transit which was plenty. Jeddah airport is ok for short transit but being a single father and two sleeping kids I had a bit of nightmare at the airport for 5 hours but I can not rate the airline bad because of Jeddah airport.

The FA's were welcoming to everyone alike. Everyone was greeted with a smiling face. Mango/orange juice was served and the lunch service began. Food was hot (had to wait for 5 minutes for it to cool down). Inflight entertainment was fairly good. Unfortunately our row's computers weren't responding. Stopover at Riyadh was 4 hours. The airport had charging points and many cafe's with affordable drinks and eatables - gets boring if you dont have personal entertainment. Riyadh to Bahrain was an Embraer 35 seater. The scheduled duration was 1 hour 10 minutes but the actual time taken was just 50 minutes. 10 minutes after takeoff lunch was served (goes without mentioning it was piping hot) the meal was filling with salad dessert and a main course. The trays were taken back within 20 minutes. In short the entire 10 hours journey was pleasing and worth the cost. I should mention that I got the ticket for 1/5th the original price because of a special offer. Worth every penny and I wouldn't mind paying the whole fare as well.,nan,5.0,nan

Flight announcements are made very unprofessionally and rudely. Taken from the terminal to plane in a bus which took approximately 10 minutes. I really hope that they install airbridges in the new airport. Boeing 777-200 is used on this route. Cabin is quite clean and the prayer facility is a bonus. Meals have got to be even worse than Egyptair. Toilets are well stocked and inflight entertainment is sufficient and up to date. Seat is quite comfortable but the headrest is like a rock. Managed to pull about an hours sleep. 97% of the flight attendants just do their job without a smile while the other 3% are slightly better. All in all I will fly with them again.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,3.0,I flew business class from Toronto to Chennai with a stop over for 3 hours in Jeddah. The flight from Toronto (SV 60) was about 80% occupied which was surprising because just prior to take-off the Saudia website showed only 35% occupancy in business class. This means that passengers were upgraded on points or people paid a small surcharge to get upgraded at the airport. I was a bit disappointed with the state of the business class section. The aircraft obviously had seen better days and everything from the carpets to the seats needed to be refurbished. The seats are angled lie flat seats which is not so bad. However the seats themselves were very hard and not as comfortable because the middle section was lumpy with the joint digging into one's back. The pillow and blanket were fine and the amenity kit was also standard nothing to write home about but at the same time wasn't cheap. The food was quite good. Service began with dates and Arabic coffee on take-off and then moved into freshly squeezed juices. They also gave us menus and we could choose between three types of mezze (tapas) - Arabic international and vegetarian - which was followed by a choice of two soups (arabic and international). The main course was also a choice between arabic (fish sayyadi) or lamb in gravy (quite tasty) and chicken or vegetarian choice. This was followed by cakes pastries middle-eastern dessert and ice-cream. Coffee tea and espresso was also offered. Breakfast just before landing in Jeddah was also quite good and wholesome. The service itself was quite well done by a friendly crew who were willing to oblige. They were pleasant and responsive but not overly stylish. The crew itself was international. All in all a decent flight but nothing to write home about. If Saudia improves their cabin interiors and changes their angled lie flat seats by making them softer it will be a much better experience. The flight from Jeddah to Chennai (SV 768) was not very good. The crew were friendly but the food wasn't up to the mark. The service was spotty. No pillows or blankets were given - nor were the business class amenity kits handed out - and many people were allowed in business class either as upgrades or last minute surcharge passengers - not a great practice. The most disappointing aspect of the flight was that the Airbus 330-300 was old and the seats were like the old business class seats. They only had a 45 degree recline which was not very good for a 5.30 hour flight. It is puzzling that Saudia isn't changing its business class seats to angled lie flat as in the Toronto to Jeddah sector.,nan,4.0,nan

We got our airfare at a promo price so I wasn't expecting anything grand. We had a 9-hour layover in Riyadh from 8pm until 4am the next day for our flight to Manila. There was no internet at the airport no place to comfortably sleep and we had no local currency so nothing to do. The worst part was when we had a mix up with our seats. In our e-ticket we had booked economy seats in the upper deck (economy service but business class seats) in Row 18. But upon receiving our boarding passes we were transferred to the farthest row in the back in Row 63. We tried to fix this mistake by talking to Saudia staff member none were any help. No one said sorry no one attempted to try to help us with our predicament. After 15 minutes of arguing they said that if we wanted to take our original seats then we would have to fly the next day. We had no choice but to take the Row 63 seats so we could finally go home. To make matters worse there was no in-flight entertainment at all in the entire 9 hour flight the small table where we ate was broken the toilets were dirty and had no tissue and the food was really terrible.

We had some odd seats but the onboard staff were nice enough to accommodate us in the rear double seat which were empty. The first halt to Jeddha was only 2.30 hrs away. The food service started quite early and we were served a tasty and sumptuous dinner onboard. Inflight entertainment had good variety but the touch screen in front of me was not responding to touch so I had to make do with my wife's screen who promptly went to sleep. This was a tolerable glitch. The Jeddha halt was for 6 hrs. Immediately on reaching Jeddha we were quite surprisingly given meal coupons (approximately worth $20 each). There was however only one restaurant where the coupon was valid and the options were only between veg/non-veg. The food was indeed very good and sufficient in quantity. The airport is small and quite cramped though clean and with sufficient seating arrangement. The seats are good enough for a short wait but no place to take a nap on. The toilets were clean but watery and wet all over. This is primarily due to the reason that local people are in the habit of washing their feet in the washbasins. Next leg of our journey lasting 15 hrs was also excellent and enjoyable. The inflight crew was nice and polite and were in good attendance. We are now awaiting our return flight middle of Sept.

Seat is the best economy class seat compared against other airlines in my opinion. Large toilets – the average toilet on their Boeing 777-300ERs is larger than that of other carriers. Food as expected with all of the Middle-Eastern carriers, food on Saudi was good. Responsible staff. Flights left and arrived bang on time. Riyadh isn’t what you’d call a world-class airport, with very limited dining, entertainment and rest options. Onboard staff were cold though not rude. Dress code, neither men nor women can travel in shorts and women have to wear something that covers their upper bodies upto the neck.

We then spent 5 hrs without being allowed to leave the plane at Geneva Airport before another pilot was found to take us to Munich. Explanations were not given, and crew (when asked) just kept telling us that we would leave Geneva within the next hour. In all this time all we were offered was 1 drink of Juice. Other than this, the plane was very old and there is no Video player in economy (even though Saudi air website says all mid-haul planes have video). Good news is legroom was quite good.

However, I sensed the motivation from the crew to provide good service. The plane is clean, except for some passengers who didn't know how to dispense their used paper towels. Meals are satisfying, although the bread rolls tend to be tough. IFE is sufficient for the duration of the flight. Because of the lack of passengers, I was able to sleep stretched fully on one row which allowed me to arrive refreshed after the flight. Tried to buy from their inflight sales on my way to Singapore as a birthday gift to my friend but was told that the person responsible was not available to accept sales (perhaps due to the fact that we are less than an hour before landing). With this experience (my first time after more than 20 years), I would consider flying Saudia again. But the Saudia Terminal (South) is another story.

There were three meal choices on the outbound flight, I choose the Chicken with mushroom sauce, the portions were generous and the flavor was good. The cabin staff were not overly friendly but not bad, the return plane was a newer A320 with somewhat larger screens and more choices on the entertainment system.

Jeddah airport itself is awful and the ground staff are rude (side note if you are a smoker there is only a smoking area available to first or business class passengers and the ground staff).

Then, as the departure date approached, I gave a look to the reviews and I got quite alarmed from the amount of negative ones. Now, after 4 flights, I decided to spend a few minutes to write a review, which I don't usually do, but I feel the company fully deserves it: Booking was quick and easy, no problem whatsoever. A320 for the short flight, Boeing 777ER for the long leg. Both new, clean, in perfect condition. True, the A320 didn't have the personal screen but there is a wifi service, working with a dedicated app, with a great selection of movies, games, flight info etc. Cabin crew were nice, efficient and smiling. Food was very good, far better than most European companies and definitely than all American ones. Aircraft were perfectly clean, unfortunately its other passengers that don't know how to use a bathroom! Crew were even entering the toilets from time to time to flush and to spray some perfume. Flight punctuality just perfect, we even landed 15 mins ahead of schedule in MXP. Leg room: unless you're a NBA player you'll have plenty. All in all, I found Saudia far better than any American company I've flown with, and easily at the level of the various BA/AF/KLM and at half the price, though. The only problem can be the layover in Jeddah, more than 2-3 hours in that place can be very taxing. Apparently, a new airport is bound to open but it's unclear when. However, this isn't Saudia's fault. (Ps. they even give you meal vouchers to use at JED, I've rarely seen other companies do so).

Food was ok for Business class, which was essentially economy meal presented in chinaware. Generally, I feel Saudia needs to get rid of old A330s' and 777s as they are starting to show their age.

I have been a Gold Alfursan member (SkyTeam Elite+) for the past 6 years and most of my flights are with  Saudia. At T4 check-in was swift and the pass for the excellent SkyTeam lounge was handed to me. Sky Priority now means that you can use the VIP security channel, so it’s a very quick process to get scanned and into the lounge where a full English breakfast was being served. London to Riyadh was on their new 777-300ER. This plane has the new First Suites and the 1-2-1 Business Class configuration. However, I was in economy and the last row only has 2 seats near the window. Boarding was early and efficient. Cabin Crew greeted me with smiles. The blanket and pillow were on the seat. Economy seat 59A is at the rear of the plane and I was lucky enough not to have anyone beside me despite a busy flight. Shortly after take-off there was a choice of fruit juice and lunch was served. Saudia still offer metal cutlery. The chicken salad starter was delicious and I chose the chicken biryani (a favourite of mine on Saudia) as it is a good-sized meal and succulent chicken. This came with a warmed bread roll and butter. The dessert was a small piece of chocolate cake. The two other hot meal choices were beef with vegetables and fish. A small bottle of water was given with the lunch. Although I use my iPad to watch films and TV on, the inflight entertainment system would also have kept me very happy with the range of choices and some box sets of USA shows. The entertainment is edited with blurred blobs covering up bare arms and legs on females. The map feature is excellent. USB sockets to charge phones and there is a multi-socket under the seat that takes various plugs. Recline is very good as the seat back reclines and the seat itself moves slightly forward. The prayer room is at the back so this tends to make for a quieter journey. The flight crew were attentive throughout and if not visible, they did answer calls and brought drinks. 90 minutes before landing, a small tray with two finger sandwiches, a packet of Scottish biscuits, water and a cup for tea/coffee was given out. The flight landed 25 minutes early. Disembarkation in Riyadh was swift (even though I was at the back) and I had no immigration queue and was out in the baggage hall before any cases arrived. Riyadh now operates a fixed fee system if you want an assistant for your trolley (SAR15 or £3). My luggage appeared quite quickly and I headed for the inter-terminal bus as the new domestic terminal is further away. It is a little chaotic getting the bus with the traffic, but it all seems to work. The new Terminal 5 is beautiful. As my luggage was already tagged for Tabuk at Heathrow, the assistant just put it straight onto the conveyor. Once through security I headed for the new Alfursan Lounge which is a wonderful space to relax. There is s self-service buffet with many choices of hot and cold dishes as well as cakes and prepared fruit. There’s a wide choice of cold drinks and the usual coffee machine. The terminal has various coffee shops and fast food choices. The Tabuk flight was on a 5-year old A321. ",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Once inflight, the food started being served. The flight attendant provided a meal to my wife and daughter and my wife asked for one for my infant son as she knew he was hungry and wanted to eat. The flight attendant said that she couldn't provide the meal to my son as ""we hadn't paid for the full seat"". My wife could have paid for the meal then and there but the staff said that they had not paid for a full seat, is unacceptable. We had paid the asking price set for “under 2 year old” traveler. Shortly after this incident, my wife called a flight attendant and requested that my son’s baby bottle be warmed for 30 secs. The flight attendant declined and said that it was not possible to warm up anything.  We have travelled on many flights internationally and crew has never declined to warm up a baby bottle.

The inflight entertainment is so heavily censored to Saudi Arabian standards that there essentially isn't any. American sitcoms, for example, censor out all swearing, references to sex and alcohol, hugging, cuddling, kissing, and they even blur over any exposed flesh - e.g. shoulders and even lower legs. Same selection on all 4 of our flights as well, which totaled almost 30 hours. Very disappointing. The severity of the strict dress code on board is  ridiculous. As a woman you have to be completely covered, and in loose fitting clothing - so no leggings or tight trousers. I wore a floor length skirt and a long sleeved top, which is genuinely really quite uncomfortable for a long haul flight.  My partner (male) wore shorts as it was a night flight and he wanted to be comfortable, he found out he wouldn't be allowed on board and so had to buy trousers. Jeddah Airport transfer lounge is genuinely one of the worst places I have ever been. It, in itself means you should seriously reconsider traveling with this airline, especially as a young western woman. The toilets are like an incoming apocalypse, honestly, it's nearly impossible to describe just how bad they are. There are essentially no shops, it's crowded to dangerous levels, to the extent that if there was a fire or an emergency of any type, people would be crushed to death. It's hard to even find a seat, and there is nowhere quiet to go, even the first class lounge is heaving. There are no restaurants, just very understocked, underwhelming cafes. The aircon and ventilation is appalling, it's stifling to overwhelming levels. Men and women also can't go through security together, so my partner and I got separated for a while, which was also quite distressing when I couldn't find him for half an hour. Honestly, avoid this place like the plague. The food and drink choice on board is limited as well. I understand the no-alcohol policy, however some more food options than 'beef and rice' or 'chicken and rice' would be welcome over the course of 6 meals! If you, like me, tend to get a bit dehydrated on flights, then make sure to take a couple of bottles of water on board as they are very stingy at providing drinks.

We called hotline everyday to get information and also we checked global trace system everyday to get any good news and also we sent lots of e-mail to customer relations of SA airlines. As a summary, we used all channels that we can use. Of course, we could not get any response. We supposed that our luggage will not be able to be found anytime. We bought something to survive such as shoes, clothes and 4 days later suddenly our luggage was delivered to our hotel and we were shocked. Could you imagine such a period that you are in as a customer? They managed the process very unprofessional and amateur, no information, no compensation etc. One week later we went to airport for departure, we requested an authorized person to talk and explain. She came and gave us an e-mail address of her manager to send mail to demand our rights. Also they gave us 75USD for 1 person as compensation in the airport but they also said this is just for temporary action, company will pay also for 4 days delay and also purchasing items cost that you bought to survive.  We came back to our country and sent e-mail to manager and she said that 'according to our policy, is to give 75$ US or equivalent in local currency for the delay of the baggage and for the inconvenience of our guests'.

Boeing 777-300ER,Economy Class,2.0,April 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,no,Islamabad to London Heathrow via Jeddah ,4.0," | Please note this was the return leg of our trip from ISB to LHR. Outbound we went via Riyadh (better planes, service and transit). The trip begins well enough by friendly airport staff checking us in smoothly (pleasantly surprised for ISB). Boarding was announced over an hour in advance due to pilgrimage pax which was fairly chaotic due to the easily forgivable increased security. Once onboard SV 727 (HZ-AK15), it was apparent the plane was one of the older 773s on the Saudia fleet, with blue seats, a 3-4-3 configuration and the older type of IFE. Just before take-off, a disagreement broke out between some ladies and cabin staff. Ground staff were called as the ladies refused to sit next to myself as I was male. I offered to swap seats with one of their male family members and thought I got lucky with a nice emergency exit seat. Unfortunately, in this section of the plane, the IFE screens were non functional, just displaying the airline logo. Remotes were lit but inactive, basics like reading light and call buttons also refused to work. When brought to the attention (3 times) to staff, one said, sorry sir, unfortunately this happens all the time! Food was just about acceptable. The flight did operate perfectly to timetable though, slight delay in departure was made up during the flight to JED. I will cover the woeful experience at JED airport in a separate airport review. The JED to LHR leg was an overnight flight, SV113 on a 77W (HZ-AK18). The aircraft again was a little older than the RUH route but of 3-3-3 config. so the seating was more comfortable than the ISB plane. Whilst comfortable, the service on this leg was shocking. Staff were polite enough, however, stuck ruthlessly to their procedures. I would not sleep at all, and was rather peckish. I asked for something to eat like a banana, crisps, or even a biscuit (being diabetic) and was refused outright saying they do not carry snacks onboard! I am sure Business Class had ample supplies! Shocking. The best they could do was offer my main breakfast earlier (but then I would have to starve towards the end of the flight!). I found this really shocking. Upon arrival at LHR, I had to report a burst suitcase reported to Saudia ground staff. Initial attitude was to accuse me of overpacking, to which I simply said “its underweight, open it if you want.” I have filed a claim but not a single response. I would not recommend this airline if travelling via JED, if it wasn’t £1k GBP cheaper at the time of booking over EK or QR, I would not have bothered!",Family Leisure,4.0,3.0
A330,Business Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,3.0,3.0,no,Istanbul to Jeddah,4.0," |  Istanbul to Jeddah. Flight departed 80 minutes later. Lost my connection in Jeddah. Food was tasteless. Drinks never served during the flight. Air crew was terribly bored not only to serve but to even smile as well. Apart the flatbed, not business class at all. At the end, the broke my luggage too, terrible service.",Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0

A320 /  Boeing 787,Business Class,4.0,February 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,Milan to Kuala Lumpur via Riyadh,4.0," |  Milan to Kuala Lumpur via Riyadh, and it really was above my expectations. Friendly check-in at Milan airport then on to the lounge. Relaxed boarding and the steward presented himself by name. Coffee and dates before take off. Menus were handed out with the choice of three entrées, main mail, and dessert. Both arabic and western bread served. Before take off a sms was received with the code for free wifi on both flights, this is tremendous value as most airlines charge for this even in business. The meals were all on demand, you could choose any time up till an hour before landing. Transfer at Riyadh, contrary to Jeddah is hassle free, with no queues, easy to find lounge. The Alfursan transit lounge at Riyadh airport is well equipped even for a longer transit time, nice sofas, relaxing chairs, working tables with computers, an abundant buffet with local and international specialities, with nice juices and excellent Arabian coffee. Though the aircraft announcements are made in a quite high noise level. A320 interior was a little bit worn, but with with excellent seat distance though not lie-flat beds. The Boeing 787 is top notch with full lie-flat beds. The inflight entertaining system is compared to another airlines quite limited, but there were Arabian films with English subtitles, films that we rarely see in Europe. Keeping in mind the competitive business class fares on Saudia and the hassle free flight, I will not hesitate to book Saudia again.",Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0
A330 / Boeing 787,Business Class,3.0,February 2018,2.0,3.0,3.0,yes,Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur via Jeddah,4.0," | Flew Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur via Jeddah with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Very much exceeded my expectations. For the low business class fare I paid I consider it to be outstanding value for money. The seating on both the A330 and 787 aircraft are fully flat and the cabin finishes very attractive. The 787 provides direct aisle access. Crew were friendly and attentive. Each flight I travelled on had WiFi. Food was pretty good. The menus could do with a little more variation and the main courses a little higher quality. And please, I know Saudia is a 'dry' airline and that is no problem for me but why can you not offer other drinks other than water, tea or coffee? Not on one of the four sectors was there a drinks service before the main meal. You take off, they do the meal order, there is a delay, then you are presented with your tray which automatically has a glass of water on it. Saudia should be offering/promoting high quality soft drinks in First/Business Class, fresh juices, smoothies, coconut water etc. Transit in JED is straight forward but the airport is a disgrace. I'm sure the terminal in Kabul or Mogadishu is more pleasant. It truly is hideous. Few food/beverage outlets, the toilets, don't get me started. Disgusting. The terminal is tiny and just people everywhere. The Saudia lounge in the terminal is just OK. Pretty small. Again, toilets are an issue (precisely two stalls - no urinals - in the gents so always a line up). Food was OK. However why the need to announce loudly every single flight that is boarding? It was disturbing after a couple hours. Saudia has the basics to be an amazing airline. The planes are great, the crews are good, the food and drink situation needs improvement but that isn't difficult to do. The worst aspect of Saudia is the Jeddah airport. Thankfully, a new airport terminal will open soon and when it does I wouldn't hesitate to fly Saudia again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0

I was surprised that on their Int’l flight DXB-JED there was no onboard flight entertainment even if it was over 3 hrs flight. Food and service was average, planes were a mix of average airbus and fairly newer B777. Crew doing their job but nothing special.",Business,1.0,nan
Boeing 777,Business Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,London Heathrow to Riyadh,5.0," |  London Heathrow to Riyadh. Worst Business class in terms of food quality and in flight service. Boarding was ok after delay of 30mins, seating and layout of the new Boeing 777 of is great and now have full flatbed seats which is a plus. However the food quality has gone downhill very fast since the past few years. The flight attendants were asking passengers what they would like to have for dinner while I was in the prayer area in the back and obviously missed me. However when the food was being served I thought they were asking passengers at the time if what they would like to eat. Clearly no one served me anything which got me concerned resulting in me asking one of the flight attendants why am I not being served any food. Still no food or acknowledgement, then I decided to ask another attendant upon which the response was that I did not ask. Seriously! Anyway after a long wait I was served the food and upon slicing the piece of steak I found it stone cold inside. Again I had to summon one of the attendants and complain, who apologised and took the plate to heat it, when it finally arrived, it was very low quality.  Also no amenity kit for Business Class passengers on this night flight, the response of the attendant was, that the kits were not loaded at London. Saudia can be a perfect airline if it improves its catering quality, variety and train its flight attendants to actually care about passengers.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,January 2018,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,Rome to Jakarta via Jeddah,3.0," | We took a flight from Rome to Jakarta via Jeddah, and back. The flight from Rome to Jeddah (5h) was in a narrowbody aircraft. Small and without entertainment! The transit was terrible. The worst I ever been. Dirty, no seats for everyone, no restaurants - nothing. The flight from Jeddah to Jakarta had entertainment but our monitors were broken. 10h flight with screen broken. Thanks Netflix and Amazon prime video for letting me download the movies when I was still home. Also USB port was broken to charge my phone. Before departure I tried to contact the call center and I wasn't able to talk to anyone. So I tried to look for a live chat. There is no live chat. So I wrote an email. The answered that I had to call the contact center. I replied that I tried but no answer. They wrote me back few days later in Arabic! I tried to change my seat from the website. There was a recurring error on the system and it was not possible. Staff on the plane is nice. Food is fine. One last thing: the delayed the flights (go and back) 40 minutes. But at least they wrote the day before by email. In the past I used Saudi Airlines, and the service was really good. Now is really bad. If the price is low, go for it. But pay attention to your transit: if the transit is more than 3h and is in Jeddah take another airline.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

At the airport of Peshawar I did not get my luggage, I wrote a complaint, the authorized person told me that I will receive it within 2 days. It is now 10th of January, today I came to the airport, the same situation. The most strange thing is that they told me that they had received the remaining bags of 27 December flight and my flight was on 5th January. Also, they had no idea when will they receive. I came for two weeks to Pakistan, so for this made my vocations one of the most stressful.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
