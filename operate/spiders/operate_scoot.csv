nan,Economy Class,1.0,August 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Bali to Singapore,1.0," |  Bali to Singapore. After take off I laid back my seat, right away a girl behind me starting kicking my seat and after a while I asked her if she had a problem with it, she said she didn’t have space for her legs. I said it was not my problem and told her to stop and call crew. I turn around and she pushes again. I called the crew member and explained the situation, he said he couldn’t do anything so he just told her to stop. She stopped for about 20 min and kept going, she pushed so strong that she even made the seat go back to the normal way only by kicking it. I called again and the lady said “I’m sorry there’s nothing I can do and I didn’t see her” (the girl was admitting what she had done) and then told the girl “I understand you don’t have space I’m so sorry, I’m gonna see If we have a bigger seat for you.” She didn’t want to change so the lady just told me I’m sorry it’s only 40 min left please just try to hold on. The lady just said she couldn’t do anything while the girl kept laughing with their friends. At the end a cabin crew guy understood me, said it was my right to have the seat how I wanted to and offered to change me and my friend. The girl just got away with it and nothing was said to her. Also no food or drinks were offered free in a 2.5 hr flight.",Family Leisure,3.0,1.0

Scoot started flying to Berlin Tegel from Singapore Changi only recently, and I caught their latest flight to the German City. Kiosk check in & bag drop was seamless, and I was allocated an aisle seat, much to my relief. I would not have wanted a middle seat for a 12hr flight on a budget airline. Seat was what one would expect from a standard low-cost carrier - Average legroom with no entertainment. I had pre-ordered a long haul meal for the journey, and the food was largely decent. Crew were largely polite and professional. Value for money for a trip to Europe.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Value of money not worth it, yes it’s cheaper compared to other budget airline but end up spending more because of the delayed flight and the reason is their is a technical issue on the plane that can not resolved. Flight delayed from 12:55 am to 3:30 am. With those people who have connecting flight not advisable to take this aircraft. The worst customer service. Flight delayed and nobody offered us a drink, ground staff at Singapore said those with connecting flight someone will assist us (delay team), upon arrival to Philippines, flight stewardess said we can approach the ground staff at the counter for assistance, ground staff not helpful as no instruction from them from Singapore and staff told me to call their office. No feedback form, no apologies even after I told one of the staff I missed my connecting flight although I paid 2x more for the rebooking of the ticket what makes me upset is I need to wait it the next day for the next flight.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Luggage fees were fine and very clear up front. The quiet section (no children or movies) was great but has no way to charge electronic devices so bring batteries. I recommend you bring your own water and snacks as these are rather expensive onboard. My main complaint is the temperature of the cabin — nears 80 degrees F so rather hot for US passengers, seems norm for Asian passengers. Bring water! Easy to press light and flight attendant call buttons on arm rests. Watch out! Love those windows you can lighten and darken. Going to try Air Asia next!",Family Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,June 2018,2.0,5.0,2.0,yes,Taipei to Singapore,3.0," | Taipei to Singapore. I was on Scoot biz on the 22nd of June heading back home from Taipei. It was my 2nd flight with Scoot and I am very impressed with the crew on ground and onboard. The check in staff was polite and efficient even though she had to handle a big tour group before us. After getting onboard, we were greeted by smiley and polite cabin crew when offered water and confirmation of our meals. It was a great start to the flight. Soon after take off I tried to charge my device with the in seat power supply, however it wasn’t working. We informed the crew in charged and was quick to get a response that the seat power supply for both 2h and 2k was down. I was disappointed but was lucky to have my own portable power bank. A few moments later, the crew in charged passed me a pink power bank and she explained that it’s her own personal charger. She apologised and went the extra mile and took the initiative to offer me hers even though I didn’t ask for it. During the flight, she was seen helping 2 elderly couple in front of us with the Scoot tv app. She kept coming back to check on them and it was when meal service was about to start. I understand that’s a very busy period for crew but she was professional and very patient with them and assisted them for at least 20-30 minutes and had left me very impressed. She was also always seen in the cabin during meals and duty free sales service. During the lull period, while walking to the lavatory, crew was also polite to inform me that there was a queue. Toilet was also clean the whole flight. Call lights by passengers around me were also quickly attended by them or passing crew from the economy class. I didn’t expect much from a budget airline but I am left with a great impression with this experience. I will be looking forward to flying with Scoot again.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Flew SIN-SYD-SIN. Seats were really comfortable for a budget carrier. If you can book the economy plus (yellow seats). For a bit more you get a lot more leg space. The food and beverage bundle was worth the money. Food was nice and cabin crew was efficient.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,SIN-OOL-SIN flight TZ006 and TZ005. SIN-OOL check in could have been a lot faster as we were the first few in line. Boarding was slow but smooth. The taxi and takeoff roll were done professionally. Food was served 1.5hrs after takeoff had lasagne which was not too bad its better to pre-order online to prevent long waiting times. For the rest of the flight I slept. Outbound flight ended well with a smooth landing but the immigration at Gold Coast wasn't very fast at all. OOL-SIN a long line at check in followed by another long line at immigration and boarding once on board managed to rest until takeoff. Food served 1.5hrs into the flight and had the lasagne meal which includes pepsi and fruit chips. Landing was fairly smooth. Overall I think Scoot is a fairly reasonable airline if you just want to eat and sleep my advice would be to download movies on a tablet and bring it onboard to past the time.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Value for money! Paid for the extra leg room and it was worth the extra. The food was simple.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Flew SIN to SYD. The only issue is with the timing of departure being so early in the morning but I compensated with the use of the transit lounge. Early Check-in was a positive. Overall the flight was fine for the price paid meal was adequate and seat recline good for a sleep. For price definitely worth it if you don't mind sacrifices.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,nan,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Over an hour to check-in because we were too early and had to check in at the early counter. Only about a dozen people in front of us but it took an hour to check them in. Of course no lounge but I expected that. Priority boarding was people at the back of the plane board first oh and Business which meant a rush to the queue. The seats relined a little more than most standard seats. I asked to watch a tablet for entertainment and was told they were having technically difficulties and were not available. I since found out they haven't been available for months. Despite leaving at night and arriving in the morning you only get 1 meal and 1 drink. A comfort pack was extra we paid $8 for 1 blanket. We paid an extra $250 for: 1 Meal and 1 drink. Over 70% of the passengers boarded before us which meant the Gold Coast customs line was out onto the tarmac by the time we got off. They had 3 international flights arrive at once as they do most mornings. This airport can barely handle 1 international flight. Our flight arrived at 8.25am and we finally got out of customs around 9.40am.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,SYD-SIN-SYD in Oct 2012. Surprised that for the fare we paid we received so much. Flights were within 30 minutes of schedule at all times. The seats (Yellow seats $25AUD more) were very good. I am 6ft3 yet I fit very easily and had plenty of room to stretch my legs under the seat in front. Fully aware that there was no IFE so we took our own. Meals were very average but that is not too surprising. Staff were obviously young and inexperienced however they provided all that was required and were always smiling. The price of drinks etc was not too bad. Airport check in at Sydney was quite lengthy but at Singapore was really quick. It is important to remember that it is a low cost carrier.,nan,5.0,nan

In response to my request for cash refund I was told to note that the vouchers were transferable. We have no plans to travel before 30 Jun and are definitely unlikely to fly Scoot again!,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Flew OOL-SIN for the first time on 25 Dec 12. Very pleasantly surprised. Although the flight was full the B777 did give the impression of spaciousness. Pleased that I had paid a little extra for an upgraded seat though. Plenty of legroom - but the armrests are very narrow. No headrests on the seats and the installation of these would be a big plus. The in-flight meals (even the upgraded ones) are no more than snacks - but that was not a big deal. There is of course no IFE. However if you are happy enough to read or use a computer the time passes quite quickly. My only criticism is that the food service was a little chaotic. Other than that Scoot represents excellent value. I'm planning to use Scoot's OOL services in future as a 'launchpad' to the multitude of destinations available from SIN. Very good value for money.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,1.0,Flew SIN-TPE on 21st December the plane cabin actually looked rather old and dated. A panel at the ceiling of the cabin seemed to be loose too. Seats were hard and uncomfortable this was made worse by the lack of a headrest. However the recline of the seat was outstanding. Throughout the 4 hour flight the call buttons were ringing non-stop making any sleep impossible. The call button is placed right beside the armrest so almost everyone accidentally pressed it. Cabin was also rather cold. Toilets are clean and there are drinking fountains outside toilets too. As for service the service crew was very unprofessional they did their work without any smiles and all seemed very cold.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,Badly organised boarding. Despite having on board water fountains the staff refused to supply a plastic cup without buying outrageously expensive water. Most customers around me were expecting to have to pay for toilet paper. No inflight entertainment available unless booked with purchase of ticket. Staff are friendly but either overworked or under trained. Overall I'll stay away from Budget airlines in the future.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,3.0,Flew OOL-SIN and SIN-TSN return was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the trip. It is a budget airline so you can not expect all the bells and whistles. All aircraft's were fresh and new with a young aircrew to boot. They seemed in good spirits and helpful. Naturally the food service was basic but not too expensive compared to some other budget carriers I have flown with. Surprisingly I was placed in a yellow stretched seat but while the seating did have more leg room the lack of adjustable headrest did not make it too much better. All in all though I would not hesitate to re-book a flight with them. No Inflight entertainment was available but I did not intend of using the pay service anyway.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,3.0,Scoot Business really means Premium Economy with one spicy Asian meal and one drink included no bread roll salt or pepper etc - very basic food indeed. After that there is a charge for everything. Try to carry your own water as its not provided - especially on longer flights. The seats are OK but difficult for sleeping. Our Singapore to Gold Coast flight was delayed an hour before any explanation was given to passengers. The flight eventually departed 1.5 hrs late.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,2.0,"BKK-SIN connecting to SIN-SYD on 28/29 November. As other posters have noted it's definitely worth paying for the extra leg room in the yellow ""Stretch"" seats. However the seats themselves are very narrow (10 abreast in a 777) and are uncomfortable with no head rest. The forward economy cabin was also very cold. I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot. Paying the ""Scoot-thru"" fee also meant that in Singapore I did not have to claim my bag clear customs and check in again for the connecting flight. Instead I was able to organise my next flight at Scoot's transfer facility within the airside departure level. Service is friendly but the staff don't seem particularly assertive. Overall I found Scoot to be cheap and cheerful and if you're a budget traveller I would recommend.",nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Booked a return flight from BKK to SG. Pre-selected window seat in the red seating of the aircraft. The seats were very thin - ok for a short haul 2 hour flight. The person in front reclined their seat which literally meant I had a headrest in my face. Flight departed on time which was a relief after seeing other reviews. Cabin attendants were far from 'fun vibrant' crew members mentioned in all the airline PR. More like exhausted/frustrated with their job. One snapped at a women when she asked to clarify the pre-ordered sandwich she had just been given. All in all an ok flight. Decided to upgrade to Biz scootz for the return leg just. Very easy to upgrade in SG - 99 SD plus 20SD administration fee.

I read up beforehand on their website that IFE wasn't available on their IPads so I brought my own so that you can just live stream movies from their system. Seats were wide enough and recline was ok for a sleep with very good head rests the only complaint is there is no space between armrests so it's just like in economy where there isn't enough room for your arm and the person next to yours. Only 1 drink and meal included but the beers were reasonably priced at $4 AU but water was expensive at $3AU. Flight was on time and check in a breeze through the dedicated Biz counter.

Even though we'd booked this as one return flight Scoot considered these to be separate flights therefore the missed connection was our problem not theirs so we had to book a new trip with Tiger to Bangkok as well as losing our prepaid accommodation and having to pay for a night in Singapore. Very little communication or explanation from Scoot no offer of any compensation or even a complimentary bottle of water. Promise of a $30 scoot voucher that never arrived.

nan,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,5.0,I have flown Scoot with the whole family twice in the past 3 months from Sydney to Singapore and then the reverse. The ground service is poor. Long queues excessively long times to check-in (stood at check-in for 45 mins). On one occasion we arranged for Scoot to have someone assist my non-English speaking cousin to take her through customs and on to the plane. When we got to the airport our assistance had not been assigned. We waited until the queues had vanished from check-in and the counter staff simply ignored us and went on with their other duties. t is impossible to get through to their call centre - they seem to be perpetually experiencing a high volume of calls never mind the time. I've tried calling at around 9pm Sydney time 6am Sydney time and about 2pm Singapore time. Only got through once at the 6am timeslot and only after been put on hold for 45 mins (time by Skype).,nan,4.0,nan

Booked the rear seats in business class and found them very comfortable and better than Jetstar business but not as good as Air Asia X business class. Food was not appealing and very basic but for under $500 dollars one way was not complaining. The staff looked very young and were helpful but not of a standard of usual business class but once again its a low cost airline. I enjoyed a nice sleep travelling in both direction and was very refreshed on landing. Food and drink on plane was expensive especially water. Major complaint was after getting on and off plane before everybody else when collecting bags both times my bags were last to appear on carousel.

However I had paid for the premium meal. I requested for the code for inflight entertainment I tried to press the call button but no crew responded the lights were on for an hour. The food was similar to economy class. Seat was slightly bigger. My luggage came out last as there is no priority for biz class passenger.,nan,1.0,nan

Check in was slow - one of the ground staff collected our passports and about another 5 people at front of the queue took them back to the counter the person at the counter flipped through the passports put a sticker on the front and then the passports were returned. Yet when our turn came to check in there was no apparent time saving. The check in staff were inappropriately dressed they were indistinguishable from general airport workers. Onboard we had ordered the blanket sets and had to ask 3 times for them although they did apologise when we finally received them. The overhead reading light switches on the arm were very sensitive so that every time you press against the arm the light would come on. The inflight crew were polite and helpful.,nan,3.0,nan

Never mind the 2 onward flights I'm going to have to miss and non refundable accommodation on top - what I want to know is why were customers not emailed on the additional delay? The opportunity to arrange not sitting in this airport would have been welcomed. You forget that many of your flyers are from Brisbane - we can't exactly hop in a cab and go back home.

I had a connecting flight from Singapore to Frankfurt at 12pm that night and told Scoot staff that I would miss my connecting flight they weren't bothered when I pushed about returning at 4pm the staff member finally admitted that they didn't even know if they flight would go at the proposed time that evening as the plane had to come from China and hadn't left there due to a snowstorm! Had to go to Air Asia and pay for a flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight with Tiger to Singapore to get back in time. NOT worth the cheap fare won't be flying with them again.,nan,1.0,nan

I did not select anything to eat when I booked the tickets but ordered from foods available on menu inflight. The hot Italian veggie food was tasty and filling - about 8 AUD which is quite cheap. I found their menu to be reasonably priced. The leg space was sufficient. I observed that leg space of some seats (yellow) for which you need to pay extra was large especially the first row. When you book online you have options of paying by credit card or through POLI using your bank account. I chose the second option of going through bank and had to wait for more than 24 hrs for the bank transfer to complete and ticket delivered. I also had to do few follow-ups with their customer centre. If people are travelling within the next 2 or 3 days of booking I suggest to use credit-card which should result in a ticket immediately. Overall very satisfied with my first experience with Scoot and happy that I saved about $A350 for my one- way trip to Singapore by booking Scoot.,nan,5.0,nan

I had a couple of queries prior to flying and emails were promptly replied to and information provided. All four flights on time. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. We did pre-order a meal Coolangatta to Singapore which admittedly I will not be doing again - the worst airline meal I have ever had. We learnt our lesson and didn't worry with the on board food service again. I noticed a number of reviewers complained about lengthy check-in queues - perhaps we were lucky but we had no such difficulties. I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess. Overall we had a great experience with Scoot. The price was incredibly cheap at just over $1400 for four of us.,nan,5.0,nan

Taking the Kindle was a great idea. No inflight entertainment except at added expense. The food that passengers ordered at extra cost looked quite palatable. Cabin staff were really nice. Seats are a bit narrow. Leg room is constricted. Take a snack from the post customs food shops to get you to Singapore. If traveling on from Singapore allow time for possible delays.

Flight home was late at night - a little cramped with 2 adults and 3 kids on 4 seats while everyone else had 3 seats to themselves to spread out and sleep.

Ground crew was slow in checking-in it was a near full flight of over 300 passengers and took almost an hour to clear everyone. Allowing 15kgs cabin baggage is a grave mistake as most passengers on this flight brought in at least 2 pieces of baggage each making the clearance extra slow at the screening area. Those who board plane later had no space left for their baggage. Aircrew was not well trained the worst I've encountered in a budget airline. I could hardly understand the announcement in English with a heavy Japanese accent. Announcement in Mandarin was also below standard.,nan,4.0,nan

My expectation was pretty limited. We took a neck pillow and warm clothes to overcome the seat discomfort and temperature issue. We didn't hear any annoying call bells (accidentally pressed) either. Cabin crew were good as well. One disappointment might be the food which was not the dish we selected while buying tickets and also it would be too spicy for some people. Overall journey took 40 minutes more than the scheduled time. When coming back to Singapore the flight was delayed 35 minutes. We were fortunate enough to have no luggage issues.,nan,5.0,nan

Flight to Bangkok was good and on time. We flew back to the Gold Coast with Scoot and the night time flight was good with a bit of extra space not all seats full and I felt comfortable in my seat.

If you couldn't eat at that time they could store your food for you and serve it to you as breakfast before arriving in Shenyang. The one hour transit in Qingdao was a tiring process - you are expected to bring along all your hand carry luggage with you. You have to clear all immigration in Qingdao. On our return flight Scoot was on time and even arrived 30 min earlier in Singapore. Seat was quite wide and rather comfy. No food served from Shenyang to Qingdao. Luckily we had brought enough of our own food. Both iPads and blankets could be rented and bought. We brought along our own iPads and downloaded their system before the flight. Overall though initially we have had a nightmarish experience of trying to change our destination from Shenyang to Tokyo everything about the Scootbiz experience was surprisingly nice for a budget airline.,nan,5.0,nan

The cabin was spacious and uncrowded and the seats comfortable with plenty of legroom and a fully adequate recline. The food and wine was very simple but perfectly acceptable.

Flight itself was delayed slightly at Sydney (20 mins) but on-board the crew were very genuine and friendly and the seat was very comfortable although there were a few issues of lights going on and off. The way some people choose to sit seems to activate the lights which isn't really the passengers fault. The food was not particularly satisfying and because I don't have a tablet device I couldn't take advantage of the free ""ScootTV"".

As advertised there was a special entry aisle for Scoot Biz Class but it was hard to see because of the crowd. We were actually first on board and our seats were as planned. As soon as we sat down we were served with cold water with a friendly greeting. A lot has been said about the Biz Class seats and some of it sadly is true but travellers must remember the fare is about a quarter of what other Australian airlines charge and half of that charged by rival Air Asia. They don't leave a lot of elbow room and don't recline to the floor but they are on the whole fairly comfortable for the money we paid. The food was nothing special it was tasty.,nan,4.0,nan

ScootBiz was awesome and well worth the extra. I have flown Premium Economy with JAL before and it was terrible compared to ScootBiz. ScootBiz had good leg-room and nice wide seats you get to board first and get off first you get served when you want it. We took our own drinks and food on the plane and we were happy.

Their business class seats were inferior to several major carrier's economy seats. Hardly enough legroom and the person behind was constantly bumping the back of my seat. Recline on the seats was minimal as to be unnoticeable. No inflight entertainment and all that was on offer was a miserable tablet pre-loaded with 3 movies which was not free not even for business class passengers.

A 7-8 hr flight is not hard work so we chose the Fly-Bag option and ate before we flew on both sectors. We paid to select extra legroom seats and travelled the equivalent of premium economy seat pitch and were very comfortable. Flights ran on time - and arrived ahead of schedule in both directions. Staff courteous and attentive. They cleaned the toilets at least 3 times an hour - more frequently than on any other plane Ive been on. I would not hesitate to recommend or fly them again.

We bought ""FlyBagEat"" however you have to add on the cost of a seat to this fare how are you going to fly without a seat? The ""convenience fee"" of a $10 was added (apparently for credit card)! All in all we had no complaints about the trip over. We also booked a trip back but as this leaves at 2.10am we decided to buy a super seat for about an extra $40 each. This turned out to be worth every cent - we booked a seat in aisle 21 just behind business class and had the bulkhead in front. My husband could stretch his legs and we didn't have anyone in front so didn't have to worry about anyone wanting to recline their seat. On the way back we arrived at 5pm at Changi with luggage for a flight leaving at 2am. It cost us $5 each for the early check-in and you have to pay in cash. One good value deal was access to the SATS lounge for $S39 each. This allows you to use the lounge for 4 hours (consecutive use). This was a wonderful oasis for us.

Check-in very crowded slow and understaffed. Avoided the crowd by going to the ScootBiz counter and upgrading but could only upgrade to Singapore. I had to upgrade Singapore- Taipei at Changi. ScootBiz is not luxurious. Seat is a little wider and with a power outlet. Metal foot rest is uncomfortable. Meal was a sandwich and a small can of Pringles plus a drink. Flight crew were young energetic all very nice and well groomed. The pilot and crews English pronunciation were mostly incomprehensible. Entertainment package - you login using a special PIN. There are no instructions on how to set up your computer. No one from Scoot will help you. Upon arrival in Singapore I went to the Transfer counter in Lounge E Terminal 2 to get my new boarding pass. Transfer desk had 2 people working I waited 45 minutes. At Changi Airport I had gone to the Widevine Media Optimizer website and downloaded the entertainment browser add-on after which it installed without a problem.

I have never experienced such nonsense all at once from one airline. first they changed my flight and then refused to let me change it to a suitable date. Then they changed my meal from a hot meal to sandwiches which I already paid for as an option. Then they lost my baggage even though I paid extra so that they would specifically look after my baggage. Also the seats are a nightmare with no headrest and are very cramped.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,We travelled to Tokyo on 2nd October from Singapore with a transit at Taipei. This is our second time travelling with Scoot and both times we were quite happy with the airline. It is a budget airline and it delivers exactly what it promises. The seats are by far the most comfortable of all budget airlines that we have used and the food quite decent and not exorbitant. I had not pre-booked a meal reading reviews that food is bad but when we ordered on board we found it quite good. One tip would be to order sandwiches or food that does not need to be heated. The transit at Taipei was smooth and we reached Narita on the dot. Only reason I have not given it full marks is that we had pre-booked iPad for my daughter and the stewardess first said they had none that were working. When I insisted on the fact that we had already booked and they should refund our money she promptly brought the iPad to us. But it was a small point in an overall good journey. Scoot remains our first choice in budget airlines.,nan,5.0,nan

First the positives: the planes were well maintained the FAs were friendly the food was basic but fine and I did not mind paying extra for the frills. Now the negatives: the seats were uncomfortable the legroom was poor (I'm 6 ft 6 so an exit row seat in economy would have been better) the movie selection was dreadful the FAs were inexperienced and the 2.10 am departure time from Singapore to Sydney is a killer. It was an overall charmless experience which was not offset by the admittedly competitive price.,nan,3.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,4 of us travelled SYD-SIN-SYD in Sept and Oct 2013. I will definitely travel with Scoot again. Ground staff and cabin crew were great. Yellow seating was great for 6 foot tall family members. We did not use the inflight entertainment as we had good books and ipad for music and we did not eat their food. They hit you 4 dollars for a small bottle of water so bringing your own empty one is a good idea. You are not meant to bring your own food aboard but it seems many do and have no issues from staff. Booking online was fine once I took the time to figure out all the options. We used the Scoot lounge in Singapore and will do this again too. Shower good food wine spirits fruit coffee internet massage chairs all good. We were on time out bound and 30 min late on our return but this was fully explained by the pilot as because of air traffic control. It could have happened to any airline. The planes seemed to be very new. Scoot does it for me.,nan,5.0,nan

Had to remind check in that we had business lounge and asked for process and direction also had to ask for tag for hand luggage as given on previous trip. Lounge which cost extra was operated by SATS comfortable and better than Qantas lounge we used recently. Good food and drink choice massage chair and internet. No loungers or flat chairs. Boarded plane easily not sure if announcer asked Scoot Biz to board but we got on with no issues. Comfort in seats good I would rate cabin and seats as comparable with premium economy as I've travelled business and generally seats are much wider. Service was good with getting water at start of flight and meal promptly after take off. Would be good to get another drink later in flight to make it more biz style. My big issue was with taking my own laptop on and not getting it to work I downloaded at home before going but could not get it working. My advice hire a tablet for $20 or take your own entertainment. It's a shame as this was the only negative of the experience. Flights all good on timings. Overall it's a premium economy seat with a basic economy/ budget service if the comfort of the seat is important to you then worthwhile.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,1.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,PER-SIN-PER just after Christmas as the fares were incredibly cheap (less than $850 for three people to SIN and back). Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot. I was actually surprised that something so bad could actually come from Singapore. Only recommended on the basis of price.,nan,5.0,nan

When boarding they asked people at the back of the plane to board first not sure what seat numbers this included. Got on board and had a stretch seat plenty of leg room which was great news being over 6 foot. Generally the seats are more comfortable than any budget airline I have travelled did notice the 3-4-3 is much tighter than the 3-3-3 with Singapore Airlines on the same plane but was ok. Food and tablet arrived quickly once we took off and I was seated very close to back of plane. Big issue was that they collected tablet an hour before we landed I managed to watch one movie and half of another. Even with watching tablet as soon as I received and whilst eating. Food was tasty and very spicy with a can of coke and a small pack if Pringles this was a pre paid meal. Overall a very good service comparable to other economy services better than any budget airline I have travel led with.

In scoot biz you can bring your own device for entertainment and not be charged everyone who I saw couldn't get it to work. Crew were more interested in chatting in the galley than helping.

Service was OK but cool and not very welcoming. Meals which we ordered in advance are poor and don't recommend them other than the Sandwiches and pot noodles which you can buy 'on the go'. The plane was full both ways. The worst experience was the freezing cabin on both flights so much so we became convinced that this was done to 'encourage' us to invest in renting pillows and blankets.

It could have been better if food was better there were more drinks that could be offered to ScootBiz class.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Flown on TZ2 SIN-SYD and TZ1 SYD-SIN recently on FlyBag ticket. Scoot's website is user friendly. Check-in at Singapore's Changi Airport and Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was fast friendly and efficient. On board planes 9V-OTE and 9V-OTA looked well maintained. The interior was clean and had a fresh look. Seats are not too uncomfortable with good legroom. However the light and call attendant buttons were too easily triggered by passengers shifting about in their seats. Pleasantly surprised that the cabin staff regularly ensure that the toilets are cleaned and freshened. They seem to put a lot of effort into it which I greatly appreciate as an almost full load both ways result in heavy toilet usage. Captain and first officer spoke very clearly when making announcements something I seldom experienced when travelling with other airlines even full-service ones. Food however is not fantastic and leaves much to be desired. Overall a good experience with Scoot and may consider flying with them again.,nan,4.0,nan

Booking system is great and very flexible. You can pick and choose say Business one leg and economy return. Our SYD-SIN flight was cancelled and Scoot automatically re-booked us 1 day earlier. This didn't suit us so agreed to change at no extra cost and also changed the next leg returning to BKK bought on a separate booking. Also impressive from an LCC. Flew Business class from BKK to SIN return because the marginal extra costs wasn't that much more. Good seat pitch space. Not too full. Leather seats a little hard but OK. Food ordered was changed but no big deal on short flight. Staff were never rude but they were not overly friendly which was a surprise given their supposed ""Scootitude"" (attitude). Bought Business for the late night overnight SIN to SYD because we wanted space to sleep and was glad. Very empty with only 8 passengers so we all shuffled around and had a bench each. Except that 2 of the 3 middle row arm rests would not lift up so it wasn't really a bed. Worse luck! On this leg the staff were very attentive and around. On the daylight return SYD to SIN we flew the extra space yellow seats in the child free front economy cabin. This was very good and highly recommended. Great amount of space and worth the slight extra premium charge. Had an excellent meal on this leg with free rum and coke. Again not much attention from the staff to be honest but remember this is LCC. Only one minor point was that when we checked in for one leg we wanted to upgrade to buy the business lounge service in SIN and were told that it was too late. Rules are rules but there was at least 2 hours to go before the flight and that seemed petty to me frankly. I had been hoping to use a tablet for the entertainment but the system doesn't support a tablet. Pity but no big deal. Lastly all 4 flights were extremely punctual. I was surprised. All in we will definitely fly Scoot again. Great value and a pleasant surprise. But as with any LCC don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed.",nan,5.0,nan

I can understand extra for food drinks (even water) entertainment but to charge you for checking in early is a pathetic money grabbing option. Only $5 but no mention of fee at early check-in sign at airport after queuing in line for 20 minutes and many complaints from other passengers a staff member came from behind the counter to tell you of the charge when you are two passengers from the counter and by the time we got to the counter we were only 5 minutes early.

(Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side.

Although they announce that food purchased from outside is not allowed to be consumed many people have a bite and no one says anything - I would recommend this option over purchasing the inflight food especially as many people have said that it is not good. We watched our own movies on our iPad so entertainment wasn't an issue either. Safety measures were taken very seriously and the cabin crew were responsive when they were called for. I would definitely recommend this airline it does what it says on the tin and at a very decent price.

The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid. It takes hours to get all the pre-booked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 2-3 hours into the flight.

My wife ordered a meal that would not be fit for a dog's consumption mine being a concoction which was barely edible. Onboard in the equivalent of premium economy the seats were sufficiently comfortable for a 5 hour flight but no more. There would appear to be very little the cabin crew knew of basics that is so superbly demonstrated by its parent company. While in Singapore I tried to pay for baggage through the website and only with the assistance of a family member was this achieved after 3 days of trying. The return flight was about 40% capacity and the service was still below average. Duty free shopping was not on a trolley but was available at the rear galley of the plane (no announcement to this effect).

I agree that a can of coke and small pringles is not the best ""health"" option but I bought my own food on board and there was no problem with that. Take an empty water bottle to refill. Don't try and take the bottled water through Gold Coast Customs - no go so you'll have to stand there and scull it! Scoot staff were fine and efficient. I can relate to the call button being ""dinged"" continuously due to the major design flaw of where the button is located on the armrest. All up I paid $745 back in January for this airfare and I am happy to do it again - but only in the yellow seats! The layout is 3-4-3 in economy and there were so mighty ""squashed"" people in those seats so invest the extra $70 (and hope that no one has the middle seat!). I agree with other reviewers that this section (Rows 21-25) is child-free and feels like your own little section.

Decided to upgrade for the return journey to the yellow seats and must say that the extra room was well worth the extra payment. I would travel again with Scoot – next time booking the super economy (yellow) seats. With such low air fares you get what you pay for so we can't whinge about being offered coca cola and pringles as a snack! The meal on the return journey (beef wrap) was a huge improvement on the forward journey which was some sort of very ordinary rice concoction. The staff at every step of the way - from when we checked in until we landed were very efficient and courteous. In recommending this airline I would suggest that potential passengers do a bit of homework beforehand and choose a seat that maximises their comfort.

Also ordered a meal. Everything worked well and the meals were exactly what is/are required on an 8 hour flight. The small extra cost for the seats was well spent as we were in a bracket of two (window and aisle) and it was only the two of us to sprawl across each other. The cabin crew was/were really good. Spoke good English and didn't seem to be troubled by the usual few fools that adorn every flight! I'd certainly fly Scoot again. Next time to Hong Kong. If I can get a decent Gold Coast to Hong Kong connection. Check-in at the Gold Coast was fast and efficient. Same at Changi. Tip. Take your own Tablet device loaded with your fave TV or Movies. Yep. The battery will expire before the flight lands but by then you will be ready for a few hours of sleep. Also take an empty 500/600ml water bottle on board. Fill it at the water places on the aircraft.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,2.0,I was scheduled to travel on a non-stop Scoot flight from Singapore to Sydney by Business Class a few days ago. The flight was scheduled to take off from Singapore at 1.45am and arrive into Sydney at 12.40pm. The flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra. So moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by Scoot as they are usually late.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,5.0,Have flown with Scoot several times and the planes have been on time and arrived early in some occasions all smooth with check in and bag collection as good as any airline I've used for this. Scoot Biz are much better than any standard seat with other airlines. Food is a bit basic but for the same price as the cheapest fare in economy with 38 inch legroom it's with it. The entertainment does not seem to work on my own devices which is probably the only downside. Overall a good service and will keep using if the price is right.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,3.0,The aircraft was ok and service was almost the same as other budget airlines. However it was delayed 3 hours and 2 hours+ respectively for my 2 flights. I felt uncomfortable that the cabin crew moved my luggage without asking for my consent. The cabin crew are rude they don't give way to passengers when they are selling food and beverages. I stood in the aisle and waited for 10 mins until one moved his cart back a little and I could go back to my seat. Although it is a budget airline they should know we are the customers and they should provide quality service not a budget.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,nan,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,Perth to Singapore - Scootbiz. Overall a good product check in very efficient through dedicated Biz desk young man was very friendly and professional he also mentioned we could board the plane as soon as boarding begins. Unfortunately no option to purchase Business Lounge Access at Perth. Boarding was efficient with a call to all Scoot biz to board at the start excellent much improved on last time. Boarded the cabin to realise there were only 4 people of the 32 seat occupied in the Biz section as always we were greeted warmly when boarding the plane. Drink orders were taken before take off and we were allowed any drink on their menu something not offered on our previous trip so improving all the time opted for Singapore slings we were told we would get these after take off. As with Biz we were provided with a small sealed cup of water like you get in economy take off was earlier than expected which I was impressed with. It was about 30 minutes after we took off when we were provided with our pre ordered meal not bad with small can of pringles and a bottle of pre mixed Singapore sling with a cup of ice overall good for budget maybe disappointing for any other service. Once again we were unable to use the entertainment system this time using a tablet instead of a laptop but once again no luck. We rarely saw the cabin staff and they did not come out and give us the code to access the entertainment. Scoot need to look at this as I don't think I'm the only one to have this issue. My favourite part of the experience is the seat its like premium economy comfortable with 38 inch leg room and 20inch width great for a 5 hour flight. Overall its a Premium economy cabin with a budget service.,nan,4.0,nan

Had previously travelled in economy seats (standard blue) and actually found no difference in service or comfort. Waste of money paying the extra for Bizclass. The entertainment streaming was unavailable on our flight which made the 5 hour journey seem quite long and tiring. The return flight was delayed 4 hours which totally interfered with our plans and cost us dearly for additional airport drinks and long term parking. We were bussed along with all other passengers to the plane which was still being repaired when we boarded.,nan,1.0,nan

Medical emergency onboard during the outward journey meant we returned to Perth. Cabin crew were First Class in their handling of the situation. It was our first flight with Scoot and we were more than happy with the flight and service once resumed. We selected yellow seats in the quiet zone a good decision as we are both tall and the extra leg room made for a comfortable journey. The return trip was good also. Last year we did a trip to Japan using Malaysian Airlines and were less than impressed with the service. Their only redeeming factor was a 30kg baggage allowance. On balance we would fly with Scoot again if we could.,nan,5.0,nan

Whilst the outgoing flight was smooth and they were allowed to take their snacks on board on the return flight they were not even allowed to bring food/water onboard and being strict vegetarians it was tough as Scoot does not serve/sell anything that is purely vegetarian.

We have sat on both standard (Blue) and Super (Yellow) seats and both were comfortable and have very spacious legroom (I could cross my legs with a standard seat). Cabin crew were very friendly and always served us quickly with a smile on their faces. We ordered a Beef Bourguignon Pasta Stew and some snacks on board and despite the small portion the meal was delicious.

The aircraft was Goin'Scootin the crew were very fast to serve food and were very friendly. The captain however made announcements far too softly. We did not choose our seats and got super seats for free which have more legroom compared to the blue seats. However the seat was not cushioned and was quite hard the flight was quite bumpy so we did not feel relaxed at all. The food served onboard was very expensive but was needed for a 5hr flight.

I got a free 'gift' of an hours free wifi on board but could not use after 4 attempts to get someone to help me and 3 different cabin crew members telling me they were busy and would come back to me soon I gave up.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Singapore to Perth. No major problems with the plane as it was new. Seats Ok but they have design problem with the button for service which is located on the arm rest. Seats are quite narrow and result is that me and other larger people were always accidentally hitting the button which annoyed the flight attendants and passengers no end. Catering was very disappointing. We pre-ordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. Wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. We did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. Completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre- ordered meals. We then thought we would buy something alcoholic - beer was warm so we decided on the wine. Decided on a white and then discovered that this was also warm. These are small things that could easily be handled with a bit more attention to detail and some flexibility by staff to keep passengers happy. Would I fly again probably because of the price but would not bother pre-ordering food and would check what I was getting before ordering anything on board.,nan,4.0,nan

Flew business class and seating legroom was great for 6ft 6 husband and recline was excellent to get a decent sleep. Food was basic but tasty and fine for a short flight.

I could have bought a cheaper ticket on Singapore Airlines or Thai Airlines in economy and got better service if I compare the so-called ‘biz’ amenities to the economy features of other airlines. Scoot ‘Biz’ priority boarding poor - only a few moments after calling for the ‘biz’ section they called everyone else and without a separate line we had to stand in line with everyone else. No hot towel or wipe onboard. One meal only consisting of a small dish that would not feed an adult and a Toblerone. One drink of water in the entire flight one other drink with my meal. InFlight Entertainment nil unless one happens to have an iPad). No blanket or pillow. Scoot has managed to cut costs so much that they are falsely advertising the ‘biz’ class as something worth paying extra for but in fact it is even below economy in normal airlines. I was particularly appalled that they do not provide water on demand especially on the longer flights. When we arrived at Coolangata the final straw was the use of a single set of stairs that accessed the economy cabin so that the ‘Scootbiz’ passengers that had paid a premium were among the last to leave the aircraft.,nan,1.0,nan

This airline needs to improve business class experience to make it worthwhile to ensure that there is priority boarding and exit from the aircraft using separate gate entry lanes and also priority luggage handling. There was no ""crowd"" control by flight staff on leaving the plane in Bangkok - with only 4 passengers in their business class on that flight the cabin was rapidly filled with passengers from economy competing to exit via the business class exit. There is no priority baggage handling for business class passengers.

The staff member at check in was extremely helpful and changed our seating from 42 H & J to 23 B & C to be closer to the exit and toilets.

Be prepared and read the fine print as if you don't expect anything other than what they say you won't be disappointed! The flight was very cheap and absolutely no frills - no pillows blankets tea or coffee included. They are clear about this on their website any extras have to be paid for. Do not expect staff to be there to look after you although I found them all to be pleasant and polite. The food did not look to be worth buying we took sweets and small snacks for the kids and were not questioned on this although customers in front of me were asked to put their own food away. There was a free drinking water dispenser near the toilets on all the planes we travelled on but you had to go and get this yourself in your own bottle or cup. The seats were reasonable (except for the dreadful position of the call button). They like to board the planes really early so be prepared for that. We left on time each flight with one major upset with one flight where 2 hours from Singapore to Taipei we had to turn back to Singapore due to a medical issue with a passenger on board. I was surprised we did not even get a free cup of tea after what was ultimately a 5 hour delay - beyond their control admittedly but some recognition of the inconvenience would have been appropriate. Another delay due to weather when leaving Taipei was affecting all aircraft so once again frustrating but not their fault. No problems with baggage at all and although a very slow check in at Gold Coast Changi and Taoyuan check ins were a breeze. Did saving around $4000 in fares for a family of 5 make up for the inconveniences of the flight? Absolutely!

Attendants seemed helpful but difficult to hear and understand over the cabin noise.

Leg rest in SB seemed not worth it very little space due to pitch whilst I found meal indelible and nothing before landing or drink on takeoff. Also they made some announcement re streaming then didn't offer IPad. I was ready for sleep anyway. However the info on entertainment choice meant probably wouldn't watch it.

The crew seem quite inexperienced and do not show the calm and assertive behaviour that I am used to from most airlines yet they are friendly and polite. The scripted announcements with things such as ""Scooting off"" (instead of taking off) add to this feeling: friendly attempting to be fun yet not assertive or what I would consider professional air crew behaviour.

The seats are actually very comfortable and already well reclined in its up-right state. I didn't feel the need to recline my seat throughout my SIN- SYD trip. There was sufficient legroom and space under the seats to stretch your legs and ample overhead storage space. I didn't miss the entertainment as I brought my own tablet as had most people. That said onboard rental of a fully loaded iPad at $22 seems reasonable to me. While I didn't try all food on offer I did load up on snacks and I like the flexibility of being able to purchase what I wanted when I wanted. The one issue I have is the positioning of the call button on the armrest that often gets accidentally depressed whenever you shift positions in your seat. I'm not a large person but I seemed to set off the pinging each time I shifted. The downside of course is that the stewards/stewardesses may not be as responsive when you actually want to call them.

We had to pay extra to use the lounge and were told at the check-in desk to go to Singapore Airlines Business lounge - not so! Singapore Airlines wouldn't even admit Scoot Biz passengers, but instead referred us to another lower market lounge. The seats only reclined 8 inches and the leg support did nothing. I asked for 2 pillows to support my back and was told I had to pay for them. That was when the staff told me that it was not Business Class but Premium Economy.

Plenty of room to move about. We had the upgraded meals That was worth the extra compared to the normal meals we saw served. Scoot offers a free drink of your choice as part of the meal. Water was available free any time. We took our snacks onboard and there wasn't a mention from any staff about that. Then again, the snacks made no mess. We used Scoot in style at Singapore airport. Incidentally we used Krisflyer points to get a Scoot voucher and used the voucher to pay the  Scoot in Style upgrade after making our booking. You need to do all that on the website beforehand. It worked perfectly. So we arrived at check-in 3 hours ahead of the Bangkok flight and got about 2 full hours in the SATS lounge. It was worth it as you can eat and drink a lot during 2 hours! The Bangkok flight was pretty full as it was a public holiday, but Biz class was ok. Again we were offered any drink to go with our upgraded meal.  We got a seat between us empty.

Originally it was a great service with great customer service but all seems to have changed. The seats are uncomfortable the staff are unhelpful and the overhead light and crew call button is on the seat arm and keeps coming on due to just resting your arm on the arm rest. It is cold on all flights I have been on probably to get the passengers to buy Scoot blankets. My daughter recently flew to Singapore and her credit card didn't work for some strange reason. She only had a Travelex card and no cash which meant she was unable to purchase any food or drink. This is not a major problem but just inconvenient. What was deeply concerning was that the crew refused to let her have a glass of water for the whole 7+ hours! I have found the food to be unhealthy and average considering they are not charging insignificant amounts for any of it. Another word of advice is never change your flight unless you have to! They basically charge you almost the same again to change dates. It feels very much as though they have come up with a great concept and then decided to take advantage of any need such as food water warmth and entertainment and charge for it whilst providing the bare minimum of comfort. Like most airlines they even charge you a processing fee for the convenience of paying them. There is no other way to pay so they are guaranteed income from this. Then they have the add on's such as car hotel insurance and so it goes on! Overall an airline that has a great route from the Gold Coast to Singapore seems to have unfortunately turned into an uncomfortable and unreasonable airline. I will use the service in future due to convenience but not look forward to it as I have in the past! Incidentally I would have given them high scores on all aspect in the beginning except for perhaps the food. It may be better to just get the train to Brisbane and fly out from there in future.,nan,2.0,nan

We sat 3 in a row and ordered the premium meal. I noticed mine was the biggest portion of 3. One of the portions was noticeably lesser probably about 85% of mine. There was a water point providing basic drinking water or you had the option to purchase bottled water. This is our first time flying with Scoot. Other than the uncomfortable seat overall it was OK for me and I will probably fly Scoot again. Looking forward to my return flight TZ5 on the Dreamliner. TZ5 Gold Coast - Singapore. Dreamliner seat was so much more comfortable. The soft and creative lighting makes it very pleasant. The windows shades also helps to create a soothing ambience. I like the sensor toilet flush wash basin tap and auto water drain - so much more convenient. It is sad that with such an updated and modern plane there was no drinking water point provided and basic drinking water had to be purchased. The reading light is now located on top of the arm rest and it keeps coming on as we rest our arms on the handle. Our pre-booked premium meal on this return trip was served without the Haagen Dazs ice cream. After we asked about the missing ice-cream we were given a bar of Toblerone chocolate and were informed that our meals come with Toblerone instead of Haagen Dazs. Naturally we were disappointed that we did not get what we have paid for. Will I travel with Scoot again? Yes so long as I do not need to buy basic drinking water on board and I get my meals purchased. If Scoot cannot deliver the meals purchased online they need to reconsider their model of not allowing outside food and drinks on board. There was a meal change after I booked my ticket and meal.

The only reason IFE still exists is when you don't have access to Internet or your phone. If you don't really care about travel prestige not having hot towels and complimentary toiletries is fine willing to eat before you board and is trendy enough to substitute IFE for Internet access then you can get a really good deal out of this airline which consistently offers half the ticket price of legacy airlines over long-haul routes.,nan,5.0,nan

Why wouldn't I be taking the same amount of luggage for the following flight if that is my final destination? I've never had to book preferences for each leg of a flight. Not to mention when it comes to seating, if you just 'continue' it will automatically pick a seat for you and charge you, you have make sure to uncheck the box if you don't want that absurd charge (that I actually caught on to). Anyway, on the app if you have a layover you have to slide the screen over to set your preferences for the following flights, which I didnt realize, because like I said before I've never had to do that. They could make the app more user friendly by actually guiding you through each flight instead of trying to trick you and making you pay more in the end because you had to book extra luggage after the inital booking.

The seats were stiff and uncomfortable, there were no meals provided for 8 hour flights, they had to be purchased separately. The flight back from Korea was delayed for 2 hours, everyone who had to detour in Taipei was stuck for 2 hours and this was in the midnight 1-3am. I felt very sorry for a little girl who was extremely tired but since we arrived late from the Korea flight there were no seats left at the waiting area in Taipei so she had to sleep on the ground with her bag under her head. Both times I boarded the flight, both arrived late. No compensation was offered and the pilot claimed it was due to Taipei's runway being closed. Personally, I did not feel that the announcement sounded apologetic, it seemed more like an excuse to me. Afterall, the flight was already an hour late upon arrival in Taipei so clearly whatever the runway issues were the late arrival had nothing to do with it. A more comprehensive view of all the problems with my trip with Scoot. It was booked by my company therefore I was not given the choice to pick. When I checked the itinerary the first thing that alerted me was no 25kg check-in baggage. My boss' secretary booked it and when I asked she mentioned she did not know it was not provided because she assumed that all international flights would include it. Therefore, we had to pay for the baggage which eventually summed up to cost even more than Vietnam Airlines which already included the baggage fees (I did a price comparison on my own). I was sent on a two week business trip which required me to ship a laboratory equipment back. Another problem cropped up when I was supposed to ship the parcel back. I was paged by one of the airline personnel to the boarding gate. She informed me that the parcel has been detained because it does not fit the airline regulations. Firstly, like all the other normal, regular people, I do not read all the airline regulations although I have a rough understanding of what is allowed and what isn't. This knowledge obviously does not comprise of laboratory equipment and other aspects which are uncommon to be brought on board - if there was a problem they should have alerted me during the check-in of my bag, not when I am about to board a plane. The staff then told me I have to leave the equipment behind. She was pretty rude, trying to shove her piece of airline regulation in my face telling me that the specifications for the equipment exceeds those of the airline regulations. I am not Korean and the manufacturer's description were in Korean. I told her to open it and read it herself and I have no problem with that. She told me they already did and I just cannot check this in. She did not give me any solutions to my dilemma. What I got from her was basically, ""Miss, the airline does not allow us to take this on board, so please just dump it here and get on your flight."" I was obviously very annoyed by this as I had paid for the excess baggage. So I told her if the baggage is now left behind, I should at least be refunded for my baggage fees. She gave me a downright no. There was no effort being put into trying to make the customer happy. She didn't even offer to ask. All in all, no more Scoot for me.",Business,1.0,1.0

It's not the inedible food. No, it's the staff. I flew Scoot within a month of their first flight and they were genuinely trying. Now, they have all become SIA wannabes, following the rules with slavish zeal. I don't mind when there is at least the intention to improve my safety. I got used to being told to put my seat upright when still at 40,000ft, etc. And it is just amusing that none of the staff can pronounce ""Let's get outta here"", without it sounding like ""customers go away"". But yesterday, I arrived at DMK airport in Bangkok 56 mins before the departure time to be told, along with a bunch of other disappointed customers, that the check in desk was already closed. No amount of pleading would get the man with the walkie talkie to waver from the script, despite there being plenty of time to clear through. With Bangkok's traffic, I can imagine this is going to happen quite often. This cost me two additional airport taxis, a night in a hotel and a new one-way ticket (with another airline).

I had an aisle seat with a couple next to me in the window and middle seat, so I soon transferred to an empty middle block of three. The seats are narrow - about 43-45cm but having three allowed me to snooze quite comfortably and better than in what is euphemistically called 'business class' with minimal recline and those horrible large non retractable armrests. Why would anyone waste an extra A$200 plus one way for less comfort? Staff were friendly but the design of the light and call buttons (and 'cancel call' button) in the armrest meant they frequently went to seats where passengers had mistakenly pressed it. Which designer thought of this? The meals are horribly expensive and a small icecream (we'd call it a 'buddy' in Australia) was an extortionate A$6. I brought my own water filled at Sydney Airport after passenger screening: a small Evian bottle on board was an outrageous A$4 with no free tap water available. There was an inadequate number of toilets on board (five for about 295 seats in economy class, although there were a total of slightly less than 300 on board including in so-called ScootBiz.)

Boeing 787,Business Class,4.0,November 2015,1.0,3.0,nan,no,Singapore to Narita,4.0,"For a recent business trip, I found Scoot which offered some great Business Class rates for locations that I travel to regularly and decided to give them a try. Because of route limitations (Narita to Hong Kong), I had to piece my flight together by purchasing each leg individually. While purchasing my flights, I found that even though the basic airfares offered are the same as those sold on other travel websites, it is not obvious until you have completed your initial order that everything else is ""a la carte"" with regards to cost. Since I fly Singapore Air regularly, it was nice that an option to count my Scoot flight on my Kris Flyer account, it was ridiculous that I have to pay extra for this feature ($20-$30 extra). But there are a number of things that Scoot's website either fails to disclose, is not well worded or has hidden on some obscure page on their site requiring hours of searching. One items it that their online check in is only available for flights DEPARTING from Singapore. Additionally, I suggest making sure to double and triple check your travel dates and times since their website did not provide me with a flight on the date and time of day that I had requested (requested Fri evening, was giving FRI AM past midnight schedule instead of making it Sat AM past midnight). For the HK to Singapore leg, I found that Scoot offered a nice comfortable ride, fast boarding (Business Class) and fairly good service from the flight crew. Scoot is definitely an all economy airline since additional beverages beyond what was included with the meal were offered even for purchase. Speaking of the meal, unless you like eating what is similar to cheap frozen microwave meals, I suggest as others have mentioned to bring your own food along. Also the flight crew do not remove the plastic cover before serving you so make sure to drape your napkin across your clothes to avoid splattering yourself. At least the flight crew were nice and friendly and were dressed like flight crew's from the 50's and 60's which was a nice change from the stuffy or garish looking uniforms that other airlines use. As for my Singapore to Narita flight, this is when I learned that Scoot's website made an error with my flight request. Like I noted previously, I had requested for a flight on Friday afternoon or evening specifically and did not realize that it had offered me a flight just past midnight on Thursday evening instead of Saturday. So this is where things got really interesting. First, based on the way the website was worded when I attempting to login and make a flight change 2 days before hand that the site said I could not make any changes until 24 hours before my scheduled flight. So I waited and tried to make the change 24 hours before my flight but was still not allowed to do so. Well like any other traveler, I decided to just call and have the change made over the phone - only to my surprise to learn that I was marked a ""No Show"" because the flight I had paid for had already boarded and was about to depart. Unlike other airlines, the Scoot rep rudely told me that the error was my fault and that their policy was to not refund the cost of the flight especially since I was now marked as a ""No Show"" and became argumentative, so Customer Service is definitely not a strong feature for Scoot.",Business,3.0,nan

Bought the fares on a sale, and even with fees with checked-in luggage, it was about half the cost of a full-service airline. The seats were fantastic - especially for a low cost airline. According to Seatguru economy seats were a generous 18""-19"" wide. This is wider than many full-service airlines. Practically speaking, this could mean a difference between being able to tuck your elbows between the seat handles (instead of clashing with your neighbour's elbow) or not. Leg room was also adequate, although I am shorter than average (5'8""). The ScootBiz seat was, obviously, much more comfortable. But note that it is a Premium Economy, rather than Business offering. It involved reclining wide seats but added utility is limited because the leg rest awkwardly stops mid-calf and cuts off your circulation after a while. The major let-downs were twofold. Firstly, the appalling attitude the ground and especially call centre staff. After talking to them I felt like they were doing me a huge favour by allowing me to fly on Scoot. I get that it's a budget airline, but it doesn't cost much (if at all) to be slightly more courteous. The second is the food. You are not allowed to bring your own food, and you need to buy theirs.

Scoot were competitively priced on our routes from Hong Kong to Perth and then Perth back to Singapore, so I thought I'd give them a go given their association with Singapore Airlines which bred confidence. I was genuinely amazed how much room I found myself with, seat width I didn't find an issue. On one leg we asked whether it were possible to sit at one of the pairs of seats at the rear of the plane. I highly recommend these. There was plenty of space to the side of the window seat to place books etc. I found the staff pleasant and flights were punctual. I can't comment on the food as I didn't try it but the on-board Wi-Fi was very impressive. Reasonably priced (about £8 for 3 hours if I remember correctly) which kept me entertained. Only negative was the placement of the lighting/attendant buttons on the armrests. Proper design issue there I think. The lack of entertainment was expected so I can't complain but it's probably the only factor that differentiates it negatively from a full service carrier.

The cabin was hot, as there are no overhead airvents it just got worse as the flight went on. What makes this issue worse is they charge you a lot for water when they are running a very hot cabin. I wrote to Scoot feedback about this issue and they confirmed they run the cabin at 24c degrees. Once the sun streams in through the windows and there's no cool air in the cabin it feels a lot hotter. From this flight my mother got sick and she was unwell for the rest of our trip. I read all the negative reviews of Scoot but went into flying with them with an open mind but I couldn't ignore how uncomfortable flying with them is. Next the seats, after a few hours it feels like a metal bar is pushing into your lower back, I found them unbearable, the food wasn't much better. Because of this we changed carriers when we flew back and went Emirates, which after you add all the add ons on Scoot really wasn't much more expensive. It was like night and day - we had ventilation, the food was decent and the seats comfortable . Why do Scoot run the cabins so hot and why no ventilation. These are basic needs of human comfort. The cabin attendants were rude - one had a fair old go at my mum for eating a sandwich she bought at the airport.  Once we landed in Singapore they parked at a stand and bussed us to the terminal, considering the amount of clear gates, is this really necessary ?",Family Leisure,3.0,2.0

It was our first time so we did not realise the biz class seats did not recline much and the leg rest also did not come up. We bought biz cos we thought we would get a better rest on the redeye but instead, passengers in economy were able to take 2-3 seats and lie down while there is a non-movable handrest between the biz seats and my toddler couldn't lie on my lap so ended up being even more uncomfortable. I brought packet oats for my toddler and wanted just a bowl of hot water but even that could not be accommodated. I guess this is budget but I don't know what biz class I was paying for. On the return flight, we missed the cutoff for the checkin counter by 5 min, that is clearly our bad as we didn't know it was 1 hour cutoff (In Singapore mostly 40 min) but what annoyed was the scoot counter staff attitude. It's tough for anyone to miss their flights but they were really mean and rude about it. I then realised the Economy class passengers for this flight were still being checked in and asked why we couldn't then get on but she said its because we were not already in the queue by the 1 hour mark. So it wasn't like the counter had closed which I would fully understand but just for the principle of it. This inflexibility really put me off. Next she tells me too bad, the tickets are non-refundable (we paid $2700 for the 3 tickets - not exactly cheap cos i wrongly thought biz class was worth it). They had no scoot counter at the airport and there is no wifi at the airport. So I had to make multiple long-distance calls to find out tomorrow's flight would cost be another $2k. At this point, I gave up and opted to buy 3 new full-fare ticket on SIA from Brisbane airport. It was a mistake to fly Scoot. Should have just flown a return flight on SIA from the get-go.

Since they do not have the same facility to check luggage through to a connecting flight, one has to have the expense and inconvenience of entering a transit country immigration-wise just to collect luggage and check it in again when the other airline commenced check-in many hours later. So the parent company gets almost the same fare for an airline operating much cheaper and so makes a greater profit! Seems like the reason for having Scoot is to run it so poorly is to make SIA look better by contrast, and convince passengers pay the slightly higher fare. In compensation for the flight delay Scoot offered a trifling voucher to use on another flight in the near future - a highly unlikely scenario for most.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

I received an email from Scoot around September changing the return date from 30/10/16 to 1/11/16. Unfortunately as a result I was unable to take the booking. The email from Scoot advised that they would refund the return trip cost. I have called them twice for the refund, each time taking at least 15-20 minutes to get through to their Philippine call centre. But still no refund. I am a frequent flyer member with Singapore Airlines and have flown with them often, found them so efficient. How can you associate themselves with Scoot, It brings them down.

Service on the plane was decent, attendants treated us with good manners and respect, responded to requests promptly, and was generally very accommodating to the passengers. Plane delayed for 8 hrs at Narita, since Scoot didn't have arrangements with other airlines and we didn't receive the notification email before arriving, we had to sit at the check-in area for 4 hours before being allowed to go through security where we spent an additional 5 hours. Flight was scheduled for 7pm departure but by 6:45pm, the plane was nowhere to be seen, they change the departure time at 7pm, very poorly communicated. Meal vouchers were provided, which was a slight plus. Because Scoot uses one plane to fly through 4 different routes (Brisbane to Tokyo to Taipei to Singapore), delays at any of the locations would cause delays to all rest. On top of that, with the tight turnaround schedule, they had no time to clean the planes. The bathrooms were disgusting. The plane seats were dirty,  not exactly the new plane they had advertised. Greediness also comes to mind looking at how much they charged for water/drinks along with their policy of no food on-board. Carry-on luggage policy is what I had serious issues with. We carried on the same amount of luggage arriving to Taiwan as we did departing but we were told we needed to keep the carry-on weight at 10kg and below for each. Why wasn't this policy enforced from Tokyo to Taipei? Instead of taking everything out of our carry-on, we decided to check our luggage instead but then had to pay $20 per kg after 20kg, so additional $200 was paid for carry-on. To make it more infuriating, the overhead bins were empty on the plane, which means, they forced most passengers to check their carry-on. Seating, coming back from Taiwan, for our family of 4, 2 adults two kids 3 and 5, they decided to separate us and had us in different rows on different sides of the plane. Had the plane been completely booked, we would've been fine with it but there were at least 30+ seats available next to each other by the time we departed.

I alerted the stewardess about the problem before the plane took off, but no action was taken. When the meals were served, the stewardess didn't know what to do. After a few mins, she came back and asked me to have my meal at the biz class seat while my wife was unattended. She was holding on to the food all the time until I finished eating. She was then asked to go over to biz class to have her meal. My wife was very furious with such arrangement and refused to eat and requested for a refund for the service paid but not delivered. 2 more stewardess came and said there is no refund policy.

I think there are no complaints by the people who travel a lot. They know the ins and outs of low cost carriers, ie the no bringing food aboard etc, as this is pretty commonplace worldwide. I found the food and chance to buy more if we wanted was excellent and not expensive. I found the TV/movie choices to be great, and they show them the new way most airlines are doing so now on your own device. I loved the fact I could use wifi onboard.

At first they were only willing to give a travel voucher for a refund, now they are offering a refund but it will take 8 weeks to process. In the meantime we still have to purchase tickets to Athens at a premium price - a destination that we didn't need to fly into, we only decided to go that route to save money.

Although I was on the Scoot Website, I booked Scoot on the Perth - Singapore sectors but the Singapore - Hong Kong sectors were with Tiger Airlines. I paid for food on the Perth to Singapore sector and the Singapore to Perth sector. As well as seat allocation, so I could sit next to my son. I also paid for extra legroom (it was 79 AUD for each seat allocation with legroom on the Perth - Singapore return sectors. When we boarded in Perth, we were allocated our seats, but advised that we didn't order any food. As I didn't print out a hard copy of my reservation, I had no leg to stand on, and as had no wifi could not retrieve my booking. When I got to Singapore, they advised, that I had cancelled the meals (even thought I had been charged for them.) I ended up paying again for meals on board with cash. Was annoyed when I got to Singapore that we were flying Tiger, I thought we were flying Scoot. Before we returned I rang Scoot (was on hold and on the telephone call for just shy of 2 hours) to try and reinstate my meals. Scoot advised that I could not get a refund for the food not used on the first sector and now they could not guarantee any food on the return sector as was inside 72 hours. (I thought issue was resolved in Singapore on the way up), I was actually ringing to see why a seat hadn't been allocated out of Hong Kong for me as I had paid for it. I was advised that I had not paid for a seat. When we got to Singapore and was issued with boarding cards for the Singapore - Perth sector our seats were not where we had paid to sit. When I queried this, I was advised that ""we are just ground staff, we cannot do anything, and you will need to put it in writing"". I did this when I returned to Perth. Only to be advised by Scoot by email 2 weeks later that they were ""sorry for the inconvenience"" would give me a voucher for the value of 50 Singapore dollars (even thought on face value I paid $82 Singapore Dollars for each seat), and nothing was mention of the food that was not provided ($36.00).

Boeing 787-8,Economy Class,4.0,February 2017,nan,5.0,nan,yes,Bangkok to Singapore,4.0," |  I flew Bangkok to Singapore return on 26 January and 5 February respectively. Scoot uses Bangkok's older Don Mueang airport (DMK) which is slightly closer to the city centre than Suvarnabhumi airport and smaller which means a shorter trek between immigration and the boarding gates. I was not able to do an online check-in in BKK (which may not be an option out of BKK) but was able to do so for the return flight in SIN. I arrived at DMK about 90 mins before departure. There was barely any queues for check-in. After the online check-in in SIN, I was prompted to print my boarding pass which I did but there are many self-service stations near the Scoot check-in counters in Changi which prints the luggage tags and also issues boarding passes. Both flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations ahead of schedule even though the flight arriving into SIN was placed in a holding pattern for over 20 mins due to traffic in Changi. The plane from Bangkok to Singapore seems a little older with prominent carpet stains. The plane from Singapore was newer and somehow cleaner. Cabin crew were well trained and did several rounds of checks before departure and arrival. The level of detail to safety is not experienced even in some full service carriers. Announcements were clear and made in both English and Japanese. The seats have excellent recline which is way more generous than the other budget airlines I have flown on this route. Scoot flies the B787 which is my preferred plane compared to the other budget airlines which tend to fly single aisle planes for this route. If I were to fly budget carrier for the BKK-SIN route, I would choose Scoot because it offers better comfort.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I am used to deleting all add ons but no escape from Scoot, though even if you only have hand bag, nor $20 booking fee, add a cabin bag and $230 is 330+, and for one leg I even paid for unwanted insurance.

I like Scoot's 787 aircraft and the Economy class seats are some of the most comfortable around. For point to point travel they are a good deal, but I won't be using them for connecting flights again and here's why. Although Scoot will sell you an itinerary with connecting flights, the transit time can be very long. My original outbound schedule was changed such that it would have taken over 29 hours to arrive in Bangkok. I decided to connect in Singapore to another airline instead. Scoot does have a well-hidden policy for Australian travellers only, which allows for refunds in very limited circumstances - I did eventually get a partial refund on my flight, but only after I involved the Consumer Affairs authorities (and I still had to wait 10 weeks for the money). My return flight was a mere 17.5 hours elapsed, which was just about acceptable. But even though I had only carry on baggage, Scoot forced me to go through immigration in Singapore to get my onward boarding pass (after telling me in Bangkok that I could do this at the transfer desk). System limitations perhaps? Well no, if I had paid an extra $20 for ""Scoot-Thru"" they would have given me my boarding pass. Someone must have thought this was a great idea to make money out of customers, I think of it as a great way to lose customers. Another thing about connecting flights - according to the terms and conditions if you don't pay for Scoot-Thru and you miss your connection due to a delay by the airline, the airline won't help you at all - you've lost your flight! For the Singapore to Perth flight I paid THB970 for a ""super seat"". In extreme cases these seats can give you an extra 4 inches of leg room, but in my case it was only an extra 2 inches compared to my outbound flight - definitely not worth it. Speaking of extra expenses, the food is overpriced and awful. Vegetarian choices are particularly poor - and you're not allowed to bring your own. Scoot could have been a great airline, but by their mean-spirited practices they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.

Decent flights and seats but a few issues that left us all a bit disappointed. Their policy of charging over S$10/L for drinking water and refusing to provide any for free (even on an 11 hour flight) means their staff are constantly dealing with upset customers and are frequently grumpy as a result. As others have pointed out the call buttons are poorly places and set off constantly by people leaning on their armrests - the cabin staff mostly just ignore them. The menu was unimpressive, especially for an airline based out of SIN, and the hot meals (S$12) were tiny. The seat belt signs were on for more than half of our first two flights, with no turbulence, and with most passengers and the just ignoring them.

Boarding was orderly and the flight departed Singapore on time. My assigned seat was comfortable and legroom was good. Cabin crew were also generally good although they didn't really smile very often and they generally left passengers alone. Unlike AirAsia Scoot charges for inflight WiFi streaming entertainment and I thought that was not worth it. The onboard menu wasn't so impressive and food was generally expensive. The flight arrived in Hong Kong early so that's a plus point in my book. I was not really happy with the placement of the attendant call buttons on the armrest - during the entire flight I could hear many instances of passengers accidentally pressing the buttons (myself included).

Check-in at the counter in DMK had about 20-25 passengers in the queue at about 2 hours before departure. The queue moved quickly. Similar experience with check-in at SIN. Kudos to Scoot for having sufficient counters to handle check-in traffic. A quick glance at nearby counters for other carriers including full-service carriers tell a different tale; long queues of 80 passengers or more is common. The flight from BKK to SIN originated from Japan with a stopover in BKK. The flight from BKK to SIN continues to Japan. This being a B787-8, the cabin feels spacious and clean. Cabin crew provided clear announcements in English. Announcements were also made in Japanese. Cabin crew was friendly and had constant presence in the cabin.

Priority check-in at the airport, but no priority security or lounge access, free checked bag, meal on board, etc. Check-in at the airport was quick and efficient and DMK is not the busiest airport in the world so both immigration and security were quick. We arrived after boarding had started but given that we had ""board me first"" status we were actively sought out by the gate staff and whisked around the boarding queue. Seats in Scoot business are very much like the seats found in premium economy on most airlines, so 22 inch wide with 8 inch recline. They are very comfortable. There is no IFE but WiFi and a streaming service is provided free of charge in business. A hot meal is included in the price which can be either pre-booked or ordered once on board. After boarding we were given the choice of having our meal straight away or prior to landing. Everything else not pre-booked is charged for at reasonable prices.

I lined up before the counter opened and it took me an hour to reach the counter. The ground staff will allocate your seat on a first come, first serve basis so if you want a seat at the front without paying make sure you line up at least an hour before the counter opens (which is opens 3 hours before departure). Flight was on time and we even arrived 20 minutes early. There is no TV at the seat and no big TV to show you the map, so it's very boring as you don't know where you are and when you will reach your destination.

Yes they are very strict about carry on and checked bag weight. They will weigh your carry on at the check-in counter (it's should be under 10 kg). But they won't re-check the weight at the terminal.

We booked with Scoot as they had convenient flights to our destination and flew through Singapore Changi Airport (No.1 in the world according to us). We were flying Scoot Biz there and back, mainly for my wife's comfort. My wife has mobility problems, so we advised Scoot that we'd need Special Assistance at each airport we used (5 in all). Being that Scoot is a Low Cost Carrier, I was a bit dubious that they'd be reliable in actioning this request, but I'm very pleased to report that not only did they give us Special Assistance at every stage, but I'd have to say it was brilliant Special Assistance. Whether it was at the airport, where the service is provided by a contract company, or in the air, the service was nothing short of exceptional. I'd like to make special mention of the cabin staff on all of our flights. The girls in the cabin (no boys on our flights that I saw), were absolutely wonderful. My wife only had to blink and they sprang to her aid, helping her getting on and off the aircraft, as well as being continually attentive on board. I couldn't fault their service ethic and they were genuinely happy to help her, whenever she needed it. Operationally, every flight was ontime and their Dreamliners were beautiful aircraft to fly in. Just prior to our return to Australia, one of their Dreamliners was hit and damaged by another aircraft, in a ground handling incident at Changi. I thought that this may lead to delays on our flights, as I'm sure they fully use their 12 aircraft, but it had no obvious effect for us. Scoot was world class and any full service airline wouldn't have been able to do more for us than Scoot did. My wife and I were very satisfied with all aspects of Scoot's service and will definitely continue to use them and will encourage others we come into contact with, to do likewise. Extremely well done Scoot!

This was only the second week that Scoot was taking over this route (previously,it was operated by Tiger Air A320), and I was highly anticipating my journey, especially given the aircraft, a Boeing 787. This inflight experience was on par of that of full-service carriers (with the obvious expection of IFE, food that is included in the ticket price and the like), I found the seats to be really comfortable and the window shade was innovative, what with the feature to dim the windows to suit your comfort level. I ordered an item from the duty-free catalogue before take off and I received it quickly. Although being a budget carrier means that it has no free food or drinks, the service level was not compromised-on par with its parent airline, Singapore Airlines. If you are expecting the seat pitch to be on a level with other budget airlines, then get ready for a surprise-the seat pitch was as good as some full-service carriers! Although I would recommend anyone taking Scoot (as with any budget airline) to bring your own entertainment on board- but overall, the flight experience was on par with that of other carriers and they landed in Hong Kong 15 minutes ahead of scheduled! Was an amazing flight, given the low fares and the good service, I would definitely take this airline again. However, one complaint that I do have is with the armrests - the attendant call button and the overhead lights button were on the armrests, so you could accidentally press them really easily and I had to take extra care to not push them.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Bangkok to Tokyo,1.0," | Firstly, just as any budget airline, Scoot charges high fees for necessities, such as bag fee of $40 USD and seat selection fee $14 USD. Once on my 6-hour flight from Bangkok to Tokyo - they wouldn't even provide water to passengers without a fee. It was $4 USD for a bottle of water - something that should be provided for free as a human right on any flight. Thus, I find it highly inhumane that the airline will try to make profit on such simple things. I asked for a blanket (as it was an overnight flight) and was told I'd have to pay for that as well - although most long-distance flights will provide them for free. Secondly, I asked the staff if I could move to an empty row in front of my (empty row) seat for more leg room - only to be informed that I would need to pay more. Later I witnessed a few of Scoot flight attendants take up the whole row that I asked to moved to in order to take naps (as it was an overnight flight). I disembarked this flight with a very poor impression of Scoot airline and will never use them again. I recommend using proper (not budget) airlines, as the cost comes at to be the same.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Six weeks or so prior to flying I was advised Scoot was in partnership with Tigerair. I arrived in Perth on the Friday, caught up with some mates and arrived at perth Airport around 3pm by Taxi expecting my flight to depart at 6.15pm. I was advised that the flight had been delayed until around 22.15pm and therefore I would miss my connecting flight to Athens and I was to report to terminal 5 at Singapore airport upon arrival. I returned around 8pm, the departurs board revealed scoot at been delayed until 0230am - I hung around until 0130 and decided to not get this flight.

Please be aware the you will not be able to stay in the secure area if you are using Scoot as a second leg of a separate itinerary on the way to Singapore.

We booked our flights pretty early, couple of months ago prior to the flight and booked our seats for the flight. Paid about SGD 2.2k per person. From Singapore to Athens, the quality of service and the standard of the service was way below par. The air stewardesses do not know what they were doing, some told us that we could have free flow water, some then told us that actually they do not serve water unless we purchase. Thereafter when it came to meal time, the stewardesses were clearly unsure of what was on the menu, i.e. we were offered the choices of pumpkin or turkey wrap, but actually, it was a pumpkin and turkey wrap. As it was an overnight flight, we were woken up 4 hours before the arrival for our meals, which was a little annoying for some of us whom have given them instructions that we didnt want our meals. From Athens to Singapore, during check in, we realised that our first row seats were given away to customers who did a 150euro upgrade. It was unprofessional of this airline as we booked our seats way in advance, paid much more for our business class seats, and the walk-in customers whom came by the counters, decided to pay for the upgrade with simply 150 euro, and yet they could take our seats which we have chosen beforehand. And we can all foresee, the counter staff, ground staff etc all said they cant do anything about it. We sent in a feedback to Scoot and as we can all expect it, there wasnt any response from them. We met another passenger who also told us that Scoot just cancelled his flight. Word of advice: If you really have to travel via business class seats, choose the first row as the rows 2 and 3 are not worth the heavy price tag. There wasn't any certainty and your seats can be given away to others.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I was literally screamed at by a cabin attendant when I wanted to take a general cabin view picture during boarding (I grudgingly complied). With other airlines it's an ok thing so long as you don't take pictures of cabin crew, which is the regulation in Europe. But why do they have to be so rude towards someone who just wants to document his flight experience? My flight departed Penang late which resulted in a late arrival in Singapore. No Scoot WiFi on these planes. Probably the only plus point was the ground staff in Penang who were polite. So although the seat pitch and comfort was acceptable on this flight and the price was amazing, the service was under par. ",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

Had a delay of nearly 12 hours for my flight from Melbourne to Singapore. All I received was an email sent the night before informing us of the delay for our morning flight the next day. Reason given in email for the delay was due to ""operational constraint"" which was rejected by my insurance. I understand from the cabin crew that the delay is due to technical issues but customer service staff refuses to provide a proper report hence I am unable to claim my insurance for the delay. Got a $50 voucher from Scoot for the delay, used it to book another scoot flight and was charged an additional mystery charge. Called and found out it was wrongly charged yet they refused to refund.

So I called Scoot, they told me to just book a ticket for my wife and me and add our daughter to our tickets, and after booking I would need to call Scoot again to request for a seat for our daughter. It turned out when I called to confirm the seat that I had to pay the adult seat rate to get a seat for my daughter after already paying for the infant fee of 75SGD! So eventually I paid almost the double fee for my daughter than I had to pay for our own tickets! It is a ridiculous policy of which I still can't believe that they even dare to request this!

And when we return back to Singapore after four nights, the same food choice was out of stock again.

Although our flight, date and time did not change apparently our seats did, which we weren't aware of. They mentioned something about an upgrade at Singapore and after reading the review of 12 August, it appears our seats we booked were sold to a higher bidder.

Boeing 787-8,Economy Class,2.0,July 2017,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,Bangkok to Kansai,2.0," |  Bangkok to Kansai. Due to the fact that I was in a tour group, I couldn’t choose the airline I was flying. I wanted to fly Thai Airways, however that wasn’t possible. On a timeline scale, I reserved an extra ticket for my Mum in business, as it was on sale at the time. It was only $200 on the first sector, so we brought it. It would also benefit me and my brother by having an empty middle seat. Initially, I asked for an exit row, and got the best seat, 4J and 4H. However, the boarding passes they printed us were the flimsy receipt type. Once I got on board, the flight attendant at the door greets you,  and find out that there is someone occupying my seat. I call the purser, and she is unwilling to help and throws the responsibility at ground staff. They then say that this was a double seat assignment and that I had to sit in row 15. The seat itself isn’t appealing, and some short haul aircraft have better seats. I could’ve paid extra for seats with extra legroom, but since it was a group booking this had to be done at check in, and inevitably led to the double seat assignment. Luckily, the scheduled aircraft to fly this flight was a 2 month old 787. But the plane looked like it had suffered years of abuse! The most annoying thing also mentioned in previous reviews are the call button/light switch, awkwardly placed on the armrest. I understand the 787 doesn’t have call buttons on the ceiling, but can’t you find a better place for it? After takeoff, I order a lasagne and pasta for my brother. The lasagne tasted unappetising, while the pasta tasted really bland. A little bit later in the flight, I had Ice cream for dessert and also nachos prior to landing. All this food set me back 50 Singaporean dollars. The equivalent amount of food on AirAsia would only cost me a third as much, and also tastes better.  On the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, the staff at the check in were friendly like Japanese people are, and I requested an extra legroom seat, and found out I wouldn’t be charged for it since the flight was overbooked. However, my brother wasn’t allowed to sit there, so we asked if he was allowed to sit in The “ScootInSilence” zone, which he wasn’t allowed to, even though he was 13 and the minimum age to sit there is 12. There was a lady and her daughter talking in Japanese in the counter next to us, and later in the flight, I saw her and her daughter (who looked like she was 10) sit in the scoot in silence zone which made me question if I had a language barrier, even though the guy at the counter wasn’t Japanese. The crew on this flight were much more friendly, but still considerably cold. I went to have some conversation in the galley, and after 2 minutes of pleasant conversation they all had their backs turned on me. Scoot is a horrible choice and I would pay much more in order to be able to avoid it. Not worth the $500 I paid round trip.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

While serving me Premium Meal, the stewardess was stacking more than 1 meal on the tray and knocked a container of salad from the tray. It fell in between passengers seat. Luckily my meal was served.  The stewardess (while still holding a tray of meal - minus the salad) was on her knees trying to locate the dropped salad. She then get another stewardess to help while still holding the tray of food. And when it was time to serve food to the rest of the passengers, the cart carrying food was being emptied and so a stewardess asked another stewardess to bring extra food to re-fill the card. The air steward bought 3 trays of food and simply just place it on the floor on the aisle. The tray of food was on the floor for a full 5-min before it was placed into the cart. Seriously?

This is the worst Airline in terms of service level at the ticketing and pre-boarding service. It is the most opportunistic airline that charges absurdly for the slightest change. I kept getting cut-off in my attempt to call and under the pretext or excuse that the manager's name dealing with my case has to be kept a secret, I could never identify the person whom I am supposed to talk to. Scoot had allowed me to change the passenger for the air ticket that I bought for my daughter. But due to unforeseen circumstances, she cannot join us in our family trip. I had to transfer the ticket to my niece. However, during the several telephone conversation, I have been told that the change fee is between S$80-S$100. However, when I tried to make the change online, I was told it would cost me $400, almost the price of the ticket itself! Plus there would also be a fare difference charge when there is no fare change, no change in date or time or selling away my existing ticket and rebuying another! The $400 change fee comprises S$100 for change of first name, another $100 for change of last name, multiply that by 2 for the return ticket! This is the most absurd charge and the airline refused to budge telling me its in their rule!. Firstly, the rule is absurd and secondly, during all the telephone exchanges, I have only been told it is between S$80-$100 and never $400! The discussion has been going on for 2 weeks now, but there has been no resolution. I feel that I have been held to ransom as I am due to depart in slightly more than a week. I have been using Scoot alot recently. But customer service, goodwill and ethical practice obviously has no place in Scoot's management! I will think doubly hard about ever using Scoot again.

The staff is highly unprofessional and at checkin the way staff talk to customers is derogatory. You get a feeling like as if you are flying for free and Scoot is doing you a favour to you by letting you fly with them. Even after complaining to manager about the unprofessional staff there was not a single word of apology or regret from them. This airline spoiled my mood during my holiday.

We had another connecting flight from Singapore to Sri Lanka. However, we were informed that we would be given another flight next day early morning. So we were forced to collect our luggage and return home.Since we had a connecting flight, wehad to pay another 900 aud to reschedule the flight to Sri Lanka. When we returned  next morning to Sydney airport, we were informed the Scoot flight got delayed by 2 hours. Ok fine, still we had a hope that we could catch the rescheduled flight to Sri Lanka. However, finally the Scoot flight got further delayed and it left Sydney at 2 pm on 15 December. When we arrived Singapore, our (rescheduled) SriLankan airline flight has left and we had to book another flight to Sri Lanka by paying another 500 AUD which leaves next day morning. Finally, we arrived Sri lanka exactly one day later the scheduled arrival and paying more than 1500 aud extra for tickets and taxi. It was a horrible experience and like a nightmare to us. The ground staff at Sydney airport do not even know how to handle such issues. They were unprofessional and appalling. One staff member laughed at us when we asked for compensation for the connecting flight rescheduling cost, and the manager even threatened my husband saying she would not board us if we do not stop complaining.

Crew members were untrained, rude, and had extremely poor language skills. The return journey from Kochi to Singapore, only upon asking at check in desk we were told that the plane was delayed for an hour. But we were puzzled to see that the original departure time was printed on the boarding pass. Nowhere else in the airport or at the departure gate was there an indication or announcement of the delay. Upon tracking the flight status of the incoming plane we realized that the flight was delayed for at least 2 hours, and passengers were not promptly updated. At the end of the flight, again there was no acknowledgement of the 2 hr delay nor an apology. When we feedback to the crew member she just drew a blank poker face and did not bother to respond.

The plane was old, but they flew on time, the return flight was earlier. As this is a budget airline, I didn’t expect much. Food and drinks are only available at a price and the seat pitch was as how budget airlines usually go. What was most troublesome was the passengers. The moment the seatbelt light was off, the pushing and shoving begins. Everyone tried to get hold of their luggage. This seemingly old gentle man stepped on my foot twice, pushed and shoved me and others to get to his suitcase two rows away. When he was done I faced him and told him ‘you don’t need to push and shove you know, you could just ask’ and he pretended he didn’t understand English. If you can, just check in your luggage.

A guy we recently met had 3 bags due to finding a sleeping bag at a festival but he wasn't told he was over the luggage limit and brought it on the flight. My boyfriend experienced a problem when his boarding pass was scanned. Apparently his seat number got changed after check-in and was moved from a window seat to an aisle seat. Because all the seats in my row were occupied, I couldn't get much sleep or relaxation during the 11 hour flight.

To add to our misery our hand luggage had to be kept in between our legs as the overhead compartment was full. The hot meal pack food is pathetic. Other then that no much choice and very expensive.

The delay was 2.0 hrs long - if it was 3 hrs or more the airline would have to issue every passenger a $50 voucher - however flight landed at Singapore 2 hrs later than scheduled. Before boarding the staff at Sydney airport promised me that my connecting flight and stay arrangements would be sorted once I met the staff at Singapore - my connecting flight had left 2 hrs before I landed, staff was overtly rude.

The staff on board are fine, the food (don't buy it) is awful, the seats are tiny, i'm not that tall (under 6ft) but couldn't fit my legs in without spreading into the aisle, very uncomfortable journey.

She  put the parents at ease and handled the situation in a most kind and professional manner. She also made it a point to talk to children on the flight and picked them up and took them for little walks whenever she saw the parent looking tired or the child looking restless.

The customer service kept saying to buy a new ticket.  It was just a 5 mins difference and we had to purchase a new flight ticket. I find this really ridiculous as the airline had a policy of check-in closed an hour before flight. This policy does not reflect in the scoot app. The policy only reflects on the invoice sent via to email.

As we were walking away we are called back to be told that the Scoot flight has been cancelled and Scoot has tendered a Singapore Airlines plane but there would be no refreshments or entertainment offered. On top of that we lost our lounge access and Scoot in silence. About a week after we got home I find out that there has been fraudulent activity carried out with my credit card in India, one of our stops around the world. I had to get a new card. I then started the process to get my money refunded from Scoot and that has continued to this day (5 months later).

I know it is a budget airline, but there's no excuse for getting the basics wrong. Flying out of Sydney to Singapore on Dec 29th, the check-in queue was the longest I have seen one in my life - it went past the barriers and all the way down the public area to almost the next main exit. Apparently they had delayed a flight the night before and it was now leaving about the same time as ours 1.30pm / 3pm no problem, that happens. But in this case, they know exactly how many people are going to be arriving, and when, and there were so few staff checking people in it was ridiculous. I barely moved for 30 mins (in the queue where the check-in counters were so far away I couldn't even see them) and was now less than hr from take -off. The let me skip the q but they should have had people separating the queue into the 1.30 and 3pm flights from the outset. A text message to flyers saying to expect delays at check in and arrive earlier would have also been a no-brainer. On the flight itself, it took nearly 2 hours for the drink carton to come around, by which stage a man at the back was dehydrated and distressed. The menu in the pocket related also to a different flight. I travel by budget airlines frequently but will never fly Scoot again.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

I am a regular Scoot customer but unfortunately I had on numerous occasions been tricked by the Scoot website unaware of the not very clear and not very straight forward system into paying extras. On my last Oct flight, while I unticked the box of not buying insurance, it somehow was ticked at the final page and I had to pay the extra for the travel insurance which I had already taken up with another company. I just let this pass because it was not a lot of money. On my recent trip in Jan 2018, I booked my ticket to Taipei on 22 Dec and decided to add a check-in luggage on 24 Dec. I had went on the site to manage booking and add luggage and thought it went through and while it was Christmas eve, I had little time to follow up with email. On the 9 Jan 2017 I arrived at Tao Yuen airport and put my check-in luggage and was told I did not buy any and was to pay NTW3660 for a 17kg luggage. I wish to advise those who are not very computer savvy to be very careful when booking online with Scoot, you need to double check very careful each step you tick or enter, they will suck your money and no reasoning. I had many other occasions paid for chosen seat but being allocated another at the airport. You need to take screen shots on every step or they will trick your money.

So be careful, weigh your luggage and make sure it is below 10kg. The seats are close together, tight. Surprisingly, at Zhengzhou Xinzheng Airport, Scoot counter is very friendly and up-to-standard. This was not expected at all. The ground staff is professional and helpful. For budget travelers in the early morning or mid-night scene, it could say a lot about local hospitality.

No explanation is given but the staff were very thorough in checking all the luggage with a couple of kgs above the limit so they could charge the overweight excess to the passengers.

After a 5h30 long flight, we arrive at Changi Airport (Singapore) and are told to wait because the aircraft doesn't have a place to taxi. We wait 45 min inside the aircraft, again with no proper apology or any kind of proper compensation. On a full flight with plenty of families with small kids, they don't even have the courtesy to give out some water for the children. To top it off, we reach the belts area to collect our luggage and our flight is not even announced on any screen. The passengers have to go around and guess which belt is our luggage being dumped on. For a flight that costs 400SGD return, the service offered is shamefully poor. It shows lack of professionalism and respect for customers.

Hand luggage policies strictly enforced on KBV-SIN sector, but boarding efficient. Crew a far cry from competitors and were practically invisible. Both flights departed on time, though return was still a bit late. Punctuality is all you can reasonably hope for when flying low-cost airlines, but given the high cost of the ticket, I still didn't feel I get what I paid for. You can't expect much when flying a low-cost carrier, but Scoot falls far below even its low-cost competition - and it has plenty in the region.

The first flight was delayed 30 mins before boarding (""because they were cleaning the plane"") and then, once we all had boarded, around 50 more minutes without any explanation. On the second flight we landed more than one hour later. I think it's crazy that they don't provide you even a bottle of water. You are stuck there easily for 12 hours and you don't get anything. Even if it's a low cost company you are still paying! I tried to buy some food and they don't accept debit cards so I didn't drink or eat from Singapore to Athens. Of course they don't have screens for entertainment. The air conditioning was crazy freezing. Many people complained (an old guy had a huge argument with one member of the crew).

The queue at Changi was horrendous - we waited 2-3 hours with minimal desks open and like a cattle market. The plane was basic, no screens, no ability to purchase wifi on computer - but you'd forgive this as it's budget. But stocking enough food for the flight is basic, and did not happen. Landed at Sydney and my luggage did not come. 5 other people were affected. It's a direct flight, how do you lose luggage? They made me a property irregularity sheet (with no reference number) and simply said wait till we contact you. I had no clothes, no belongings for 3 days. You ring the customer services and you can't get through, if you do they cut you off (happened twice) because they can't be bothered or may be they are trained to do it. They eventually returned me my luggage but no offer of compensation, nothing. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

The next day, Scoot charged me 3 times the amount I paid for the flight home . So in addition to the flight which I did not use (7,880 bahts) , I was charged 23,700 bahts for the early flight home.

Scoot changed the flight departure time but didn't tell Virgin so I was not allowed to board the flight.

It was unbelievably disrespectful and I was unfairly treated in Manila airport. Missed my flight due to long queue in the immigration despite checking in early and the flight took off earlier than departure date but that’s not the problem. The way I was treated at the gate was a disgrace. Instead of trying to listen to my queries I was bombarded by remarks where it’s not the airlines fault and it’s entirely all my fault and the airline is not liable. I was only trying to raise my queries 1) what happened to my ticket 2) what’s the alternative to get to my destination. At least I get an idea what can I do next. But all I get is a small piece of paper with the customer service number to reach out to (called the number and all I get was voicemail - all executives were busy). Managed to get through once and while verifying the phone got dropped off. The most surprising thing is all the staff at the gate just left! Left me by myself! I had to hunt for my luggage somewhere at the 4th floor of the airport and again! No one was there. They had no idea where my luggage was and they made me wait at the corner for 45 minutes at around 12.30am. This is disgraceful for an airline. What’s worst is how I was being treated. Maybe those staff are just hurrying to go home with their bag packs. Absolute disgrace! Maybe it’s a one off but this is the worst experience I’ve had in my life!,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

My flight to Athens from Sydney was uneventful and easy, however my inflight meal which I purchased at the time of booking the ticket was quite rubbery and not hot. This isn’t something I’d write a bad review over, however my experience on the return flight back to Sydney has been absolutely atrocious. After attempting to purchase additional baggage online multiple times on separate devices the website failed and crashed many times. I was finally able to get through and pay for my extra check in luggage ($123) the night before the flight. Upon arriving at the airport to check in on time, I was told I was unable to because o had an outstanding balance of $83 to which they couldn’t tell me what it was for, but “if I didn’t pay, I wouldn’t fly”. Not only could they not explain this fee, the attendant who was handling this issue seemed to be incompetent with their system and couldn’t get it to work. Although I wasn’t exactly sure what was going on because she ignored me as if I wasn’t there and would stop intermittently and fill a stapler with fresh staples! This went on for so long that I had my baggage given back to me and told I had missed check in and now had missed my opportunity to get my flight. There was zero communication to myself as the customer, no attempt by the staff to be helpful or treat this as an urgent matter to assist me in getting this issue sorted out, and no apology for the fact that this was an operational fault of Scoot as an airline. I was upset at the fact that I had now missed my flight, and the attendant that had been supposedly helping me simply rolled away in her chair and sat behind a desk messing with receipts. Not to mention the huge line of frustrated and ignored people behind me waiting for assistance for a separate flight. I can’t believe how horrible this experience was as a customer. I hope the airline improves on this in the near future, because I’d hate for anyone else to have to go through what I experienced today.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

No in-flight entertainment, but I just used my iPad and downloaded a few movies on Netflix. We experienced a delay on our return leg from Phuket to Singapore, which we thought may cause issues with our connecting flight. However staff managed the issue well and gave us updated and information where to go on arrival at Singapore. And last of all, if you have to have a stopover, why not make it at Changi airport.

We generally avoid Scoot but for this routing the timing and fare were the best combination we went ahead. Most important: we arrived on time and safely, and so did the luggage, so no complaints about that. But in general this airline is really annoying to fly. Their business class doesn't even have paper towels in the bathrooms - you can dry your hands on facial tissues. No blankets - unless you want to pay $15. (Oh, and though it's a Singapore based airline they charge for extras in USD - because they are bigger.) No entertainment - not even screens. Seats recline somewhat. Food varies from not bad to quite mediocre. Service is officious and rigid - even when there were only ten people in the business class cabin they couldn't bring themselves to be flexible on mealtimes. Everything is about the rules, nothing is about the passengers. I don't think that's the fault of the crew - it is probably the management. Trying to check in on line from Tokyo was impossible because the website - whether the JP website or the SIN website - only supplies Singapore as a point of departure, there are no other choices. Condescending - the pilot refers to the staff as ""our Scootees"" - as if they are owned property. It's basically a run-of-the-mill low-cost airlines with pretensions. I wouldn't say avoid at all costs; I would say expect a quality of service and professionalism a little below AirAsia and you will probably get what you are looking for.",Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0
