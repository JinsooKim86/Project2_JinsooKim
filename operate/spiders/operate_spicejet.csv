This time I made a mistake by taking my sisters phone inside the airport and since I passed the security area, there was no way for me to physically hand over the phone.

I had only hand-baggage, so no interaction with ground staff,on previous occasions i have checked in with spicejet in HYD, a pleasant experience. It was a bus gate, the ride to the aircraft was smooth. Flight was delayed by almost 90 mins. Legroom on this aircraft is less and could have been more. The cabin crew is good and well trained, there was a small medical emergency which was handled well by the crew. This one was an older aircraft. Only negative point is the seat.",Business,4.0,nan

They sell food on this 40 minute flight but ran out of most options by the time they reached me- and I was in row 7!!

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu. The time of my web-booked flight had changed but I had not been notified of this and therefore arrived at the airport far too early. Luckily there was an earlier flight and the person at the ticket counter changed my booking to this flight at no extra cost. Seats were allocated at check in but there was no scramble anyway as there were only 100 passengers. The 737-800 was clean and the crew were quite friendly. Overall a positive experience - but Spicejet have already started cutting routes and frequencies so things are looking tough for the Indian locos.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Pune to Chennai return. Flown for the first time with them and found them okay. Planes were new and clean. Both flights were on time. FAs well groomed and do a good job. Food served was not free and was more of a snack. For the fare they charge you its a very good airline to fly with in India.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,DEL-CJB (via HYD). We chose this flight for its convenient timing. SpiceJet's ticket office at Delhi Airport is very hard to find (as an exception to the rule it's located outside the temporary ticketing hall). Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages. These two unpleasant situations were not handled well by what came across as a particularly arrogant FA. Landed in CJB on time.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,PNQ-HYD. I booked with a foreign credit card which caused a bit of a delay at check-in. All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear. Overall a good value for the price I paid at about $52 for an advance purchase one-way ticket.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,AMD-HYD return quite happy with the product. New B737-800. Were offered soft drinks & peanuts on a 1 hr 15 min. flight. FAs attentive and efficient.

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,DEL-BOM-DEL. A good and cheap budget carrier. New spotless aircraft friendly service and flights were in time. I have no complaints at all except the horrible Delhi airport but that is not the fault of Spicejet.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,BLR-DEL-BLR because their price was very attractive. The meal price is reasonable and meal was good. Seats okay service fine. The return flight was delayed for an hour however the crew was apologetic.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Delhi-Kolkata return on 737-800. The check-in at Delhi was fast and staff polite and helpful. The departure was on time and plane was spotless. Seats were allocated there were no charges for checked luggage and a bottle of water was given to each passenger. In row 11 the seat pitch was fairly tight but only a problem when the person in front reclined her seat. Check- in at Kolkata was OK but travellers should be aware that you go to have all your luggage scanned before going to the check-in desks.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Cochin to Mumbai. I As it is a low-fare airline you have to buy food or drinks onboard but prices seem reasonable. The plane seemed clean.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Delhi to Chennai. 3 hour delay due to dodgy plane. New plane had 18 fewer seats but we still try and fit everyone on. 3 adults and 2 kids per row. Don't start the air conditioner for an hour as you sit on the tarmac in 45 degree heat. Almost mutiny everyone standing up and waving their arms around. No food and the least leg room I've ever seen on a flight.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Pune to Delhi return flight. Convenient timings with a 9am arrival in Delhi. Smooth check in and service on flight satisfactory. Return again convenient with a late evening flight arriving at 2300. Full flights both ways so aircraft crowded and the leg room in the seats are so limited that you feel crammed in for the flight. Fare similar to others but as its non stop it pips Indigo airlines on this route.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,We booked our tickets on Spicejet with a travel agent in Surat on August 2009 for travel January 2010 for Goa to Mumbai flight in the afternoon so some of us can catch a flight back to US from Mumbai that night. As we were standing in line at Goa airport for more than an hour they took down the Mumbai sign at the check in counter. On inquiry the check in person told us the flight was cancelled and the fare will be refunded to the travel agent- no other assistance or help. We had to scramble to GoAir counter to get to Mumbai before we are no show at the international flight. GoAir charged us INR 45951 for 7 tickets to Mumbai. Spicejet is irresponsible in its policies and attitude. They left 200+ international passengers in limbo at a place without accomodation or any other help. In light of our experience I would advise anyone with any plans for further travel to stay away from booking their tickets on Spicejet unless they want to jeopardize their plans and wallet!,nan,1.0,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Keenly priced tickets. They take a practical view of baggage allowances which is very helpful. Overhead lockers are somewhat low and can be awkward for odd-shaped carry-on bags. FAs are very courteous. Seat pitch is unsatisfactory but for short flights this may not pose a problem.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,CJB - DEL (via HYD). Departure punctual arrival late due to endless approach into Delhi. Whilst you get what you pay for in terms of service on this type of airline I was surprised at the rudeness of the CC. When on the ground in HYD one of them addressed me as if I was an inmate in a prison camp for wishing to use the toilet. However in the air with turbulence warning and seat belt signs on pax were walking up and down to the toilet freely.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Mumbai-Delhi check-in did not take very long. Seats were pre-assigned as the flight was full 20 mins delay departing. B737-800 cabin clean. Seat pitch very tight. Food for purchase was a good selection of snacks and beverage ie. sandwiches cookies muffins tea coffeeetc. Cabin crew disappeared after food sale and only returned to collect the trash. Overall a good experience except for the very tight seat the price was extremely competitive.,nan,nan,nan
nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed. Was the worst Indian airline in terms of punctuality and service. Also they seem to get the furthest possible bays which means taking almost an hour from the plane to the airport after landing. I would not fly with them again.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,MAA-TRV. Chennai Airport looks like it needs replacing and the security queue snaked around the terminal building. The flight was late boarding mainly because the domestic terminal only had two gates in use. Aircraft was a modern Bombardier Q400 which was two thirds empty. The wrong aircraft safety card was in my seat pocket I showed this to one of the crew and she replaced it. Cabin Crew were attentive and efficient in their tasks. Flight arrived 30 minutes late into Trivandrum and the bags took about 15 minutes to come out.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Flew Bombay to Kochi on Spicejet. Early morning departure and a full plane. My partner and I got seats in the last row - uncomfortable and cramped for the 2 hour flight but a full flight so no chance of changing seats. Poor service on board with terrible crew. Got to Kochi only to be told the return flight was cancelled on our date of return. Called their Customer service and were rebooked very efficiently on another flight- and even to a new destination as we had missed a connection. Flight back much better. Service great. Was like flying 2 different airlines.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,We were flying to Trivandrum from Chennai. The journey takes about one hour fifteen minutes. The flight was announced and we boarded at 6.30 pm and were supposed to take off at 7 pm. No announcement till 7.15 pm. When passengers approached the cabin crew they did not know what was happening. The flight crew was arguing with the ground staff. There was nothing to eat or drink. The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful. If there was an issue the airlines should have delayed the flight instead of boarding passengers and make them wait on the Tarmac without any option of cancelling the journey or even getting refreshments. We never did the mistake of taking a Spicejet flight again.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,This is a low fare airlines that appeals to many budget minded travelers. However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight.,nan,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,DEL-KTM-DEL on a relatively old B737-800. Nothing much is expected from a LCC but the worst part was the leg room and space. As we were travelling with our 6 month old child we barely moved for the entire 1.5 hrs flight due to limited space. Barring this everything else went fine. FA were courteous and helpful.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,BLR-DEL. Smooth check in friendly ground crew. We were flying their 737-900 aircraft. Poor seat pitch. I'm 5'11 and my knees kept knocking the seat in front. Agreed Economy airlines offer bad legroom but this was hopeless. Luckily I was the only person in my row and could get some extra room by reclining the middle seat. Food is not free as with most budget carriers rates are good.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,SpiceJet from Hyderabad-Delhi. My sister had booked a ticket for me using an international credit card but when she realised the ticket should be booked using Indian credit card if the ticket owner is not travelling she managed to get an Indian credit card from her friend and called customer care of SpiceJet and made the payment using the Indian credit card. When I reached check-in I was told I can't board the flight because payment had been made using a credit card of someone else. They didn't listen to me we had checked 4-5 times with the airline when making the payment that this would be okay. I was harassed by the staff and they asked me to pay the money in cash. Finally they took cash and asked me to sign a declaration and only then could I board the flight. When I reached home and called their customer care they just said sorry it's our system's fault.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Pune to Delhi return. The outbound was delayed and so my 11am departure became a 3pm departure. They kept messaging us the delayed time but does not help when you have appointments you are missing. The ground staff in Pune had no empathy and we got not even a hint of an apology for the delay. Cabin crew nicer - friendly attitude and good service. Return delayed as well by one hour. Check in staff in Delhi no better. The only reason I would not recommend this airline is that every flight on both days seemed to be running late.,nan,4.0,nan

Cabin crew welcoming and efficient in providing water to all passengers on a flight that wasn't quite full. Kudos to cockpit crew for a smooth take-off climb cruise descent and landing in somewhat perilous conditions (heavy rains). Plenty of legroom and well-spaced-out seats on board with ample reading in the in-flight magazine. Disappointing that the airline does not stock a few extra hot meals for those who didn't pre-order them. SpiceJet is well-placed and commendable for its extremely cost-efficient yet never lacking in any aspect of low-cost service.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,5.0,B737-900ER of SpiceJet which was one of their newest aircraft. My destination was Goa. Our boarding started 15 minutes prior to departure and there was a mess with the stamp on my boarding pass. So we had to go back to the security check area and get a stamp on - ground staff was polite and they had the bus waiting for us. We took off from Mumbai relatively on time and reached Goa in 45 minutes contrary time given by airline which was 1h 05m. I found the seat comfortable with enough legroom. We didn't buy food in-flight for a 45 min flight. The staff of SpiceJet was most polite I have seen.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Round trip from Chennai to Hyderabad. Morning departure from Chennai. The boarding was complete 20 minutes before scheduled departure time and then we had to wait for close to 30 mins for a piece of cargo to arrive from another location. The captain was prompt enough to explain the reason for the delay hence there was no confusion. Clean aircraft with attentive cabin crew. Return flight at night was delayed 2 hours but was informed about the same in the afternoon through a text message which I think is a positive step. The flight to Chennai was operated by an all women crew which I think is a first as far as the low cost airlines in India are concerned. Overall good experience.,nan,4.0,nan

Their website says you cannot do web check-in if you need to check in baggage. For an early morning flight this rule makes you leave home at least half an hour before other airlines. Staff allotted me an aisle seat in the non-reclining row before exit without informing me since I am relatively tall the leg space was quite insufficient the only reason to be thankful was the gentleman in front of me did not recline his seat. Overall have had better experiences on other Indian budget airlines like Indigo. Staff are good but could do with some more training.

One hour later after the original departure time the plane didn't show up for another 30 minutes. The plane was small but clean and looked new. Bottled water was handed to everybody. Overall the flight was pleasant but the delays make the trip exhausting for I spent more than 4 hours at the airport.

Of those 5 three were cancelled without any issues with weather/external circumstance (i.e. all internal SpiceJet operational issues) and one was delayed by 2 hours. Only one flight managed to make it to the destination on time. Worse SpiceJet does not pay for hotels or offer any sort of recompense when they cancel a flight due to operational issues (including not having enough passengers) all they offer is to book you on the next available SpiceJet fight (note that they refuse to buy you a ticket on any other airline) which is usually the next day and forces you to either pay for an additional hotel night out of pocket or lose a night that you had already paid for. They don't even offer to make the seat selection free after forcing you to change your plans completely. The additional 250 rupee charge is just a slap in the face after they tell you there is nothing they can do about completely disrupting your travel a day before you are supposed to leave. They are the worst Indian airline. Not only does SpiceJet not get you to your destination on time you're usually a day late.,nan,1.0,nan

The biggest let down about Spicejet is the fact that they have a very extensive food menu but they don't have any food or beverages onboard (except for water). I had pre-booked and paid for a meal (Chicken Sandwich) for my onward flight which was never served to me. The reason given to me was that there was no food available onboard. Don't get fooled by the pre-booking discount (20%) they offer as they charge a convenience fee which eventually escalates the price more than buying the same meal on flight.

A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said ""sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies"". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service.

In their run for on-time performance this airline now takes passengers for a ride. The staff at the gates are very arrogant and rude. I traveled from Madurai to Chennai on SpiceJet. I landed on-time and had a connection to Bagdogra. My flight was at 10.25 hrs and was denied boarding when I reached the gate at 10.00. The irony is the fact I was called from the gate at 10.00 to ask if I am on my way when I was on the escalator leading to the the ground floor gate 14. Within a minute I was at the gate and they say the flight has been cleared and will be pushing back. My question why I was called if the flight was cleared was not answered and also I wanted them to put the time and reason for boarding denial on my boarding pass. This was not done and they swiftly took me to security check and asked me to leave. There again the problem starts. The staff at the main exit gate will not allow you to leave unless staff update the records. I had to run behind the staff for half an hour to get it done and get out. I take at least 15-20 flights a month and this is the only airline I have found so rude.,Business,1.0,nan

Seats cushioning was good (better than Indigo) but space was a constraint. As my ticket was a Corporate one, meal was included. I was served a full breakfast (consisting of Idli, Vada, Uttapam, Sambhar, croissant and butter). This itself was pretty heavy and I was impressed with the meal (Indigo fares so low on the meal part). After that crew asked me if I wanted a beverage. Opted for tea.

I had 3 flights booked with this airline in the same month - the first was delayed by over 3 hours, the second was rescheduled to an earlier time without any communication and the third was fraught with airport handling issues.  Good communication and empathy softens even the toughest customers and yet this airline does not understand this very basic of customer service. Not only did the airline not understand the impact of the delays/reschedule, they dismissed the claim of paying the fare difference for the second flight which we had to book urgently on another airline which ended up costing us more than the value of the entire trip (4 flight legs). I warn potential customers - do not be tempted by the lower cost that this airline purports to offer - the delays and reschedule will end up costing you an arm and a leg. There are other low cost airlines in India and I strongly advise you to travel with them over Spicejet. I am not sure how many people find the time to write a review but I did hear chatter at the gate (for the first flight that was delayed by over 3 hours) from other passengers who said they have also never seen an airline with this terrible on time performance.

So there was no way I could get this flight. So, I asked Spicejet to provide any alternate flight to Chandigarh. As there were some other flights working for this area. But they said they can't do that and told me that they can provide a flight from Bangalore to Delhi which will depart from Bangalore at 21:10 and will reach New Delhi at 00:05 and then next flight from New Delhi to Chandigarh at 07:10 and will reach Chandigarh at 08:05. They said I have no other options. When I asked for hotel/Lounge service as there is a total delay of nearly 12 hours to reach Chandigarh. They simply denied and said no such facilities are provided. They just provided 1 basic lunch.  I had to spend more than 6 Hours in the Bangalore Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility and nearly 7 Hours in the New Delhi Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility.

The Spicemax product offers seats with more legspace at the two front rows, priority check-in baggage arrival and complementary beverage and snacks. I feel the only reason you can buy the product is if you want priority arrival of your checked in baggage. Keeping in mind the price you pay for the product, the legspace, food and beverage quality was quite ordinary. You would rather want to be in the economy seat and buy meals and drinks on board or from elsewhere. It's much cheaper that way. The legspace, contrary to their claims, didn't seem all that wide. I am a short man but felt a taller passenger would struggle there. The airhostesses were polite and answered my enquiry about beverage choice available. Didn't interact with them much but from whatever I felt, it was fine. The captain or first officer kept quiet throughout and didn't provide any update on weather, arrival or location. The flight left on time and arrived before the time mentioned in the ticket which was good.

The thought of 212 pax in an all economy configuration made me think that I would feel compressed in a tin can. However, the comfortable seats, very professional and friendly cabin crew and the background music (Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie) reminded me of how a flight must actually be.

I was able to get this ticket cheaply, about 20$, which is very cheap. At the airport, the check-in line wasn't bad. At security check there was line cutting from other people which was very frustrating, but it isn't airline's fault. To start with, value for money was absolutely 5 stars. The check-in staff looked like he worked 24/7 for 50 years; he was not kind, and I felt he wasn't willing to help. For ground service itself, I went to the plane by bus since jetways can't be connected to Q400, so beware. For seat comfort, it was very narrow. Seat pitch was average for LCC but felt shorter than IndiGo's A320. I was able to rest and the seat was comfortable to sleep. For cabin service, it was not bad but not great. Cabin crew were well trained and took care of passenger safety and told passengers to remain seated after the landing. Other than that, everything was average. For food and beverages, they provided water for free and the average cost of items is about 300 rupees. Overall, I do recommend this airline despite its little bit ""rude"" ground staffs. The flight ticket is extremely cheap, so you can expect to save your budget for a delicious meal at the airport.

I decided to go for Veg Biryani and my wife wanted Paneer Tikka Masala. When she came to take the order, we mentioned above choices but she replied that they only have Veg Cappa Noodles and Bhel. My point here is that when they have only 2 options then why can’t they make it clear in the announcement rather than giving opportunity to customer of choosing the food they like from menu and waste time. We decided to go for only left options Bhel & Cappa Noodle, so when she came to serve us the same then she asked for 350 Rs./-, I offered US Dollars because I found that in menu that they had 2 prices mentioned against each item, one in rupees and another in USD and I did have US Dollars with me (Because my current residential status is US, so my preferred way to spend money was US Dollars). She replied “let me check whether we have change for this or not” I said Ok. She came back after long and mentioned we don’t accept US Dollars in Indian flights, US dollars mentioned in menu is for our (Spicejet) international section only. The point here is when this is the rule then why she did not make it clear when I offered US Dollars in the beginning, why did she tell me that “let me check whether we have change or not”. I offered Credit Card, she said Machine is not working. Then finally I offered my last preferred mode of payment “Cash in INR” and then she accepted that and returned me the change. The staff who was dealing with me was very rude not only to me but I found her same behavior to others as well.

At some point, a stewardess told us that the people from the stairs insisted that the plane has to wait for another two people to join the flight. No clarification was brought to us. It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain, or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that the crew did nothing, but waited for 1,5 hours after the boarding was finished. The passengers asked them to call the police or the airport security but nothing happened for 1,5 hours. It was a huge chaos. At some point, many passengers, tourist mainly step out of the plane, arguing with the group of people who wanted to stop the plane for departing. No reaction again from the Spicejet crew.

SpiceJet, as you may know is a low budget airline, but who knew in this case that low budget means lowest quality? My family and I started our return flight back to Dubai with discomfort, for our seats were positioned directly in front of the emergency exit doors. So whilst we couldn't recline our seats, those in front of us could. Let me just say this resulted in little to no room for sitting, reading, or even for that matter sleeping. To provide a more visual description we were literally trapped in our seats, so if you get claustrophobic either pray you get a better seat or better yet I would recommend avoiding the flight itself. This dissatisfaction didn't stop there. The food which my sister and I had specifically pre ordered due to our dietary constraints (paleo) and already paid for was not available. As we couldn't eat any of the other meals available, we had to order 2-3 other meals and scrape at whatever we would be able to eat, which wasn't a lot as the portion sizes were extremely small, in comparison to the food available at the airport which we didn't consume due to the fact that our pre-ordered meals would be served on the plane. This review is specifically targeting SpiceJet's management and organization, not its cabin crew who were in fact very helpful with providing additional meal alternatives for us. It's a shame to think that these issues could have easily been avoided if my family and I had been informed of our seating locations prior to boarding. Sadly SpiceJet's management found it too difficult to pick up a phone to inform us about our seat arrangements and the unavailability of our meal options.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

We were travelling from Dubai to Amritsar on 21st April and had especially booked spicemax as we needed increased leg space and priority check in as we had an infant with us - but we were utterly disappointed when we got to know in the flight itself that there were no spicemax seats and the food my husband ordered was finished already. For all 4 of us the journey was disastrous and we were just fidgeting in the small seats and my son was irritated with congested space. We were not told by any of the staff nor did we receive any email regarding non-availablity of the spicemax seats. This didn't happen once but both ways we were travelling. ,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

But not informing as an announcement and an apology, and staff just talking aggressively to passengers, cant be expected, when the fault or misfortune happened to customer by the service provider. Moreover, our flight time was 9:35, but it didnt depart from the gate as planned, but gate was changed, and people were running around not sure if they are heading towards correct direction. After all the hurdles, flight boarding completed and it started at around 11:30pm. I wont say that Spicejet is bad, but  their attitude without an apology for inconvenience has to be condemned.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Q400 Bomardier,Economy Class,3.0,March 2018,1.0,3.0,nan,no,Kolkata to Dhaka,3.0," |  Kolkata to Dhaka. This was my first time on SpiceJet, a low-cost carrier -- though after paying for securing a seat, a snack, and to make the reservation -- the total price exceeded that of a full service operator! To secure my seat, I had to also pay for a snack! I chose the flight entirely because of its timing -- it was convenient for my plans. On the day prior to the departure I received a text message that the flight had been ""preponed"" by a hour because of runaway repairs at Dhaka. Appreciated this update. At the airport, SpiceJet's international counter opened about 90 minutes prior to the flight's departure. A man checked passports to determine if visa to Bangladesh was in order. He sat at a counter that said ""Air India"" - this confused some of us. The twin engine propeller plane was parked out on the tarmac and a bus ferried the passengers to it. The short flight was smooth though loud. Flight attendants were efficient. My vegetarian sandwich was dry; I needed to pay extra to get a water. Although the flight got me to my destination in reasonable comfort, the airline seems to focus on the mass market. The small plane did not have a first class cabin and its emphasis on charging for everything and anything whether you want it or not can be grating.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The price of juice was RS 70 where I paid RS100 (no change) and after landing I reminded her but the air hostess fumbled and stumbled. I am sorry to say given the standard of the airline there was lack of concern to return the change promptly I felt uneasy though it was not the best way to give change I opted to let go of it.,Family Leisure,3.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,November 2017,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Jaisalmer to Goa via Delhi,1.0," |  We were booked to fly several SpiceJet flights in November 2017. One of these flights was a flight from Delhi to Goa. Shortly over a week before we were due to fly, SpiceJet notified us that the flight was cancelled due to a runway closure. Frustrating of course, but apparently out of their control, so we were initially understanding. What was in SpiceJet’s control however was the customer service experience that followed. To summarise what has been a truly horrendous experience spanning 3 months. SpiceJet could offer no alternative flight that day, so I we had to book an alternative flight at 3 x the price. Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ‘km by km basis’ rather than the price paid for each leg, leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive. SpiceJet erroneously refunded only 1 passenger of the 2 on the cancelled leg, leaving us an additional 7000 INR out of pocket. After querying this we were told the refunded amount was correct and that this was the end of the matter. It took 7 phone calls spanning 3-4 hours, over a period of 5 weeks to receive the refund for the 2nd passenger. Each of these phone calls was to a different agent and involved explaining the situation from the beginning each time and battling the front line denials and scripted replies in order to actually discuss the issue. We were assured on each of these phone calls that the refund had already been processed (it hadn’t) or that it would be processed (it wasn’t). Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us, more than a month later. From the UK we spent over £50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded. In total due to a combination of administrative failures on SpiceJet’s behalf, we are out of pocket approximately 22,000 INR (£250 GBP). After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2,000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused. All in all, this has single-handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company, anywhere in the world. SpiceJet may get you from A to B, but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues, prepare for a time consuming, fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience. For your own sanity, I highly recommend you avoid this company at all costs.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Late flights with no apologies, incredibly rude staff at the airport literally shouting at my friend and I. When we missed our connecting flight they questioned if we were stupid and offered no apology, and then made the most minimal of efforts to arrange a new flight for us - 9 hours later.

Seats were average. The  crew were very busy on the flight selling foods and beverages. One flight attendant seemed tired and frustrated and yelled at any passenger who called from service at times. I felt extra crew member or relaxed flight attended could have made the service better. No inflight entertainment. I will fly again.

Ground staff did not care about the stress we were under because of it with a 2 year old. Rude and unprofessional behavior. I think we should have been a priority because of the onward journey, they did not take any responsibility for it. We also had to pay extra for the luggage even when this was part of the deal with an international journey.
