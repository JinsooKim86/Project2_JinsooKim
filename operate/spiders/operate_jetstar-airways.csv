The obsession with carry on baggage weight that includes computer or handbag for a total weight of 7 kilos makes passengers paranoid and uncomfortable just in case they are 1 kilo overweight. This puts unnecessary pressure also on staff. Weighing hand luggage on boarding caused confusion and many customers complain. This is obviously a revenue raiser despite that they are concerned about safety. Get back to reality that's why your ratings are so low.

The worst part is that didn’t inform anyone for a very long time so we’re all waiting around. There wasn’t even anyone at the gate desk for over an hr after the delay. Then we get switched gates and the girls that finally show up at the desk are pretty much just on their phones even when you walk up. Pretty much killed a day in my short stay in Hanoi.

I asked why and I was told that it is usually due to young families that need to be kept together. I said, no problem, and gathered up my things. As I was about to move to my next seat, which was much less appealing than my original seat, I saw the passengers who I had changed seats for. It was four men, middle aged. who had arrived late, and appeared to have been drinking. Not a young family, but some blokes that wanted to continue drinking together, and obviously had some friends at Jetstar who accommodated them. What a joke!

I flew from Melbourne to Phuket first and incurred issues with the staff. The service was absolutely horrible. Not once did staff walk through the cabin to offer water to passengers on a 9 hour flight, nor did they comply with our requests when we asked for water. I had to call staff multiple times over several hours before receiving a small cup of water. I also paid for comfort packs and received them two hours into the flight. The flight back to Melbourne from Phuket was delayed 6.5 hours making me miss my domestic flight back to Adelaide and requiring extra accommodation to be purchased. All the airline gave passengers for this inconvenience was a $20 food voucher when in reality, many, like myself paid $600+ due to their inconvenience. I would not recommend flying Jetstar under any circumstance. Staff do not seem to have any consideration toward passengers and overall service was appalling.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

We have had four flights cancelled. You end up paying more for accomodation when your flight is cancelled - once after a 12 hour wait, they wanted to send us back home! We had to argue to get a cheap, dirty accomodation organised near the airport. The next time another flight was cancelled and we were offered accomodation and we said, “NO”. Never trust where they put you. While waiting around at the airport you also spend so much money for food and lose your precious holiday time. Better to spend a little more and secure your holiday and business travels with other reliable airlines. The worst is the staff and clearly their lack of quality training. They have no desire to help you out, inform you promptly and show a compassionate attitude during cancellations. They are slow as turtles on land and couldn’t care less about customer care. We have had three flights cancelled due to engineering issues. Their aircrafts are unreliable and the engineers unable to deliver speedy and quality repairs. How can they have so many issues so often?? I feel scared to get on their planes. We will never fly with Jetstar again. Not only are the prices cheap - all other aspects of Jetstar is cheap.

Flew on a relatively new Airbus A320, when compared to some of the older ones in the fleet. Although I was seated close to the front (8D), the seat was unbelievably tight in terms of seat pitch, which is okay for shorter flights like Melbourne/Sydney, but for a longer flight I’d try and buy an exit row seat next time! Crew were okay, but nothing to write home about. The customer service manager wasn’t overly pleasant when she informed me of my $15 voucher (as I’d purchased a Starter Plus fare). I had purchased this fare for the bargain basement price of $99 (plus $45 for the starter plus bundle), so I can’t complain too much.

Ground staff in Brisbane were wonderful, and the all-male crew onboard this mid-afternoon flight to Proserpine were terrific! It certainly got my Whitsunday holiday off to a terrific start! Overall, a wonderful flight at a good price!

All of my contact info was correct and I was on a local phone system (received texts and email from other people). Next flight was three and a half hours later (it took off much later than that). I asked to be put on another flight as I had a meeting in Melbourne at 5. Jetstar refused because they had a later flight. Offered refund, but I had to eat all the fees, so the full refund was about 60%. booked on a Virgin flight for $200 more, but got there. Second, a policy issue. Flying from Cairns to Hobart via Melbourne. Jetstar will NOT check baggage through. Had to retrieve bags in Melbourne re-check them (and go through security, wait at check-in counter all over again). When I asked an employee why we could not check through he said that they were such a budget airline that they refused to pay for someone to sort the bags as they come out of the plane.

Boeing 787,Economy Class,2.0,July 2015,1.0,3.0,3.0,no,SYD to HNL,4.0,"I flew HNL-SYD and a month later SYD-HNL. I was actually traveling from Vancouver to SYD, and broke up the trip by flying Air Canada YVR-HNL return for about $550, and the Jetstar for about $1100 (plus all the extras). I had to stay one night in HNL each way, adding $500 hotel. With the Jetstar extras the cost perhaps $500 less than a direct flight. Plus I was trying to break up the 15/16 hour nonstop flight duration.  Jetstar : I had a cordial reception checking in at HNL. The rest of the staff throughout the rest of the trip were indifferent. The Boeing 787 is a nice airplane, as they go. I paid extra for a good seat, which was a great boon on full flights. That was good value for money. I paid $40-ish for the meal: it was a rude joke both times. The meal was mushy, minimal and miserable, and you needed to wait 15 minutes for a drink to wash it down. The most demeaning part of the experience was getting dinged $125 for my 5 kilos overweight baggage on my return. There wasn't a weight scale where I was staying, so I couldn't have prepared myself for the problem. My carry-on backpack was at the carry-on weight limit, so I couldn't switch items into that. So it was either pay the money or toss out some of my clothes. I paid, and then fumed for the next hour or two. The only way Jetstar can avoid this kind of rude greeting for a customer would be to give staff some leeway on the overweight rule. But they were very stern. In most of the reviews people are willing to forgive Jetstar's faults because of the lower prices. I don't agree. A price is a price and a fault is a fault. If Jetstar worked on its faults, and upped its prices slightly, it could delight customers instead of annoying them, as it so often does. I think I'll flight direct next time, either Qantas or Air Canada.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,August 2015,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Melbourne to Sydney,2.0,"Jetstar insist frequently enough during the online ticket purchase process that passengers must get to the airport 2 hours prior to departure which we dutifully did, arriving at Melbourne airport a bit before 4 am, to catch the 6:05 am jetstar flight to Sydney. When we arrived check in had just opened and there were only 2 staff checking baggage. Got our baggage tag and got in the queue. Then they proceeded to call out every single passenger whose flight were departing before ours, regardless of where they were in the queue. At one point the front line stood still for more than 49 minutes whilst jet star personnel were pulling people out of the other lanes and getting them checked in. When we finally got seen - after a riot nearly broke out - the check in guy told us we had less than 5 minutes to get through security and make our flight. We had to run like mad. Our flight was at 6:05 am!  I don't care about the pay per use for extra stuff like bags, food, seat assignments etc - it's a nuisance but fine. I'll pay, as long as I get the service. The lack of a coordinated path to check baggage for passengers and poor organization at the airport is simply not acceptable and no cheap airfare makes this worth the anxiety! It is maddening and made me angry and resentful. I can't believe this airline is a Qantas offshoot. In the end don't bother with the 2 hours early part. It does not make any difference trust me!! At least not for domestic flights departing Melbourne. Get there 45 minutes before your flight, flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and you'll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules. Basic definitions of service do not apply here and it is NOT first come first serve as they claim. It is next flight out gets first priority, which makes for a highly stressful experience.

When as suggested I contacted Jetstar by phone, I went through their voice recognition system which was aggravatingly useless, and ended up giving the same information that the useless computer system had requested to a live person in the Philippines. Fortunately my employer has a policy of never using Jetstar if an alternative is available so I have rebooked on another airline.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,September 2015,2.0,4.0,5.0,no,Sydney to Cairns,4.0,"On a family holiday in Australia we chose Jetstar to fly from Sydney to Cairns. On arriving at Sydney T2 we found that we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the scheduled 15.20 departure. This meant trying to find somewhere to sit in a heavily overcrowded departure lounge while guarding our luggage. The preferred method of checking in seemed to be using one of a row of machines which very efficiently printed our boarding cards and luggage labels. But when we went to the ""Bag Drop"" we were told to wait at the back of the queue. I'm still not sure if everybody in front of us had already checked in at the machine or not. The Jetstar staff member at check-in weighed our 4 hold cases. We'd paid for four x 20 kgs, but all of them only came to 70 kgs. We knew we were allowed 7 kgs per person for hand luggage. When we were asked to redistribute 2 kgs. weight from one case into other pieces of hand luggage which were underweight, we were shocked. We were 10 kgs under on hold baggage! A little common sense would show that we'd already paid more than enough for extra luggage. We'd flown Tigerair from Melbourne to Sydney and their luggage policy seemed far more reasonable - same weight restrictions but as long as the total does not exceed your limit it doesn't matter how it is distributed. Onboard we had serious problems with fellow passengers. We were seated together 27C my wife, 27D myself, 27E my daughter's boyfriend and 27F my daughter. There were 7 men aged 28-35ish seated 25C,D,E,F and 26D,E and F. They were very boisterous from the start, shouting and swearing at each other. Then they ordered beers repeatedly until one of the attendants refused to serve them more alcohol. They became more rowdy and then the one in 26F dropped a can of beer which rolled against my daughter's handbag. When she drew his attention to this they rounded on her giving her ""the finger"". I told them to be careful and they called me a ""rat"". The attendant came and asked them to calm down but it was having no effect. The ringleader appeared to be in 25F. He pressed the call button and told the attendant that I was annoying him by ""reading too loud"" he could ""hear my thoughts"". He looked at me and put his forked fingers to his eyes and then pointed them at me, in true Hollywood gangster style! I felt threatened and concerned for my family's well being. I was worried that they'd all come up to us at the baggage claim. As it happened the only thing was that 25F ran past and bumped into my arm on purpose. I feel the cabin crew allowed this situation to escalate. The entire rear of the plane had to put up with this childish behaviour for three hours. They even shouted at infants to 'Shush"". The staff should have threatened them with calling ahead to Cairns Airport Police to be waiting. This may have served to quieten them down.  Why can't Jetstar allow check-in earlier than 2 hours? I know I have done it with other airlines and it cuts down the queuing tremendously. Why don't Jetstar adopt a total weight luggage policy and show clearly if baggage drop is operational?

I asked if we could possibly be booked onto one of these flights as although it was very inconvenient we would still be able to arrive in Melbourne that night and join other family members who were already successfully travelling to Melbourne from various locations using other airlines. I was informed that if I did this I would have to pay for the flight again as it was not to the same airport and that I would not be refunded. I asked if I could speak to her manager and she said that was not possible, she would read out my options which were to cancel and apply for a refund through customer care which would take 15 days! or she could book me on a flight the next day, 12:45pm was the earliest - a night and day of our 2 day holiday ruined as we had to return to Sydney the next day Sunday at 6:30 pm. I explained and she said all I could do was present my case to customer care. I asked if she could put me through to ""customer care"" and she said she did not have a phone number for ""customer care"" and that I had to go online, email them and wait for them to examine my case (up to 15 days as above). Totally frustrated I asked again to talk to the manager. She said she would put me through to someone then left and again I waited for a long time. There was no response on the line so I called again same wait process and asked the woman not to hang up on me this third time and that I wanted to know if I took a flight that night on their partner airline would they refund me for the flight I had already paid for and pay the cost difference for the new flights, this cancellation being Jetstars eng. fault (there were still seats on these other flights). She could not tell me. I couldn't afford the additional fares so I had to ask her to book me on the 12:45 flight Saturday, only to have to return the next day.

Cabin could have been cleaner as I found crumbs on my seat and the air seemed a bit stale. Magazines were well worn despite only being midway through the month and a previous passenger had left their boarding pass in the seat pocket from a few months ago. Check in queue was quite long but it moved along ok. However at Brisbane it was inconvenient that they did the handcarry size and weight check after check-in which meant queuing up 4 times before actually boarding and made worse with the lack of seats immediately at the gate because they put the flight next to several other minor routes instead of some priority spacing unlike other carriers had set up. Booking the flight through the Jetstar website was good. The interface was easy enough and the early check-in feature and early seat selection are big drawcards for me. I think its a great idea for the cabin crew to direct passengers to their seat because one of them omitted this on my flight down to Brisbane and it meant someone took my seat by mistake until I pointed this out to the cabin crew.

It was a night flight and I was watching the huge fires and some wicked lightening storms till they darkened the windows for people to sleep. Sorry but what was happening out the window was better than the in-seat entertainment. The seat has plenty of leg room but I don't think there was one seat where the recline/foot rest worked properly - there was a lot of times when the cabin crew were wrestling with seat. Recline is huge but you're reclining into the space of the person behind you. It happened to me - the tiny TV drops to where you can't view it unless your neck is double-jointed. You can't get up to go to the toilet without some contortions and using the headrest of the seat in front and then you receive that disgusted look because you woke them up.

What an awful poor choice - and in Business class! Food not quite as good as other airlines economy food. I was in row 2 of business class and they ran out of the first choice in row 2. Well actually they didn't run out because our friends (also in row 2) shortly after being fobbed off with the fish, noted that row 2 and 3 of the other side of the business cabin got the first choice.

Cabin staff were mainly good and attentive (not that we wanted much) but a bit disappointed with the lack of checking for meals.

That meant I would have had to dispose of a few items packed in my checked luggage. (I was not able to check my bag through from HBA to CHC). When check-in for my flight finally opened, I found that I was slightly over the carry-on weight limit. This meant packing my laptop and charger in my 20kg allowance. Thus no laptop or charger to use while waiting for departure. At self check-in, the JQ system could only recognise me on a flight which would take me to the wrong destination. As directed, I approached a check-in agent, weaving my way through many JQ staff who seemed intent on chatting with one another, and ignoring passengers. The rudeness intensified with the agent I chose. Obviously someone who had experienced an unpleasant day, and also someone who made it quite obvious that he or she did not want to be there. Once in the departure lounge, things changed completely, and the excellent Jetstar service returned, even to the point of an offer of changing seats into an exit row in the aircraft. I graciously accepted, and thoroughly enjoyed the flight right through to my destination. A minor hiccup, but an unnecessary one, this will not deter me from flying with JQ. I still highly recommend this airline.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

However, at check-in in Melbourne, I was given both boarding passes and my bags were checked through to Tokyo - this seems to be the norm for the Tokyo and Osaka flights but I can’t find anywhere where I was told that in advance. A good thing, too, since the Melbourne-Cairns flight left 63 minutes late despite boarding on time (they’ve got a reputation to maintain). The flight to Cairns had no business section so I was stuck in economy in an exit row seat, plenty of room but next to the noisy galley and toilets. The Boeing 787’s electronically-dimmed windows just don’t work in direct sun and my head got very hot and it was impossible to sleep. The quieter engines don’t translate into a quieter cabin - seems like some machinery is very loud, perhaps for the higher cabin pressures (the higher pressures may however have reduced the screaming from the usual gaggle of families). On the the Cairns-Tokyo leg I was in the first “business” row and it’s directly equivalent to premium economy elsewhere. The seat actually felt less roomy than the Cathay Pacific premium economy I was in a few weeks ago, even though 2x3x2 in a 787 should have more space than 2x3x2 in the narrower A330.

Jetstar offered a bus service down to New Plymouth or a flight the following day, which is completely worthless to me as I needed to be in New Plymouth by 7am.

While Jetstar calls this business class it really should be called for what it is and that is premium economy, meals where good and staff were attentive and it is far better than sitting at the back of the plane.

But that is punctual for Jetstar so I can't complain. The economy seat was not comfortable but acceptable, except the IFE was not operating. I hadn't included it in my options but I did need to charge my iPhone and iPad so I could continue to access my own 'entertainment package'. But the USB port was not functioning either. I mentioned it to staff after a couple of hours (the batteries were flat). Staff offered to relocate me to a seat where the IFE worked and also offered complimentary access to the IFE to compensate for the inconvenience. Sensible and polite. That's a tick. I brought my own picnic lunch/dinner - 2 boiled eggs, 2 rolls, 3 onigiri (Japanese rice balls), some fruit and a bottle of water purchased in the boarding area. This was fortuitous as the offered fried rice/noodles options looked OK but pedestrian whereas my little 'picnic' meals were appetising and delicious. It's another tick for Jetstar that they make meals optional and allow you to bring your own. For a cost conscious traveller, Jetstar is now OK (delays notwithstanding).

It did not feel like a normal flight on another aircraft type, but it instead felt much worse than that. We already had a 30mins delay waiting for pushback from Bali's Ngurah Rai airport, for a reason the pilot did not even announce. Additionally it was a red-eye flight, which means that sleep is important on such flight. However this is the least duration of sleep I could ever get on a red eye flight which will be explained further below. Mood lighting was there but not effective at all. The IFE was there with a responsive touchscreen, although money is required to pay for most of the IFE content. Seats were horrible. Leather seats are not at all comfortable, inhibits sleep, as well as those hard headrests that felt very weird to adjust. Seat itself was very narrow at less than 17 inches, and armrest was ridiculously narrow not a hand can comfortably rest on them. The seat pitch was also very narrow at what felt like 30 inches, extremely cramped, and all these contributed to my sleeplessness. What's more the plane was scorching hot, so more than an hour of sleep seems like an incredible feat to do on such a plane. Meal was bland, only the sauce had a slight bit of flavour, although the dessert made up for the bad food. Cabin crew were average with nothing remarkable to speak of. The same can be said on the return flight. Hot plane, narrow seats, bland food but with great deserts, average crew, same IFE.

When we boarded the overhead bins were huge! Generous fit in even the smaller bins. The airline lied to us and lacked any sense of good judgement or customer service. We paid over a hundred dollars to store the guitar at the airport. Jetstar - today you earned passionate detractors.

A little inconvenient but not being seasoned travelers didn't worry. At 5pm the day before departure Jetstar emailed that the outbound flight was cancelled. Their call center organized seats on a Qantas domestic to Sydney and connected to Qantas to Bangkok. The call center were deceptive in not disclosing there were no business class seats available on either leg. When asked the seat numbers we were told these would be allocated at the airport.

Little did I know that Gold Coast airport, which is over 100km away from Brisbane airport, can be used interchangeably. So it wasn't until I arrived at Brisbane that I realized my mistake. Thankfully the kind staff at Jetstar did me the favour of allowing me to pay a $50 fee and catch the next flight out of Gold Coast, provided I could make the flight. Please Jetstar, you shouldn't have. Upon arriving at Gold Coast, I promptly paid the $50 fee and queued for the baggage drop. The agent at the baggage drop informed me that I was over the allowable limit for my checked baggage. Being familiar with airport procedures, I said ""Ok, just let me put the excess into my carry-on."" He replied by asking me to put my carry-on as well as my laptop (?) on the scale. He then informed me that I was 16kg overweight. I reluctantly agreed to pay for it, until he informed me that it would cost me $240 additional. So if I were to have taken that offer, I would have paid almost 4X the advertised price at a whopping $440. Thanks Jetstar! I went back to the help desk and there was a lot of hand wringing. And they had the gall to tell me they were doing me a favour by bending the rules by letting me pay the $50.

We arrived in Bali 5 hours late, because of technical issues in Melbourne. We were notified on this 4 days prior to the flight which was good.

Jetstar have removed Check-In kiosks from Launceston Airport, meaning everyone that has checked in baggage and/or hasn't checked in online must do so at the counter. That I was okay with, however, what I found somewhat appalling was the nearly 45 minute wait to be checked in, as Jetstar have cut down staffing levels to just three team members checking in my flight and another flight to Melbourne (some 300 people in total), which left me with little time to enjoy the sights of this small but wonderful airport. Boarding was efficient, and I was also allocated an exit row seat upon my check-in. However, the crew were very robotic, and even though this was only a flight of some 90 minutes to Sydney, just did not seem to be interested or attentive. With the exception of the in-flight magazine, there was no entertainment available, and the rather limited in-flight menu made me regret not purchasing something at the airport (Vietnamese ""Pho"" was little more than a cup-a-soup with bits of meat in it). Overall, Jetstar just doesn't seem to be as good a carrier as it was just a few years ago, and when compared to recent flight experiences on Tiger Airways, doesn't seem to provide that memorable flight experience, especially where service, catering and crew are concerned. However, I would probably still continue to fly Jetstar if there was a very attractive deal (I only paid $115 for the starter plus fare to Sydney), or if they were the sole carrier offering a direct route to a destination.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I was travelling in New Zealand and I received an email from Jetstar informing me that my flight on 4th December to Kuala Lumpur had been cancelled. There was no back-up plan nor any other flight options made available except to call the customer service team. The next available flight was the following day – the 5th (the original date I booked) and which we were told that we could confirm our presence 3 hours prior to the departure time. We called back 12 hours later and we were told that nothing could be done because the flight is now full. We needed to wait for 2 more days for the next available flight. When we asked if we could book other tickets back to Kuala Lumpur with the cost fully reimbursed the customer service answered that this is subject to the approval from the claims department. It is obvious that booking flights at such a last minute will be extremely costly, which defeats the purpose of purchasing the cheap fares from Jetstar months in advance. So no flight, no other options, except to accept the refund of the money paid or wait for the next flight out. To add on, the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful. Upon checking-in in New Zealand for our flights back to Melbourne, we spoke to the customer service at the airport. In less than 15 minutes, they confirmed 2 seats for us for the 5th December which was what we have been told that the flight was full. Fast forward to the day of the flight (2 days later) – once again another frustrating e-mail which stated a delay in the flight from 1200 hour to 1350 hour. Bearing in mind that we have a transit at the Singapore airport, the email stated arrival time to be 1840 hour whilst the departure from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was at 1945 hours. However on the plane, the captain announced that the ETA was at 1930. Logically speaking, we expected that the Jetstar crew would have had the information for passengers who are transiting in Singapore for the KL flight. Hence, they would have been aware that the Melbourne flight was delayed thus wait for these us to arrive. On our way there we even heard them calling out name, so I immediately stop by the information counter to request for them to hold the gate as our flights were delayed. The gate was closed when we arrived. We explained ourselves, but once again nothing could be done despite already having our boarding pass in hand. They even checked our seat numbers but still the same answer. At the transfer counter, I was told by the airport staff that the flight we had just missed was the last flight out. And to top it all, the representative only showed up after close to 2 hours later. No apologies, nothing. It was as if nothing had happened and we should be thankful for the arrangements made. When it was our turn, he quickly briefed us on the flight to be taken then next day and the accommodation provided for the night. I asked if we had any other options and all he answered was no because that was the last flight and that is all they can do. I even asked if we could book any other available flight and get Jetstar to reimburse the full cost.

The aircraft is actually very noisy compared to others we have flown on, so you need a good set of noise-cancelling headphones. We also paid for the food package, which was not worth it - lousy food (we are still trying to identify the meat). The hotdog for breakfast (!) on the return flight was unexpected and we had to wait ages to have the rubbish collected.

Have flown Jetstar within Australia for a pleasant experience and found the crew friendly and obliging. Did not enjoy flying Jetstar internationally. The difference in service and seating between the two is like chalk and cheese. I am 186cm and booked the exit row with seat 23C. Cost was $45 for the exit row which in my view is very acceptable. Plenty of leg room but seat is narrow with hardly any padding. Seat was very uncomfortable. Booked the bundle which included a meal which was a cold chicken type rice salad. Worst meal I have had on an airline. Crew were not friendly and appeared disinterested. Once they gave the meals out (which was early in the flight) hardly saw them again. For a six hour flight would have been happy to pay for a bottle of water but you do not see them to do so. Loved Bali and can not wait to go back but not with Jetstar!,Family Leisure,2.0,nan

We were given exit row seats on the plane and A$15 airport café voucher because of the later departure. I have no problem with Jetstar as such, my gripe is that we paid for a flight with snacks and drinks and never even got water on Jetstar.

We left Denpasar airport a bit late due to several excuses, the main excuse was paperwork. We have already boarded the aircraft and waited on the ground for about an hour which made us miss our connecting flight to Auckland. Ground staff was a bit slow on giving us information about what was going on which made some of us very stressed and uncomfortable. The connecting flight that we were meant to be on had already left at 11.05pm when we arrived at 12am. Jetstar gave us accommodation and told us that we were on the next flight out which was at 9.10am but due to the immigration not giving us Indonesians visas we were unable to go to the hotel which meant we had to make ourselves comfortable in the transit area (which weirdly you had to call someone to open the door for you, it is so impractical when you are in a rush). We were given food vouchers worth $20 each (no shops were open at that time so we were starving). We were going to get our boarding tickets at the gate and the ground service were very aggressive and so unfriendly and rude which put us off so much. Overall, the cabin staff were alright but I've seen happier more friendlier cabin staff on other airlines. I recommend that Jetstar should really get their services to prioritise customers that have had disrupted flights and also train their staff to be more friendly and not so rude and aggressive. It would have made it more pleasant if the ground staff were more helpful and informative. Also on the flight from Auckland to Denpasar via Melbourne, our baggage had been left in Melbourne for around 3/4 days. Our baggage was meant to be checked in all the way through to Denpasar but obviously did this not happen. Not sure who to blame, Melbourne airport or Jetstar but this is really not a good way to start a holiday. We had to leave for Surabaya on the very next day we arrived in Denpasar which meant we had to drive 3 hours to the airport to claim our bags. We were stranded without clothes for 5 days.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

Our flight had been changed from via Cairns to via Gold coast with no notification so all seats I had booked were lost and our family was unable to sit together.

A tip is if you prebook seating to book in the front section of the economy cabin (mini cabin) because there's only 4 rows of economy here. Front row next to the window because no one reclines into you. The seats are fairly narrow at 9 abreast. Food was edible both ways, drinks were fine and if you wanted more you could purchase it. Excess luggage was reasonable and fortunately available to purchase. Inflight entertainment had plenty of options to keep someone entertained during the flight as well.

He waited in a long queue for an online chat to rebook, only to find out that they could get us on a flight on April 12 - three days later and would put us up in a hotel for 1 night. As we had island tours booked and paid for in Kona (we had booked on our earlier trip) we needed to get there on the original day we booked. They refunded us our money but would do nothing else to compensate us for the additional cost of flights - Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Honolulu, and change our flights from Honolulu to Kona.

I cannot comment on the actual flight as it hasn't happened yet, but I'm thinking I won't even be getting on the plane. I flew from Minneapolis to Auckland, visiting New Zealand on holiday before I start my working holiday visa in Australia. I do not have any solid travel dates but knew that I had to be in Australia by April 16th. I was told at the ticket counter that I could not board unless I had a flight out of New Zealand. This is my fault as I misunderstood the conditions of traveling into a country via visitor's visa vs. a working holiday visa. I was under the impression I could enter the country as long as I had enough money to purchase a flight out of the country. I had to book my flight at the ticket counter and fast since my flight was about to leave. I booked through kayak.com. I purchased insurance as I was under the impression I could use it to change or cancel my flight if I needed to. Apparently, kayak has their settings set to round trip by default and I accidentally booked a flight out of Auckland to Sydney on March 7th and then right back to Auckland from Sydney on March 8th in less than 24 hours. I noticed this mistake on my layover in Los Angeles and called the airline immediately to try and get a refund for the return ticket. Usually airlines will let you cancel of change your flight within 24 hours of the booking. Not Jetstar. They will do nothing to help me. I've talked to their customer service team about 4 or 5 times and they do not care about their customers. They won't even offer me a refund via voucher. The insurance I purchased to Allianz is a farce as well. The box I checked to purchase the insurance said it covered cancellations and changes to your flight. What they don't mention is that it only covers cancellations of changes if you or your travel companion is injured or ill and you must provide extensive proof of this. I will be contacting my bank to dispute all of the charges and I'm confident they'll get my money back. Jetstar will also be losing a customer.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city.

The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid.

Because she is frail I am 190 cm tall and my wife needs to care for my 8 year old son we delayed our holiday for several days in order to secure the 3 aisle seats we needed. Can you imagine the humiliation I suffered in front of my mother and other passengers when after we had taken our seats the ground staff came into the cabin and demanded I move to a middle seat or else the plane's takeoff would be delayed. In order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. However as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. Because the armrests on the StarClass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later! To be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. I do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract. Let alone humiliating myself and making my mother very uncomfortable during the flight.

Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline.

Had we been told this at check-in we would have bought passes to the lounge so we could have waited in comfort. Jetstar don't allow their vouchers to be used towards the cost of the lounge which is ridiculous. When we finally boarded the flight crew had the audacity to ask us to hurry so they wouldn't be delayed! Then they delayed us as they tried to find 15 missing people - probably the ones who had been told 4.45 instead of 14.45. Never again.,nan,2.0,nan

Had a delay due to a computer issue so for safety reasons we left at 20.30 instead of 18.00. During the delay the flight attendants were not any good as they had put them self in the galley and only came down with a small drink of water which wasn't that nice. The captain was much helpful with information during the delay. After take-off in flight entertainment started but not for long. Didn't have any food or drink as I was sick during the flight except water during the delay. Would recommend it if your looking for the cheapest way possible but at the same time wouldn't recommend it. I would personally keep to domestic with Jetstar.,nan,4.0,nan

Remember to book any checked in luggage more than 24 hours before your flight and if you get an error message that says you are not eligible to book call their service centre to resolve (which we should have done) as baggage charges increase significantly if you buy baggage allowance at the airport. We also arrived to the airport with ample time to spare but waited 30 mins in a service queue to sort baggage which caused us then to be late for flight. Partly expected for a low cost airline I suppose.,nan,3.0,nan

We have travelled business class with Emirates and were never under the assumption that we were going to get the same level with Jetstar.

IFE was the only let down. Very limited range of movies and even though we flew over in Oct and back in Nov we had Nov choices both ways so 20 hrs with only 2 movies I wanted to see out of the limited selection. We didn't buy food but took our own on the plane and this was no problem. Checking in baggage is not inexpensive but if you do it at time of booking it is not too bad. If you follow the rules about booking/ flying with a LCC they are definitely worth looking into.,nan,5.0,nan

Very surprised with the service I received flying from the Gold Coast to Narita on A330. Staff are friendly helpful and less rude than their domestic counter parts. Flight to Narita was 9.5 hrs from Gold Coast and add around 1.5 hrs from Sydney to Gold Coast but still being a very large plane and only around 50 or so people on board you can take advantage of the 4 seaters. I have learnt that you don't have to book seats on these flights and pay an extra $25 for it better to use that money to add check baggage to your flight and checked baggage isn't really cheap at $45 for 15kg. The food was ok best to bring your own snacks and water.,nan,5.0,nan

There is so little room between the rows that when the passenger in front has his seat reclined it is almost impossible to leave your seat! On a short daytime flight perhaps but on an overnight flight sleep is impossible. The food was however quite good and the alcohol service OK but nothing makes up for uncomfortable seating or the lack of pillows (unbelievable even though they provide a blow-up neck support). They also don't offer the normal express service through immigration etc and no priority baggage handling which is quite annoying. So in summary - a definite improvement on economy seating but by no means the normal business class that they promise but then again you get what you pay for!,nan,3.0,nan

Efficiently boarded & pushed back right on time (each sector). Row 1 bulkhead/partition seats were a good choice for a day flight. No IFE or free snack service but not needed. Clean aircraft. However it does take more effort to monitor a JQ booking for schedule changes and cancellations.,nan,5.0,nan

I was in seat 4k - when the seat belt sign went off the passenger in front reclined and the space was less than economy. By the time I was able to ask a flight attendant to ask the person in front to move the seat forward a bit they refused as they said he was asleep! The seat pan width was 28 cms to the tray table it was almost impossible to eat and equally impossible to get out. Jetstar Business Class is the worst leg room I have experienced and to have that in a Business Class is unforgivable.,nan,1.0,nan

Quicker than scheduled flight meant only a 10 minute delay in arrival. Food was surprisingly good better than domestic business and international premium economy on QF but not international business standard. Beverage selection excellent. You can choose from the entire for sale menu from the economy cabin at any time which gives you access to a much wider selection of mid flight snacks than could be offered on a full service airline. Seat is same as QF domestic business so again not a true long haul business seat. IFE on ipads with enough selection to keep you occupied. The highlight was the service from an enthusiastic and happy crew. This flight exceeded our expectations.,nan,5.0,nan

Booked using AA Miles and thought we'd booked Qantas. 1 week before our trip we discovered it was on JetStar. This was our honeymoon and my husband is 6 ft 3 and a big man. We braced ourselves for a miserable flight. However the flight was a pleasure. Food was delicious. True legroom is tight and when the seat in front of you is reclined you cannot get out without disturbing your neighbors. A lovely amenity kit provided. The earphones were extremely comfortable and the pre-loaded Ipad has a nice choice of entertainment. Flight attendants were warm professional and accommodating. As for rating the value for money we used our AA miles so I can only say that it was a most pleasant flight in Business Class with excellent food excellent service nice entertainment options pillows blankets and comfortable leather seats.

In addition you do not pay a hefty rate for booking a one way ticket as you do with a full service airline. The service was cheerful and competent. The food fine and plenty of drinks on request. I had a middle seat in middle aisle so really the worst seat in business class however it was comfortable and I was able to sleep. The I pad entertainment is limited but then most people load their own I pad before travelling. The young staff were great and the price of the ticket very competitive.

No food is provided unless you pay for it. In fact you're best to pre-book because the food runs out. Back to Melbourne. Jetstar offered us an alternative flight on Qantas. We wanted to go home early to save us hanging around the airport for hours. We were offered one flight which left later than the one they cancelled. No effort to be conciliatory. Given the fault was theirs they should have made at least some effort to be more helpful. We couldn't check in our luggage because the paperwork wasn't done. We were forced to stay at the airport for 9 hours - only 1 without our bags. Put this one down to experience but can guarantee I'll never fly Jetstar international again.,nan,2.0,nan

This seemed to annoy the flight attendant and just as they were about to announce the boarding she asked me to check the bag size using the gauge they have for that purpose. I picked up the larger of our 2 bags that were on the floor side-by-side and halfway there she said not that one the other one. It was a standard luggage bag that she would have known was in regulation size and visually you could see it was the smaller of the two. As soon as I left the now-formed queue she turned her back and did not even look at what I was doing. It's obviously a game they play.,nan,4.0,nan

At the Jetstar check-in Adelaide he was charged $70 for having a near empty cabin bag that was only 4cm over length. Technically a breach of cabin baggage dimensions but he was not aware of this. Took all his spare cash to pay it so he had no cash to pay for a taxi at Melbourne airport. He is unable to use an ATM. He explained all this no consideration given no assistance offered.

The old A330-200 aircraft was dated and the leg room was bad even for economy. Ground staff treated us more like cattle than passengers if it wasn't for my ability to run with the crowd I would have been trampled whilst boarding as there was no line or structure to this process.

It didn't get any better once on board. The leg room was non existent and my knees where against the back of the seat in front for the 3.5 hour flight.

Bear in mind that this is a low cost airline and meals etc are only provided to those who are prepared to pay at the time of serving. I took a good look at the number of passengers who did purchase meals and there were not many therefore the serving times should have been a lot faster than they were. In between serving the crew made no attempt to contain their noise coming from the galley. Probably the most disruptive flight I have been on and for a change it was not the passengers who were the cause. Perhaps a review of the serving processes is required to help speed this up.

nan,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,MEL-SIN return. We chose not to pay extra for mileage credits. We sought legroom and we got it. The seat width was suitable. We needed a wheelchair and ‘pusher’ at all travel terminal areas as they had slopes difficult joining lips & pushing distances beyond what I am capable of doing. Jetstar assisted with a wheelchair on the outward leg. Only after much discussion did we get 'pusher' assistance on arrival in Singapore. When this came it was an excellent 'local service' - a gratuity was not begrudged. For frequent travellers being a continuing Qantas Club member as I am was wise. In Singapore they arranged the 'pusher' service to our return gate. Sadly at both check-ins knowledge by Jetstar staff about Business Class Max rights plus those of Qantas Club Members was either nil or misinformed. It was a bad start later righted by Qantas Club Staff at both lounges. The in light food choices were acceptable. No problems with the complimentary liquor nor level of service table decor or travel amenities supplied. Seat back lowering by the person in front was a concern on both flights as we had to disturb those persons when we wished to move about. Our outward seats were in Row 6 – the last in Business Class with restricted but acceptable lowering for a day flight not suitable if overnight. The Jetstar web-site would not let me pre-select a seat if you had asked for ‘wheelchair assistance’ as we had - it was one or the other and this is unsatisfactory. On return I opted to select Row 4 to fully recline. In this position the seat is not a fully reclining ‘sleeper’- footrest space is insufficient. With a 2-3-2 configuration in this cabin I would not choose the middle seat of a fully occupied ‘3’. We were fortunate both ways in not having a full cabin thus no problem with overhead storage but a number of the compartments were taken up with staff bags and service items-not good. Ours were Jetstar stop-over flights in Singapore as part of flying to/from China thus and correctly there were helpful Chinese & English speaking flight attendants however the level of English could have been better. In reading some of the adverse comments about Jetstar Business the benefits provided compared to cost is being ignored. It is a precious approach to compare Jetstar to a 'full service' airline.

About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient. Despite the aircraft being on the ground for a good 35 minutes most of the windows were grubby. The flight was fine and I had about 2cm between my knees and the seat in front. Thankfully they didn't recline the seat. A 15 minute delay in Sydney waiting for a clear air-bridge and a 20 minute wait to collect our bags capped off an uneventful flight.,nan,3.0,nan

It is a budget airline but the cleanliness of the cabin should not be compromised. Chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight.

We called through and found the flight that was scheduled for a 5.15 pm departure had been delayed. Because the status was unavailable online we were not able to book a late checkout with our hotel. We made our way to Da Nang airport booked a single room so we could have somewhere to wait until 10pm for our re-scheduled check-in for a 12.50am flight. Arrived at the airport at 10pm to find it was not flying until after 2.00 am the plane arrived around 2.45 we arrived in Saigon just before 3.45pm.

Ground staff at MEL airport were polite and assisted with checking our two bags (under my name) onto the flight. The flight attendants boarding the flight at the gate were extremely rude yelling at passengers to move forward in the long queue. Once onboard the service was better and the crew were quite friendly at times offering to retrieve bags from the overhead compartment. One of my bags didn't arrive in Brisbane - which is curious because it was checked in at the same time as the other bag. I was told that it didn't make it onto the flight and that they would only be able to send it by courier the next day.

On my return flight there was no identification of the flight number or time at the gate gate changes over the speaker that were incorrect nor any staff there to help with any queries. Both flights were extremely delayed and the flight crew were not helpful. Bags were moved by the flight crew and they did not inform the passengers. It took over 35 minutes to board the plane. The most annoying part about the whole thing was that the lines to board were crazy - we were told to line up once we were all lined up and waiting in line they decided to change the way in which to board to seat 19-37 first. On both my flights the flight hostesses were rude very unhelpful and kept hitting the back of my seat without apologising. I would never fly Jetstar again it was an awful experience.

My husband and I were at the airport 2 hours before departure and there was no queue at the check-in desks so we didn't bother with the self-check-in kiosks and went straight to the counter. The check-in agent was all smiles checked in our bags handed us our boarding passes and wished us a pleasant journey. 30 minutes before departure we went though security where there were again no queues and the security agent could not have been more pleasant and even cracked a joke! The flight boarded on time with smiling flight attendants at the gate and at the aircraft door. The cabin of the A320 was clean bright and looked relatively new. We had paid a few extra dollars for extra leg room seats and had plenty of room in the exit row. The flight left on time and it didn't take long for the FAs to get the trolley out. We enjoyed a wine with cheese and biscuits for $10 whilst marvelling at the view below. Throughout the 1hr 45min flight the FAs were friendly down to earth and professional and instead of hiding after service were present throughout and happy to engage in conversation with passengers.

The flight home a 10.45pm departure from Denpasar: keep in mind that there is no food at the new airport (except chips sausages) when you've arrived the required 3 hours prior and then boarded a plane which will arrive Perth at 2am people need to eat. We were in row 10 by the time food arrived there was none left so they offered us a hot meal I don't mind paying but first you need to have food and secondly it needs to be edible.

The Ipads can be a bit annoying as you have to find somewhere to put them as the front seats have no ""pockets"" to put your items in. Due to putting bags on first in CNS we were the last to receive our bags in TYO which is not like business class on other aircraft's. (You shouldn't’have to wait 45mins for your bags if you are paying a higher price for seats). Economy class on the return was good. The flight was not full so everyone was spaced out. The food was also good quality.

Though the return flight from Osaka was average. They forgot my sons meal during dinner service (I had to ask them for it) they did apologise though he ordered chicken and got beef and I said nothing as I figured it was all to much trouble for them. Then the girl going through the cabin offering desert tea and coffee missed us completely. Once again I had to ask. The fight from Cairns started good with a very helpful girl at the counter. Some of the crew were terrible. Then a rather rude women on the crew ordering people to sit down marching up and down the plane and the two crew members sitting down the back during the whole trip gossiping in loud voices. As an Australian it was embarrassing. As a regular flyer I've got to say the service is pretty average and it really is hit or miss. Some staff members are very good while some are woeful.

In Aus JQ may be hard work but in NZ they seem fine but you must check in on time and be at the gate in plenty of time.

Compare the rates on the main trunk (AKL-WLG-CHC-ZQN/DUD with provincial eg ROT-CHC that doesn't have competition. Food and beverages and IFE are both extras. We didn't use either but it looked ok.

He was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. And then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs - well you get the picture.

To be fair the flight was a lot cheaper than any of the other full service airlines but you get what you pay for. Flew back to Tokyo on Air NZ a few weeks later and was amazed at the difference. Chalk and cheese. Seats are uncomfortable and have minimum legroom (even on a large aircraft such as the A330). Cabin crew are rude (and their polyester polo shirt uniforms are awful).

Being a low cost carrier I made sure I read the fine print and terms and conditions. Once again as is so true in life you get what you pay for. Budget Airline means no frills and the bare basics unless you want to pay extra. As it is only a 3.5 hour flight I was more than happy to forgo the full services offered in exchange for a much cheaper fare. Both times Jetstar have provided a realistic service for the price paid. Aircraft was clean flight on time and fairly smooth. No real complaints.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Recently travelled from Brisbane to Launceston and over the past 4 months I have made many return trips due to my moving. The flight times are very convenient and all but one flight was on time with departure and sometimes early on arrival. One flight was 25 minutes late due to weather which is of no consequence. All aircraft's were clean and cabin crew were fine. Several times I had emergency exit seats offered which I accepted and have no complaint with my treatment. I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees. One of my return trips via Melbourne was actually with Parent Company Qantas and this flight was nowhere near as pleasant as the Jetstar flights. Its just a shame that I see poor behaviour on these flights from fellow passengers over fairly minor problems.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,5.0,Flew Melbourne to Bangkok in Business class. We've flown Business Class with 5 other much more costly carriers in the past. Got to say we were very impressed with Jetstar. The cabin staff were the friendliest and most attentive! The service faultless. The food was great I had a black pepper steak with fried rice and steamed greens. The wines 4 selections were acceptable and they weren't stingy about top ups. They give you iPad's for the entertainment which with the superb headphones was good listening. The only downside is that the iPad adds to the limited space available on your tray come meal time. Would definitely fly with them again and the savings made mean Suite upgrades at the destination.,nan,5.0,nan

Had pre-booked meals and the I have to say it was the best inflight meal I have ever had (spicy Chicken with rice). The seat next to me was empty so comfort was quite good as I got to stretch out a bit. All intra Asia flights were pretty good but nothing more than what was expected i.e. got me to where I was going! Inbound flight did not have the seat back AVOD and have to say that I got a sore neck by the end of the flight as the Ipad has to sit on the tray table which is at an uncomfortable height. Flight attendants on all flights were nice and always willing to help. All in all I will be flying again with Jestar as they get me where I am going and at a good price.,nan,5.0,nan

I write this as I spend over 12 hours at Changi Airport after Jetstar cancelled a flight from Singapore to Perth supposedly due to bad weather in Perth. There is no bad weather in Perth today and other airlines are flying there. We and our fellow passengers believe they have given this excuse to avoid responsibility for passenger accommodation. For this reason we simply will not trust them again. We were warned though so the lesson has been learnt.,nan,2.0,nan

Very dirty and grubby plane esp for such a new aircraft (the carpet was appalling). Had flown Jetstar J before and knew what to expect but the seat seemed less comfy but maybe it was my imagination. Service wasn't an issue for us as the flight is only 3 hrs but I have to say that if was crammed into a Y seat for 9 hrs to Asia I would understand how the convicts must have felt coming out to Australia. All in all had low expectations which were met. Did like the 787 as an aircraft and look fwd to seeing them on QF services one day in the future.,nan,3.0,nan

Did not expect anything like business class product on other international carriers so I was not disappointed with the product overall: it is closer to a premium economy product. Food was pretty good wines were fine very limited options on the free iPad but the noise-reducing headphones were great and no complaints about the amenities packet. However the leg room and recline were quite limited and the leg rest on my seat did not work. Chief FA looked at it and pronounced the cable broken ""like lots of these seats"" offered no regrets but pointed to 2 company non-revs in the bulkhead row and asked if I wanted her to go and roust them out so I could sit there. I felt very much put on the spot and declined. Miserable night. I suppose I should have been more assertive. On the inbound: execrable vegetarian food in economy and the seats also busted: no reading light no call bell no expression of regret from cabin staff (and this was an exit row seat for which I had paid extra). A332 on both flights very dirty and shabby. The toilets on both were simply disgusting even at the start of each flight. Many FAs wore dirty or tattered uniforms with buttons missing and frayed hems and cuffs. Of course the ticket was relatively cheap and Jetstar is now the only non-stop between MEL and HNL so one has to hold one's nose and endure. Slipshod rubbish airline even for an LCC.",nan,2.0,nan

The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers?

Luckily we had our original online bookings done via Qantas docs printed with us. Our friends on the earlier flight during the week were made to re-check their luggage in Singapore but we were not also another level of inconsistency. Fly Silk is my advice until they have got their act together or fail which may not be far off looking at the way they seem to be going.

I flew on 2 May from Perth to Bangkok. The trouble was I took an aspirin 10 minutes after takeoff and asked for a water. I was told it cost $4 cash. All I had was my ATM card. Four dollars: for a bottle of water on a 5 hour flight. Then I noticed I was sitting on a stripped Airbus that could easily pass for a re-purposed 1971 Trailways bus. No video entertainment zero amenities - 5 hours with nothing to do. I am sure Jetstar would install pay toilets if they could. Flying Jetstar left me with a renewed appreciation for Thai Airways and KAL.

It cost my group members over $800 each to fly from Singapore to Hangzhou when tickets on full-fledge flights with meals refreshments and entertainment on other airlines like SIA and Cathay Pacific can cost less. It's 'budget' quality in seats with very narrow leg space so the flight attendants insisted that all hand carry had to be stored in the overhead compartments. Problem is that all the compartments near our seats were full with the crew's and other passengers luggage. There didn't seem to be restrictions on the size and the number of hand-carry passengers could bring on the plane. A crew member offered to squeeze my backpack into a compartment that was far from my seat. As I had my passport and money in it it refused to have it out of my sight. I had a most uncomfortable trip with the bag in front of me and hardly any room to stretch my legs.

Seat 1F - which was in a row of 3 when I checked in on-line the seats next to me were free but at check-in they agent advised these seats were now taken. I had asked if I could move to 3G/H but was told these were reserved for crew! I had read online that these were the best seats with more recline what's the point of having them if they are only for crew - seems pointless! Seat config of 2-3-2. For business class I don't understand the point of a row of 3 seats. Seat comfort was ok but impossible to sleep in. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Dinner was ok - Soup for starter which was tasteless Main was very tasty which was stir fry steak. Was accompanied with a 'salad' which was a couple of lettuce leaves in a bowl. Wine choice good. Entertainment system ok - had a couple of new release movies and some recent TV shows but quite limited. Overall it was good value for money but I'd hardly call this Business Class. I don't see why Jetstar wouldn't invest in putting in slightly bigger seats with more recline especially when the majority of their flights on the way back to Australia are red eye and the current seats are impossible to sleep in comfortably.,nan,4.0,nan

The cabin manager was on his game polite friendly welcoming and very smartly turned out. The other crew equally so and the atmosphere on board was one of calm and professionalism. Smooth take off not a word from the Captain but prompt service one we levelled off and again swift friendly and professional. Given the hour of the flight the Cabin Manager was smart enough to realize that most people were wanting to doze and there was minimum noise and disruption from the crew in respect to announcements or endless trips up and down the aisle as sometimes mysteriously happens on night flights.

She was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay $25 per kg. I told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk.

Baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the QF website about incremental charges for excess baggage. Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website). Jetstar employees in Melbourne were unsympathetic said I should've known read the policies etc. One even suggested they should be charging more and didn't think $500-1000 was out of line.

Chicken very tender and noodles more tasty than they looked. Vegetables were overlooked. Standout was cherry tomato and basil soup. What I liked was they took food and drink order before take off so getting drink after seatbelt sign off pretty quick. Crew very friendly especially cabin manager. Nice wine selection.

I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly either Jetstar or their B787.,nan,2.0,nan

We checked in with no dramas and we boarded and flew out exactly on time. Once seated however I discovered that a mother and two young children aged around 4 and 6 years were seated behind me and the youngest child started to kick the back of my seat pull the tray up and down and make a fair amount of noise bickering with the other child. I put up with it until after takeoff before getting the attention of a flight attendant. I explained the situation to her quietly so as not to offend anyone and we were moved to a seat at the back of the plane immediately no questions asked. I can appreciate that it is difficult for children to sit still when flying but I was not looking forward to having my seat kicked for 2.5 hours and I was grateful that flight staff on Jetstar were able to move us quickly and without fuss.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,4.0,nan,1.0,yes,nan,4.0,12 June 2014. JQ 30 BKK-MEL. Business seat 1 F Boeing 787-8. First flight on a 787 and booked my normal 1F. At check in advised it was one 1 E. Due to language difficulties I could not understand why and my request for an explanation was polite but I was not able to master the meaning. I was informed it was a window seat so proceeded to the aircraft. I was then advised that I was in the second row. The reason I fly in row one is for the legroom and lack of a seat in my face for 9 hours making laptop use at times impossible. Again the explanation was difficult to understand and upon my insistence I eventually got back into 1F. It appears the IFE was U/S in seat 1F and the crew were trying to assist me. Lived without IFE. Food and service very good from an all Thai crew which is becoming the norm on this leg and JQ 29. Big drawback with the 787 in seat 1F is that the galley access is out of alignment with the seat so approximately one foot of the space in front of the seat is in line with the open galley. This means when the crew make their multiple visits the curtain hits the passengers legs. This could be some what alleviated with a retainer lower down the curtain. So for 787 flights I advise I will be sitting in 1B or 1J which are out of the way of the traffic flow by about 4 inches. The seats were reasonably comfortable with reasonable recline but footrests need improving as the rung like support is intrusive. Plane new and clean as you would expect. PA from flight deck was nearly indecipherable. This is a safety issue that needs attending to. The headset issued now has a 3 pin plug and subjectively the headsets don't seem as noise cancelling as the ones on the A330.

What a great mistake that was! Yes I understand it is a budget airline but there was no service at all when they delayed the flight for more than 12 hours! I got to the airport about three hours in advance when ground staff said one can check in only two hours prior. An hour passed and when I approached them again to find out the flight had been delayed until the following morning at 4.40am and passengers would be able to collect a meal voucher worth SD$8.00 and that was it. We could not check in until 6pm. The least Jetstar can offer is some bottled water and increase the meal voucher which is less than Aus$10. To hang around with luggage for so many hours at terminal 1 is not fun at all and an inconvenience. Almost all the passengers said they will never fly with Jestar which I think is sad just because the management cannot be bothered to show that they actually care about their passengers.,nan,1.0,nan

It is an economy airline. No great fuss and we were up and away. On the plane: After some tine refreshments were served and cleared. Up in the air: Orders taken for meals and immigration cards out and with no great rush a hot towel arrived. Cruising: Drink served and soon the meal which was pretty good appeared. Cheese and wafers and fruit and a glass of lovely Rutherglen muscadelle were great. Inflight service: Once ""service"" is over staff become very scarce and those who are about do not overtly seek eye contact. However a walk into the galley is greeted warmly and efficiently for any small request. Inflight crew: The captain and second were good on announcements and I look forward to having them up front again. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous but you felt that was the extent of the service offering. I was sitting next to an off duty staff member and was not greeted with a hello or any form of inquiry as to my flight for the duration of the flight. I suppose that is what separates the great airlines from the good airlines? If you love your product or just go to work is demonstrated by behaviours not platitudes of company jingles. Overall: Great plane and cabin and faultless service for most part. For the money Royal B and China E and Air Asia are strong competitors but there is a certain Aussy feel good on board especially with the majority Thai staff.

Melbourne was a whole other story. Ticket counter staff: The staff were chatting with each other and did not notice me standing in the economy line. The girl took my passport without a greeting and continued talking to her co-worker. In a condescending tone said ""You know this flight is 2 hours late right?"" Never an apology for the inconvenience. I was given my ticket with no explanation about where the gates were or how to handle this delay. I decided to wait at the gate and get information there. The 11pm flight now said 1.30 departure with ""Closed"" next to it. I had no idea what this meant and other customers seemed confused as well. My ticket said 12.30 boarding in pen so I just waited. At 12.45 a gate staff member came to the gate but made no announcements. At 12.50 we find out they will start boarding at 110 once the plane has been deplaned. Boarding: The female gate attendant at least said thank you to each customer the male said nothing. Just scanned all of the boarding passes like a robot. I was surprised they never checked our passports even though it was an international flight. Flight: The flight had about 100 people. The airplane could probably hold about 340 people. Still all the customers were assigned seats right next to each other. The flight crew announced that ""You may notice how empty the flight is. Please wait until we are in the air to choose new seats."" Once we were on the plane the pilot needed to get the weights and the flight crew needed to remember where meal customers were seated so they prohibited seat changing. Very poor customer service by airport staff! Flight: The seats were actually very comfortable. My intention was to sleep through the flight. Unfortunately my ticket said meal on it unbeknownst to me so 2 hours into my sleep the flight attendant jabbed my arm to wake me up and give me the food. Her exact words? ""You ordered the meal."" As we were landing the flight crew (not the pilot) made an announcement to thank us for flying and finally apologized for the delayed time. All in all - not the best experience. The food was good.

nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,nan,3.0,nan

Firstly the Thai crew are excellent and are far superior to the domestic version in Australia. The aircraft was on time and was a comfortable flight from an engineering perspective. However the interior of this aircraft can only be described as a time capsule whereby the interior designer had a selection of interiors and said ""That's the one - the theme we will go for is recycled 1970's Estonian disco."" To be fair not all of the seats were broken mine reclined on the left side thereby putting my left shoulder on the lap of the person behind me while my right shoulder was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I especially liked the rips in the ""leather"" that allowed me to hang my mobile phone for viewing of videos. Very thoughtful. Also the 3 TV's that came with the plane at the front of interior did not work so we couldn't even follow a flight map. On the return leg same story re interior.

After it was clear that wasn't going to happen they cheerfully rebooked me for the morning flight and even gave me a front seat which was really nice.

It markets itself as a low cost no frills airline. It was certainly no frills but definitely not low cost. We flew the week before September school holidays and the airfares were very expensive. Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice. It would have been good to see more gluten free offerings rather than a cookie. Service was basic not particularly friendly and mostly absent. Overall a below average experience.,nan,2.0,nan

As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas. My only problem was that there was no inflight entertainment whatsoever although I suppose that's the case with most budget airlines.,nan,5.0,nan

The staff were efficient and friendly. We pre ordered vegetarian meals and they were excellent in fact some of the best airline food we have had. There is no inflight entertainment as advertised so we took our own iPads loaded with books and movies. We only had carry on luggage and although it complied with weight restrictions no one checked the size and weight. The seat pockets needed a good clean out as I found on both trips but the cabin and bathrooms were kept clean throughout the trip. The distance to the seat in front was a little squishy when the couple in front threw their seats back for the the return trip. This would be a problem if you are large. But I've had the problem on higher priced full serviced flights so it comes down to the courtesy of your fellow travellers. To date we have taken about 10 Jetstar flights and never a problem.

We were delayed 2 days in Manila and were not informed when our flight will be until the last minute. They put us up in a very nice hotel in Manila while we were waiting. The morning of the flight they decided to take everyone to the airport at least 3 hours before the flight. I guess they were going for the Guinness book of records for the longest queue ever. Because they didn't start checking people in until all the bus loads had arrived. Little did I know this was a sign of what was to come. We had to change at Darwin to a connecting domestic flight where we arrived about 1pm. As our connecting flight was not there yet they put us up in a hotel in Darwin. We had to wait in a queue in Darwin 3 hours for our new tickets. That plus the 2.5 hours we had to wait in Manila plus an hour at the hotel. All this waiting in queues with a 12 month old infant. The flight from Darwin to Sydney left about 2am. A family we made friends with while waiting in the queue suffered worse than us. They were put off the plane at Darwin because their baby had eczema around it's mouth. Wasn't the whole family just the father and 3 kids. Mother was waiting for them in Sydney. The pilot said the family was removed because the child had an obvious illness. I witnessed the whole event and the pilot never left the cockpit. Anyone that has had a child with eczema would have known what it was. so anyway the family was taken off the plane and left on the bridge. One of the flight attendants coldly carried the sleeping girl and dumped her on the bridge. A memorably bad experience. If you have a family don't fly Jetstar. They also promised to give us $200 worth of coupons each for future flights which turned out to be $50 when we tried to get them.,nan,2.0,nan

When we arrived in Sydney were told that no luggage had been loaded. It was very windy in Hobart so I get why this happened but we were off to Hawaii. Had we been given notice before checking in the luggage that this was a possibility we could have got our swimmers out and left the big bag in Hobart. Anyway Jetstar managed to give us about 3 different stories about when our luggage would arrive in Hawaii and each was completely contradictory. I spent perhaps 3 hours in the first couple of days trying to chase down what was going on. On the HNL SYD flight the attendants all seemed to be lovely but were absolutely hopeless. They were disorganised we didn't get a veg meal that we had ordered. The cabin was an absolute pigsty too - there was an overwhelming smell of urine there were coffee drips on my tray table milk spilt over the seat a carton of milk shoved down the side of the seat previous passengers' rubbish in the seatback compartment. I took my daughter to the toilet about 10 minutes after the seatbelt sign had been switched off and there was urine on the floor. We got back to SYD late and we missed our connecting flight. I had tried twice before leaving HNL to check in online it wouldn't let me. Tried again before going through customs wouldn't let me. I then called once we had got though customs talked to someone who told me she should be able to get it done. I asked her if she could let me know the quickest way to get to domestic and she said she could then put me on hold. Very long story short I ended up on the phone to her for 38 minutes got to check in 29 minutes before takeoff and was not allowed on the plane. I have travelled with Jetstar many times and at this stage the bad experiences outnumber the good about 3-1. Last time on a flight from HBA to MLB I organised (booked and paid for) transport via Jetstar and ended up at the airport with the company having no record of it and refusing to pick me up. The thing that I think frustrates me the most is that through all this it has been me who has had to chase everything up.

At 2.30pm an announcement made that the flight was cancelled (with no explanation) and that we were to be bussed 100km to Brisbane to join JQ817 to Sydney which didn't depart until 6.30pm. So instead of being home in Sydney at 5.30 pm we got there at 9.20 pm 4 hours late. Totally unacceptable.

At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed.

We were still in the middle of the long line having arrived two hours before our scheduled departure time when we heard someone shouting our flight number. With great difficulty we managed to extricate ourselves and baggage from 'the maze'. Eventually we found the check-in desk where our flight number was being shouted. The check-in clerks were complaining to each other that they weren't being sent the right passengers. The return flight from Uluru wasn't much better despite being the only departure that afternoon. At the check-in they waited until all the passengers arrived before they very slowly began the process. Very galling to watch them sitting behind the check-in desks doing nothing while we all stood in line.

We then proceeded to fly the same route that Jetstar could not fly because of bad weather. Tiger Airways also took off on time Jetstar being the only Airline grounded because of bad weather. If we had allowed ourselves more time and booked the same flight 24 hours earlier we would still have had to wait until 13-00 hrs because the flight the night before had also been ""delayed"".",nan,nan,nan

Our initial flight was due to leave at 10am only to receive an email the night before at 9pm informing our plane had been cancelled due to ""scheduled maintenance"" we had to very quickly rebook ourselves onto a plane that left at 12.45am or 1pm the next day. We were lucky to get seats on the 12.45am flight however the seats at the very back of the plane ""designated for cabin crew."" Because this is a budget airline we really didn't expect many thrills but the back seats allow for little room to recline and the three seats in a row are so compact it was the most uncomfortable experience I've had on a plane. The seats are like cement the faux leather is super sticky and the leg room is ridiculously tiny if you are larger than a size 14 I'm sure you would be terribly claustrophobic. The cabin crew also burnt the coffee which stunk out the entire cabin. Luckily for us this flight did get us in to Melbourne 8 hours earlier than we had first booked so a small positive to say the least. On our return journey from Melbourne to Perth - only four days later - we were due to board the plane having been called over the speaker to get our boarding passes ready to then be told over the speaker that ""we think the plane has been cancelled."" We had to quickly run out to the departure check in grab our checked in bags off the carousel and attempt to be rebooked onto another flight. Thankfully we were changed to a flight (operated by Qantas) to Perth via Adelaide with an extra waiting time of 2 hours in Melbourne airport. Again things turned out well for us given you get IFE on Qantas flights and food/drinks are included however this experience really does remind us that paying the extra cash for an airline Virgin Australia or Qantas is much more reliable.

I have just returned from a holiday to Bali and flew Jetstar. I was actually quite excited to be flying the 787 for the first time after all the hype about comfort air quality bigger windows and low noise levels. What an enormous disappointment. Jetstar have managed to take such an advanced and modern aircraft and jam it with cramped seats down in economy with terrible leg room. I am not even that big 175cm. It looks like they had a team from Tupperware design and install the entire interior of this plane. Plastic everywhere. The food (pre-purchased) was marginal at best and it'll cost you $10 to watch a movie. You go to all that trouble of installing screens in the back of the seat and it seemed hardly anyone bothered paying. The actual inflight experience (bigger windows air quality and smooth flight) was OK - and I am looking forward to flying the 787 again with an airline that actually designed a cabin with a hint of passenger comfort in mind. Thankfully it's only a 6 hour run up to Bali and slightly shorter coming home.

The seat of Jetstar's Business Class was exactly the same seat taken when you're flying Business Class in the 1990's. The only thing that was added were the two in-seat power points. Makes me suspect that Jetstar/Qantas cut corners by re-using the old Business Class seats from old airframes and installed them here. Like the old Business Class seats the in-flight entertainment (IFE) is a very bulky iPad with equally bulky battery pack. The first meal dinner I was given a choice of two dishes. After dinner I ordered for black coffee 15 minutes later my ordered arrived as coffee with milk/coffee. I ordered Scotch after dinner and it arrived 20 minutes later as Scotch and soda. For breakfast I was given two choices: Take it or leave it. This is where Jetstar cuts costs again. Instead of hot meal you're given a bowl of cereals. The seats were hard and I didn't sleep a wink because it was just plain difficult to lean back. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone to bother buying Business Class as it is really not worth it. I have flown Business Class (Cathay Pacific) and Premium Economy (Air New Zealand) and Jetstar's Business Class is BELOW (in standard) compared to Air New Zealand's Premium Economy.

When asked about how passengers could go about making claims or trying to find alternative flights out of Singapore Jetstar staff could only offer a measly piece of photocopied information sheet explaining that the flight was cancelled and that should passengers choose to find their own alternative flight carrier that this would mean Jetstar bears no responsibility in fully refunding claims.,nan,1.0,nan

The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes.

Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in.

Flew to Honolulu with Jetstar for holidays the tickets were not cheap but I think it was more premium economy at business class prices. No priority boarding. No priority baggage first off and last to get baggage. The all Thai cabin crew did not seem to have been well trained they were very friendly but the service was slow and haphazard. Some meals came out fast others really slow to arrive dessert of ice cream was liquid when it finally arrived. Food would be classed as average for economy on most airlines definately not what I would call ""business class"". Seats were not that comfortable and had lacked in legroom the seat in front hit my knees when reclined. Inflight entertainment of iPad took an hour to come out after departure and there was no place to hang it it was in my lap while I ate meal over the top of it. Not exactly classy. It was three times the price of an economy ticket and definitely not worth it. I am one very unhappy customer and will never fly Jetstar again.",nan,1.0,nan

As it was an evening flight we checked the Jetstar website throughout the day to ensure that our flight was not delayed before heading to the airport. On arrival at 3.30pm we were told the flight had been delayed until 4.00am. The reason was fog over Perth however we watched as other reputable airlines departed as scheduled. We were each given 'meal' vouchers which turned out to be to the value of approx. $7.15 - not enough to purchase a meal from any of the airport vendors. When we approached Jetstar for further compensation they did not provide any. We were forced to spend 12 hours waiting in Changi airport watching time pass. When the flight eventually did depart (after 4am following a long delay on the Tarmac) we were then brought the dinner meals that had been pre-purchased when we believed we would be flying out in the evening! Not being interested in eating dinner at 6.30am this was further money wasted. The small amount of money saved by booking this budget airline was not in the slightest bit worthwhile and I would never fly with Jetstar again.,nan,2.0,nan

We are on our honeymoon in Vietnam and I decided to book with Jetstar Pacific because I viewed them as a more reliable alternative to the other economy airlines in the region and also because of the flight times. However they have been completely disastrous changing the days and times of all our flights (some on multiple occasions) up to 2 days before the flight. This has meant we have had to completely change plans cancelling hotel bookings as well as all the stress that goes with it. I will never fly with them again.,nan,1.0,nan

Price was nothing special. Bags were bang on 20kg if not a whisker over but a blind eye was shown which was a relief. They didn't weigh hand luggage at the gate. ADL-DPS sector was on a domestic A320 which was old dirty and the magazines in our seats were all torn. The seats were either developed by a bus builder or just stuffed judging by our numb behinds for the 5-hour flight. Crew fine and I gather ADL based. Disappointingly half the menu was unavailable as tragic as the choices are - they really aren't trying it really is lowest common denominator and undrinkable wine. DPS-MEL sector was on new B787 with Australian pilots but all Thai flight attendants. New Denpasar Airport is excellent very efficient even if the air con is a bit changeable. You can buy duty free (unlike other ports in Asia on flights to Aus?) which is bagged and given to you at the gate. First time on 787 and the big windows and nicer cabin humidity/pressure seemed to make a difference. I got a good sleep couldn't complain too much about seat or pitch. I would do short haul 787 with Jetstar for the right price I again but keep my underlying disdain for this business model and airline.,nan,3.0,nan

I have to put my hand up and admit that my wife and I have only traveled with Jetstar once some years ago. From the outset (booking your tickets) the experience was horrendous with each separate step being asked if we wish to purchase an add on. And the number of times where we were reminded that carry on luggage that breached the weight limits (which apparently have recently been reduced) would be severely penalised and baggage placed in the hold. On our flight to Hobart passengers were called to board the aircraft then spent 20 minutes in a holding pen waiting to board. The flight left 20 minutes late. On our return journey from Hobart we arrived at the recommended 60 minutes before departure time to be told that the plane had been delayed and would be an hour late arriving which eventuality extended to two hours late arriving and departing. The cabin crew were actually OK. Not overly friendly but courteous and attentive. Overall our latest experience with Jetstar was not one that I don't intend to repeat too soon.

Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier.

Tired frustrated customers then had to be insulted by the Jetstar spokesman who simply kept reiterating that any costs involved in missed forward flights, accommodation etc were our fault if we had not taken out travel insurance – he likened it to hiring a car. I researched 5 different travel insurance providers and none would insure against an airline cancelling their own flight only against weather. Jetstar did not reply to my query as to whether our flight was cancelled due to engineering problems and if so why wasn’t another aircraft provided or due to an unfilled flight which several passengers had been told was the reason. Jetstar did offer $60 vouchers with an expiry date of 6 months – I asked if these could be transferred or extended as we did not intend to travel in that period and of course the response was no. The cancelled flight caused many passengers grief, in our case it set the stage for a nightmare 5 days of missed ongoing flights with huge rebooking fees (being Easter it was a nightmare getting seats on flights), missed hire car bookings, missed hotel and car hire, lost luggage meaning the same clothes for 5 days. Jetstar customer service responded that 'Section 9.1 of our Conditions of Carriage does state that flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. This information is available on our website and you agree to it when you make your booking.' Jetstar is not a cheap airline, in fact there are times it is more expensive than Qantas and Virgin – we booked Jetstar because it fitted in with our dates. United Airlines and Delta Airlines were both involved in our 5 missed flights and both were amazingly helpful in getting us from Honolulu to New York and even changed our flight for the second time without charge – why can’t Jetstar treat its passengers with the same consideration.

In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front.

This last trip will be my last, I did not enjoy it at all. My husband and I did not sleep a wink as the seats were just too uncomfortable. I fail to see why we should pay the same price as row 1 passengers (we were row 2), when we have nowhere near the amount of legroom as row 1. Service was very average and I believe if you choose and pay for exit row seats with a premier airline in economy, it may be cheaper and more pleasant. Sad to see the service decline as it used to be a reasonable option. From now on, it's either true business class with a better airline, or we just don't go!",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Was in a hurry so checked in online, didn't print out my boarding pass 'cause I didn't even have time (my bad). Was hoping the boarding pass with a bar code on my phone would be ok, lady at boarding gate didn't seem to have a problem with that at all so she checked me in as normal. They ended up checking the wrong person in and gave it to me as me and the other one had the same surname and first name's initial. Obviously this resulted 2 people with the same seating, tried to explain to staff what I thought happened, apologized for the confusion because I felt at fault. The guilty feeling stopped when this lady was rude and blamed the whole thing on me for holding the wrong boarding pass. Well, I'm sorry that your staff was the one who checked the wrong person in, instead of using the booking reference to ensure they checked in the right person, they used the last name (which can be very common). It was amazing how I received no apologies for the mistakes on their end and had to feel bad for my mistakes only. I only thought it was ok to use a boarding pass on phone because I never had an issue with using it in the past with Jetstar. The flight attendant was sweet enough to check if I was ok afterward but then said ""it's alright"" like ""yeah, we forgave you""??? This time it's not the delays that bother me (you get what you pay for), it's the attitude of staff.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

It was well under 20. We also took off 1.5h late due to faulty cabin lights and were on the plane the whole time, no offer of water or anything.

(And no, that Q doesn't stand for quality, more like questionable). Called JQ, after being on the phone got seating I wanted. Even got charged for it, though I wasn't advised of this. Although I have the QF app (which after the flight showed JQ526), I had to download the JQ one as well for some reason. All the way Tripit showed it as QF443 / QF478 operated by JQ (JQ526) Ah well. It then changed from exit row to + 4 rows to -1 row to ultimately another 11 rows and exit row. We got to the airport in time to get some dinner, then realised bag drop only available 2 hours before flight (and check in on the machine 3 hours before flight). It then asked if okay with exit row, but still got shuffled around. Though staff at the counter fixed it having seen some charge had been send through, which Amex showed as pending. Still not sure why. Flight was may be 3/4 full. Last time I flew JQ was probably a decade or so ago, thanks for reminding me why, even for short haul.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

I have flown with Jetstar on this route to and from Bangkok numerous times since it's inception but this is the last time ever. Everything has gone down hill so much in the two years since I last did it. Check in was a debacle at Bangkok with economy passengers checking in at business desk whilst we waited but no economy check in agent called us up and economy passengers got priority ! Boarding is like a herd of cattle swarming and again no priority. I was most angered by the meal service which was very sparse, linen napkins replaced with paper ones, no second cup of tea, just quickly swiped the tray away.

Hearing some bad reviews about cancellations and delays with Jetstar I was really worried about our flight. We had to check ourselves in via a kiosk and tag our own luggage and send it on its way. Having waited in an extremely long line before this innovation, it was actually a positive thing. We boarded efficiently, although by steps - and left right on time. The seat itself had reasonable leg room but was very narrow. We were lucky we had a free seat between us. The price seems initially cheap but when you add in things like seat choice, checked bag, any food it adds up to almost the price of a full service airline however, Jetstar is the only airline that flies direct from Melbourne to Townsville. We were not able to download any entertainment from their website as they don't allow this on this three hour flight. Made for a boring three hours, fortunately we had books to read. The flight attendants were very friendly, more so than any flight we have ever been on domestically or internationally - go figure. We had pre-ordered a Pho and ham and cheese toastie - mistake. They were not nice at all. I wish we hadn't done that. Anyway we arrived in Townsville 10 minutes early so that was a bonus. I would definitely choose this airline as it saves a lot of time when you can fly direct.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

We had driven for 1 hour in an uber to get to the airport and we had about five suitcases - on the check-in iPad, we had to check in each one of us individually which wasn't a big help. However, the experience got better once we boarded. The cabin crew were friendly and the plane was pretty clean, but the legroom was shocking. My knees were literally touching the seat in front! The Jetstar menu was good, with a decent range of food although a bit pricey. Toilets were spotless, surprisingly and the magazine was great. overall, Jetstar is a cheap and decent way to travel and I would love to return some day.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

We have two young children so the ""alternative"" flights they offered for the first delay didn't work. Ended up canceling and re booking flights a few days later at a significant cost. The second flights also ended up being delayed by a day due to technical issues. I can understand that it happens sometimes and was OK with it. Jetstar offered to pay for accommodation and a meal allowance for the 4 of us up to at total of of US $700. I have receipts etc but have so far been offered reimbursement of of US$250.

Having never used this before we stumbled and the female attendant was quite rude. Felt like she was talking down to us. On the flight 3 of use had 11 GHJ going over with a bulkhead behind us. The seat back still reclines the normal amount and the great thing is no one behind pulling your seat or asking for it to be raised. Watched a few movies over which is quite limited in its selection. Food was roast chicken and another friend had pork. Both meals were quite good. Service was good and overall a good flight. An hour late leaving but made up some time and only half hour late getting in. Return flight we had row 10 GHJ these are great seats. No one in front. Heaps of leg room.

Feeling skeptical at that point and ready to lose that piece (it's a kite, light and small but has poined ends and hence hand-carry abroad was not allowed), was pleasant to find luggage arriving in 1 piece.

A new aircraft - clean - comfortable seating for economy. Not much leg room, but which airline does provide a lot of legroom in the Economy cabin. We prepaid our Entertainment. A reasonable selection of movies, TV programs. Nice size screen & easy to operate. We had also preordered a meal for this flight for $24. Cabin crew stated handing out meals not long after takeoff, so it was really a very early dinner. The serving size (roast chicken) was very small, but the actual quality was very good. In addition to the chicken, we received a cup of water and a small chocolate bar. Not particularly good value. Flight was very comfortable. We had a spare seat next to us, so that was good. The aircraft is very quiet. Clean toilets. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. Overall a very good flight.

We had already booked a lot of very expensive extra baggage. when two of us arrived the airline check-in staff told us we had to pay an extra $25 per guitar as a fee for oversize baggage. I was offended as this is an obvious money making exercise on behalf of jetstar and I travel frequently with many airlines and over 20 years with a guitar have never been asked for this before, oversize baggage handling is a very minimal service which mostly involves the passenger taking the bags to a different conveyor. The ground staff argued with me trying to tell me that it was always the case and that other airlines charge the same amount. When my bandmate arrived to check in with the same booking, he wasnt charged any extra fee they didnt even mention it. When i made a complaint I just got the run-around. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I wasn't, however, impressed with Jetstar's new policy of weighing each passenger's carry-on bag as they approach the boarding gate, with the intention of slugging each passenger with excess baggage a small fortune to place the bag in the hold. This is something that should be done at check-in, as it only holds up the queue. On board, the service was good, but not great, and overall tolerable for the short hour-long flight to Melbourne-Avalon. The return flight  on May 17 was very similar, with some divergences. This time, I checked in at the counter (I happened to do some shopping in Melbourne and pre-paid checked baggage), and Jetstar's Avalon Ground Crew couldn't have been more helpful or polite. On board, however, the service was once again good, but nothing to write home about. Overall I'd recommend Jetstar only if there was a significant difference in price between other airlines, including Tigerair (far superior to Jetstar as an LCC in Australia), or if one wanted to fly to Melbourne Avalon Airport, a beautiful little Airport some 40kms out of Melbourne's CBD which was an absolute breeze to visit and to use.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

I received a message 3 minutes before walking out the door to catch my late evening flight with Jetstar. ""Your flight from Sydney is cancelled. Go to website to check your flight options. We're sorry your flight has been cancelled."" Bit of a pathetic apology, but I jumped online immediately to investigate. This was due to bad weather - so not Jetstar's fault, but their responsibility to compensate none-the-less especially considering other airlines were still flying from Sydney, and I was paying for a promised service. My reason for booking a late flight was that I was working my part time job (ie.can't afford the higher fares for Qantas or Virgin) in the day and needed to fly from Sydney to Melbourne for a job interview. The interview was at 9am on Thursday, so the alternative afternoon flights they were offering on Thursday afternoon were not a solution. I was told that I could swap my flight for an afternoon flight on Thursday, or morning flight on the Friday. Or a voucher for the amount of the cancelled flight. I explained that my reason for travel was a job interview in the morning (not just leisure or an unimportant trip) and therefore an afternoon flight was pointless. I could not be flexible - not to mention my return flight to Sydney was scheduled for 3pm. Arrive in Melbourne at 1pm and return to Sydney at 3pm the same day?? I told them I had no need for a change of time and date unless that change landed me in Melbourne in time for my interview. I was given more options (and then fewer options) for Thursday afternoon or Friday, and not one that actually properly compensated me for this cancellation. A voucher provided in five business days was not a solution, and with no extra planes added the following day to compensate for the hundreds of passengers put out; I was left with no solutions, and out of pocket. Finally I agreed to their only form of refund (despite the assistant explicitly saying at one point Jetstar can refund cash depending on the reason...ie whether they deem it worthy). It was this point that I was offered the amount for the cancelled flight, only. They still tried to charge me the cost of the return flight despite cancelling my initial flight! The attempt to still charge me for the return flight, after an hour of nil solutions, was enough to firm my mind. Avoid Jetstar. They do not care about their customers. They are a budget airline because they take advantage of their customers to make a profit. I could only just afford the flight to an interview.

It took 90 minutes before Jetstar provided a solution- a flight on Qantas to Tokyo not Osaka. So I arrived late at night, miles from Osaka and had to arrange bullet train to Nagoya at my expense. This was my second Jetstar international flight that Jetstar cancelled and transferred the recovery costs to me. Behind schedule I decided to return on the same flight but extend for five days. The Jetstar Indian based dialogue centre tried to charge me $630 to change my flight. I rejected and used the ""manage my flight"" option. I was charged $300. My complaint letter to Jetstar was acknowledged, by a corporate apologist who stated that I had changed my return route. I hadn't changed my route - I changed the day. The excuse for their cancellation was unavoidable technical difficulties. So my experience with Jetstar is two cancelled flights with no apology or compensation for the extra costs.

Jetstar promised to compensate my friend and I for a mishap they made and then ignored our calls and emails when it came time for payment. I’m totally disgusted at how they treat customers and would always recommend travelling with another airline.,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Sydney to Honolulu,1.0," | Sydney to Honolulu. Worst airline in the world. Had ordered meals and paid for meals which they did not have on board when we flew. The so called customer care person emailed to apologise and provided vouchers which are not transferable, have to be used in six months and have a host of other conditions which makes them very hard to use. Also he has failed to respond to any emails we have sent. The complaint was taken by the stewardess onboard, so they just sent an email with excuses and then sent these worthless vouchers and ignored all other correspondence. Jetstar are quick to take your money for pillows, meals, entertainment etc but do everything to ensure they don't give you a refund in cash. They send these highly conditioned vouchers which clearly you will have little chance of using so they don't provide the service and then also keep your money! Don't fly with Jetstar.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

I have never had a problem with my carry-ons fitting in the cabin, etc., and I have traveled on 10-12 domestic Australian flights in the last 2 months. But today they took my carry-on out of my hands in the boarding line, said it was too big, and made me pay $60 to check it. I am irate. The way it was handled was very degrading and upsetting. I will not be traveling with Jetstar in the future, not ever again.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 787,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,no,Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne,2.0," |  Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. Tried to upgrade my seat from Economy to Business. Upgrading via the site gave me errors. Called the phone numbers on their app (2 in Vietnam) both wrong numbers. Found the correct numbers eventually - phone went to the hold music and hung up after 10 mina, twice. Went to the airport early to upgrade, Jetstar staff told me to wait for check in to open and do it at the counter. Went to counter and they said I had to do it before check in opened and it's too late now - and it was the same guy that told me to wait. The kicker though, he grinned at me. Crew on board just chatted to each other and were barely seen. In addition: 5 flights with Jetstar equals 33 emails, 4 flight changes, 17 SMS's, different contact number for each email, emails to check in for flights they cancelled.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Sydney to Melbourne,1.0," | Jetstar website said if they have changed their confirmed delay time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, they don't notify us unnecessarily of a potential flight delay that can be brought back on to schedule or does not eventuate. They have failed their guarantee. The flight arrival time was changed without any notification. If I didn't go online to check. I won't know. They change the arrival time but not departure time. I feel like I got tricked. I was planning to catch another connection flight, but I couldn't make it. It is meant to depart at 7am, but till 7am, we are not even boarding. If Jetstar notified us earlier, we could have got another flight. They are so unfriendly too. I called the hotline and they said I can move to an earlier, but when I arrived, they said it is full. Also, the airport staff is very rude and unfriendly. I feel like treated second class just because I am flying economy. The flight attendants are the worst. Please never ever ever fly with them. Totally disappointed. Everyone is waiting at the gate, but there is no staff around trying to help us out.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,September 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Brisbane to Sydney,1.0," |  Flew Brisbane to Sydney. Worst flight attendants on my flight. Checking in and boarding was fine but the flight was terrible, I had a crying 1 year old who just cried non-stop being her ears were sore, not once did any of the 4 flight attendants come to see if she was alright. I was blocked in my seat so I couldnt stand with her and not once did any of them come to see if she was okay or if she needed anything. They would just walk past everytime. They looked miserable and so untidy, they basically looked like they had just woken up. I am so dissappointed all other airlines I have travelled offer the most amazing help and support. I will never ever travel with Jetstar again.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,3.0,November 2017,nan,3.0,nan,yes,Brisbane to Melbourne,2.0," |  Brisbane to Melbourne. This was my first fight with Jetstar and had no previous expectations of the airline. We had quite a bit of luggage as we were moving from Canada to Australia and had everything that we came over with, so we had to purchase extra luggage. Although we had to pay the extra surcharge for 30 kg's of checked luggage each the price was very reasonable (Considering a similar flight in Canada would probably be double the cost). Prior to boarding I saw another Jetstar flight weighing carryon baggage to make sure that everyones carryon baggage met the standard of 7kg. I was a little worried because although we only had a backpack each, 7kgs is not a lot of weight. However, when it was time for our flight to board we did not have to weigh our carry on bags. I am not sure why we got the pass on the scale and the other flight had to weigh their bags. The flight itself took off on time and had the seatbelt sign off within a few minutes. We were in Seats 20 E & F, however as there was a kid kicking the back of my seat I moved as there was free seats in row 20 ABC. The leg room was probably the worst pitch I have ever sat in, coming in at 29 inches. I am 188cm (6' 2"") tall, so this was uncomfortable for me however anyone smaller would be okay for the short flight. The staff came around just after take off to do a service. Standard stuff was available for purchase (hot/cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks), but there was no complementary drinks or snacks. There was a family sitting in the 2 rows behind us that had 5 small kids that were making a lot of noise and not following the seatbelt sign. At one point the staff acted very professionally and asked the parents to get the kids back in their seats for landing. We landed on time and exited the plane on the tarmac, but were walking distance to the terminal so we didn't need a bus. Overall an average flight for the price we paid, I probably would not recommend as the legroom was uncomfortable and there were a lot of families and children that made the flight seem chaotic at times. The price was okay though, and as long as you know what you were getting into with a low cost airline it is an okay way to get around Australia for a reasonable price.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,December 2017,nan,1.0,1.0,no,Auckland to Christchurch,2.0," | Flew from Christchurch to Auckland and they didn’t check the weight of our carry on bags but at the Auckland Jetstar they did. The staff in Auckland airport made sure she checked every single bag even my husband’s laptop. We’ve flown to a load of places and no airline has made him weight his laptop except this one. Due to this The weight of our carry on bags exceeded 2kg. (Our two suitcases, laptop and my handbag). They charged us $60 saying it has to be checked in. All Jetstar wants is more money. What annoys me is Christchurch jet star didn’t weigh our bags. Shouldn’t rules be the same for Christchurch and Auckland? When I spoke to another staff member she said that Auckland is Auckland and Christchurch is Christchurch. That doesn’t make sense to me. I say that’s poor team work and rules aren’t very consistent. Don’t think I will ever fly with Jetstar again. Their cheaper than Air Nz but they try to charge every little cent out of you which then makes it more expensive than Air Nz. I will be going with Air Nz next time.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
A320,Economy Class,3.0,November 2017,3.0,5.0,nan,yes,Melbourne to Sydney,4.0," |  Melbourne Avalon to Sydney on the 21st November, the 15.45 service. Arrived at the terminal punctually, went through check-in and security swiftly, and was given an excellent seat by the ground crew (who also overlooked the fact that my baggage was 1KG over). Onboard, the service was fairly good (but not great) for a run-of-the-mill Jetstar flight, and we landed in SYD 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall, I’d recommend Jetstar if there was a great sale, or if using Avalon, where the ground crew are consistently exceeding expectations as well as the airline being able to offer cheaper prices from this airport.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A321-200,Economy Class,3.0,December 2017,nan,4.0,3.0,yes,Hobart to Melbourne,5.0," |  Hobart to Melbourne Tullamarine. Second time flying with Jetstar and they impressed me. One thing worth mentioning about Hobart airport is that when we were boarding, it was raining. And the airport was kind enough to provide us with umbrellas when walking across the tarmac (No boarding bridges at Hobart airport) Once boarded, it was refreshing to see the new Jetstar interior, especially the brand-new seats. They were thinner than other  seats, which enabled a greatly increased amount of leg room. They shifted the seat pocket to above the tray table, thus increasing the leg room. The cabin crew was nice with positive attitudes towards passengers. My only complaint would be the inadequate amount of lavatories onboard (only one in the front and two in the rear) compared to five in some airlines' A321s, but it's a budget airline, and it's not too bad for a 55-minute flight. The flight was delayed due to bad weather, but the captain was very prompt to provide updates. Overall a fairly nice experience at this price point and I would recommend it to the people who are looking to save a few bucks on your plane ticket. (The inflight entertainment was just a magazine btw).",Business,5.0,nan
A320-200,Economy Class,3.0,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Sydney to Melbourne,1.0," |  The route says Sydney to Melbourne Tullamarine, but Jetstar sent me to Melbourne Avalon. I just got off a Qantas 787-9 flight, and I wanted to fly back to Melbourne cheaply, so I booked Jetstar. Jetstar cancelled my flight to Melbourne while I was walking to the gate, because of weather that had already passed in Melbourne. I can tell you that Qantas and Virgin Australia were still flying, so if I had chosen to pay the extra $100 for a Qantas fare, I would've been fed, and comfortable. But in this case, Jetstar stranded me in Sydney and I had little to no money, and NO help was given. They just booked me on a flight to Avalon for the next day. So, I spent the night in Sydney's International Terminal with np sleep, and no support whatsoever from Jetstar, because I had no money, I could'nt afford a hotel room, and as a 16 year old, it was quite scary. Hotels were booked out because of the Cancellation too. I flew to Avalon the next day, and  Seats were uncomfortable, aircraft was dirty. Cabin crew were not very nice, and service was terrible.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

We were late to the boarding gate (beyond our control) and the lady screamed at us like we were children. Not sure what side of the bed she woke up on but I would expect a bit more maturity from an adult woman. Seats weren't comfortable and leg room was barely the minimum. Next time I will pay extra and fly with an airline that treats its customers with respect.,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0

For every kilo you pass they will charge you 25 dollars. That’s insane, try using other airlines more comprehensive, if you pass one kilo they will charge It. One flight they charged me something but for the next one, with the same amount of kilos they tried to charge me more. Wherever they can earn more money they will take advantage of it.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I paid a low fare and could check in via their app up to 28 days in advance. The flight left on time, arrived early, and the crew were professional and helpful. There was also good information from the flight deck. LCC’s tend to get hammered when things go wrong or maybe when customers don’t do their research, but I knew what Jetstar offered and what they didn’t when I bought the ticket and I feel they are good value and relatively comfortable to fly with. My only negative was the long line for bag drop in Sydney. Maybe a Melbourne-style automated system would be better.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Queenstown to Bali via Sydney,2.0," |  Terrible Airline! Flew Queenstown to Bali via Sydney. Will never fly with them again! Of course its a budget airline and I understand that but seriously its a joke. We purchased luggage for 35kg then when we arrived and tried to check in they tell us 32kg is the max! Nowhere does it say it can be in up to 10 bags! They weigh your carry-ons to the T. 7kg and no more. So here we are at the check in counter being pregnant, trying to put on layers and layers of clothes which we are just going to take off after security and put right back in the bag so whats the difference. I've never had an airline weigh and criticize our carry on luggage. We still ended up having to pay another 100 dollars for another checked bag at the counter. First she said it would be 75 dollars, then when we are abour to pay tells us oh it's 100 dollars because you have another stop. So we ended up paying an extra 250$ for nothing. We could have just booked Qantas for cheaper, have our bags included, no hassle with carry on weight, a meal included and complimentary alcoholic beverages included. Worst experience with Jetstar.

My flight from Auckland to Palmerston North was cancelled a few hours before I was due to depart. I have since learned that this is a common occurrence with this airline. We were offered other flights the following day but believe that at least one of these flights was also cancelled, thankfully we did not take the chance of finding out and booked with another airline. During our flight we heard stories from other passengers of repeated cancellations!",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,January 2018,nan,4.0,nan,yes,Sydney to Hobart,3.0," | Flew with Jetstar from Sydney to Hobart return over the new year. The flight was much more expensive than normal, but that is to be expected during busy/peak travelling periods. Both routes were flown on the A320. The seats were fine, felt a little squashy at times but it was only a 1 hour 30 min flights. Cabin crew promptly came around with drinks and snacks, but I had brought my own food. No entertainment, but it's such a short flight it hardly matters. The incoming flight for our trip back to Hobart arrived late, but as soon as everyone was off the plane we boarded, which meant that the plane departed on schedule and arrived on time in Sydney. I've flown with Jetstar multiple times and have never had any issues with them. I will continue to fly with them.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,1.0,December 2017,1.0,4.0,1.0,yes,Melbourne to Sydney,1.0," | Booking online was simple, as was the self check in and bag drop. However the departure gate was right at the far end of the terminal. It took ages to get to and it included various flights of stairs. Once there there wasn't anywhere near enough seating made available to sit and wait before boarding. This was made worse by very weak airconditioning. This is despite the airline requesting all passengers be there not less than 30 minutes before boarding time. It was a tiny plane. I was unable to move whilst in my seat and due to lack of space only got to make use of 1 of the 2 armrests. Cabin was dirty all over. As was the magazine which had all the puzzles filled in by previous passengers. My ticket said I was to get a $10 meal voucher but this never occurred. The menu was pretty awful anyway and staff service non-existent. It was a very boring flight even despite its brevity as there was no inflight entertainment. At least my bag came out very quickly the other end. In summary the best parts were start and finish but very poor in the middle.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

I now wear compression garments which act to compress the skin. I go to the gym and weight train approximately 4 to 5 times a week and regularly go jogging and hiking. Over Christmas I flew from Sydney to Cairns with Jetstar. I booked an exit seat as I am 6 foot 2 and I like the leg space. On arriving I was told I was not allowed to sit in the exit as I was not physically capable of doing anything. After trying to explain that I had no issues at all and the garments were only for burn compression, I was moved to another seat and told to contact Jetstar if I wanted a refund. If that was not enough of an insult, I boarded the plane to find that my seat and the other exit seats were filled with people who I highly doubt were able to physically help anyone. I was obviously discriminated against purely on my appearance and at no time did they consider my situation.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,November 2017,2.0,3.0,nan,no,Queenstown to Auckland,3.0," |  Queenstown to Auckland. Jetstar imposes a highly restrictive and inflexible baggage weight policy. Jetstar does clearly articulate the requirements that must be met to avoid their unreasonable excess baggage weight fees, but if you are unaware and are over their limit, you will be unpleasantly surprised. In my case, my carry on bag was 12 Kg, 5 Kg above their 7 Kg maximum. I could not fit anymore items into my checked baggage to offset this weight. So, Jetstar charged me, not for the excess (5 Kg), but for the whole 12 Kg at NZD 15/Kg or NZD 180! This was far more than the cost of my seat on the flight from Queenstown to Auckland. The whole experience was the only blemish on a fantastic 2-week trip throughout New Zealand. My suggestion to future Jetstar passengers: travel with a portable luggage scale or consider flying with an airline that is more customer-oriented than Jetstar.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

They were not able to connect me with another flight. After being on the phone and waiting in line for over an hour all they would offer me was a Jetstar voucher stating they could not give a monetary refund. My wife spoke to them and informed them the reason for my trip was to visit my terminally ill father they requested a hospital statement before they would issue a refund. They also offered me a voucher for the flight I would miss tomorrow. I then had to pay $400 for a flight with another airline. I will never fly with Jetstar again.

Upon arrival at Gold Coast airport, we checked in using the kiosks – a process which was smooth and simple as both the check-in kiosk and the automated bag drop system were very easy to use. Boarding started around 7 minutes late but (because of the efficiency of the process) we departed right on schedule. The flight itself was rather uneventful, taking around an hour to get to Sydney. The seat was comfortable, though the legroom was quite cosy. All food and drink on board had to be purchased. The landing in Sydney was smooth, and disembarking was as smooth as boarding. Overall, I would definitely consider flying with JetStar again in future as the flight experience overall was very good (particularly for a budget airline).",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

I have flown Jetstar a few times and only once had a good experience this flight was the worst making a last minute quick trip to Perth. Had carry on only as I have a handbag/laptop bag and small suitcase at gate I stupidly weighed suitcase again, it was 1 kg over, I again stupidly honest let the girls know, I thought I could just transfer something to handbag. This honesty cost me $60 and a further $32 at Melbourne for next leg. When calling to complain I may as well have been told learn to be dishonest like a lot of others have learned to be or don't fly with Jetstar. I will be choosing to fly virgin from now on and will not recommend to anyone. virgin have luggage auto included and a snack or meal on plane depending on flight time and free in flight entertainment. Jetstar has none of these so if you work out the charges for these extras supplied free from virgin, it works out virgin is a lot cheaper and the staff are amazing.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

The luggage I am carrying is within weight requirements in the US and EU, but here I had to pay an extra fee that cost more than I paid for the flight.

Meals were tiny for a premium price. Rubbish from meals was not removed until just before landing. Drinks (coffee etc.) came around around 1 hr into the flight then not again unless you paged the stewards. No offer of water for the flight unless you called the stewards. They seemed uninterested in the passengers hiding in the middle /end prep areas. Seats were cramped and flight full. Return to Sydney was worse. All water was confiscated prior to boarding. Again flight crew seemed disinterested in the passengers and meals were as above. No water unless asked for. Unfortunate as all water taken before boarding by Bali inspection of bags at the loading gate.  The crew seemed unhappy or dissatisfied and gave the bare minimum of service. Again not happy with having to pay for everything including old TV shows and music. I'll never travel Jetstar again on any flight over 1hr.,Family Leisure,2.0,1.0

I saw others that went through with similar sized, but they said they had to be backpack sized. If too heavy, u kinda understand but not for $300!  To top it off the agent was rude and I heard other agents complaining about customers that had questions. My flight was bout 9 hrs long and all I got was half a cup of water offered to me. Everything else I had to pay for.  None of their movies, music or games were free either. So in the end the flight cost wasn't cheap at all. For $8 a movie, I could buy the DVDs to keep!

No IFE during the flight so I was quite bored and no complimentary food/beverages, a true sign of LCC.

Many of the passengers were children. There was much activity on the seats and on the aisle. As it was not a full flight, I had to seek a quiet area in the plane. I guess, the activity was allowable or else the cabin crew would have taken action. The cabin crew were not as attentive as in a comparable QANTAS internal flight. The plane looked new and it appeared clean and fresh. Arrival, the baggage arrived soon after. We had hoped to avoid the Sydney rush hour, but because of the flight delay, we were in the middle of the rush hour. It took us longer to get to our hotel than expected.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Then, on our way home from Sapporo to Tokyo, we checked in, waited a few hours only to find out that our flights were cancelled, and we'd be missing our connection to Canada. We scrambled to find a different airline, but are now paying 3x more for flights, early morning taxis, train tickets that aren't being used, and extra baggage fees.

Today when flying Jetstar as a Flexbiz traveller (their highest traveling class for domestic flights) I was choked by the unpleasant behaviour from the check-in staff. When calling for a supervisor she's telling me that she is the one. To the point is that on my booking confirmation it says hand luggage is maximum 14 kg for business travellers. My two bags combine a weight of 14.1 kg. Now the staff tell me maximum for domestic business is 10kg (says nothing about that in the email confirmation). I tell her about the email and she acts cocky (like i'm lying). Now when showing her she claims that that's only valid for international travel. Then I ask how I could possibly know that when it says 14kg on my domestic confirmation. Her answer is that everything is clear. We were already paying for 60kg check-in luggage for two people. They had us reorganize our packing over 4kg claiming it's for security reasons. Then what they are saying is that it's more secure with 14 kg on international flights and that most airlines in the world flying A320s isn't safe enough as they are not applying these ridiculous rules.

Very rude in approaching customers, even though we are all waiting back an hour for their delayed plane. Not worth saving the extra $50 to go budget airline.

On this flight from Sydney to Denpasar, food offerings were meagre and among the worst airline meals I've had in over 30 years of frequent flying. Service was poor: e.g. Items not cleared in a timely manner: I ended taking my items to the galley myself (and saw other pax doing likewise). IFE selection is also paltry. And not that anyone else probably cares, but the Classical Music audio selection should be re-named ""Easy Listening"". My dessert choice was unavailable as well: a first-world problem I know. But when paying A$2400 for a ""max bundle"" fare one might be excused for expecting better. No priority tagging of luggage is on offer, so I also endured 40 minute wait for bag at DPS (and also on return to SYD).

Our return flight back to Auckland from Rarotonga had been cancelled and Jetstar gave us the wrong information for our recovery flight leading us to miss it completely. They have taken no accountability for this lack of communication that shouldn't be an issue in the first place for any reputable airlines (or business) and have never apologised for their error. There was a group of 30-40 of us who missed our flights because we weren't given the correct info. Who is running this? This whole ordeal has been very frustrating and stressful and have received no sufficient help or support from Jetstar throughout this whole process.

After having previously tried to ensure that my baggage met the requirements and was within the size allowed for carry on luggage, I proceed straight through check-in not believing my carry on to be problematic. However, at the gate the airline staff weigh your baggage to ensure you meet the 7 kg weight requirement. I would understand this policy for excessively sized pieces, however, my bag came in at 8 kg and as a result of this occurring at the gate was forced to pay $60 for this bag that was 1 kg over the weight limit. This is clearly a penny-pinching method. Had the fee been appropriate for the additional weight carried I'd have had no problem. However, by this point I'd paid just as much as a Virgin or Qantas flight where this sort of penny-pinching isn't experienced.

There was a very restricted choice of movies and music. I wasn't even able to access the music . When I mentioned this to one of the staff he said he'd check. I heard nothing more.

As most people that fly with mountain bikes know, they typically come in around 23kg if packed in a commercial bike bag. Most airlines have at least a 23kg weight allowance and typically don't apply any oversize changes to sporting goods. I have flown overseas and intestate with Qantas, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Air Canada with a bike bag weighing between 23 and 24kg when packed and never once had an issue having it checked as my included bag. It has always without exception been carried under the flight's standard included luggage allowance This all changed when I flew the first (and last time) with Jetstar (on the return leg of a qantas flight) Jetstar only allow 20kg (which if you use a good commercial bike bag and have mountain bike you're almost certainly not going to come in under) AND an oversize bag charge that isn't waived for sporting goods like most airlines. This charge along with their $15 PER Kg charge will add about $70 to your flight each way. They will not take into account that you flew out with their partner airline on the same booking with which can lead to some obvious confusion when you cant come back with the luggage you flew out with. To top it of once they know you're at your weight limit the smell blood and really go in for the kill to make an extra buck. On our return flight the resorted to the utterly stupid level of weighing the wallets/purses you're carrying on board (even if they are not going in the carry on). While I acknowledge the whole ""we need to weigh your wallet and purse"" thing was probably just got someone having a bad day at check in it does go to underline the clear culture is making money from baggage charges however possible that must permeate through the airlines culture.

I understand that Jetstar is a budget airline, and that the best quality of customer service, flight comfort, and safety can’t be expected. However, it’s extremely unreasonable to do carry on baggage weight checks at the gate and not at the check-in outside of security, and then require passengers to pay 60 dollars to check in a bag. Had we been given this option, we would have put more weight into our actual checked luggage that still has extra room in it. Had we been given fair notice of this, then we could have easily gone back out of security and added more to our checked bag. The staff at the gate were extremely rude and not willing to explain why we couldn’t just add our bag to our checked bag weight allowance, or why the bags that people were being forced to check in were all the charged the same price when they were all different sizes and weights. We had a customer service agent rudely address us, and I boarded the plane feeling I’d been robbed. I know that this won’t change any of Jetstars backward policies, but I hope that in the future, Jetstar is more prudent about how it goes about monitoring the weight going onto the plane.

Upon checkin in Cairns I was asked to show an onward ticket which I did not have and was refused the check in. I have travelled a few times to Japan with other airlines and this has never happened. I know the rules, which are 'may refuse'. The rule is meant to avoid suspicious people to get to the destination, be refused entry and sent back, apparently at the airline's expense. This rule is flawed because, upon arrival, the traveler's ticket will not be for that day, it may be up to 3 months in the future. Internet tickets are generally not allowed to be changed or cancelled. But if a ticket can be cancelled (such as 1st class tickets), then the traveller can cancel it straight after checkin anyway. The Jetstar personnel was unsympathetic to the extent of malicious and could have caused me to lose not only my $700 flight, plus the other inconveniences with missing the flight, but also to lose my hotel reservation in Tokyo. But ultimately, it is not just the money, but the unpleasantness of having to deal with their personnel as badly suited to their job as they were.

I was seated in an aisle seat 34G, the Jetstar seats are charcoal leather and are relatively comfortable, however the seat pitch is only 30 inches which makes it a tight squeeze on long haul flights. Jetstar had a credit card only policy on this flight for all on-board purchases which can be problematic for those passengers without a credit card. There was good selection of new release movies, V shows and games on the IFE ($10 onboard or $9 pre booked). There are a few free TV shows available however these were predominantly short 15-20 mins fishing programs from the Top End. There were a reasonable range of snacks, hot food and sandwiches available from the on board menu although priced relatively high. It would be nice to see Vietnamese Beer (Saigon/Hanoi brands) on the beverage menu to add to Jetstars limited selection of beers on-board.

Do the math its cheaper to fly with another airline that offers all. After my flights I'm still being charged for inflight meals the problem is I can't speak to any humans about these false charges that jetstar is taking out from my credit card, you have to email back and forth to get your complaint heard or dealt with.

I wouldn't fly Jetstar, but when I need extra baggage allowance (40 kg's as I sometimes have to travel with a lot of technical equipment for work) it has been a good option in the past. But Jetstar gets worse and worse as an airline year after year. I got the Max Bundle as I thought it would make the flight more comfortable and would reduce the cost of adding 40kg's anyhow. Neither was true. I did not get my upfront seat selection! The upfront area of the aircraft for max bundle is behind a whole section of economy class seats that weren't even available as an up front option with the max bundle. So the whole upfront seat selection is a lie. What else do you get with the Max bundle. One really small bad 'meal'. Apparently a voucher to use on another Jetstar flight if you cancel. I didn't need to, but I can imagine the process is at least as awful as the rest of the booking process. What you don't get with the Max Bundle: A blanket or anything to make the flight more comfortable. Inflight entertainment. All that costs a lot more. You also don't get the seat you book. It also took 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive at the carousel from this Jetstar flight. Conclusion: Don't buy the max bundle on Jetstar, fly economy on a premium carrier like Thai for approximately the same price.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Jetstar must be scratching for revenue - the plane was approx 3/4 full but they weighed everyones hand luggage. I was caught when checking bag in I had even upgraded from carry on to 15 kg - it turns out i could have taken some in my carry-on. They dont even give you any over, then hit me $ 15 per kg.

After being told several time we are leaving in an hour they then at 10 am cancelled the flight and told us to come back same time the next day. We did and it happened all over again. We were told to come back at 10 pm that day to leave. This puts us now delayed 75 hours and on top of that we have to get new connection flight from SYD to DPS putting us at the Sydney airport for 12 more hours. I will never fly Jetstar or Qantas again. Jetstar is owed by Qantas and Qantas had 30 open seats but they said we had to by a new ticket with them and did not offer a discount at all. No help what so ever.

Melbourne to Denpasar. For under $400 return i was quite happy with the service, but if i was paying closer to $600-$800 which these flights sometimes are, my review would be quite different. Seat was fairly comfortable, but narrow even for someone like myself who is under 170cm. I paid the $26 extra and sat in the forward cabin. Apart from a screaming child on both legs, it was fairly tame compared to the creche in the main cabin. I think they should make the forward cabin free of parents carrying infants as it is only 3 rows and you could probably squeeze a bit more money out of me for the privilege. For a bit under 6 hours to Bali and 4.5 hours I was fairly comfortable but would struggle I think for anything longer. Overall you pay for what you get and for the price I am satisfied.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

No issues at all with the flight and the Cabin Manager was fantastic and pleasant. The cheese and ham toastie is a winner for breakfast. I fly Jetstar regularly and never have any issues above what I would have with any other airline (e.g. delays etc).

As I was dropped to airport early had to wait to check my small luggage, 2 hours before, no problem so far. I am walking up and down and up again where you check in and one lady there maybe security, asked if I was ok? I explained that I am waiting to check my bag in, she convinced me that as I have paid for extra baggage I can do it immediately. So I did as to carry it on board, which by the way was not my proffered choice carrying bag with me. So this is where the problem begins I was told that I had to pay extra $60 dollars - obviously I was not happy tried to explain the situation to no avail, what really upset me here the two female staff were so rude never even wanting to listen. I wish someone in  Jetstar will understand this and review your standards and procedures. I flew back to Melbourne with another airline, and may never return to Jetstar, the way I feel now.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I'm on the 4pm flight right now, it's 6.40pm and we just had an announcement of a further 20 min delay. We might be taking off soon. Tonight, I must admit, I was at the end of my tether, and I took them to task during boarding. They threatened to remove me from the flight and the girl was very aggressive about it. I gather this is their system for controlling unhappy customers and it worked. I had to back down quickly or risk being stranded far from home with a child. Disgusted and shaken. It's the 23/5 if you want to see your employee in action Jetstar. Or is this your system?",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

My mum and I were booked on a 3:15 pm flight when we received notification that our flight was cancelled. After contacting Jetstar - the cancellation was apparently due to bad weather. Our travel agent booked us on a 6:15 flight in replacement. Having already booked and paid for transport to the airport for a set time, we went in and decided to just wait the additional time. Not only were there several flights with other airlines (virgin, Qantas & tiger) all leaving at 3pm - going to Sydney (they didn’t seem to be affected by this “bad weather” - the “bad weather” that was non existent !!) but they were all running on time and had no issues flying out. After checking out bags in - we were informed that the flight, was delayed. After a day full of screw ups from Jetstar, arriving home at 10pm - with work the next day, it’s safe to say, we are both unimpressed.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

By far the best cheap travel airline I’ve ever been on. Not really any help at Melbourne. Self check in and the odd couple of Jetstar people walking around. We checked in online so we just bag dropped our bags. A bit of a wait at boarding but I guess that’s cheap travel for you. Me and my family had starter plus so $30 (Australian money) on food, drink ect. Legroom a bit little but it was a short flight to be fair. No TVs on the domestic flights but if you fly international with Jetstar you’ll have TVs. Again, very good flight with Jetstar.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

Our flight got cancelled last minute while we were waiting to check in at the airport at noon. They only had a flight next day early morning. We were offered zero compensation, transportation and no accomodation. Staff very careless about it only excuses and stating ""it happens all the time"". It doesn't stop there - next day flight they put on 6.30 am we arrived several hours before and while checking in this was flight delayed again till 9am. Again no notification prior. So we've missed 2 days of our 5 day vacation, no compensation and no proper notifications so we could make other arrangments. Oh and they dont even include a bag for international flight either! (charged $75 for checking in 15kg bag!)  We've lost not only that but all the headache and expense of unrefundable hotels, activities and rental car, all because Jetstar didnt notify us before, cancels and delays flights last minute.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,1.0,4.0,3.0,no,Sydney to Queenstown,3.0," |  Paid for the package including hold baggage, a meal on the flight and the pre-selected seats. We selected the meal online but on the flight we were given a different meal and told ""This is the meal you selected, all passengers with that package get the same meal"". I didn't even try the provided sandwich. I knew I wouldn't like it and it looked terrible. Another in our party tried it and said it was awful. Also tried to upgrade baggage beforehand but the site wouldn't accept either of my bank cards. I believe it was because I was on mobile but they told me their site works on mobile and it was a problem with my card. Two cards failed to work and one notifies me if the payment is declined so I know there was no problem on my side. Luckily, I left the option on as unpaid so wasn't charged extra at the airport. They didn't tell me this was an option while I was on the live chat with them though. An on the subject of the live chat, anything typed into the box, even if you don't press send, is sent to the agent. They only record messages which are ""sent"" which can mean accidental pastes are sent (perhaps a password for example?) and they have no record that their employee received it. Also, if you want a copy of everything said in the chat, you have to speak to a different team. This is basic functionality available in most live chat services. I contacted them with a complaint. The first response was just excuses and the offer of a voucher which can only be used by me and expires in 6 months. I live in the UK so completely useless. I contacted them again and they said they had forward some of my comments on to the development team around the live chat but nothing was said about the meal or voucher. The only positive things I can think of is the we made it to our destination and the ground staff at Sydney were helpful.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,3.0,May 2018,4.0,2.0,nan,no,Sydney to Melbourne Avalon,2.0," |  Sydney to Melbourne Avalon. First, the good part. The aircraft was in OK condition, my seat was bearable for a one hour flight, Jetstar got me to my destination on time and my bag arrived on the baggage carousel. But it's very difficult to travel on this airline without thinking that they take every opportunity to shakedown their customers. In the departure lounge, I witnessed people being asked for more money for their carry-on. Thanks to other posters on this site, I knew in advance to check in my bag (which other airlines accept as carry-one without question), so it didn't affect me personally. I had bought a starter-plus bundle, which at the time of purchase was claimed to offer standard seat allocation, a baggage allowance, frequent flyer points, and a snack. When I received the itinerary, there was no mention of the snack. Equally, when I received the boarding pass, there was no mention of the snack, either, but there was a four digit code, so I asked a crew member at checkin what the four digit code was and she replied that it was because I had paid to have my seat allocated in advance (seat allocation is part of the starter-plus bundle). When the cabin crew were promoting the sale of snacks and drinks, they said that they would accept Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, but they said nothing about people who had bought the starter-plus bundle. When the crew member serving snacks got to my seat, I showed her the boarding pass and asked her if it entitled me to a snack. Yes, she said, your choice up to $10. Why don't they print this on the boarding pass and announce it when about to serve snacks? I nearly went without – I thought I must have got the wrong idea about what was included in the starter-plus bundle. I can't help but get the feeling the airline wanted me (and other starter-plus customers) to forget the fact that the bundle includes a snack. No doubt it's more profitable if people pay for a second time, or go without, as I nearly did. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth but, like the shakedown in the departure gate, seems typical of this airline, which only seems to care about opportunities for more money.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

The outbound flight was on an older aircraft, seats were less comfortable and more cramped. The Crew on this journey were very cold, not Customer orientated in any way. I understand Jetstar is LCC, but as a business that deals directly with the public you would expect a certain standard plus being part of the Qantas Group should give you an advantage. The return flight was more up to scratch, the cabin was refurbished with a better hard product, and the Crew even remembered that I had a $10 voucher to use onboard. I think the service is very much hit and miss with LCC, my advice is to book with Jetstar for leisure with flexibility in minds, rather then for business.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

On May 31st (USA time) our flight from Honolulu-Sydney at 8:30am was cancelled. We have been at the airport since 5:30am, at first they said there's technical issues & flight will be delayed by 1 hour then they turned around and said its cancelled, next flight will be the next morning. After waiting several hrs we were given an $8 voucher for snacks at the airport ($8 can barely buy you a snack) but had to wait couple of hrs at baggage claim for our bags. Then they announced our flight will be at 11:45pm that day. There was no speaker system, everyone had to ask others what they are announcing as we couldn't hear a thing. They told us they are organising us hotels & shuttle buses. There were hundreds of us waiting outside for the shuttle. I decided to uber it to the airport which was just down the road (could have walked there) only to arrive and be told we have to wait til 3pm for checkin. Finally when we got our rooms could only have a few hrs rest before getting a shuttle to another hotel where we got a voucher or dinner. But on arrival there was a long queue of people waiting in line! As if we are not exhausted & over waiting. I left and decided to make my own way to the airport. After checkin & waiting at the gate, it was 11:30pm and boarding hadn't commenced for a 11:45pm flight. By 12:30am we were ready and started leaving, then the plane stopped for a while & they announced we have to return as there is 'another technical difficulty' which was another 1 hr delay. You'd expect after a cancelled flight& wasting our whole Friday that Jetstar would have had all day to do their checks & ensure there are no technical difficulties & plane is 100% safe and functional.
