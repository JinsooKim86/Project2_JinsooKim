Particularly poor was the flight from Mahe to Mumbai. At Mahe airport when we asked for a seat selection, we were rudely turned down. We could see other people standing behind us get the front seats. This was unfair and uncalled for. To top it off on the 4.5 hour flight from Mahe to Mumbai we were not even given blankets. When we asked about the blankets, the cabin crew told us that they had limited supply. Complaints to management fell on deaf years.

Lots of delays,mechanical problems with aircraft. No clear communication what was happening with the engine problems and updates so very stressy for all passengers to make connections. Very outdated aircraft. Problems with boarding pass issuing for many passengers while transiting in Seychelles! Frustrating with inadequate ground staff follow up! Halfway the food service some meals where already out of stock. Super rude check in at Antananarivo Airport. I have a silver frequent flyer card from Etihad which is their partner and normally my allowance was 40 kg. I arrived with a surfboard back and had to take out 8 kg as they said they only allow 32kg. My other bag was already checked in so i had to take it all as carry on.There where laughing and showed no mercy at check in-no humanity.

We took Air Seychelles flight from Mauritius to Mahe - at Mahe airport for our onward flight from mahe to mumbai, when we politely requested to give us seats in the front of the economy - we were rudely turned down. How difficult is it to give 2 tickets in the front where in the tickets that were given to us were in the last and second last row - not even together - really unprofessional, unfair, rude. To top it in the 4 and half hour flight from Mahe to Mumbai we were not given the blankets. When asked about the blankets, the cabin crew told us that they had limited supply and they gave it to seats 6 to 15. The cabin crew did not even come and ask us about disembarkation form.

We had two transfers - Mahe and Mumbai. We were treated like illegal immigrants and forced to stay at the airport overnight because the supervisor on ground in Mahe. We flew from Tana to Mahe. When we arrived Mahe, they refused to issue us boarding passes for our next two connections (Mahe-Mumbai-KTM) because we did not have onward tickets after Nepal. We explained that we are backpackers. We travel by land mostly and plan to cross the border by car from Nepal to India. The supervisor told us she will check and disappeared. When we asked about our flight, she said we still have time and she will not leave us behind. We waited in the airport until 9:10pm when our connection flight to Mumbai was boarding. By that time, we've purchased our onward ticket from KTM to Delhi as we cannot afford to miss the flight. We showed our ticket to one of the staff. The first thing she told us is we cannot boarding our flight because the gate is closed! Then when she phoned the supervisor, who demanded to see our India visa, which was completely irrelevant. We waited there thinking the supervisor will come back to us, but they just let us miss the flight like that! Even after we had all the documents they asked for. In the end, the supervisor never showed up and they did not let us board our flight even though we had the onward tickets. We were dumped in the airport without any explanation. We did not know why we need to show the airline our India visa while we are just flying to Nepal and what should we do for the flights that we've missed. When the supervisor showed up around midnight, she said we will have to wait for the next day to rearrange the tickets and just disappeared again. They tried to send us to a hotel but it was too late, the immigration officer didn't let us pass. Therefore, we were forced to sleep in the airport. The next day we spoke with numerous staff about our issue, including the supervisors and duty managers. None of them helped. In the end, we were able to board the flight that day withy the same documents we had a night before, which means we could've boarded our original flight! ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

A320 / Boeing 777,Economy Class,3.0,July 2016,3.0,1.0,4.0,no,BOM to DAR via NBO,3.0, |  I wanted to bring to your attention the pathetic experience I have recently had flying Air Seychelles and its partner Etihad on the Mumbai-Dar Es Salaam-Mumbai route. I  booked a confirmed Air Seychelles Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Mahe return flights on January 2016 for July 2016. A month later we were informed that Air Seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi. I confirmed with the Mumbai office of Air Seychelles and the flight was confirmed. A week before flying I checked with Etihad online and they informed me that my Abu Dhabi to Dar es Salaam sector was not confirmed. Neither Air Seychelles nor Etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation in spite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in January! If I had not followed up I would have been stranded in Abu Dhabi. The Air Seychelles ground office in Mumbai was equally clueless. Repeated emails from them to Air Seychelles and Etihad (on highest priority I was told) went unanswered. Only after I threatened to take action did they swing into action and book us on Kenya Airways. As a gesture we were informed that a special request for upgrade to Business class has been put but of course as expected there was no record on the system during check in. Also the complimentary chauffeur service from Etihad was not available as the PNR was 'not registered' in the system. The only explanation that I was offered was 'a system glitch'. This is irresponsible of both Air Seychelles and Etihad. I will definitely not be flying either airline. I would rather pay more and go by a more reliable airline like Emirates or Qatar Airways. Both Etihad and Air Seychelles promise a lot but once the money is exchanged forget their responsibility.,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Used Air Seychelles as it was the most direct flight since travelling with 2 young children but now I wished I had travelled via the middle east. Air Seychelles staff arrogant and unfriendly. Asked for food for kids to no avail. Had to get up and fetch it myself. They had loud conversations with their co-workers across the aisle while serving food. Upon arrival to SEZ airport my youngest was sleeping on my shoulder and needed help with hand luggage while going down the stairs to the tarmac. Instead of helping they stood there and watch me like I was their circus act for the night. Thanks to a fellow passenger who came to my rescue!

I asked the stewardess if she could do something - she looked at me as if I had asked her to jump out of the plane and then gave me a cushion to put between me and the broken plug cover. So we had to sit bolt upright in these terrible seats with me having to try not to move or the cushion would fall down.. I have to say I was in tears in the end. I did notice there was another lady in the opposite seats to us and she was in a very distressed was too. Wrote to Air Seychelles hoping for an apology and an explanation as to why they let anyone travel in these most terrible seats. I have not heard a word. Very upset.

nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,CDG-SEZ-CDG. Overall average airline that left me with mixed feelings. Outward flight delayed by 2 hours due to technical failure with chaotic (or no) information given (AF staff and Aeroport de Paris are responsible). Inward flight was on time. Smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight. On both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept (no lie flat no electrical control). IFE is a joke (not on demand personal screens show only two channels) but crew can provide on request some DVD like personal readers with a (limited) choice. 5 movies that are on demand. Aircraft are old but food (choice of international and creole) and wines (1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines) were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts. Unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight. Beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley. Lounges good (but AF at CDG). To sum up decent aircraft with modern cabins are needed and some cabin crew need to improve their attitude.,nan,1.0,nan

Outward flight on time inward flight with 1h delay due to late arrival of plane (from CDG) and slow boarding at SEZ (due to passengers having to walk in heavy rains on the tarmac to reach jet).

My wife and I along with 200 other passengers were held up for 4 hours in the SEZ terminal for SEZ-CDG waiting for passengers to arrive from one of the other islands. The staff were totally incompetent in every way possible. The flight was held up because there was a problem with one of their other planes and Air Seychelles decided to boat them over to SEZ holding us all up. My wife and I missed all of our connecting flights and had to pay significant fees to change all of our tickets to get home 8 hrs later than we were originally planning to. Air Seychelles staff were useless throughout this process. They kept bumping the flight departure time up one hour at a time reassured us that things would be handled (which they weren't) and began to lie to us to keep us quiet. Every request we made to speak to a supervisor was completely dismissed and ignored. Their choice to inconvenience 200+ passengers for so few to cover their airlines obligations is despicable.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LHR-SEZ-LHR for our honeymoon. Flight out was okay - 767-200 aircraft was ancient there were a scattering of CRT monitors showing three films which were difficult to watch without a revolvable head crew inattentive and bored looking. Returning on a 767-300 we were first in the queue for check-in because we we wanted to try to get exit aisle seats which we were told we had been given but when we boarded we found ourselves right in the middle of a section in the middle row. If we'd been told this when we checked in this I'd have understood but we were obviously disappointed to have been lied to. I mentioned our dismay to a crew member who said she would speak to the ground staff and get back to me but she didn't bother. Apparently seats are pre-allocated on the return leg so make sure you try to organise this on the way out. My seat was broken so wouldn't stay in the upright position much to the dismay of the person sitting behind me. There was a projector showing the film which would have been an improvement on the tiny CRTs on the way out but wasn't because the image had massive horizontal stripes running through it and the colours were completely out. The staff were surly and rude and mostly ignored you. I called for service and was responded to two hours later. They stood at the back chatting and you pretty much had to physically grab them in order to get their attention. The plane was knackered one of the films broke and had to be restarted and when the announcements were made the film kept playing so you'd miss chunks of it. The food was awful; the dinner like school leftovers breakfast consisting of grey-egged tortilla and chicken that looked like it had been condemned. The only benefit of Air Seychelles is that the fleet is currently so ancient the seat pitch is fair which I'm sure they'll change because according to the inflight magazine the fleet will be upgraded.. Their staff need some proper training and to learn the importance of customer service. Any decent airline would have sacked most of them by now. Very disappointed.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LHR-SEZ-LHR Economy. Quite simply the worst flights ever. The plane did not offer the level of comfort we have come to expect from other airlines on long haul flights. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped and could do with reupholstering. IFE is of the old fashioned type with screens in the middle of the cabin. Film choice limited. We were sitting in window seats and because of the angle the screen took on a green/yellow hue. The cabin crew were bordering on hostile (both legs) and passengers were made to feel like they were an inconvenience. On the return leg one member of the cabin crew dropped a full food tray onto a passenger. She did not say anything at all to him and offered no apology (but she did go and get him some tissues for him to clean up.) ( The outgoing flight was nearly full but the staff managed to put all their belongings onto the back 2 rows that were unoccupied so that they could spread out when they took a break. Passengers were told that they could not use these seats. The staff had a major attitude problem on both legs. The food was virtually inedible. Customer services at Mahe - made a point of visiting the Air Seychelles customer services office to complain about the outgoing flight. On the 3 occasions we visited the office was empty. When we did finally manage to speak a representative they listened to our complaint nodded a lot never offered an apology. The day before we flew home we managed to speak to another Air Seychelles rep who was able to move our seats to the centre aisle and block off the spare seat to give us a little more space which is what we had asked for and was a satisfactory outcome. Still no apology though. They handed out customer satisfaction questionnaires on the return leg. I can't think that they had many favourable reviews judging from what the passengers around us were saying as well. Never again! Not a great start or end to our holiday in a beautiful country. We'd go to the Seychelles again but not with Air Seychelles.,nan,1.0,nan

We feel we should have been informed about this when we first booked and this would have saved us a lot of money. Apart from that we were pleased with the service of Air Seychelles. The service on board was excellent the food was pleasant and the comfort was of a superior class to many other airlines we have flown. Plenty of leg room and as the plane was only half full we were able to have two seats each.

When they served lunch they would serve 3 rows and then start clearing plates from the first row! That is how slow the service was!,nan,3.0,nan

Even though they received the plane last year it has old IFE has limited movies around 8 and few audio channels. Some screens were not working. They will receive another A332 this year wishing will have better IFE. Good experience I would travel with them anytime.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,We were due to fly at 19.30hrs the flight was diverted to Madagascar due to bad weather. We were kept in the terminal until 02.00am. None of the staff knew what was happening. They offered us food vouchers at 00.30hrs the queues for the one food kiosk were so large that it closed before all passengers could get their food. Staff did not give information and were rude. The plane landed from Madagascar about 01.00hrs but they didn't tell us they shipped us off to a hotel at 02.00am. The next day the girl at the desk just put our hand out for my ticket. No apology for the delay no smile. We ended queuing at Mahe for a further 3hours because they were unable to confirm our connections. Once again no-one giving water to passengers we were left like cattle just stood there. I have family in Seychelles but won't be going back until BA return or I'll fly Condor from Frankfurt next time.,nan,1.0,nan

One could leave around 9.20 am same day and arrive around 16.00 hours. Now, with Air Seychelles, one has to leave residence at 11.00 pm to reach destination around 12.20 next day, ie very odd hours. On top of that the transit time in Mahe, is now more than 2 hours. Seychelles has plenty of quality fish, yet the food served on both legs is appalling, only 2 breakfasts. Overall, only the dessert was good. It is preferable to pay partly for the food and obtain better quality.",Family Leisure,2.0,2.0

Re-check in at Johannesburg very slow with long queues, although very pleasant staff. Aircraft showed lack of cosmetic maintenance despite being fairly new such as loose seat pockets. Decent legroom and A330 seating configuration 2-4-2 preferable to Boeing. Service very slow after take off, first hour spent handing out immigration forms. Food was good but drinks, water or wine, in tiny quantities with no offer of refill. No walk around service after meal, although call button was responded to. Reasonable flight but do not be taken in by ""Creole experience"" punted on their website.",Business,3.0,3.0

Friendly staff, but a tiny plane (as it was a 10 minute inter-island flight), so small that I couldn't stand up, but it was clean and new. The flight was smooth, and non-eventful. The seats weren't comfortable, and there were arranged in a two-one layout. The plane's livery needs a mention - it was one of the best I've seen.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
A330,Economy Class,2.0,November 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,JNB to PRI via SEZ,3.0,"Johannesburg to Praslin via Mahe with Air Seychelles. Our flight departure time was at 14h00 and the arrival time in Mahe very close to midnight. From Johannesburg the service was extremely slow as our trays were cleared more than an hour after the service commenced. I will not even comment on the food served as my tray went straight to their exit bin. The departure time from Johannesburg is clearly problematic if one considers the crew on duty had just come from Seychelles and with a turnaround of possibly an hour or less, they must have been on duty from very early morning. It would be interesting to know whether the same crew returns the aircraft or whether there was indeed another crew returning to Seychelles. If a different crew did duty on the return flight then their tardy service is unforgiveable. If the reverse is true, then surely their hours on duty exceeded the norm. For folk travelling from South Africa and seated in the economy class, sleep well the night before your departure. Do not try and extend your seat and then expect the passenger behind you to be happy having a stranger sleeping on their lap - when service starts you have to be asked to please place your seat in the upright position. On our return the menu was just as terrible - fancy being told they do not have the omelette which is first on their very fancy menu card and your choice is frittata or bread pudding for breakfast. The service was better, the crew were well trained but the noise from passengers and children was chronic, we at times wished their was an escape route and a parachute available. We have travelled to many destinations on various flights - longer flights do deserve the extra charges which we willingly pay, but never have we been so delighted to end our flight. Mahe Airport is in serious need of better seating and air conditioning - being the departure point from all the islands. Praslin Airport was cleaner and better equipped.",Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0

The flights were both very empty with no more that 35 passengers on each sector. The flights left on time or even 30 minutes early as we found when leaving Victoria. The crew on both sectors were very friendly and professional. The quality of food was good on all flights and the crew continued to come round with water throughout the night. The entertainment was from Etihad's ebox selection which was very good and had an up to date film television and music selection on demand.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,4.0,We flew JNB to Seychelles on 21 April and back on 1 May 2015. The Cabin was good and the seat comfort very good - not completely lie flat but very close and much more comfortable than Emirates Business Class. Service is what you would expect from Business class. Outward bound trip from Johannesburg was good. Nightmare was on Inbound trip. The flight departure time was 8am but at around 5pm the evening prior to the flight they sent an email out to the travel agents that they have moved the departure time 1 hour earlier. They didn't contact the customers themselves and no one with authority at Air Seychelles was available to talk to. For people on Mahe the 1 hour earlier departure wasn't the end of the world but for people on the outlying islands who relied on a regular ferry service there was no way to make our flight and flights for next 3 days were fully booked. In the end we had to charter a boat to get us to the airport on time we were the lucky ones - others missed their flight completely. It seems that customer service is not something Air Seychelles understands. The flight back was uneventful except that 2 of the seats in business class were out of order and that the cabin staff were extremely noisy talking non stop at high volume throughout the flight. Sleeping wasn't easy but they just didn't care.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,3.0,I fly to Seychelles frequently and unfortunately as a Silver member of Etihad I fly Air Seychelles from Abu Dhabi to Seychelles. The services are terrible. Firstly they talk way too much all those announcements! From fasten your seatbelts to marketing their duty free it is in 3-4 languages. They start in English them French then Creole. Safety info presented in English and Arabic. Fasten seatbelts warning start with Chinese. The whole flight you listen to this nonsense. Entertainment system is very limited food is not great either. The most annoying thing for me is that as a Silver member I have never been able to upgrade with miles. They will not do it at the airport and even the manager on duty does not know how this is done I find it very annoying what is the point of being the frequent flyer then?,nan,2.0,nan
