Boeing 777-300 & A350,Business Class,4.0,July 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Copenhagen to Melbourne via Bangkok ,5.0," | Flew Thai Airways from Copenhagen to Melbourne via Bangkok. Both flights departed on time. 1-2-1 layout on both aircraft. The seats were comfortable and extended into fully flat beds. The mattress was an added bonus that added to the comfort of the 'bed'. The cabin on the first flight (CPH-BKK) was a little too warm. The service was outstanding and the menu choices were extensive and excellent. However, I did not eat the breakfast on the first flight due to a lack of appetite. The A350 was the superior of the two aircraft. It was much newer and it had a more spacious layout with a higher ceiling. It had lower humidity and quieter engine noise. The mood lighting was more relaxing. The free WIFI voucher (for the first 100mb) given out on the A350 (BKK-MEL) proved to be useless as it kept on going round and round in circles. It asked me to keep on logging in to the plane's WIFI even though I was already logged in. I gave up and watched a couple of movies. The IFE on both flights worked well but choices were limited. Overall, two excellent flights and good value for money. The lounge in Bangkok was excellent and the shower was greatly appreciated. I will fly with Thai again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0

Good flight despite a few little problems, Seat and in-flight entertainment good, Food very nice and plenty of choices.

Flight delayed by 55 minutes meaning that I had 15 minutes to transfer (stopover time was 1hr 10 mins). Staff provided false reassurance that everything would be okay and not to worry as next flight to Seoul would be in an hour or two. I had to catch this specific flight so I ran as hard as I could and managed to transfer within 15 mins. The plane shut the door as soon as I got on board and departed. Upon arrival, my baggage was left behind in Bangkok. Next flight was ~9 hours time. The staff in Bangkok provided false information. If I had missed this flight I would have had to spend the night in Bangkok. Bag was suppose to arrive at the place I was residing at 9:00pm (14 hours after arriving in Seoul). Bag did not arrive until 12:30am the next morning. I made a complaint on the day and still have not heard back (2 weeks after the incident).",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I had never flown long-haul before so had some reservations beforehand but I found it a better experience than I expected. I'm fairly tall but I had enough legroom in both planes. The cabin crew were efficient and we got served plenty of food and drink which was of a high quality. In-flight entertainment was good - I watched 5 movies and a number of TV shows. No problems with our baggage either. We had a 2 night stop-over in Bangkok on the return flight and I left my camera on board the plane. When we got back to Perth a couple of days later I phoned the local office of Thai Airways and they could not have been more helpful. They said they could see what they could do to help me recover my camera. They phoned me about a week later saying they were still looking, and then the next day phoned to say they had found it and would I like to pick it up from their Perth office or the airport. I chose the airport and got it back the next day. And I wasn't charged a cent!",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Brisbane - Bangkok No delays, good flight, nice crew, food was ok (had a veggie meal). Other airlines have a better entertainment variety. Toilets were clean. Bangkok - Munich plane was a bit older than the other flight. Crew members who served the area I was sitting, were a bit unfriendly. Asked if I could have a croissant for breakfast as my chosen meal was without (got just a scrambled egg with potatoes that I didn’t eat) after they finished serving all passengers.

Part of the Turkish airlines ticket from Europe to New Zealand, this was quite disappointing. Thai is behind the industry standards when it comes to economy product : old entertainment with poor selection of films and small monitors, catering average with the cheapest plastic, no amenity. Despite not being very old their Boeing 772 look very tired. Cabin crew nice, however some crew quite robotic. A lot of better options now around to choose from. I really had better expectations.

Boeing 787-8 / A330-300,Economy Class,4.0,February 2018,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Brisbane to Phuket via Bangkok,3.0," |  Brisbane to Phuket via Bangkok and back, on Boeing 787 and two on A330. Nice catering with tasty but sometimes too spicy dishes . New & fresh B787 aircraft. Mostly nice crew (3 of 4 flights we had an excellent crew). Generally high quality of service, great business class amenity kits. Nice Bangkok business lounges with great shower experience.  On B787 Thai Airways saved on the video monitors so it is not adjusting to the front seat reclining position. It makes the overnight flight horrible in terms of the entertainment - you can't see the picture good enough. The transit from international to domestic flights in the Bangkok Airport is very crowded, long and disorganized. Inconsistency with crew. On Brisbane-Bangkok-Phuket-Bangkok sectors we had great crews with very attentive flight attendants but on a Bangkok-Brisbane sector crew have been inattentive, not friendly and not trying to be welcoming.",Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0
A380,Business Class,3.0,April 2016,2.0,5.0,4.0,no,BKK to CDG,5.0,"It seems that Thai Airways is experimenting a new way to serve meals in C class between Paris and Bangkok. Instead of using a trolley, each passenger is served their meal individually, and it takes a lot of time to serve 62 passengers. I had to wait 1h 45 after take off to get my first meal. Returning from BKK I decided to get the snack instead of the dinner to avoid waiting. The staff is running, stressed and you can feel it. ",Business,3.0,4.0

A surprise how good Thai Airways are, modern Boeing 777, big IFE screens, better food than EVA and more generous with drink, the stewardesses ensure window blinds are kept firmly down during flight hours. A male steward put my duty free in the fridge. At check-in offered a seat with space to stretch out;, I would say EVA Air marginally beats Thai for leg space and pitch.

The A380 staggered business seats are one of the most comfortable in the sky. Pre departure beverage service was prompt, Vueve in a flute glass. Menus at seats, and was able to postpone service until I had a few hours of sleep. FA was at my seat when I awoke, provided water and inquired if I now wanted to eat. I was then served my meal order from prior to my sleep. Food was very tasty and seasoned. The cabin and restrooms were well maintained.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A380,Business Class,5.0,March 2016,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,LHR to BKK,5.0," |  London to Bangkok return. Having used most Gulf based airlines when flying to and from South East Asia over the past three years, accepting the inevitable transfer time-wait until the next leg, I thought it was time to experience a change. So, for my recent flight from London to Bangkok, I booked with Thai Airways which now operates the A380 – and of course, flies non-stop. Travel to Heathrow by road from my home in Mid Essex, is always a bit of a gamble with regards to allowing sufficient time to arrive. The now ubiquitous delays on the M25 have to be allowed for, which I did on this occasion and reached Terminal 2 just before 0800hrs, for my scheduled departure at 11.50hrs. To my disappointment and surprise when presenting myself at the check-in desk, was being told that the flight would not now depart until around 15.30hrs. 'Late coming in from Bangkok', was the reason. That I had not ben informed of this long delay, was irritating, as my personal contact details were available to them. Putting all this behind me (but not looking forward to waiting around the airport for almost 8 hours) I spent the time as constructively as possible, particularly sending notifications to the Bangkok car airport transfer company, the hotel I'd reserved and the company with whom I had an appointment the following morning. Once on board, it was immediately apparent that the cabin crew were well trained, polite and helpful. The A380 aircraft is a big beast and the internal configuration design is appealing. Long haul flights like this one exceeding 11 hours, are never easy to bear but I have to say that Thai Airways have provided all possible features and amenities to soften this burden. My seat was as good as it gets, the entertainment system worked perfectly with plenty of choice - and all meals served to a good standard. Noticeably, a press of the seat call button produced an immediate appearance of a member of the cabin crew, an occurrence not always experienced when flying with some airlines. The plane actually made up a little time, which meant arrival at Bangkok was three hours behind schedule. So, as to the flight itself, I have no complaints, rather to compliment the professionalism of the crew for making it as comfortable as possible. With my Asian itinerary completed, it was time to return to the UK. On arrival at the Thai Airways desk, I was extremely pleased to be offered a space available cabin upgrade. The return journey is always some hour+ longer than the outward leg, so lounging on a wide seat, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar-covered biscuits, is not to be sneezed at. Such an upgrade was especially welcome, as I had suffered an injury to my left ankle. Once again, I found the crew's performance to be as first class as the cabin and after eating, I extended my seat, snuggled under a blanket and slept for almost six hours. In summary, both flights were seamless and comfortable. They get a ten out of ten from me. Had the Heathrow departure debacle not occurred, the entire experience would have gained the same marks.",Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0

We landed 4.10pm, our connection was due to leave 4.25pm. There were no ground staff holding signs about our connecting flight and after 15 mins running through the airport with young family we arrive at departure gate to find it had departed. We were told no compensation was due as flight TG671 was delayed by fog on take off. It was a sunny morning in Sapporo when we took off - not a hint of fog. After 3 hrs we caught a later flight back to Singapore that was 40 mins late into Singapore. Thai Airways have a lack of organisation and information at Bangkok terminal. ",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

The interior of the cabin is clean and reasonably quiet although the flight was nearly full. All is well except the lunch which is spicy stir-fried chicken with basil leaves and fried egg. For the Thais, this menu is a very common fast food you can find almost anywhere in food stalls or even in some restaurants. But for this flight meal, it is neither what you expect nor authentic.

All is fine and near perfect except for a few issues for improvement. The IFE on my seat 15J is quite annoying since its volume always becomes louder after each inflight announcement by the crew and I had to adjust it every time after each announcement. Also, my wife's request for an additional pillow was turned down with a reason that it is a full flight and there is no spare pillow! The outbound Bangkok to Sapporo TG670 on 2nd May was perfect with attentive and professional crew. Thanks.

The return flight from Beijing to Colombo was a pleasant experience. Good legroom and unlike the previous flights the crew were very friendly and helpful. The food was again great with a traditional Thai mango dessert which was delicious. The only drawback was the IFE as It didn't have enough options to choose from.

If there is only one gripe, it's that both flights were parked on the tarmac instead of aero-bridge, we had to be bussed. Being back in their home base, this is quite a bad surprise. If in rainy weather, it could be quite troublesome. I feel this is their way of cutting costs here and there.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

For each sector of the coach cabin they have a seperate cabin crew serving the sector. So after 1hour 15minutes after take off the trays were cleared. Some other airlines did not start service until than. Seat is comfortable with enough width (I am 186cm tall) and more recline than other airlines. The inflight entertainment could offer more German videos on this route perhaps too much for the Asian taste. Breakfast was also served very fast. After some waiting time at immigration in Thailand the bags were on the belt. In general nothing to complain. Almost same experience on the way back so I would certainly recommend this airline to South East Asia. Would also mention that both flight departed on time.

The lounge staff greeted us in typical Thai hospitality and offered a selection of breakfast items from an i-pad menu. We also had one hour free usage of spa services which was excellent. the flight was slightly delayed and the pilot kept us informed. However the inflight service was very disappointing for First Class. A very limited menu for a 6 hour flight and they ran out of choices very soon. Something which should not happen in First really. Crew were ever so gracious but that does not serve it purpose really. Seats are comfortable and the amenity bag was very good.

The seats and cabin was very clean, all the items where in the seat pouch along with the Thai magazine. I  reclined my seat and stayed asleep from the edge of Thailand till we entered Russian airspace. This meant that the cabin crew did not wake or disturb anyone, and the seats were very comfortable. The IFE movies were an OK selection. The IFE map was also standard. The food on the way to Thailand was tasty, I had chicken with fried rice, it was excellent! I tried a fruit platter on the way home and the fruit was a little dry however, but the croissant made up for it.

All crew members, but especially the crew director on the Upper Deck, did the Extra Mile for every passenger and always with a great and genuine Thai Smile.

Although we could have saved money by taking the same route on Bangkok Airways, we chose Thai for its reputation and service record. A few months after we booked our tickets, Thai discontinued their flights from Bangkok to Luang Prabang, our destination. Yet remarkably, although the airline reached us easily via email and had all our contact numbers upon our initial purchase, no one from the airline contacted us when the flight from BKK to LPQ was discontinued. When we checked in at the airport in Phnom Penh for the first leg of our trip (TG 581), and we asked for boarding passes through to LPQ, both the check-in agent and her manager simply shrugged and said they were ""not available.” Arriving into BKK and looking for the now-disappeared TG 576, we were grateful to be handled by an admirably competent Transfer Desk Agent who spent half an hour rebooking us onto a later Bangkok Airways flight. She was the only bright light in an otherwise poor Thai Airways experience. We arrived late into LPG and poorer for having overspent on tickets with an airline that wasn't concerned about honoring them by keeping us informed.

Flew Thai Airways instead of taking a flight in business class with a connection because of my schedule requirement. Took the risk of flying economy class. Instead, I have never been more happy in economy before. At check in, the staff was nice and fast but seemed inexperienced. But that's just a small problem in an amazing flight. I reserved a seat during check in which was a window seat with my mum, but I found out there was no window and immediately complained to the purser who sorted out the problem as soon as the flight was boarded. The seat was really comfortable seats with a PTV and footrests. The 34' legroom is excellent, no need for an exit row. The plane was delayed due to a door fault, but the purser kept us informed. The food was plentiful, and above expectations, but was only served one meal and several drink rounds. Instead of having to call a flight attendant for a drink, I was awake so she was able to spot me and asked me what drink I wanted. I enjoyed every moment of this flight. Attentive crew doing drink rounds every half hour, and a comfortable (enough) flight. Much above expectations. However, my mum's bag arrived when the business class bags arrived, but my bag arrived almost twenty minutes later! Still, doesn't bother me that much. If you want to fly cheap and still get good service, fly Thai. All the flight attendants were professional.

They have had nothing but my respect for the quality of service provided, friendliness and excellent flying experience. On this past trip I flew with them from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and then Chiang Mai to Bangkok and on to Seoul. On August 26 the flight was delayed leaving Chiang Mai by 10 minutes. The connection time in Bangkok was only scheduled to be 1 hour which made the connection tight and tighter with the delay. Upon arriving in Bangkok there was a line up for transit security however it moved along fairly well. Because of the delay I boarded with everyone else and that was no a problem for me. As I was seated one of the flight attendants was clearly not amused or friendly that I had not been seated before. That Thai friendliness and welcome was not there. A few minutes later as we were taxing for take off the youngest of the flight attendants in business aggressively and rudely barged in to the space in front of my seat and grabbed pillows and rudely announced that they were going in the overhead bin. I have never experienced such rudeness from one of the Thai flight attendants before. This same flight attendant repeated her performance prior to landing in Seoul. I coupled that with the lack of welcome and friendliness upon being seated and it was not the greatest of experiences with Thai this time on that flight. If they were not pleased with the tight connection and my inability to be earlier to my seat, then they should take that up with their airline and not blame me. As for the other flight attendant with the rudeness, she needs to be more familiar with appropriate etiquette. The quality of food, cleanliness of the aircraft were of the same very high quality that I have come to know and appreciate with Thai. Hopefully those 2 flight attendants will not be on my next flight. I can only give a 6 on this rating because of those two persons.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

The lounge prior to boarding in the A concourse was looking scuffed and it was crowded, food was not great but coffee and fruit were fine. Delays at the gate as well but so far was still in reasonable spirits. The A380 seats aren't the best but at east all offer aisle access. In the air the meals were reversed with breakfast first given the delay this was now a day flight instead of a night one. Crew were unresponsive and glum looking. Breakfast was very overcooked, had to ask for everything including missing cutlery. Two cracked and chipped glasses offered, one badly cracked showed lack of care and any inspection. They were genuinely apologetic when this was pointed out but this was a rare show of passenger focus. Did not see crew at all during the majority of the flight for any period of time between meals, water was replenished once. Dinner was not heated at all and asked for it to be reheated as it was inedible. No pre-dinner drinks, offered one drink with dinner, never saw any offer of any top ups in cabin to any other passengers. Not offered water with dinner. Drinks were replenished on request. In general I felt that you had to ask for everything, there was no anticipation of passenger need. We wanted the flight to be over as quickly as possible, an unusual response to business class. I wondered if the feeling of grief over the recent loss of their King may have had an impact. Would still recommend Thai and hope that our next flights are better with them.",Business,2.0,nan

Boarding was organised very well at LHR and once onboard, staff were friendly, attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The aircraft was clean and presentable. Service was great, food was enjoyable and drinks were offered regularly. After an enjoyable 12 hour flight, we stopped in Bangkok where we waited for our connecting flight to Phuket. We boarded an old B777, the aircraft was dirty and needed a good deep clean. The flight was only 1 hour, and the crew did a good job serving everyone a snack and a few drinks before clearing away rubbish within the one hour flight. So far, a good experience with Thai Airways. On our return flight to LHR, we boarded a cleaner A330 aircraft to Bangkok. The crew on this part of our journey back home weren't so friendly, having been cabin crew myself for many years I believe it's important to be friendly and approachable when working in a customer service role. Boarding the A380 at Bangkok for our return flight to LHR was a pleasant experience, we were upgraded to emergency exit seats at check in due to my partner being 6ft 6 which was very nice of the agent. I was flabbergasted to find that the crew moved a family of six which included three young children under 5 into the emergency exit seats next to us, who were nothing but disturbing for at least 6 hours of the flight home. The adults could not control their young children! This family even had the cheek to moan about the cabin crew, who may have been slightly miserable but were still working hard to serve everyone as quick as possible. Many people were disturbed by this family, and I was disappointed as they could have moved this family elsewhere into other empty seats towards the rear, other airlines do not allow under 16s into exit seats due to emergency reasons so I was extremely surprised to learn Thai Airways have different rules. Other than the disturbances, I would entirely recommend Thai Airways especially if you will be flying on their amazing A380!",Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0

Also we experienced a rude steward who was unprofessional with a number of passengers including us (like serving with a glum face and shoving foods etc. At least 6 passengers complained about his behaviour.

I realize that cabin staff can have a bad day and the crew were efficient but it wasn't what I remember Thai airways service to be. But my biggest disappointment was the food.

On this return flight, the stewardess made as little eye contact as possible, was churlish and off hand, to the extent of being rude. The meals were adequate, but lukewarm, and during this long flight no additional drinks were offered. If I went up to the galley I was shooed out, and the requested drink would eventually be delivered. If I attenpted to order via the call button, the response just as unfriendly. This attitude was prevalent throughout the cabin crew, from thr CSD down. The choice of film and tv very limited to anything recent. A very poor selection. Seats were comfortable, and information from flight deck good. Check in efficient. Upon return, however, my soft sided case was wet inside, and had obviously been left uncovered in the rain at Bangkok. ",Business,1.0,1.0

Started the journey off on its subsidiary airline Thai Smile in Penang where the boarding pass provided was nothing different than a restaurant receipt, the ground staff said the new system has yet arrived in Penang, hence they could not reprint the boarding pass. As Flew in Smile Plus, no difference between normal seats except being seperated by a curtain with the rest of the seat. Upon arrival at Bangkok, I went to the Royal Orchid Spa for my free massage, it was very good. The only downside is that it was only 30 minutes, you should add more ground services for business class passengers. Next, was the Royal Silk Lounge, it was average, buffet food. It was disappointing to be honest, I expected more from an international business class lounge. In flight, the cabin crew was friendly and helpful. Probably one of the airline with the best cabin crew. The food was very good, and in flight snacks as well. The seat was very good as well as the Amenity kit.

Slow boarding as the plane waited on a group of late arrivers on a transit flight - no announcement or apology made and we arrived one hour late.

I queued for about 20 mins for check-in but once at the counter, the check-in process was efficient and staff courteous and professional. Boarding did not start until very close to the departure time but it was orderly. The crew welcomed the passengers on board,  offered a small pack of nuts once the seatbelt sign was off. The cabin crew change into their traditional Thai attire after take-off. The flight was probably around 60% full so there was ample space for passengers to spread out. I was initially seated in seat 62C which is the first row of 3 seaters behind 2 rows of 2 seaters so I had ample leg room ahead, As the row next to me was fully empty, I asked a cabin crew if I could move over and promptly did so when I received the go-ahead. 2 options were offered for meals and I picked the pork option. When compared with the catering coming out of Bangkok, the food from Bangkok does seems better.  In the flight out of Bangkok, two gentlemen seated near me (who seem to be first time flyers) did not realise that vegetarian options had to be pre-ordered and opted to go without food. The cabin crew then went out of his way to locate non-meat options for the 2 gentlemen. The seats are comfortable with a decent recline. There is a good selection of movies and TV shows to choose which, together with the food and friendly service, makes for a very comfortable flight.",Business,4.0,nan

First leg service was just excellent as on the way out from Europe aside from typical delays of coming into a congested airport like Bangkok. The Thai crew in stormy conditions managed to service everyone multiple times on a fully loaded flight, I was dreading the late night double leg flights home but my sensitive sleeping wife cat napped on the short leg and then due to a departing ahead of time settled down after a well served meal for the long haul home. She slept near 10 hours on what was bump free journey landing back ahead of time into Zaventem something never achieved with Brussels Airlines, United Airlines or British Airways night flights. This was my first Thai Airways experience but after flying with big American and European carriers this was something special with their 777-300ER out and back and with one leg of four flights on the one month old A350. It is clear this is an airline in transition with a new fleet coming in and our luck being we that we had all our flights on planes of just a couple of years old. I am now seriously tempted to fly Thai Airways to New Zealand on the next long haul as inflight entertainment and service was very good. This said three things Thai could simply fix to move in my book from Very Good to Excellent. Bringing a fully loaded 777 into a hard standing and using buses instead on to the terminal should not happen, we were lucky at end of rainy season but I dread to think what could have been if the tropical sky's had opened up. If you fly into Francophone countries you should have either copies of the film with French sound track or at least French subtitles, my Wife being French speaking Belgian was lucky to know English well. Your mild chicken is not mild, it was hotter than dishes served up in restaurants of the same this meal blew both us away and could not be consumed on one flight. This all said the crews on both legs could not do enough for us and for sure will I return to Thailand but I will also consider using Bangkok for any future South East Asia journeys.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

My main concern is the number of times I have to be bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and vice versa. For Thailand's flagship airline, this is a poor practice. Not withstanding the safety issues of passengers having to disembark via steps with luggage, it is a very cheap approach to what should be a much more pleasant experience. None of the crew or ground staff have a positive response to any questioning about this practice, but it certainly seems to tick off a lot of people, unfortunately not enough people complain about it and simply accept it.",Business,2.0,nan

All flights were on-time or nearly on-time and the cabin service on all sectors was of a high standard, but there is room for improvement in other areas. The cabin interiors seemed a little bit tired and worn out, especially on the 777, with the seat upholster being damaged and screens out of date and not working properly. I ordered a gluten-free (GF) meal but regretted the choice, as they seemed to have also removed almost everything else from the meal in the process, only giving me a bland piece of chicken with tasteless steamed vegetables. The normal meal looked much nicer and was incidentally GF anyway (rice and Thai curry). I cancelled the GF meal for the return journey and just substituted their bread with my own GF bread. It also seems a little strange and annoying that Thailand's flag carrier does not have adequate gate access at Bangkok airport, and so all of the flights involved bussing to and from the planes, which were parked very far away. Upon arrival in Melbourne I noticed that my bag had been opened and the zips broken. I lodged a complaint at the Melbourne luggage desk and after following it up just once, they ended up sending me a brand new suitcase in time for my return journey. I was quite satisfied with this response to my complaint. Even though I had a dis-functional screen on one sector, I was mostly satisfied with the entertainment overall system. The only other issue was the seat comfort. I really think this could be improved, as there was an entertainment system processing box under the seat of the 777 and the seats on the A330 felt like I was always sliding off them. Overall it was a decent product for the price, but they could especially improve on seat and cabin quality.

I had high expectations for Thai Airways in the Star Alliance group, but failed so miserably. On all four flights, the boarding time was not as printed on the boarding pass. All of them boarded at the departure time or later, and one flight was delayed because of technical reasons. I booked from Thai Airways website, and because the amount was over 10M rupiah, I had to come into the sales office in Jakarta to pay in person. Because my transit time was 18 hours, I received transport and accommodation in Bangkok, but even that I had to request and no details were given on the transportation procedures. At the Indra Regent hotel they didnt provide breakfast, despite Thai Airways saying that breakfast was on their account. When I asked Thai Airways to clarify this with the hotel, they said it's on the hotel. The entertainment system/screens were very old and dated, resolution wasn't good. The headphones jack didn't work on one side, and the magazine pocket wasn't fixed properly so the magazines kept on falling. After the meal service, picking up the trays took very long, and on one of the flights I had to call the attendants to pick mine up because they skipped me. Attendants weren't friendly. To have a blanket I needed to ask, not on every seat. Checking in at Dubai was the worst. Line was so long. Local staff had no customer service skills.

The worst part, and something that always seems to happen on Thai flights that arrive late in the day - the plane was parked way out in the airfield, leaving passengers to climb down a set of stairs and take a very long bus ride to the terminal.  Our bags were then delayed meaning that I had to wait a whole hour after the flight had landed for our bags to arrive on the carousel. I asked the ground staff why, given that Thai is the national flag carrier, aircraft that arrive in the evening are not parked at the terminal, for the convenience of their customers.

Thai Airways offered much better service compared to my previous journey. The counter was big enough to take all of the passengers swiftly. However, the problem occurred after half of the check-in counter closed, in order to take Uni Air passengers. Large group of travellers were forced to go around and line up again. It was not understandable how they had 3 special checkin counters where few people used (Crew only, Internet checkin, and Business class/SA Gold card holders), and had 2 common economy class checkin counters where everybody used. After the bad start at check-in, we had to run in order to make it to the gate, as Incheon was crowded at that time. Onboard, the cabin looked very clean and new. The seat width felt little bit small for me with heavy lady seating alongside me, but seat pitch was acceptable; it felt same with other airlines in my seat. I moved my seat for the second leg of the flight, as there was an empty seat. I moved to a window side seat, and the seat width felt very nice to me. However,  there is a metal box under the seat in front of you, which restricted me to stretch out both legs (which was possible in some degrees in my previous seat).  Cabin staff service, I couldn't find flaw in their service. They were willing to help, and cared about passenger safety. They were there to help passengers to put up their carry on items to overhead bins, which must have been hard for them, as the flight was almost full. I am impressed with cabin crew service. In this flight, I never knew that I could stuff in 2 meals in such short time period (6:30 hours?). Their food quantity was just right, and food quality was nice. However, in both of my flight, as a passenger seating in front side cabin, I was forced to choose the meal that I did not want. Once, when I asked cabin crew if they have another meal that I could eat, they brought me business-class food for me, which was obviously very pleasing, and nice of them.  I would love to give TG 5 star rating on food, but I can't, as some meal options was unavailable. IFE was quite nice; it takes a little bit of time to get used to, but once you get used to it, it will work dandily. I really liked how they had traveling information about big cities such as Bangkok, Seoul, Tokyo, and more. But their variety of Music/Movie/TV Shows could be improved in the future.

They were smiling, and was willing to help, but the part where they just watched at the passengers getting up shortly after landing (When seatbelt sign was on) was pretty disappointing. A330-300 was better because I could actually go to sleep. After landing at HKG, we was asked to deplane and get on a another A330, and ground crew messed up again. One TG ground crew at the gate told us to go to certain gate. We found that there was no plane at all! We then asked another ground crew (Who was working for HKG airport this time,) She told me to walk about 6 minutes to get to our plane. We had to rush to catch up to our plane, and HKG ground staff was correct. A330 to HKG to ICN felt the same. In this flight, I tried using Wi-Fi, hoping for any free internet usage, but it was paid service. Personally, their IFE was terrible for me.  Despite the negatives, I saw lots of positives on this flight though. Cabin crews were very nice to me and my family, and were always there to help me. IFE's hardware of A333 was pretty impressive, or actually better than SQ's one, since TG's IFE offered touch screen!  Food was very nice; one of the most delicious plane food I've ever eaten.  Not the best, but not the worst either.",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

I had a very enjoyable flight with Thai Airways from Manila to Frankfurt.

All flights were on time and the transit in Bangkok was easy and smooth.

Smooth check in at Manila Airport. I recommend doing your check in online to save time as they have a special lane for people who did online check in. Both flights were smooth and well fed. Cabin crews are friendlier and more helpful compared to other five star airlines I have flown. Soon after take off, passengers were given nuts and drinks and then a proper meal. Thai cuisine is delicious and their desserts. Pleased with the seats as they have more generous leg room and inflight entertainment was plentiful to choose from. I highly recommend Thai Airways.

They have an own check-in area and security for Thai Royal Silk passengers. But the lounge was disappointing, there was a small selection and the ambience was not really nice: dark and a bit dated. The boarding on to the plane was one of the best in my opinion. In the plane the seat offered enough legroom and as soon as I settled in to my seat the crew offered me champagne along with nuts and she also hang my jacket. There was a basic and functional amenity kit, together with a cozy blanket and pillow. After takeoff food was offered, but it was a bit disappointing. The crew forgot my wine for dinner and a coffee at breakfast, at breakfast they gave me the wrong option, don't know if they forgot or not, or they ran out of the other option.  After landing the deboarding was a bit of a mess, since all economy passengers ran in to Business. I would recommend to close the curtain while deboarding, so that this cannot happen. All in all it was enjoyable but I think Thai should fix this point to deliver even better.",Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0

For the price they were ok, half the price of Cathay Pacific. Plane at present seems to leave late every day and arrival between 15 and 30 mins late.

The seat reservation procedure at Thai Airways is not understood, and no staff is aware or able to explain it. Before our flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt at 23:40, we checked in in Phuket at 15:30 and asked for an exit row seat or another seat by the window. It was not possible because of reasons we were not told, we were asked to check once again in Bangkok upon arrival. We did it which was still 5 hours before boarding, so not even check in counter for the flight was open, but we were told flight was full and no reservation can be done. We were asked to talk to flight manager who was supposed to be there 2 hours before boarding but ended up in last 15 minutes. All in all, despite being at airport several hours before, we could not get an exit row which should be based on certain physical restrictions. So somehow Thai Airways reserves these seats to people without seeing them! Anyway, we started our trip with this frustration. Then wrote an email to Thai airways about it but received no feedback.

When I eventually reached the check-in desk, I asked for my bags to be checked through to the onward destination, told this was not possible as it was not with the same airline. News to me as I have done this numerous times, if airlines are codeshare or in the same alliance etc. Check in staff are not interested in giving customer service so why airlines use this facility is beyond me. Boarding chaotic, no sign, no announcement just a woman shouting who could board over a full A380 flight, resulted in every-one boarding at the same time as passengers were asking each other what was happening. Aircraft was the high standard of the A380 – good leg room, touch screen, OK recline with good menu and quality of good. Staff had an appalling attitude, they did not hide the fact that they would rather be doing other things than providing customer service on this flight

However being a return trip to Sydney from Thailand in Holiday season choices were limited. My original booking was in economy although most times I use business (Christmas holiday pricing again) but I intended to try for a paid standby upgrade at the airport for this return flight, which I was offered. To my surprise Thai Airways have now increased the upgrade cost by around 30 - 35% and is now very poor value and not recommended for anyone that may be considering it. The aircraft was an elderly 747-400 which was showing it's age. The business class seats (upstairs) were angled lie flat, very worn with faded upholstery. These are the same business seats Thai have used for close on 15 years and are way past their use by date. Considering they are flying Boeing 787's to Brisbane and the new A350 to Melbourne I cannot see why we still have this worn out 747 on Thai's most important Australian market, Sydney. The food service has improved slightly from what I can remember with the food now plated by the flight attendants before serving however they still insist on a totally French wine list where most other airlines offer some Australian or NZ wines on the route. The inflight entertainment is pretty poor with limited choices compared to competitor airlines. The screen size and clarity is also poor due to the age of the system. I will continue to avoid Thai on this route as much as possible as their business class fares are some of the most expensive on the route yet they offer what is, by far, the worst product against their competitors (both direct flights and ones with acceptable transit stopovers).",Business,1.0,nan

On the night flight (BKK to FRA) no decaffeinated coffee was available in the upper economy class galley. It caused major confusion amongst the onboard staff to make decaffeinated coffee readily available. Even a main purser was unable to straighten out this problem.

The person controlling passenger entry to the upper or lower deck entry looked at me and said 'economy?' I said 'first'. I was directed to the right hand aisle and after sorting myself out was offered a drink. Then a person introduced herself as a flight manager and said to ask her about anything. Flight took ages from gate to take off as Heathrow was full. Seat is wide and comfortable but I could always see middle seat passenger whilst seat was in sitting position. Had more Champagne after takeoff with a funny bit of chicken first, followed by a Thai northern sausage, which was hot, but I did not like the cooked egg dish or nuts. The caviar is now served in a controlled portion screw top bottle with plated garnitures and vodka has to be requested. I chose a Thai selection for main course which was extensive. Duck in red curry was not very succulent as I don't think that reheating duck can turn out very well, unless as Confit. Dried shrimp was fiercely hot. Long cooked soft pork was soft. I did not need anything else but the cheese looked nothing special. Red wine was an improvement on anything offered in Thai that I have ever had. Sleeping was not so good. Seat length and width are good. But the seat is hard and segmented, the seat cover and blanket are of poor quality and they could purchase United Polaris pillows rather than the uncomfortable two currently on offer. I was in 1K and the lighting from the front staircase was intrusive. By the way, the bar area at the front of the plane is disused, apart from providing somewhere to sit whilst your bed is being made up.

On my remark that it was verified in KUL airport already, I was advised that their internal system isn't working and they cannot check. I was told to wait. After waiting for 1 hour, I came to the counter, and asked what is going on. A Thai airways representative said he sent Telex to New Zealand immigration, and there's no reply from them. So he cannot put me on the flight unless he gets response from them. He said my visa isn't real and there is something wrong with my passport, that's why there's no feedback. I told him to call the immigration. He said they cannot do overseas calls. Eventually, I called Auckland airport and asked to put me through to immigration. I talked to the immigration officer, who confirmed that it's not the right thing that Thai Airways is doing.

After a quick sleep at the hotel, we arrived back at the airport with transport provided by the airline. Check in took a while due to staff having to rebook us onto the afternoon flight but we were eventually checked in and were on our way.

I tried to tell them I didn't order it but they said ""just wait"" I felt like a child in school being chastised! Same hostess who was supposedly fixing my screen came to me and asked what the problem was. I said I didn't order this may I have a normal meal.

Bangkok to Melbourne late. Entertainment system didn't work on a 9 hr flight, instead of moving us to other seats, the Purser tries to reset, it took nearly two hours for him to fiddle with to no avail, still he doesn't want to move us to other seats, while other passengers are already taking other empty seats prior to taking off. At the end he gave up and suggested to us to move to another two separate seats, why do we need to accept mediocre service? So we refused his offer, he could have done more at the beginning when we told them that he should move us in the first place. Surely they can make a note online or check in that these seats so and so have issues, so passengers don't have to sit on those seats. It wasn't a full flight too. The Purser tries to appease us by offering a bottle of perfume, which I refused, as we only want a working entertainment system that works. While I was sleeping he gave my wife two Business Class amenities - we do not want TG amenities in lieu of non-working entertainment system.

Meal was a choice of chicken curry or fish. I had the chicken curry and it was delicious with rice and crunchy beans. My partner had the fish and he said it was delicious. Soft drinks wine and spirits were offered with the meal service. The wine was ok after one glass decided to stay with ginger ale. Service was professional and smiles all round. Throughout the flight they offered water and juice, later in the flight they offered mango ice blocks, yummy. Toilets were kept clean and fresh, they are good sized toilet on this aircraft 787.

For outgoing and return night flights no socks, slippers, tooth brush / paste or ear plugs given in economy class. Thai Airways seem to be cutting costs on this route at the expense of passenger comfort and yet the flights are usually more expensive than other airlines due to being non stop flights. The meals could be described as average at best. Food and beverage on other airlines I have used are superior to Thai. I am old enough to remember the days when Thai Airways issued all ladies with a complementary Orchid on arrival.

I am a gold card member and would add that I am 6ft and 20st. My main gripe is that since the A340-600 has been introduced the level of service has gone downhill in my opinion due to the increase in seat capacity but same level of staff. The importance seems to be on serving rolls steward comes round numerous times whereas the wine serving is sparse and never served with the meal which is a shame as it is very palatable especially the white. The Thai lounge is much better than the London lounge. Films can vary a lot but in the main tend to be American. Seating at my weight is never going to be that comfortable. Overall I will still fly Thai but please you need to improve the service at least to how it use to be.,nan,3.0,nan

Having flown Thai Airways on long haul flights in the past I had no hesitation in using them again for a shorter flight. Overall the seat in economy is quite possibly the most comfortable economy seat I have had. The flight was only 7 hours due to a quick stop in Taipei but got up from the seat well rested.

Flight slightly delayed and I got bitten by the Changi Airport habit of misinforming people of the start of boarding. Boarding started 30 minutes later than the flashing signs indicated. Boarding was a little bit chaotic and started before an announcement was made. As a Star Alliance Gold member I like being able to board earlier than other passengers. Got a choice of newspapers. Luckily headphones were handed out during the long wait for departure and the entertainment system worked the whole time during landing and take-off. We got the choice between fish-rice and chicken-noodles. I went with the noodles. Easily the best dish I've eaten on a flight (business or economy). A simple dish yes but excellent executed. Service was good with the only remark that the second offering of drinks came from behind and took me and other passengers by surprise. The stewardess was apparently in a hurry. If you ask people if they want another drink please wait for an answer and try not to break the 100m sprint record. But this was the only remark for an otherwise very pleasant flight. Seat comfort was OK (I am 1m 81 tall).,nan,4.0,nan

I will follow up from my previous comments and say it almost seems that their service keeps deteriorating each time you fly with them. 11 days into the month of April and they still have March's inflight entertainment guide. The inflight crew along with the inflight manager were very cold and did not have the charmingly friendly smile. To end the terrible service run they forgot to serve me my meal as well and when brought to their notice was followed by the all too common sorry. If long transit times were not an issue for me I would have stopped flying Thai it is just not worth flying Business Class with them anymore.,nan,3.0,nan

Security agent refused to let me go into check in although I pledged I was flying with Thai. A security supervisor came and intervened and I was allowed to the check in counter. Once at check-in it took the agent over 30 minutes to process! She then refused to give me the boarding pass as she said she could not locate my return ticket. I told her this is because it was a separate ticket to Vietnam and I showed her the e-ticket stored in the phone. It then took her over 10 minutes to clear with somebody on the phone. Once on board the 777 it was usual Thai friendliness and quality. My seat and my neighbour's failed after take off. Cabin crew did not bother fixing it and just asked us to move to other seats as there were plenty empty seats. The television in the 2nd seat did not work and I was moved to yet another seat. Transfer in Bangkok smooth but TG Domestic lounge facilities were basic. BKK-HKT short but the cabin crew managed to serve food and very friendly as well. It is comfortable but all facilities on board or on the ground seem to be old and worn.,nan,5.0,nan

Business Lounge at Melbourne Airport (shared with Air NZ) is tatty and tired with worn dirty carpets and furnishings very poor snack selection and a general air of neglect. Outbound aircraft was a bit tatty and worn too with the customary small and hard business class seats often found on Asian airlines generally and of course they are at an angle even when ""flat"" so unless you strap yourself in firmly you will slowly slide down onto the floor. Inflight service was adequate but rushed and wine top ups had to be requested. Inflight movies and entertainment was excellent with lots of new release movies. Return flight was in a newer cleaner aircraft but the same issues with seat and service applied. Overall I'd rate Thai as ""OK"" but there are better options.",nan,3.0,nan

Very old aircraft's they had one TV in the front which you could not see at all and very bleary. Have a snack before flight on this sector and take some entertainment because you will get very bored.

At check in my travelling companion and I received a warm welcome. I advised the gentleman at check in that I had reserved seats. He checked the system and advised that the adjacent seats were now occupied so he arranged for us to be seated in the row behind where we would be the only occupants in a row of four seats. Lounge was comfortable with an improved range of food including hot choices. Onboard the attendant addressed me by name welcomed me aboard and asked for our dinner / breakfast selection. Only issue with getting dinner before anyone else is that the meal is finished before the wine is served so I asked for wine to come with the dinner which it did. Drinks were plentiful throughout and the new AVOD was good. I did have some concern that the under seat AVOD box might be intrusive but it wasn't. Empty seats allowed us to stretch out and get a reasonable night's sleep. Flight attendants genuinely did their best to ensure a pleasant flight. Hard and soft product equally good.,nan,5.0,nan

I was assigned seat 25K and was surprised to see that the FA drinks station was on the other side of the seat with no partition. It appears that rather than provide a decent work area in the rear of business class Thai have opted to jam in more seats and put the drinks station between the rear toilets and emergency escape door - not very well thought out at all.

Staff very good and attentive but meal surprisingly and disappointingly mediocre. Plenty of drinks rounds and requests met with a smile. AVOD entertainment adequate but not comparable to Qatar Airways. BKK-MNL delayed almost 2 hours awaiting connecting passengers. Flight very full on a tired A330 without any personal entertainment. No air conditioning while waiting and drinks only available on request. Food forgettable and legroom pretty bad.

The inflight entertainment was down due to technical issues and about 35 pax had the same issue with me. The cabin crew and services are fantastic. Meals were okay.

The way back was TG 471 BKK-SYD 26/4/13 I was on the 747-400 again but this aircraft has no personal screens.

From NRT-BKK the service was wonderful - warm attentive and energetic cabin crew made the flight a real pleasure. Drinks were regularly topped up and crew aimed to please.

Only 9 suites now in the 744 nose and each quite private though without the doors of Emirates and Singapore. Gone are the lurid pinks and purples now replaced by wood finish and beige's and neutrals. Very dignified and restful. The new seat is a fully flat bed with good bedding and comfort wear and it was so comfortable and the atmosphere so hushed I slept for much of the leg. Huge HD flat screen promised fine IFE but I settled for a canapé and a glass of Dom Perignon from a gracious FA who reminded me of how service used to be on Thai back in the 1980s.

Slightly angled full recline was not a major issue for me but the short footrest area was as my feet dangled over the end and dragged me ever closer to the floor. IFE is unexceptional and the screen and controls very old fashioned. Food was much lower in standard than economy food on SQ MH or CX. FAs tended toward the sullen some with very poor English indeed.

Flight from Banglore to BKK to HKG was good especially loved the A380 on the BKK-HKG sector. Banglore - BKK flight was good. Seats on A380 were really good and afforded good privacy. The AVOD was not great except on the A380. The business lounge in Banglore was ok but the lounge at BKK was not great even though it is the home of Thai Airways. The business lounge at HKG was the best. The food served on the flights was good and staff were nice and attentive. The worst flight was BKK - Mumbai. The seats were a little better than economy movement was too restricted and the calf support only moved a small distance.If you have to sleep it was a very odd position. The AVOD screen was really small and low resolution. The food served on that flight was also not very good. Overall except for the last flight the experience was good.,nan,3.0,nan

For breakfast they ran out of pancake option half way and did even say sorry to the customers. As we pay for our flights it is the duty of the airline to make sure customers get what they ask for. Otherwise they should not mention that in the menu card. It is very unprofessional to say that they do not have an option which is already mentioned in the menu as an option. Flight attendants were not very attentive. I enjoyed the inflight entertainment programmes. Next time I will think twice before choosing Thai Airways.,nan,2.0,nan

I like the A380 a lot generally and Thai's new Business class product designed for this equipment is a huge improvement over other iterations of Business in the Thai fleet. Unfortunately they have not done away with the lurid purples and pinks but otherwise the staggered 180 degree life flat seating units are excellent. Staggered arrangement gives lots of privacy though window lovers will find that in every second row the main armrest with its storage remote control and reading light etc is between you and the window itself. Nonetheless the whole deal works and works well. The seat is wide enough and long enough though the alcove for one's feet is a little narrow. There is a lot of storage a huge fold down table and a good sized HD screen though the range of IFE selections is Thai's usual humdrum which seems to be much the same as UA's IFE. Cabin service started out very attentive and graceful but after dinner the FAs pretty much disappeared did not answer the call bell and seemed miffed when I poked my head into the galley to ask for water. As for the food well it was as usual with Thai's business class product not good. Interestingly enough the next day I flew with Bangkok Airways on a short domestic hop and the food in coach was way better than Thai's business class dinner on the leg from NRT.,nan,5.0,nan

I didn't like that they didn't have kid-sized headphones for IFE - my tiny 5-year old held hers up to her ears for the whole journey. On the ARN-BKK and BKK-SIN legs there was not much difference between my special meal and the kids' meals. They also did not give the kids any 'goody bags' except for the BKK-SIN leg where they presented my kids with lunchboxes filled with snacks. FAs didn't do their rounds much during the night portion of the BKK-ARN leg they did it more frequently during the ARN-BKK leg though they ran out of the snacks as many passengers were peckish during the night (between dinner and breakfast service).

I enjoyed their in-seat onboard entertainment in particular the big touch screens on the A380. In contrast to other reports I found the service and food offerings good.

Aircraft's are clean and well maintained. The food is OK but nothing special and they have a very limited range of alcohol in Economy Class.

Even in economy the product was impressive with generous seat pitch (34"") on-demand entertainment and a full hot meal service despite the short flight time (less than 2h). Cabin crew were incredibly kind and friendly flight was smooth and landed on time. Immigration was very quick under ten minutes and bags arrived pretty soon.

In both cases placed in upper deck of 747 which was a quiet but pleasant cabin. At BKK it is always a delight to be able to use the Royal Orchid Spa in advance of flying C Class on TG and that proved to be exceptional although the lounges themselves are looking tired. Boarding was reasonably orderly with a warm welcome. The angled lie-flat business class seat was fine for the SYD-BKK afternoon-evening flight as it is comfortable for relaxing reading watching movies and snoozing but found it difficult to get much of a sleep on BKK-SYD between the cabin being too warm and sliding down the seat. Service from cabin crew was friendly and efficient. The meals were adequate although not outstanding. All but one of the main courses and desserts were mediocre but the starters and range of drinks were quite good. Inflight entertainment system had a wide range of movies and reasonable TV and music selections enough to keep me occupied. Only downside was an excessive level of high volume announcements so loud that it is deafening through the headphones. Thai's Business Class is ok but the angled lie-flat seating has had its day and it could do with a bit more effort in quality of catering (certainly the quantity and range of choices were reasonable) which would complement the excellent cabin crew.,nan,3.0,nan

Crew seemed quite excited to be working the A380. Thai Lounges in BKK are a bit tired but plenty of space food and staff on hand and hardly anyone there. The chicken noodle soup is delicious! The final leg BKK-MEL was actually probably the best flight of all 3 - the 777-200 feels very very spacious in the J cabin even though its the same seat as the 747.

Our flight back out of Melbourne was much more enjoyable - better aircraft (777) crew were attentive and smiling and the food was surprisingly very good. I think it's the best meal we've had on Thai. One thing we did notice was that the seats were not as flat as on our outbound flight. Not sure if they have 2 generations of seating or maybe our seats weren't working properly?

The inflight entertainment going was so bad and wouldn't load at all. On the way back there was no inflight entertainment at all. The FA's really didn't appear at all interested in their customer service. After breakfast was served on the return leg the cabin was darkened and the two rows of seats they had reserved by the galley were occupied by the FA's and there they sat talking and giggling for hours. I think Thai needs to perhaps encourage the FA's to provide a little more customer service than they do at the moment.

Flight arrived 20 minutes early which was a bonus and luggage received within minutes. Overall good flight but have come to expect better service from the crew. Inward flight left 20 minutes late which was strange as only 100 passengers on-board. Lots of space to spread out and managed to get 4 seats again which meant some sleep again. Crew were excellent and restored some of our disappointment from the outward flight. Food was good and we received lunch and dinner. Flight landed 25 minutes late in LHR.

After reading the glowing reviews of the First lounge in BKK my expectations were set very high but unfortunately I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's a perfectly nice lounge with extremely attentive service however with the ambient noise from the terminal its not really an oasis of calm and the place looks like it needs a refurb.

nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,1.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,1.0,Traveled BKK-CMB-BKK Business Class on Thai Smile it was like traveling in a shoe box. The most uncomfortable airline I have ever traveled for a 3.5 flight which felt like 6 hours. The stewardesses did their best but the seats were absolutely unacceptable for business class. There were not enough overhead space for the luggage whereby we had to store our luggage in the empty seat between the seats in Business class. Never again Thai Smile. If anyone is ever intending to travel on Thai Smile be prepared for the worst.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Business Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,3.0,Inconsistent service! We travelled outbound London to Bangkok business class on TG911 on 15th January 2014. Throughout the flight the service was second to none and we had thought Thai had really upped their game. The staff were superb the inflight meal service extremely well presented and of a good standard. The entertainment reasonable. Sadly the return journey in business class TG 910 on 28/29 January 2014 fell so very far short of satisfactory. The staff were surly and obviously didn't want to be there and not particularly helpful. The drinks and meal service was shocking! The staff were on a mission to 'throw' everything at the passengers as soon as possible so they had nothing to do from there on! The drinks and meal service was completed within less than an hour of take off before we had chance to have a drink our meal was virtually thrown at us and cleared before completion. Similarly the breakfast service was faster than McDonalds and the meal dry and inedible (scrambled egg which had solidified) the whole return journey felt unwelcoming and one I would not wish to experience again especially given the premium pricing! Hence sadly reducing my overall rating of this airline from what could have been substantially higher if based on the outward journey only!,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Business Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,3.0,All in all not a bad experience at all. The Business Class lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport (Concourse E) was nice and clean couches were comfortable and there was a reasonable variety of food to eat. Only criticisms are that there should have been more types of fruit to choose from. Our Boeing 777-300 seats in business class had a very generous amount of leg room. The seats do not recline completely flat but I was comfortable enough to be able to get to sleep. Earplugs and blindfolds were also provided which gave me a more peaceful rest. Generally cabin crew were friendly especially when you talk to them personally. They could have smiled at bit more however in other situations such as when they are serving food and beverages. Special mention to the fresh fruits that I had for breakfast which had amazing presentation on the plate! Overall pretty positive experience just a few little things that TG should look at to enhance the experience for customers.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,3.0,nan,2.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,4.0,Flew Thai flight 910 from Bangkok to Heathrow on 1/13/14. The flight arrived 20 minutes late which cut into our 90 minute time to reach our connecting flight. There was no onboard announcements about connecting flights no one to answer questions once we deplaned. Since this was our first time in Heathrow we did not know that everyone has to go to a connecting flight area of the terminal. We were left wondering if we would find our connecting carrier until we found some security personnel to ask. On this return flight as well as on the flight over gone were the slippers gone were the eyeshades gone were the little bottles of water gone were the toothbrushes and amenities in the lavatories. The food was worse than in years past. In short Thai Airways is becoming more like the horrible American domestic carriers and losing its Asian charm.,nan,4.0,nan

Excellent award trip excellent cabin on a Boeing 777-300 with really big staggering columned seats providing a perfect degree of privacy and socializing. Aircraft new. Smart chairs nice colours and decorations. Staff very caring and tried to please me in all ways. 3 hot meals offered which is enough for a 2 hours flight. Champagne and wines good – all 5 products offered comes from France only. This has been the limitation for Thai for years. Good teas and 3 kind of beers offered.

Excellent staff service on the newly refurbished 747-400 now with semi suites in first with new wider more comfortable seats. Noted that the left wide electric arms rests on 1 and 2k and 1a were not working. Engineer called on to plane to investigate but listed works to be done at later date. Extra cushions given to act as replacement arm rests. This plane is so much better than the A340 as the cabin has only one more seat but is more than twice the size of the A340 and as galley and WCs are at back its much more peaceful too new improved pyjamas and new seat pad forming a mattress makes the sleep better. Take the day flight out and the night flight back to get this plane instead of a340 until the A380 arrives (due nov 2014). Food was good - usual Dom Perignon and caviar and so too ground services at Bangkok.,nan,5.0,nan

Lounge good at BKK although I must say that if you have a private sitting room as we did it is difficult to attract any attention from the staff. We always flight Thai first on long haul to the far east and until this flight have always been impressed with the staff service levels. However on this occasion they were: a) down one member of staff and b) used a staff member who had only worked in first twice. Thai cannot have provided her with any training so although she made every effort she had no idea how to serve dinner or drinks and was nervous and unsure throughout the cabin service. The Flight Manager explained that Thai now have a policy to shuffle staff between all classes and all aircraft types. That in itself is fine but please guys - do some training first! No wines offered with dinner (we had to ask and were brought an open bottle - no choice) No proper pre-dinner drinks service main courses were forgotten so we were offered fruit and cheese after the starter the wrong menu was used (we had pre-ordered) orchids were missing from the suites vases mix and match pyjamas long delays in clearing the tables so we had to ask for it to be done eventually. I still will recommend Thai unless this happens again next time. The saving grace was the helpful cabin crew and ground staff who retrieved my passport on landing at LHR which had fallen through a hole in the suite wall down into the floor (along with a large collection of menus safety cards mineral water etc) A design fault which need bunging up.,nan,4.0,nan

We have previously flown with another Airline to Bangkok but chose Thai due to the excellent price! We were slightly worried as it was a good deal. All our worries disappeared once we were on the airline. The seats were great with much more leg room than the other Airlines we have flown with. We were offered a drink quickly and offered drinks continually through our flight. Food excellent and served quickly and tasted really great. The staff were fantastic always smiling happy to help.

I can't remember ever using TG in economy either it's always been business and on a few occasions first for what I paid it was ok seat was not that comfortable although there was enough space. They served a hot meal which was fine and the aircraft despite being very old had PTV in all seats my star alliance membership ends soon but I managed to use the lounge at HKIA food was good with lots of variety and it's located very close to the departure gate. All in all an ok trip and service for a 2hr 30min flight I don't know if I would use TG in economy for a long haul I like the premium economy offered by most Oneworld carriers.,nan,4.0,nan

Overnight to BKK in A330 - these J seats look the same as the 777/747 J seats but have less pitch therefore are on more of an angle. Despite the light load I found sleeping difficult as it was a tight angle. BKK is an enormous airport and take a long time to walk anywhere. TG Lounges were fine - was hoping for the chicken noodle soup I enjoyed there last time but it was not to be. Boarded at a remote gate which was a complete shambles and thus departed late. BKK-MEL was on the 777-200 which is a fantastic cabin - very spacious more pitch than the A330 therefore a flatter bed. Was very surprised and impressed to be served both a full breakfast and a full dinner - usually on Asian to Australia flights you get one of the other + a snack. 'Signature dish' of Massaman Curry was dreadful - chicken in red water but there's always plenty of food on Thai. Thai is a very old fashioned airline and not in the same league as CX and SQ but have a perfectly acceptable business class product.,nan,5.0,nan

Booking in for return on Flight TG 910 on 26th January to find we had been allocated seats by bulkhead and toilets! Not happy and sleepless night!

As I was not hungry at dinner time I advised the cabin attendant that I would skip the dinner but would like a snack later. Around mid-point in the flight I went to the galley and asked the attendant for some food. I was told that no food would be available until the breakfast service several hours later. I was given only two small packets of crackers to last several hours until the next full meal service causing me several hours of discomfort. Unbelievable!

Dinner quickly served cold options absolutely the best as hot meals seemed somewhat overcooked of 4 options I took prawns with garlic coriander sauce which was rather tasteless and unspicy with rice - not too interesting all in all like an enlarged economy meal - also breakfast options. However service both effective smiling and very quick leaving a long night for sleep on fully flat bed.

IFE was excellent with plenty of movies to choose from. However I was very disappointed with the service and food on all legs. Half the crew seemed grumpy the whole time and not a smile was to be seen. Two very bland meals were served on each leg. We got hungry mid-flight on several of the legs and asked if they had any snacks but all they could offer was some crackers and cheese. Crew were not particularly diligent in going round with water/drinks during the flights so most of the time I ended up going to the galley myself. Overall a disappointment.

I was not best pleased when as soon as trip finalised they were taken off (LHR-BKK and HKG-BKK). Overall OK-a trailing rather than leading product except for BKK-LHR which was wonderful in all aspects. Generally I don't mind the semi lie flat seats but just could not a get comfortable adjustment on any except the A340 this flight was 'smooth as silk' with a great crew and product whereas the rest was going through the motions more. Lounges OK at best-very good at HKG. Fast track at LHR and departure at BKK only-immigration took 1.5 hrs going into Thailand and nearly an hour at HKG due to obscure pax in my line.

If TG is an airline I have always appreciated and flown both internationally and domestically their Thai Smiles at least in Business class is just a way to cheat passengers: if you buy a ticket on TG you don't expect to be on a flight offering a low cost airline service at a normal airline business cost. On this flight Bangkok to Krabi we were sitting in coach seats (no passenger in the middle that is the only plus) food was revolting and service to its minimum. To be honest a few days later I flew another domestic TG from Chiang Mai to BKK this time with business seats and service. So be sure to check if your flight will be Smiles or not!,nan,2.0,nan

All flights were in Business class except Haneda - Bangkok which was in First. 1st sector SIN-BKK 777-300ER comfortable seats but a bit on the narrow side and claustrophobic when in the fully flat mode. Staggered seating so everybody had aisle access. Service and food was fantastic. Crew were friendly and energetic. Towels newspapers and drinks offered on ground. BKK-CTS 777-300 seats arranged 2-3-2 in angled flat. Still comfortable and I find more spacious than the 777-300ER seats. However service was terrible. Could see the crew was just going through the motion and didn't bother. The 2 stewards had no smiles. On ground no towels or newspaper offered only drinks. After takeoff a light refreshment is served and breakfast before arrival. Didn't eat so cant comment on the food. Haneda-Bangkok in First 747-400. Night flight so not much to comment. Everything offered on ground. Rimowa toiletry kit which was nice. One thing about Thai their blankets are really very nice and comfy. The supervisor offered to make my bed but as it was already in flat bed mode I told her it was ok. Again light refreshment served after takeoff and breakfast served before landing. Didn't eat again but my friend had the eggs and he said it was awful. TG changed our seats before we left for Sapporo from 2 windows to the 2 center seats. Their reason - change of aircraft. Transit in Bangkok was fantastic. They had a buggy waiting to transport us to the lounge. As our original flight to Singapore was cancelled we had a 7 hour layover. They let us use the First Class lounge so we could take a nap in one of their private rooms. Lounge was empty so was very peaceful and quiet. BKK-SIN A330 again service was very good on this short hop. Crew were young and enthusiastic and food very good. Would fly Thai again for its reasonable ticket and comfortable seats.,nan,5.0,nan

This seat was narrower than standard had an entertainment box under the seat in front and had far less seat pitch than the advertised 34"". In short it was very cramped. Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks. I imagine this is because the A340-600 is so long and the back seats are a long way from the centre of pressure so any slight lateral movement is exaggerated.

Seats on both planes are the semi lie flat type most of the other Asian carriers exchanged in favour of full lie flat seats. I don't understand why TG can't have fully lie flat seating on near 12 hour flights. It is difficult to sleep in the current seats. IFE was somewhat slow but there was a decent inventory of films. A nice touch was the loaded menu for the flight as I didn't get a menu on my return flight. Outgoing flight service was somewhat poor with the FAs not too interested in the pax. Return flight had FAs present in the cabin. On both flights despite there supposedly being a selection of white wines there was one white wine option only. Outgoing 1st meal was overcooked bland and poorly presented. The 2nd meal was equally unpleasant. Return flight 1st meal was up to TG's former reputation but the 2nd meal option consisted of some greasy pork sausages on cabbage with boiled potato. It looked like someone had run down to the 7-11 and bought some of those hot dogs that are a mainstay of Thailand 7-11s. Seriously sausages as a meal in business class? The other option was duck. Gate staff in Brussels are contracted out and they were rather unpleasant. Bangkok TG check-in and gate experience was excellent.

Not only the service punctuality and price but also the treatment of Star Gold. Even though it's a relatively short flight (1 hour and change) both segments operated with widebody (A330/777-300) and made for a really pleasant journey. Offered exit row seats without having to ask - which was wonderful. Great snack run and multiple coffee/water runs done during the flight. The cabin crew couldn't have been more hospitable.

The fish was inedible. Grey and mushy in texture. In their defence the staff offered to make us a sandwich. A sandwich in the business lounge?

Sleeping was not a problem and quite comfortable.

When checking in for return to London Thai Airways had given our seats away. After a lot of haggling got onto flight. Shocking service. Staff poorly trained but worse were rude and arrogant.

nan,First Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,"TG911 LHR-BKK 747-400 Royal First Class - new first class cabin. Managed to get online check in completed 23 hours before the flight and got seats 1A and 1K. Because we were transiting through Bangkok and onto Hanoi we had to get our boarding passes at LHR as our visas had to be checked. Arrived at the Royal First class desk where we were processed in an efficient and friendly manner. When flying Thai Airways Royal First Class you are told that you can use the SAS London Lounge which is the general Star Alliance lounge in T3. In fact you are also able to use the Singapore Airlines First Class lounge which if you time it right with their flights is actually a much nicer lounge and much quieter. There are no announcements in the lounge so you have to be a bit vigilant with the time for boarding especially if your gate is a walk away. Arrived at the gate just as boarding had started and after a short wait first and business class passengers were ushered down a separate boarding way into door 1L. Within a matter of minutes the cabin service director came and welcomed us on board he came round with a tray of glasses and a bottle of champagne in hand. The ambience of the new first class cabin is noticeable with its hues of cream purple and wood. The mini suites (without doors) are spacious the seats wide and comfortable and comes with plenty of storage space to the side under the windows and under the ottoman. To the front sits the massive 23"" screen with the ubiquitous Thai orchid in pride of place and on the aisle side is a small closet with hanging space. To the window side of the seat starting at the front is the magazine rack storage for the headphones and a multi pin power socket then the large and heavy wooden table which lifts out of the housing followed by a small touch screen which controls the seat positions and then a further storage area where the entertainment handset 2 x USB ports and a further cubby hole can be found. For couples travelling together seats 1A and 1K are definitely the ones to go for if you want a window view otherwise seats 3E and 3F which are two seated together in the middle at the rear of the cabin. If you are travelling alone any of the other widow seats or 2E will be suitable. There was very little communication from the flight deck throughout the flight but it kept the flight quiet and peaceful. The food service was exceptional and started almost immediately. First came the drinks service and warm nuts. Drinks service was followed by canapés. Once this was finished the table was laid and service began. We had pre-ordered the Lobster Thermidor online and it did not disappoint. Once I had finished watching a film I asked the crew to make up my bed and by the time I returned to my seat my bed was made. I slept for about 4-5 hours before the lights were switched on for the breakfast service. Before we started to make our descent into Bangkok the first class crew came round to each individual passenger to thank them for flying with Thai and handed out an orchid a lovely touch. This particular crew were friendly chatty and attentive without being annoying. The food and drink service was exceptional and the pre-ordered dish was very good. The new cabin is comfortable airy and the mini suites cocoon you from your fellow passengers; I like the relaxed feel of the cabin with only 9 seats compared to British Airways first cabin of 14.",nan,5.0,nan

I checked in online 24 hours before the flight and was able to confirm seats 1A and 2A which I had already allocated beforehand. Because we were transiting through Bangkok from Koh Samui we had to get our boarding passes at BKK. Arrived at the Royal First class area and were greeted by two eager porters who took our bags and another member of staff took our passports. We were ushered to the seating area whilst the formalities of check in was completed. We were then ushered off through fast track security and then onto fast track immigration which again was swift. After immigration you descend an escalator which takes you straight into the Royal Silk Business Class lounge however as we were flying First Class a golf buggy was awaiting us at the bottom and we were whisked off through the business class lounge and along the corridor of Concourse D to the Royal Orchid Spa. As we had booked a massage at the check in desk we were dropped off outside the spa. There are no calls for boarding in the lounge instead lounge staff come and find you 20 minutes before the flight is due to depart and escort you to the aircraft. Boarding was swift and straight-forward. Shortly after taking my seat a glass of champagne was offered along with papers magazines and the menu. Aircraft servicing the lunchtime departure to the UK is the A340-600 and so the Royal First Class is of the older open seat variety. The cabin does feel very spacious with only 8 seats but it is an old layout. There is plenty of storage although not as many sockets and connection points and cubby hole cupboards as on the new 747 layout. For couples travelling together the middle seats 1/2E and 1/2F are definitely the ones to go for however if you want a window view you can sit in tandem as we did and have either 1/2A or 1/2K and dine together if you fancy a chat. Flight pushed back on time the food service started well with the drinks service and warm nuts and the canapés. The crew did not come around and ask for our meal order instead choosing to serve everyone in the cabin the same early courses and then proceeded to offer the main courses from the wheeled table. They completed missed out one of the main course choices. By the time we were served the food was cold and unappetising. Even though this was a daytime flight I wanted to try to get some sleep so proceeded to make my bed at which point one of the crew came out of the galley and continued the process for me. The seat on the old A340-600 does not go fully flat it leaves the head end slightly elevated which quite frankly was causing me some severe problems with my neck when lying on my side I probably only got 2-3 hours sleep. Lights were switched on 2 hours before landing and the afternoon meal was served. I opted for the Chicken and Leek soup which because it was served to order was hot and delicious. We landed on time and bags were collected within about 30 minutes of landing. The Thai Airways ground service at Bangkok was absolutely second-to-none from the moment we checked in we were very well looked after the flight however left a lot to be desired and was shame considering the excellent service we had on the outbound flight.,nan,2.0,nan

What came as a shock was the behaviour of the Check in Manager at Delhi Airport who was talking loudly on his mobile phone and barking instructions to passengers and staff alike. It was disgusting at first and laughable later. At times you will find middle aged women at check in counters in Bangkok who have a grim look pasted on their face. It definitely does not represent the land of smiles. A little more smile even faked will be welcome. However Thai offers competitive fares and for that reason alone I shall fly with them. I just hope Thai puts newer planes on the DEL-BKK-SYD leg like the 787 and the A380. I recommend Thai to those looking for a comfortable flight with no nasty surprises.,nan,4.0,nan

On this route Thai have to compete with SQ and CX and showed a huge improvement compared to an earlier flight I took from the Philippines where they were only competing with PAL and Kuwait Airways. 9 across configuration with a good seat pitch but the box for the IFE does get in the way. Seat back screen was a decent size but the content was a bit of a letdown. Catering was very good for economy with the main course on a china dish metal cutlery and milk for tea and coffee compared with foil/plastic/creamer on some airlines. The baggage allowance in economy is only 20kg and needs increasing to 30kg in line with most of the competition. Overall I was perfectly happy with the price/service and will definitely use again.,nan,5.0,nan

Staff are excellent and passengers are welcomed with a very respectful traditional Thai greeting once you step aboard the aircraft. Seats are comfortable with a good election of movies. We flew the night flight to Bangkok and a dinner and breakfast was served (whereas on the night flights with Malaysia Airlines only a light snack and breakfast is served). Cabin crew were excellent and there were numerous drinks round on both flights. My call button was answered promptly. Food served was good not exactly fine dining but more than adequate.

The warm Thai hospitality remains but was let down by the food quality and quantity due to cost-cutting. Seats are comfortable enough especially on 747. On both legs the food served was small in quantity and the quality was below my expectation. Fried pork mince with sweet basil on rice looked like a 7-11 fast meal served on bone china dry and tasteless. Chicken red curry with rice tastes ok but quantity so small it's like children menu. Good if you are on diet but for any grown men that's way too small. I commented on that and FA was embarrassed but she agreed. The biz lounge and 30 min free massage was a saving grace. I don't mind flying with them but I wouldn't go out of my way to I still prefer my other choices such as Emirates and SriLankan which are cheaper and better.,nan,3.0,nan

I have had a gold card with Thai for about 20 years but I do not think I will keep it. This trip confirmed to me what people have been writing here. This 747 had old rock hard uncomfortable seats from 10 years ago the sound system was broken the menu has not altered for many years and BKK airport is too difficult for an older person. The arrogance of Thai to divert this flight thus making many passengers miss connecting flights or appointments without any prior notice is appalling when a plane could have been sent to Bali from BKK to take on some stranded Thai passengers from another flight without causing more problems.,nan,1.0,nan

The cabin interior on this 777 was worn out and the seats were very narrow and not at all comfortable. This aircraft should be retired from long haul routes or refurbished it is just not up to standard. The FA were friendly but the service was rushed and disorganized. The quality of food on Thai flights has been slipping but what they dished up this time hit a new low for me.

The B772 TG uses on the MNL-BKK route is well- maintained and therefore clean but its advanced age is evident. My friends and I liked the colorful seats and the 2-3-2 economy class seating at the rear of the aircraft which meant that the aisles in the tail section were never crowded. The entertainment which included Hitchcock and Hitchcock-inspired selections was great. The food on both legs were well-suited to the Filipino palette that requires the harmony of all types of tastes and flavors and the extra bread runs were obviously highly appreciated by most of the passengers who got seconds. I have flown with a few other airlines and what clearly sets THAI apart for me is the crew and how consistently warm and attentive they are throughout the flight regardless of the crew member you speak with. I wish TG would continue to leverage on their crew as their competitive advantage instead of their aircraft (the A380 and B787) that leave much to be desired at least in photos and collateral's.,nan,4.0,nan

I have had better meals on other airlines but my husband will argue that Thai's meals were delicious so I guess it's just personal preference. I was disappointed that my young son was not given an activity pack or anything at all! Every other airline we've flown with has offered books toys colouring in activities - something to keep the kids happy but Thai offered nothing to children at all. IFE was great.

Although the crew seemed in a rush due to the short flight time the lunch boxes were great! Services was good and everyone was so friendly. BKK- KIX - A380-800. Great clean aircraft and efficient service. Although it was a red eye flight crew went out of their way to make everyone feel comfortable. Crew constantly moved throughout the cabin with soft drinks and juices. Breakfast was an awesome Thai chicken dish served 1.5 hours before landing with second helpings of hot dinner rolls and croissants. Overall an excellent airline and always a pleasure to fly but the lounge at Kansai Airport needs serious improvement. Only instant noodles and rice balls available.,nan,5.0,nan

At check-in I was asked to show the credit card I had used to book the flight. I was able to produce the credit card so no problem. Thai is not the only airline to insist on sighting credit cards but I would prefer it if they had better fraud prevention methods than that. At check in I also asked for an exit row aisle seat and was given one - no problem and no request for extra money. Two meals were served on the first flight to Bangkok both offered choices for the main dish and my choices were both tasty. The staff did numerous water/juice runs throughout the night and the washrooms were kept spotless. The seats were quite hard but I did sleep some. On arrival in Bangkok I cleared Immigration and then - after the brief flight to Chiang Mai - customs in Chiang Mai were a breeze. Thai has always been and still is a decent full-service airline in my opinion.,nan,5.0,nan

The Thai staff were attentive and efficient. Welcome drinks were offered including a second round and service was efficient. Because of the flight time (dinner time) and the relatively poor selection of food in the lounge at HKK the meal service has room for improvement. Thai has the best flight times between HKK and BKK and you can consistently snag an a decent price in the royal silk cabin without too much pre planning.

I always buy my tickets direct from Thai Airways and I find if I monitor their website I can purchase tickets as cheap is not cheaper than any other agent/organisation.

I have never before been in a business class lounge when you couldn't get a glass of wine! The flight accommodation was not good with uncomfortable seating which did not covert into flat beds. On the outward leg the cabin was reduced to darkness after the first couple of hours into the flight despite it being early afternoon which made no sense (except perhaps for the cabin staff). Same on return but quite acceptable as this was a night flight. Half way through the flight the toilets ran out of hand towels. On both flights the service seemed rushed.

This is the third year that I have flown with them going between Canada and Chiang Mai. When I have requested window seats they have gone out of their way to see if it is possible and they have succeeded. The central office can make that happen on international flights and the gate agents make it happen for domestics. In Chiang Mai they were respectful and very helpful and the same in Bangkok. Onboard the service is second to none. The food is great and the quality of onboard service is great.

Hot towels offered and a drink before take off. Was in the last seat of the Biz Class (27 K) and enjoyed it - the small economy section behind is nice as they don't allow children there so it is quiet. The food was average but had good flavor. AVOD Entertainment had plenty of movies and TV shows to watch on the 10 hour flight. The attendants were very friendly and accommodating but I was surprised that after dinner and before breakfast they never came through the cabin offering drinks and snacks. If you went to the galley they would happily deliver whatever you wanted to your seat but even on American and United they come thru every few hours with water (and that is in economy). Landed on time and bags out quickly. Overall a good flight and the A380 is so quiet.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Business Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,2.0,no,nan,2.0,Very negative experience Thai Airways is very pricey and their service is getting poorer over the years (I'm a Gold member and I often travel with them). They now switched back to old 747 from Bangkok to London and despite flying business I hardly noticed any difference with the economy class in terms of quality. Seats are very narrow and not very comfortable the video screen for the onboard entertainment is noticeably smaller than for other seats and old (also difficult to return to its stowed position without any difficulty). Old movies (same as few months earlier). Food in particular was very poor and with little choices (I had better food on economy class in the past) and service was also very poor compared to the past (little care to details). This should probably be my last business flight with Thai Airways.,nan,2.0,nan

They should just not be allowed to call it first class business class on Singapore or EVA is better. Last year I flew Thai from ZRH-BKK on A340 and was disappointed - I thought maybe I just had an old plane and a bad crew. Turns out it's the standard for Thai. A380 is a fairly new plane but it was already quite worn. The F cabin just isn't designed that well - there is a lot of wasted space on some lounge in the front that no one used. Much better to put another bathroom in that area like Emirates have. The seats are OK but the armrest is only on one side which I didn't like. The TV screens are big but the entertainment selection is quite poor. The service would be ok for business class but it's definitely not polished enough for first class. Again I don't want to compare them to their major competitors but Thai is miles behind. It just feels like it's not genuine it's very mechanical. About the food. I ordered a speciality meal thinking it would be better boy was I wrong! The white fish was inedible. I don't know what they did to it but it tasted like a shoe. I had to ask the flight attendant to give me salmon from the standard menu fortunately she had some left. It wasn't a culinary miracle by any means but at least I was able to eat it. Not sure what champagne they were serving but it wasn't good either. Now since this was only a 6 hour flight there were no PJs and it didn't seem like they had bedding for anyone either (at that point I didn't dare to ask just slept on the seat). Also we didn't receive the standard Rimowa first class amenity kit but rather a business class amenity kit designed by Porsche. So disappointing. The FA didn't make any attempt to apologize or explain that. I would definitely prefer to fly ANA business class NRT-BKK.,nan,2.0,nan

After 2hrs into the flight it was apparent that the IFE was not going to work and for the next 11hrs or so all the passengers were restless.

The seats are very comfortable with adjustable head rests and good leg room was even able to sleep during both flights. Food was decent with a beef curry with rice offered after take off from Melbourne and chicken noodles as a choice for breakfast. On my return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne there was only one breakfast option on offer which was chicken sausage with scrambled eggs and this was the only meal which was below standard The egg was too runny and the spinach was burnt. Cabin crew on both flights were excellent and very friendly and spoke excellent English assisted me in putting my heavy suitcase into the overhead bin. Unlike the crew on some airlines who disappear right after the meal service the crew walked down the aisles with trays of water and juice after the cabin lights had been turned off and promptly bought me my scotch and coke when requested.

When we boarded a very rude hostess said that my daughter could not sit in the exit aisle without a parent sitting next to her. I was travelling alone with my four children and the man sitting next to my daughter said that he was happy to take care of her in case of emergency and I was only separated from her by the aisle so I could easily reach her. The hostess insisted on one of my children moving because the plane was full and we could not all be moved. My children were very distressed because one had to move and none of them wanted to sit alone as you can imagine as they are all under the age of nine.

The flight in Business to FRA was on the A380 and I loved the seating with lots of space and the seat was easy to operate between the various positions and put down into a bed to sleep. Heaps of room for storage which is great. The service was good and the crew were friendly and helpful. On the food side of things I think Thai lag behind some of their competition in terms of quality but there was plenty of it with a 4 course meal followed up with a hot breakfast served a couple of hours prior to landing - I did not go hungry.

The aircraft model that operated this flight was a Boeing 777-300ER and the seats were pretty comfortable for a 2 hour long flight. Pillows were found on every seat. The entertainment system was responsive and the food was excellent. The taste was great and they came in pretty big portions. I was full before I even got to the dessert. It's a pity no menu was given out though. The cabin crew were a little rushed but generally pretty friendly. TG413. 13th December. I was lucky enough to grab a seat on the Airbus 340-600 which is such a gorgeous plane and one of Thai's most coveted aircraft models by aviation enthusiasts. The seats were definitely not as comfortable as the ones found on the Boeing 777-300ER but good enough for a 2 hour flight.

I was frankly a bit worried at first having read some of the negative reviews but to my surprise - worth every penny! I personally found the staff to be the best factor on that trip so attentive friendly and welcoming. For me that made up for the uncomfortable seat and the slightly bland meal(s). I will give TG credit on making an effort to sort me out a veggie meal at the last minute (I hadn't pre-ordered it) - yet TG went the extra mile to satisfy me as the passenger. Inflight entertainment was brilliant too! So many choices! I'd definitely fly them again and recommend that you fly Thai!,nan,4.0,nan

No storage space in the seat and no direct aisle access for the window seat. Overall the seating was more like premium economy. The wine choices were good but unfortunately food quality and presentation were of low quality. Choice in the inflight entertainment system was limited. I was surprised that they would use such bad equipment for a route with a very long overnight segment on the westbound route. This choice became even more puzzling when on my connecting segment from BKK to PVG the plane (Boeing 777) had a much more modern business class product with flatbed seats for a much shorter daytime flight.,nan,3.0,nan

Flight boarded only 15 minutes before scheduled departure but using 2 jet-bridges they had the door closed and pushed back on time at 21.00. Smooth take off and prompt dinner service by smiling flight attendants. Good food and friendly service for the 2 hour flight. Good AVOD entertainment on large screen and tons of legroom. Landed on time but taxied to a remote stand which was irritating as there were at least 15 airbridges in the Thai area that were free. Bussed to the terminal and long walk to connecting flight. Used the Thai Royal Silk Lounge - good food but awful seats and so crowded. Tiny lounge for being the hub of the airline - and used by other Star Alliance passengers. My travel companion and I spend 15 minutes in there and preferred to sit in the terminal. TG642 to Narita was boarded by bus so again a long bus ride to the plane. Amazing new 787! Warm greeting upon entering and led to seats. Comfortable pods with a lot of room and amenities. Take off just after midnight for 6 hour flight - meal served quickly and very delicious. Service perfect - smiling attendants and they predicted your next request. Slept 3 hours comfortably and with individual air vents keeps your seat area cool. It's ridiculous that many new planes come without the air vents. Breakfast an hour out of Narita and once we landed short taxi to the gate.

BKK-HKT delayed by approx. 40 minutes to allow passengers for late connecting flight from Tokyo to reach it. Return flight on short 20 minutes delay. Apart from those on-time issues little to complain about. Plenty of space on widebodies (777-300 on BKK-HKT and A330-300 on return) no IFE (only route map available but you do not need much more on such a short flight) light and tasty meal consisting of sandwich delicious coconut or orange cake and non-alcoholic beverages.

As a scuba diver this means I can now carry all my kit without going via the middle east. At check in on the way out I was asked if I was satisfied with my selected seat. I was offered the alternative of an exit row with greater leg room. I took this and found I was the only person in the whole row which was good as these seats are slightly narrower than normal. I therefore had room to move my elbows to eat! On the return journey I was again offered an alternative to the seat I had reserved another aisle seat but with an empty place beside me great. Good leg room and if it wasn't for other passengers selfishly punching the touch screens and bouncing in the seat in front it would have been perfect.

Returned on TG 916 flight left on time plane was pretty much full but still had enough space to fell comfortable and not cramped. Food was decent again with no issues.

The Boeing 777 had a nice clean interior and had spacious leg room perfect for the long nine hour flight between Australia and Thailand. Flight Attendants were nice enough and were quick to respond to passenger requests. IFE had a decent selection of new movies and TV shows enough to entertain me throughout both long-haul flights. Unfortunately on the return journey my screen went dead five hours in and there was nothing that could be done to fix it leaving me to watch the remaining half of my movie on my friend's screen. Between BNE and BKK food was plentiful and tasty however on both of the shorter flights the 'cold lunchbox style' food was really quite bad and a little inedible. Disappointing. With this being said I did enjoy all flights with Thai and would recommend for long haul flights.

Staff made up for the discomfort. As usual they were very attentive and friendly. Food was a little bland but not inedible. Entertainment was great - the same as the inbound leg which was still enough to last me the full 14hrs! All in all not a terrible experience.

The DEL-BKK leg was on an ageing A340-600 with particularly uncomfortable seats and obsolete IFE. The screens were low definition and barely visible if the blinds were up (it was a daytime flight). On the plus side food (other than the dessert) and the service was fine. The BKK-SGN leg was by stark contrast on a new B787. Owing to the short duration no headphones provided so the fantastic IFE is largely inaccessible. Cold box meal was adequate for an hour long flight. In comparison the aircraft for the SGN-BKK flight was a tired A330 with hard seats and no IFE. The B777-200 used on the BKK-DEL leg was far more comfortable and modern but it had the worst food on any of the legs including the cold meals on the Saigon flights. Service was functional but seemed rushed and was brusque on a couple of occasions. It was a full flight but I haven't had the crew on other full DEL-BKK flights be as snappy as this set was. That set and the ground staff at Bangkok airport diminished a lot of the goodwill from the good service on the other flights. Overall IFE needs to be improved to keep up with other premium competitors but still stands head and shoulders above Indian competitors on the same routes.,nan,4.0,nan

I tried to upgrade to business class for the 13 hour flight back to LHR but was (rudely) told it was full. The return flight was just as bad if not worse than the first flight. My entertainment system did not work again and the staff were just as rude. They seemed to disappear for around 6 hours during the flight (it was not a night-flight either) leaving us with no offer of even a cup of water. When I eventually asked for a cup of coffee I was brought (20 minutes later) a stone-cold one. Dinner was served 2 hours before landing although our row of 3 was served around half an hour after everybody else - I think w e were forgotten as we had to ask for our food! When we eventually got our food they had ran out of the beef option leaving only the seafood option.

I fly Thai several times a year in both business and economy and find them to be very poor. Unfortunately they offer the only direct flight on some of the routes I need to take. On this particular flight the disappointments just kept adding up. From the poor service provided by flight attendants who were more interested in chatting in the galley to the very poor quality meal and drink selection. For the price they are charging for a business class ticket one would think they could provide some decent wines and video entertainment.

The electronic entertainment is old, murky image and very poor for anyone used to the digital clarity on Emirates and others. And the seat - well, it's impossible to get comfortable in any reclining position in this seat. How it ever went into production I'll never know.

Better than some real food I've had in Bangkok. Also, the movie selection was excellent. The flight back, TG 658, was on a noticeably older 777 (old AVOD). It was a red-eye, so they served a boring croissant sandwich after take off and a full breakfast (bland ham fried rice with Thai style egg) before landing.

I checked in online but did not have a printer to print out my boarding pass and had to do so at the check-in counter. The first passenger service agent I talked to seemed clueless when I requested to obtain my boarding pass. He referred me to his colleague who was more eager to serve. Business class passenger services was terrible in Paris CDG Airport. There were two Business counters open but only one line, therefore the passengers who arrived later formed a second line to correspond to the number of counters and therefore skipped 2 parties (myself included) who were in line ahead of them. This is unacceptable as the ground staff were ignorant of the inappropriate manners of the other passengers. When it was my turn to the counter, I simply requested them to print out the boarding pass as I already checked in online, but the agent (who is actually an Air France agent but was serving for THAI) said I had to wait until she can get a Thai Airways agent to check my credit card. This took over 20 minutes and I was stuck at the counter until the other agent arrived. Big thumbs down. The lounge facility was average as CDG is not a Star Alliance Hub, but the staff were very friendly. Boarding was not the best and very chaotic. No announcements for First/Business class priority boarding. In flight service was the best part of the entire experience. I was seated in the last row of Business cabin (upper deck). My part of the cabin was relatively empty and both of the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive to my requests. I was greeted warmly and because I request special meals, one of the FAs asked if I would like to stick with the special meal or opt for the regular. She knew by heart what the options were and was able to provide very thoughtful recommendations. She was probably the best Thai Airways cabin crew I have met on board. Throughout the flight, all the FAs were extremely helpful at navigating the IFE, looking for my lost item, answering my questions, and accommodating my requests without any annoyance.

The cabin is comfortable with nice passive lighting changes, windows are dimmable, seats are flatbeds and super comfortable. Screen is large but difficult to turn off and stay off as the hand console is positioned at elbow height in the seat rest. Service was excellent and a full meal and drinks was offered an hour into the flight. I would have preferred to have the lights dimmed immediately in the cabin on takeoff so sleep was an option. In any case, light turbulence made sleep uneasy for several hours. Morning wake up at around 5am Perth time. Full breakfast option was available but I took the ready made sandwiches which were tasty.

Check-in was efficient as both ways had a separate seated check-in area with a lot of counters. No queue at all. Had business class tickets, but after boarding we were upgraded to 1st class. Online you can't book 1st class for this short flight, so I suspect they cherry pick from business class and fill 1st class (instead of just leaving 1st class totally empty as some airlines do). Seats are located in the nose of the ground floor of this 747 in a 1-2-1 setup (though as it narrows down to the front it becomes 1-1-1 and the 1st row is 1-1). Seats are not new but comfortable nonetheless. Wide from seat to feet. TV screen is of good size and has a good video selection. Also for my 11 year old daughter. Didn't really liked the TV remote, though it did bring back good memories from the 90's. Food was not 1st class but business class food instead. This is understandable as all  were upgraded from business class. The kids ignored the food served but the chocolates with the meal were well received. Choice and flow of drinks and tidbits were endless. Staff was super nice and attentive. Every few minutes they'll come by and offer their services, till having said ""no thanks"" a few times and they'll leave you alone. Boarding of this fully booked 747 (it was just before the King's birthday) was orderly and quick. The Singapore lounge was disappointing. They have their own lounge but it's small and has not much to eat. It doesn't have it's own toilet, so you'll have to walk out (not far) and use a public toilet. The Bangkok lounge was better. Large and good choice of drinks (available at the bar, just outside the actual lounge, but can consider in lounge area). Free 30 minute massage at an actual spa was an extra bonus.

I am used to high quality service and excellent food in Royal Silk, but this time the service highly exceeded any previous experience. Excellent flight overall. If I only had any - very minor - complaints it would be that, after 5 years in service, the monitors seem to have a lower resolution than more modern aircraft (or probably it's only my impression, as my inbound flight was on a super modern A350 where the monitor quality was impeccable), also, the restrooms, even in Royal Silk, feel quite small comparing to Thai's A350 or B747. Also about the restrooms, I was happy to find that the moisture lotion has gone back to the excellent Bulgari Eau Parfumée au Thé (Blanc now, it used to be Vert a few years ago), after switching to Era's Cloud Nine for a while. The only pity is that the lady in front of me stole the whole bottle after less than 15 minutes into the flight. Despite these little details, a great flight experience!

I briefly want to describe how different services with one airline can be. FRA-BKK was the afternoon flight TG921 with the B777-300ER. Unfortunatlely we had the entertainment box beneath our seats which made the space additional tight. The entertainment system was a bit difficult to understand and it took a while to find German translated movies. The service was not as expected. This was very average only. Additional our row was served a german traditional meal (thick noodles, red cabbage and goulash). No alternate was ordered. It felt like there were 3 german meals left and need to be distributed asap. This wasn’t satisfying. Drinks were served before and while lunch. Once again just before landing in Bangkok. In the meantime drinks were available in the Galley. Once we decided to push the “crew button” for service. However no one appeared at all.

Boarding was very quick and efficient and we were soon sitting on our seats that we had reserved online in advance. The aircraft was pretty worn, IFE screen was tiny and the resolution reminded me of flights I took between shortly after personal screens were introduced. At least the content was on demand. The seat was rather comfortable and every passenger got a blanket and a pillow. However, the seat felt narrow and it was not possible for me to find a comfortable sleeping position without constantly touching some buttons of the IFE remote, which had the result, that the screen was constantly switched on again. The crew was disappointing, they were not able to live up to the reputation Thai has. Although they were very efficient and service oriented, I almost felt as if they were yelling at me. The cover of my armrest was loose and fell off. When I told the FA, she put it back and said "" It's okay?"". Needless to say it fell off again shorty after. Food was OK, but not exceptional.

The B777 was nice inside and looks like it has had an upgrade to add plug sockets to charge devices which is great. Through out the flight the cabin crew were pleasant and always happy to help. 2 meals were served on board which were nice and appealing. On landing. Exiting the plane was smooth and no issues and was given a Thai farewell. The return journey back to Heathrow from BKK. Checking in at BKK was easy as always and no problems and check in staff were helpful. Same plane back but had a last row seat in the middle which was ok but legroom was adequate but at times felt a bit uncomfortable. This was not at issue with the seat i took more that i am a big guy. Cabin crew were equally as good on board through out the return flight and food was equally the same on both trips. Would I use Thai Airways again. Yes.  Nice seats, able to charge a phone on board.

Thai used to have fantastic leg room in economy, but now it's down to 32"" or 31"" seat pitch, OK but not really comfortable for someone 194cm tall, as I am. The Boeing 777-200 on the first leg was old but OK, the front economy cabin on the A380 on the second leg was curtained off from the rest of the aircraft and was a very quiet and comfortable area - not surprising given that this area is used by some airlines for first class. Food and service on both flights were very good (given that it's Y class after all) and the baggage allowance generous (40kg for me as a silver status Royal Orchid Program flyer). However, being offered almost identical two breakfasts on the same day (one on the inbound aircraft and one on the outbound aircraft five hours later) wasn't a great experience - at least I had a choice of main dish so could vary it slightly. The international transfer arrangements in BKK are a disgrace - the airport is really letting the airline down. I arrived in BKK on TG 462 at 6am and departed TG672 at 8.25am. I joined the transfer queue at around 6.20am and only got through security at around 7.25. A lot of the time was spent held back at a gate where desperate pax with tight connections were coming forward and begging to be allowed through but told by unsympathetic officials to go back into the queue. I had sufficient time to make my onward flight but the whole process was stressful and I think that BKK airport's bureaucratic incompetence really undermines a lot of the good work done by TG staff on long haul flights.

Cabin crew was enthusiastic and hot towel was provided when boarding. From Bangkok to London I flewed on A380. Although legroom was tighter than that on B747, it provides more seat recline and I found it comfortable as well as a 190cm. Food was among the best, especially compared with airlines in China.

Thai use wide bodies (a few different ones A350, 777, A330) a few times a day on their domestic BKK to Chiang Mai route which is about an hour long. Downside is you are bused to international side of airport and then walk up a stairway to the jetty vs relocating the airplane to the domestic side, stairs are little challenging if old. I opt for these vs narrow body ThaiSmile or other airlines as there is generally a lot of priority to ensure they are on-time within a small buffer zone of 20 minutes. Seats are good, 9 across in 777 versus the spacing saving in most carriers is evident. Service is rushed given the time, but coffee and small chicken snack. IFE was old but reasonable. Cabin crew are rapid paced which is fantastic, I'd love to see if they have same energy on international legs. I think the 9 across dated cabin would be much better internationally than 10 across, I'd sacrifice the extra 2"" IFE screen for the extra 1"" seat width. Minus a point for no beer available.

Seat was extremely comfortable and wide as TG still maintains 9-abreast seating on the 777. IFE screen a little subpar of other carriers such as Cathay Pacific as it wasn't responsive and often times would lag. Crew worked hard to provide snacks and several round of drinks during the 45-minutes flight. The snack was a Carbonara wrap with several choices of juice and mineral water to accompany. The wrap itself was delightful and appropriate of a size for the duration and timing of the flight. Arrived Chiang Mai on time and bags came out within 20 minutes of disembarking.

You should then think if you are in business class you would be in a business class bus. No - the sign on the bus says so, but the bus does not leave until completely packed. One word - cost savings over passenger comfort. If you make the effort to ask the Thai call center you will get a list of excuses from it is the control tower to the weather.

The priority customs and immigration process you get at Suvarnabhumi Bangkok Int'l in business class is a blessing. The business class cabin was spotless and in good condition. The cabin staff were as attentive as usual. The only complaint I would have is the state of the business lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport. The lounge really is in need of an upgrade. For example, Thai Airways solution to a wall with water damage and wall paper peeling off was to place pot plants in front of the problem. A very Thai solution but doesn't really fix the issue. I must also admit that my last two occasions I have used this lounge the food has been surprisingly good. I have not always been able to say that.",Business,4.0,nan

Boarding in Bangkok started very close to the scheduled departure time by which time the gate was crowded with passengers forming queues voluntarily. When boarding finally commenced, passengers were boarded according to classes and row numbers. The gate agents had the boarding process fully under control which was brisk and orderly. An earlier start to the boarding process will be more comfortable for passengers who just want to get settled in rather than stand around at the gate area. Cabin crew was on hand to welcome passengers on board and were present throughout the cabins during boarding. The cabin was clean and bright. It was nice having seats of 2 to 3 different colours randomly scattered throughout the economy cabin making it vibrant. The cabin crew first came round with a packet of snacks followed by a drinks service and then a meal service. 2 options are available for the main meal. I opted for the curry snapper which was good. At the end of the meal service, Chinese tea and green tea were served together with tea/coffee.

It was still the same good service with a very good selection of 4 main courses (available for longer route) for dinner, plus desserts etc. Crew are present throughout the night flight with drinks and snacks etc. Managed a few hours of sleep and woke up to a delicious breakfast.

Flying on the A350 was a great experience: Cabin extremely quiet, comfortable seats and very large IFE seatback screens. Excellent range of latest release movies and tv shows. Reclining the seat causes the seat to slide forward, which slightly reduces legroom. Personally I like this, as it means reclining doesn't trouble the person behind. Meals were ok, though not wonderful. The child meal we booked for our daughter (for both sectors) was delivered on the MXP-BKK sector but wasn't loaded on the BKK-MEL sector. Cabin crew on the A350 or at least the one crew member looking after our seat (33A-C) didn't smile once in the 10+ hours on board. She was quite abrupt at times during meal service, which is disappointing and very uncharacteristic for Thai crew. The crew on the second sector were much nicer. Friendly and professional at all times. TG 461 BKK-MEL was a 777. Noisier than the A350 with smaller IFE screens which had much less clarity. The 777 seats are comfortable, though the legroom wasn't as good as the A350. Again, the food was ok though not as good as Thai flights a couple of years ago. Overall a reasonable experience with both flights on-time.",Family Leisure,4.0,4.0

The cabin crew in business class are excellent and have tremendous experience; even offering light meal or drink options if you are not hungry! I love that Thai serves iced tea - they have a great sour iced tea as well. While the food was not anything to write home about, the service is from the heart. I was surprised they did not have chocolate on board. The hard product differed on each aircraft with the uncomfortable recliner seats on the Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi sector and a much better 1-2-1 lie-flat seat (still tight) on the Beijing sector. IFE was absent on the Delhi-Bangkok leg and there was a limited selection on other routes flown. Seats seemed worn out and tired. The loos were clean and fragrant with L'occitane amenities. Amenity kits were given out on all flights; again different ones on both sectors. Ground service is near absent - priority bags came last and as a business class passenger there are no priority benefits.

The flight was smooth and really quiet. The crew members are polite and very efficient, served a hot wrap, a bottle of water and coffee in such a short flight. Only issue is that the flight was delayed for about 40 minutes and no explanation was given.

Instead the AB350 we had an old Boeing 747 from Bangkok to Auckland, and luckily I got a seat in the First compartment, their seat and especially flat bed were much better then the new seat on the A350. The big difference to carriers from the Middle East is the staff: one feels like home in Thailand, with very friendly and efficient staff with a Thai smile.

What I experience let me think that Thai is on an upward slope. First, the plane didn't dock at the terminal-finger and 250+ passengers had to get down stairs, take a bus, get up again to get to the airport. I didn't mind, but seeing the fathers carrying the strollers and the mothers carrying the crying kids, and seeing the people having problems taking stairs, I thought it would have been easier to relocate the plane instead of relocate 250+ passengers. Once on board, apparently, things got delayed and the flight crew was pushing people to move quickly instead of helping passengers. The food was ok, not special, but they totally skewed up the vegetarian options. My seat was broken and extremely uncomfortable. And in order to get some water during the 9 hours daytime flight, I had to get to the galley. All in all my impression was, that this airline does not deserve the high rankings.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan

Ticket prices have increased markedly over the years and possibly now much higher than other carriers on the same routes. A Bengaluru to Bangkok return in business class is about THB40,000 (US$ 1250) which is exorbitant for a 3.5 hour flight. For this price, there is no Jetbridge services and passengers need to walk down stairs and bundle into a crowded bus that takes a very long time to reach the arrivals gate. The aircraft put into service is a bit old and worn. My main grouse is the price. I checked out a BKK-HKG flight recently and price on TG was about THB12500 while Cathay was THB8,000.

First: it is a mystery to me how you can waste such a lot of space for such an uncomfortable seat. It is not angled lie flat or even flat at all. I wouldn’t care about an angle, but these seats are too short (I'm 1,86m) and have several angles, so at maximum you can lay back somehow, and the footrest isn’t stable, so whenever you move (even in turbulence) it will sort of “swing”. Secondly: service shows much effort but little result. For instance: There are attendants all over the cabin, but if you need any kind of refill (wine, coffee, water) you have to go to the galley and ask for it. Thirdly: the Lounge at BKK: completely overcrowded, had to wait for an hour to take a shower (which was a mould lover’s paradise), and don’t even think of the famous spa, if your transit time is below 5hrs. In a nutshell: outdated product, inefficient service, poor lounges, not worth the money. On their 747s I would not even call it a Business Class. A good premium eco will be a much better product and deal.",Business,1.0,nan

On this occasion there were a few issues. The first leg from London Heathrow to Bangkok was excellent, flew an A380, great flight. The second leg from Bangkok to Sydney was on a clapped out 747, the flight itself was mediocre but the service was very poor. The major problem was on the last leg from Bangkok to London Heathrow, we were supposed to fly an A380 but apparently the plane was ""broken"", however, it seems the plane had been unavailable for at least 7-10 days prior without a replacement A380 being found. After a delayed take-off, which again appears to have been the case for more than a week, we shuddered home on a 777, must be the noisiest plane I have flown on in 40 years. I booked a long-haul flight on an A380 as I am very tall and the leg-room is usually good and the comfort is usually excellent. Not so the 777, my knees were in constant contact with the chair in front for a 12 hour flight. If I book an A380, I expect to fly one just like if I book a Mercedes I don't expect a Ford!

A 10 minute delay which was due to late arrival of aircraft can be ignored. However, overall not up to expectations for a business class flight . Attendants service was superb and serving of food and drinks was top notch. Being vegetarian had pre-ordered the Asian vegetarian meal. Food was about average. I am somewhat disappointed that even though non-vegetarians get a full 3 course meal comprising of salad/starters, mains, dessert and cheese tray why are vegetarians served a single tray of food. I am sure airlines have enough food experts to devise a lavish vegetarian meal for its business customers.

I have been warned by many Thai friends that I would not receive a good service on this airline plus Thai Airways is always the most expensive. I decided to book because I wanted to experience 'the service' and I have hadn't flew with them for long time (my last flight with Thai Airways was in 2007, I was a little kid could not remember anything). I got a one way ticket for 25250 THB about = 580 GBP for one way. On the day I flew, I was almost the last one entering the airplane since I was enjoying my shopping time at BKK duty free but the air crew still welcomed me with a smiley face. Since I was one of the last onboard, I did not have space in over head cabin to put my carry on bags. The purser assisted very nicely. He took my bag to put in somewhere in the back and told me that he will take it back to me once the plane departed. He took another one to his room and suggested I do not put valuable items in either bag until I get it back. After the first meal (I did not eat much because I was not hungry, it was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning in Thailand). I was asleep for long time and once I got up another staff member asked if I was hungry or want anything else like a sandwich or something. It was totally different to what I have heard from other people so I did not expect this much better service to happen to me. The seat was new and comfortable. Once we arrived all the crew were sending passengers out of the plane with Thai style greetings. I don't know how can they do that after a 12-hour flight, really impressed.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

At the departure gate for my two outbound flights there was no separate security queue for premium passengers, and there was no separate boarding queue either (you have to fight your way to the front of the general boarding queue). The lounge I used at Bangkok was very crowded. The airport is poorly signposted and the strange layout means there are very long walks from gate to gate via the security checkpoint. Security staff, both at the security check-point and again at the departure lounge, didn't seem to have heard about the famous Thai Smile. On board I found the seats comfortable on all three aircraft types, though the B777 doesn't give you the same privacy as the A380 and A350. The crew were smiling, polite and friendly.

Boarding was a breeze and the FAs welcome you on board with offerings of Champagne (Dom Perignon) and other soft drinks. Whilst not an enclosed cabin such as Emirates or Etihad the position of the seating means you do have some privacy from other passengers. Service on board was very good though mechanical. I did have to ask for vodka to go with the caviar. On the airlines stated previously the FA would ask if you wanted it. First world problems! There is no dine on demand either. The screen isn't as big as Emirates and seems further away but the entertainment package was fairly good and kept me occupied for most of the flight. On landing at BKK there is a buggy waiting to take you the to the Diplomatic fast track immigration counter, once through you are met again by ground staff who will then get your bag from the carousel for you. The service was exceptional and more akin to that of a VIP passenger The bad. Not a lot really. I found the bed not particularly comfortable but then I'm picky and the onboard service isn't as polished as Emirates but given that Thai was a lot cheaper its certainly one of the better FC airlines. One major issue is that you get very little free WIFI (10meg if I remember correctly) and then have to pay a Kings ransom for more data. In today's connected age and given the cost of the flight I would of expected this to be offered free of charge as other middle-eastern airlines do.. On the whole I recommend Thai's FC offering.",Solo Leisure,4.0,1.0

Thai airways always give you a welcome service on board, so polite and always smile. Foods was fine, warm and tasty. However, the aircraft is quite old. I search for the information about that aircraft and found that its age is around 20 year. However, there is no tear on the seats but you would find some stains on the seat. the leg room and seat width are standard for economy class. The entertainment display is a bit small and low-resolution display because it is an old aircraft. Everything is good. Strength : warm service, nice and helpful crews.

Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,3.0,December 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,Chiang Mai to Frankfurt via Bangkok,3.0," |  Chiang Mai to Frankfurt via Bangkok. Our dog can be temperamental with strangers, so it was critical for us to bring her as excess baggage on our flight when we were relocating from Thailand to Portugal. When we booked our flights, the booking agent at the Thai Airways Corporate offices told us that a dog up to 40kg (animal and crate) would be $750 USD to transport her as excess baggage to Europe. The agent’s quote was consistent with the Thai Airways Pet Travel policy found on their website. We arrived at Chiang Mai International Airport on Christmas Day with Tam, and all of our belongings approximately 2½ hours before our flight. We provided the ticketing agent with the printed reservation confirmation (including all of the updates) that had been provided to us by the booking agent at the Corporate Offices. When we checked in, we had other issues regarding our baggage and associated fees but that is secondary to what followed. We loaded Tam (crate and all) onto the luggage scale and the total weight was 39.8 kg. Shortly thereafter, the ticketing agent told us that Tam could not travel with us on our flight because she was over 32kg. This was in direct contradiction to what the Thai Airways website says, as well as our reservation confirmation that we made in person at Thai Airways Corporate office in Chiang Mai. There we stood at the Thai Airways counter on Christmas day, after months of preparation, checking and double-checking that we had complied with all of the travel and export requirements, ensuring that the 40kg. weight limit was allowed and documented on our booking confirmation, in total disbelief. We spent 2 hours at the ticketing counter dealing with an agent who seemed entirely indifferent about the circumstances. The only explanation that she was able to provide was “Bangkok not accept”. We had to ask for a supervisor and eventually the highest person in charge for Thai Airways at the airport. After speaking with the Supervisor and being told once again that Tam could not fly with us, the Duty Manager eventually came down and told us that the booking agent in the Corporate Offices should not have made the reservation for our dog. On 2 January, I sent a lengthy email to three Directors at Thai Airways describing our experience. Several days later I received an email confirmation from Thai Airways Customer Relations Dept. that they received my email and would be conducting an investigation into our situation. On 10 January, I sent a follow-up email about our case. On 12 January I received an email from the Chief of the Customer Relations Svc. Dept. regarding the investigation that they completed on our case. In the Chief’s response, she acknowledged that Thai Airways Staff at CNX was in the wrong and should have accepted our dog on our flight, but she indicated that because we were given additional baggage allowance (as a gesture of goodwill) that there was nothing further Thai Airways would do for us. On  12 January another email was directed to Customer Relations, the Chief,  Directors and  VP's. In it I expressed that while we appreciated the gesture, including the additional bags was a soft cost to Thai Airways and that it surely did not compensate for their error. I also highlighted that bringing Tam on our flight as excess baggage was the single most important factor in selecting Thai Airways. As 01/18 I have heard nothing further from Thai Airways.",Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0

Boarding at Bangkok was a bit disorganised and we departed one hour late due to 'short flight time' - the crew was efficient and polite but not particularly friendly and there was no attempt made to personalise the service. About 1 hour after take off a crew member asked me if I would change seats from 12A to 12K so that a family could sit together - I reluctantly agreed and the crew stood and watched as I made 4 trips through the galley with my drinks, nuts, books, gadgets, carry on luggage etc - not one offered to give me a hand. The catering was fine although nothing out of the ordinary. The seat was comfortable enough and there's plenty of space to spread out. The IFE is poor - way below what you'd get on SQ or Emirates - even Malaysia Airlines is better in this regard. They gave out a 5mb free wifi card - paid wifi is really expensive.

Boeing 777-300,Economy Class,5.0,December 2017,3.0,4.0,1.0,no,Bangkok to Incheon via Hong Kong ,2.0," | Flew Bangkok to Incheon via Hong Kong. Thai Airways is known for its service. I believe they certainly achieved the service. The cabin crew's service was beyond 'nice'. They were willing to help at any given time, and when I informed the crews that the restroom was a bit dirty, (because somebody decided to throw the toilet paper to the toilet and flush it) they rushed in to clean after saying 'thanks for informing us'. I really loved how they handled that issue without any frustration. Brilliant work ethics were shown there. The aircraft itself made me think like 'well, cabin crews deserve a better plane than this!'. Seat was very uncomfortable because of the metal box that was sitting under the seat in front of me - and my seat wasn't the only seat where I could see those fixed-metal boxes and I was (by the way, I'm not that tall, I'm only 1.78m) forced to spend the most of the flight with one leg stretched all the way, and another crammed in. Only positive I can think of is the fact that the seat formation was 3-3-3 instead of 3-4-3. However, the reason why I gave 1 star in seat comfort is because I would've given a 0 if this 777 was 3-4-3! That metal box is very annoying, so be sure to check your seat before you book your seat. IFE wasn't good. Not only were the contents missing, but display itself was a mess. My eyes started hurting after 2 minutes of movie watching, and I couldn't see anything from the movie properly. If I had an option to not have IFE and not have the prementioned iron box thing, I would probably choose not to have IFE. (It was that miserable). That's the reason why I gave a 1 in IFE. Food was good except for the fact that one option ran out. That's the mere reason why I gave four on that category. Well, I wouldn't recommend you to fly this airline if you have alternatives like Emirates, Singapore Airlines, etc if you're flying 777-300. If your flight is with the relatively newer fleet, then you might take a risk, but I wouldn't advise that, as Singapore and Asiana were cheaper that time, but I decided to take a risk and got the 773. To conclude, my flight to Incheon was not good. The service was perfect, but the fleet wasn't.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

I have always been reluctant to fly Thai Airways in Business for a number of reasons, but this time has proven to be something different. The business class cabin crew introduced themselves to us and greeted us by name. The service has also become more personalised in many ways from no longer putting food on the tray all the way to frequently (almost every half hour) attending passengers who were not sleeping during those times where most of the passengers were asleep. Apart from an immensely improved soft product, the seats on this particular equipment is new. The seat reclined into a full flatbed where you can really get a sleep. Thai now provides you with one pillow, one extra pillow for lumbar support and an extra padding for sleeping. The IFE was also very responsive and the inflight WiFi which all business passengers were given 10MB trial for free was also quite fast. Overall, a pleasant surprise, over my last Business Class trip with Thai Airways 1.5 years ago.

We had the unpleasant experience with this rude  male chief flight attendant. Our seats were 23A-B so we left our hand-carry items in the overhead compartment that was labelled as that. Then rude attendant telling us that we should be putting our belongings in the next compartment instead. The funny thing is that this compartment was not even labelled and how will we know that this compartment was meant for us?

A380,Economy Class,5.0,April 2018,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Bangkok to Tokyo NRT,4.0," | Bangkok to Tokyo NRT. I chose Thai airways based on the aircraft type (a380) and price. I bought three tickets for my family, and we paid extra to sit in the upper deck. Check in was a complete nightmare, the queue at Bangkok airport spanned about 200 metres, luckily we already checked in online and the bag drop counter had a waiting time of only 10 min. Unfortunately the lady who attended to us was quite impolite and we had better experiences in the past. Boarding was an absolute nightmare, people just kept flowing in. Although we were the first of the economy passengers we didn’t get in quickly. The flight attendant at the main door is polite, and welcomes me onboard. I have to walk all the way to the back of the plane and then take the rear stairs. There is a huge amount of storage on the upper deck. You’ve got side bins, and the overhead bins aren’t like the 747 bins, they’re quite big. This flight to Tokyo was quite full, with the premium cabins having a 100% load factor. We took off, and service started with a cocktail snack and a drinks service. Strangely, on the upper deck, both aisles are served by the same cart, starting with the left side. Since it’s only 7 rows I didn’t mind. Breakfast was a choice of fish or omelette, I chose the fish and it was a very big portion of snapper accompanied by Japanese rice, which was very good. My seat mate didn’t finish her omelette entree, so it’s a hit or miss! The seat itself is comfortable, I had the front row so it was a comfortable flight. Entertainment wasn’t too good, choices are slightly lacking. WiFi is a rip off, as $34 for 100MB of data is way too expensive if you compare it to airlines like Finnair who charge less for the entire flight. An hour before landing, ice cream is distributed. We had one go around during landing, and after landing, I passed customs in a breeze, but the baggage claim wait was a nightmare. It took approximately 30 minutes for one bag. On the return trip, the bag drop looked so long, so we did something unusual: We went to the United counter and asked them to print boarding passes for us, And it worked! We did have to ditch a flip knife though, as we didn’t check any baggage. Boarding was really efficient as they sorted out the passengers by zone at the gate. This flight, I was surprised to know that the purser and three other flight attendants were from my previous outbound flight! Unfortunately, on this flight, I didn’t have a bulkhead seat, and it wasn’t as good as the first flight, but still okay, since I was on the upper deck. The food on this flight was pretty good, and service was similar to the outbound. The difference was that on this flight, there was a self serve drinks counter in the galley. On this flight, I decided to ask for some business class food, and they gave me two to try, and both were pretty delicious. They were also nice enough to plate the food like they would serve it to a business passenger! The landing in Bangkok was surprisingly loud as we may have landed on a groove. The captain of this flight was kind enough to be standing in front of the first class section and said goodbye to every passenger. This flight was very worth the money, as it was quite cheap, and I was able to book extra legroom seats free of charge. I already booked another flight with thai, and I’m hoping I could survive 12 hours in the same seat! I would highly recommend Thai if they are cheap.",Family Leisure,5.0,1.0
